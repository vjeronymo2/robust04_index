			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F> correspondent Anatoliy Tabachenko on 13 June, place not given  -- recorded]    [Text] [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, you are the  incumbent president, the head of state. What is your view of  the state of Ukraine's home and foreign affairs?    [Kravchuk] To be brief, we are, indeed, going through a very  difficult time, and it is clear why. All nations making a  transition from one system to another have gone through a  similarly difficult time. That is why it is wrong to see only  the negative, there is also a positive factor here. But, since  life is very complicated, and with the rise of inflation, the  fall of production, and various social problems involved, people  sometimes fail to see the positive part of our life, while the  negative factor is often used by different political forces.  One must understand that it can be no other way, because in a  democracy, where there is an opposition and a power struggle,  all this is taken advantage of in a certain sense. What ways do  we see out of this situation? First of all, we are taking very  specific steps to create a proper industrial structure to live  up to Ukraine's interests.    Second, we are solving problems concerning fuel supplies.  Despite all the difficulties, we have been able, in the recent  years, including the last one, to create conditions for sowing  the harvest. The national economy continued to function in  winter, and people were provided with heating and all  necessities. Of course, all these factors, both positive and  negative ones, unfortunately, negative ones to a greater extent,  make an impact on people's feelings, socially and politically.    Political stability, too, has its roots in the economy,  although there are other factors involved. We can see our  miscalculations. Already, after two and a half years of my  presidency, I can see how many mistakes could have been avoided,  but, unfortunately, what has happened has happened, and we can  only use these lessons to avoid similar mistakes in future.  The one who wins this post can also use the mistakes we made to  avoid repeating them in future.    Since Ukraine gained its independence, our foreign policy  has  been aimed at protecting Ukraine's interests by diplomatic  means. The main effort was made to promote Ukraine's further  integration with European structures, to strengthen economic and  political relations, and to develop such relations with the CIS  countries and with our neighbors, above all, Russia. Thanks to  our consistent foreign policy, Ukraine has taken its place among  world powers and is now occupying an important position on the  international stage. The trilateral statement signed on 14  January in Moscow made a great contribution to improving the  international atmosphere around Ukraine. This has given us  clear guarantees for the recognition of our sovereignty and  territorial integrity and the granting of financial, economic,  and technical assistance. This statement secured a world image  for our state. Ukraine, as you know, was the first to sign  Partnership for Peace and become part of this NATO program. On  Tuesday, 14 June, I am going to Luxembourg where I will sign a  document on Ukraine's accession to the European Union on the  principles of partnership and cooperation.    Naturally, Ukraine as a European state will always lean  toward close ties with Europe. But we take a realistic view of  the situation, and we cannot follow one track only. Our  greatest priority is cooperation within the CIS. Ukraine is  part of the economic union. It has signed all the important  economic agreements of the CIS. Within the CIS, we have a  traditional, friendly partner, Russia, with whom we have signed  over 75 documents, and agreements of various kinds regulating  our economic, political, and other ties. A broad-scale  agreement on cooperation, friendship, and partnership with  Russia is currently being drawn up that will place our relations  on a qualitatively new level and register fundamental principles  of our relations predetermined by our way of life, our history,  and our future. It is a very important document, and I hope we  can sign it immediately as soon as we solve another urgent  problem in Ukrainian-Russian relations, that of the Black Sea  Fleet.    [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, what ways do you see out of  the difficult economic situation in the light of your election  program?    [Kravchuk] These ways are outlined in the election program,  but let me focus our attention on them again. These problems  are already being tackled today. First of all, this concerns  the entire block of financial problems: Mutual payments,  credits, and banking. They are the most painful and urgent ones  today, and we not only declare them a priority, but we have  agreed a concrete program and concrete ways of improving the  situation with the Cabinet of Ministers and the management of  the National Bank.    The second problem concerns the priorities that must be  clearly singled out. I always put forward two priorities that I  believe to be basic: Foodstuffs and energy. Any other problem  can be solved in the course of time, but these two cannot wait.  This is something a person needs every day. These two core  priorities must be basic to all of our activities. The  successful solution of these issues, that is the development of  agriculture and power engineering with related industries, will  give an impetus to the development of other sectors, because  these are huge industries with a demand for a variety of other  products, and will provide for the people's vital needs.    Another priority is the reduction of costs in all spheres of  the national economy. This problem has never been seriously  dealt with. Another concerns the creation of a proper investment  climate both for domestic and foreign partners who are very  sensitive toward any changes in our legislation and activities.  Incidentally, Ukraine's (?constitutional) climate was extremely  badly damaged by the cabinet's decrees amending two important  laws passed by the Supreme Council. I attend dozens of meetings  now that reveal a lack of confidence in ourselves. If we  continue to change our laws as frequently, we will never be  trusted.    Next are the banking, budgetary, monetary and taxation  systems. Taxation must stimulate development. We have certain  projects in this area that we are sending to the oblasts to  develop them further and submit to the Supreme Council. It is  clear that we will not be able to avoid a monetary reform. There  is one basic principle: It cannot be implemented in a  confiscatory manner. People must know that it will be  implemented on the basis of social justice, openly, and without  any secrets.    Next is social security. People who are today in need of  support, pensioners, people with many children, and not all  pensioners, but only a certain group, require both financial and  direct aid, by means of special shops and special opportunities.  Now, as we prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of Ukraine's  liberation and the victory in the Great Patriotic War,  provisions should be made and relevant directives passed on to  the local authorities to make it work for the individual. The  next aspect includes economic problems: Privatization and  demonopolization. These must be pursued openly, under  supervision. It implies problems, and there are ways of solving  them.    [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, how do you see further  development of nation-building in Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] Nation-building currently boils down to the  Constitution. The state must ensure the development of the  individual, their rights and freedoms. The overriding principle  must not be that of the individual for the state but that of the  state for the individual. All this time, the state has been the  best protected one. Now, we must protect the individual. But  without a Constitution, without legal acts, this is impossible.  Therefore, first of all, a Constitution must be adopted,  together with elections that are already underway, and there is  no denying that elections must be held. But the Supreme Council  must pass laws before the elections to guarantee normal  development of society, subordination, division of powers, and  all related functions. Then it is necessary to stop all  discussions as to what we are building and where we are going.  I believe that we must be clear about what system and what form  of government we should have. If the elections take place, and  I am sure they will, and a president is elected, this will mean  that the people will have voted for a presidential,  parliamentary republic. This must put an end to all  discussions, a Constitution must be adopted, relevant structures  and authorities must be set up, a strong government, a strong  president, and an authoritative Supreme Council must be formed,  and we will proceed from there.    [Tabachenko] Another question, Leonid Makarovych. What can  you say of the successes and problems in the spiritual sphere of  our life. Because there are many complaints that it, too, is in  decline.    [Kravchuk] You see, in such a period as this one, there is  either a renaissance or a decline. Sometimes, economic decline  may be greater, but revolutionary pathos may inspire a  renaissance in the arts. Our development is evolutionary. This  evolution may not be seen on the surface, which prompts some to  say that there is some kind of a spiritual decline. I would not  say so. No creative union has been closed down. All publishing  houses are working, books are being published, newspapers are in  circulation, television and radio is working, textbooks are  being written. Yes, it is difficult, but it is there.  Scientists are working, discoveries are being made. There have  been a lot more discoveries and practical applications recently  than before. We should not dramatize the situation, but look at  it comprehensively. Yes, culture needs financial support. That  is the way of the world. I believe that the next quarterly  budget that will be submitted to the Supreme Council, and I have  instructed the government to this effect, will again show  support for the arts.    There are presidential decrees in support of science,  culture, and publishing, but it is not enough. We must make  clear budgetary provisions for such support. Using this  opportunity, I would like to wish all radio listeners and all  voters good spirits and good health. I hope they will all come  to the polls, not only in the presidential but also in the local  elections, and vote for those people who can ensure Ukraine's  peaceful, democratic, and legal development, economic reforms  and improvement in the people's living standards.</p>

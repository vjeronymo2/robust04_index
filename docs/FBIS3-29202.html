			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "To Establish a True `Mature Relationship' </F> Between Japan and the United States"]    [Text] While President Clinton stated that "it is better  to have reached no agreement than to have reached an empty  agreement," Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said that "an  ambiguous agreement is a source of misunderstandings." Thus,  the Japan-U.S. summit talks ended in a rupture over the pending  economic framework talks. Prime Minister Hosokawa stated: "A  mature relationship between the two nations should be one in  which both say frankly what they are unable to do." There is no  choice but to coolly accept this unusual situation and seek a  way for building a true "mature relationship" between Japan and  the United States.    During the joint news conference after the summit talks,  both  Japanese and U.S. leaders seemed to be cautious as much as  possible not to make the situation worse. While President  Clinton stressed that "the Japan-U.S. relationship is the most  important bilateral relationship," Prime Minister Hosokawa  pointed out that "the results of the talks should not damage the  close and friendly relations between the two nations." Although  a breakdown in a summit meeting is not unusual among European  nations, as well as between the United States and European  nations, past Japan-U.S. summit meetings always ended  successfully. For this reason, both leaders were anxious to  minimize the shock of the rupture in their talks.    It is certain that Japan and the United States are in a  state  of economic cold war in the wake of the breakdown in the  economic framework talks. The President refrained from  mentioning the possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan  following the breakdown in the talks. However, the U.S.  Congress has begun to move to impose sanctions against Japan.  For example, Senator Baucus stressed the need for revival of  the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and  Competitiveness Act. The President himself referred to  "fluctuations in exchange rates" as a concrete indicator to  measure Japan's progress in opening markets, and the exchange  market is moving toward the yen appreciation.  <H5>  Cool-Headed Action Is Required </H5>   Amid the situation in which the economic framework talks  will  be frozen for the time being and there will be no way out to  break the deadlock in economic relations between Japan and the  United States, what is of most concern is that emotional  confrontation will spread between the two countries. To avoid  such a situation, it is important that Japan and the United  States try to strengthen bilateral relations by all means.  Although it goes without saying that the economic relations are  important, the Japan-U.S. relationship does not consist only of  those. What is important is to consider the depth of mutual  dependence between Japan and the United States and to take a  calm attitude.    It seems that despite the breakdown in the summit talks,  there is no tremor in the foundation of personal relationship  between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa, both of  whom seek reform. Nevertheless, it is dangerous that the two  countries should rely on the relationship between the two  leaders to prevent a decisive confrontation in Japanese-U.S.  relations. There is no other adjusting mechanism than a summit  between the two countries, and the situation is quite dangerous.  It is understandable that trade negotiators of both countries  confront each other. However, it is undesirable that the  foreign minister and the secretary of state discuss issues in  the same way as the negotiators.    Why did Japan and the United States make a mistake? It can  be said that now that they do not have to be united as a  liberalism camp following the end of the Cold War, economic  confrontation between Japan and the United States has come to  the fore. Nevertheless, this is not the only reason.    The Clinton administration, concluding that the post-Cold  War  era would become an era of the economy, has worked out its  economic strategy at the National Economic Council (NEC).  However, the administration has forgotten the fact that, in the  era of the economy, the leading role is not for the government  but companies and consumers, and that decisions are made not at  the White House but on the market. It is obvious that numerical  targets demanded by the United States will surely lead to  "managed trade."    The reason why Japan has insisted on this view is not  because its bureaucrats are obstinate but because it is common  sense in the world. Influential American economists as well as  major mass media in Japan, the United States, the UK, and Canada  share the Japanese view. The conspicuous view is that "Prime  Minister Hosokawa should say `no'" to the U.S. demand,  (according to an editorial in the British FINANCIAL TIMES).    Although the Clinton administration has strengthened its  information strategy toward Japan, it failed to figure out  Japan's reform thoroughly because it has stuck to the view of  Japan revisionism [nihon ishitsuron]. This indicates that  experts on Japanese affairs who think that Japan is a peculiar  nation should not be involved in the current Japan-U.S. ties.  To secure numerical targets, administrative instructions by  Japanese bureaucrats are necessary. Nevertheless, deregulation  efforts being promoted by the Hosokawa administration are aimed  at decreasing such intervention by the government.    Japan also made a mistake. It was busy saying only "no" to  the U.S. demand, and did not act on opening its markets,  seriously delaying the economic pump-priming measures. Its  current account surplus remains large. The trade imbalance  between Japan and the United States is widening due to the  current economic gap between the two countries. The Japanese  Government should have indicated its understanding of the U.S.  irritation, with the off-year election near at hand. Japan has  been making efforts to open its markets, and the situation of  market opening has largely changed. Nevertheless, we cannot help  but say that Japan is still protectionist among the industrial  nations in the area of opening markets.    The biggest mistake is that both Japan and the United  States,  which should be models for world trade, took a narrow view. The  two countries faced off without taking into account the chaotic  post-Cold War world.    Although it seems that the Clinton administration took the  initiative in concluding the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round, it did so mainly for the sake of  improving the employment situation in the United States. Japan  did not take the lead in the Uruguay Round but rather played a  role of a victim. The situation in which Japan and the United  States are snarling at each other in a manner of pursuing only  their own interest will negatively effect not only both sides  but also the world economy as a whole.  <H5>  Same Value Should Be Sought </H5>   The manner of frankly talking is not a way to prevent the  economic cold war from expanding and to build a true mature  relationship. Although it is said that the Japan-U.S.  relationship is maturing, it is different from the relationship  between the United States and European nations. This does not  refer only to the difference in military structures -- namely, a  difference between the Japan-U.S. security system and the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Because the same value has  rooted in the U.S.- European relationship, a residue of hard  feeling would not be left between them even after they quarrel  with each other heatedly.    During a cooling-off period, Japan and the United States, at  first, need to think why the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  have been in an impasse, from each other's standpoint. After  that, they need to rebuild a new adjusting framework. This  should be a trade framework which will be open to the world and  be based on the GATT system.    Japan and the United States should not only concentrate on  the bilateral negotiations but also become cosponsors of a  proposal for a new multilateral trade negotiation after the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round. There are many tasks which the  two countries have to tackle immediately, such as working out  international rules for trade, environment, and competitive  policies. Now is the time to study a new international monetary  system in which monetary authorities do not take an action of  verbal intervention and in which economic conditions of each  country are reflected.    This may be a good idea that Japan and the United States  will  jointly tackle the "Global New Deal" policy which some quarters,  including U.S. labor unions, are discussing to solve the  employment issue, a world's common issue.    Japan and the United States will not reach a true mature  relationship until they find the same value through such efforts  in the post-Cold War era.</p>

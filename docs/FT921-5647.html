			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Appointments: Eyeing Europe From burgers to eyewear? Richard Snead, until now managing director of Burger King in the UK, was also pretty sceptical when the US Shoe Corporation approached him to head up one-hour optical retailer Lens-Crafters' British operation. 'I wasn't about to leave a very promising career at Burger King to mind eight stores (the extent of the current network in Britain),' says Snead, an American who has spent 13 1/2 years at the burger retailer now owned by Grand Met, and who, since 1989, has been in England masterminding among other things the integration of Wimpy into the Burger King chain. But his family likes living in the UK, and Snead, 40, was won over by the notion of being 'a key player' in advancing the LensCrafters concept internationally. With a little sensitivity to the differences of the UK marketplace, he thinks the optician's success in the US can indeed be replicated across the Atlantic, and also has his eye on continental Europe once the UK is mastered. And, for the cv, the coming of the single European market means that 'this is the most exciting place for a businessman to be.' His predecessor, Angus McPhie, who opened the first shops in the UK in 1990, returns to parent company US Shoe in America.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading DISAPPOINTING money supply figures from Germany led to a fall in stock index futures after an advance early in the session, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,655 and sporadic buying was seen in the early stages of the session before a squeeze developed as independent traders bid for stock, causing June to climb to 2,677, the high of the session by midday. News of the German money supply figures sent June into retreat. The poor performance in the gilts and bonds market coupled with a lacklustre Wall Street only served to bring out more sellers, although a modest rally was seen in after-hours' trading. June closed at 2,647 down 2 on the previous session and about 18 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover reached 7,354 contracts. In traded options, volume totalled 39,979 lots, with the FT-SE 100 option recording a day's total of 13,602 contracts. Courtaulds was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,275 lots, with the October 650 calls particularly busy. BT was the second busiest stock option, trading 2,059 contracts, followed by Marks and Spencer with 1,970 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The Markets: Opec needs to tread carefully - Commodities With oil prices having enjoyed a modest but, to producers, welcome rally over the past month or two, one of the main tasks of delegates at the Vienna meeting this week of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be to avoid damaging the market's new-found buoyancy. The scope for influencing the market positively seems very limited, but from the opening of the meeting on Wednesday traders will be watching for signs of a weakening in members resolve to maintain a reasonable degree of discipline on export quotas. Prices are about Dollars 3 higher than they were when the Opec ministers last met in March and agreed to keep the overall output ceiling at 24.52m barrels a day for the rest of year. Output has remained closer to 25m b/d but that has not deterred buyers, many of whom see demand for Opec oil growing to about 26m b/d by the final quarter. Traders warn, however, that any talk of quota reductions, most likely from Iran, the chief price 'hawk', could backfire if the cuts failed to material-ise. Iran could also pose a threat to the cartels' perceived solidarity through its persistence in maintaining the candidacy of Mr Kazempour Adebili, its ambassador to Japan and representative on the Opec board of governors, for the Opec secretary-generalship in place of Dr Subroto of Indonesia. 'All of the rest of Opec, including Saudi Arabia, is in favour of (ex-Venezuelan oil minister Alirio) Parra simply on his merit alone, but it must be a unanimous decision,' one of the Gulf Arab delegates told the Reuter news agency on Friday. Other events this week include a three-day International Precious Metals Institute conference starting in Vancouver today and, from tomorrow for four days, a European Metals conference in Freiburg, Germany, at which Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist of RTZ Corporation, will be among the speakers.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television We are promised that BBC2's Black And White In Colour will tell us about 'Television, memory and race, 1968 to 1992'. Will it celebrate the success story of black people on British television? Will it point out that in a population more than 95 per cent white, the proportion of prominent black sportsmen, comedians, and pop groups on television is well above the proportion of black people in the population? Will it applaud a system which, despite some racist feeling of the sort you find the world over, in populations of all colours, brings us journalists such as Zeinab Badawi, Stuart Hall, Trevor McDonald, Trevor Phillips and Moira Stuart? Or will it be the usual old resentful defeatism that we get from television's race industry depressives? We shall see (8.10). Tonight also brings Rear Window (9.00 C4) which visits Rajasthan for its account of Indian miniatures; Madhur Jaffrey starring in the drama about two women who start a catering business, Firm Friends (9.00 ITV); and a repeat of a 1964 documentary about Afro-Caribbeans living in Birmingham, The Colony (11.15 BBC2).</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand extends coal field deadline AN Anglo-American consortium which is poised to buy east Germany's giant Mibrag brown coal fields has been granted an extension of the sole negotiating rights by the Treuhand agency charged with privatising east German industry. The Treuhand, which owns Mibrag, granted Powergen, the British-based utilities company, and NRG of Minneapolis, a subsidiary of Northern States Power Company, the sole negotiating rights until July 31, but will agree to extend them for another few weeks for 'technical reasons'. A banker involved in the negotiations said yesterday that the contract was in its 'final stages. This is an enormous contract. The lawyers are working flat-out' to complete it. The contract, which entails the consortium buying the lignite fields, which straddle the eastern states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, is also linked to its purchase of a 44 per cent stake in the Schkopau power generating plant near Leipzig. The acquisition of the power plant will give the consortium a stepping stone into the utilities sector in east Germany, which is monopolised by west Germany's three large utilities. It is expected to pay DM1bn (Pounds 390m) for the mines.</p>

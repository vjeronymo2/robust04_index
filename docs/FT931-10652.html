			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: Designer blends AFTER the Dualit toaster, the Philippe Starcke lemon squeezer and the Alessi kettle - welcome to the Waring blender, latest must-have kitchen appliance for the design-conscious foodie set. And lest that sounds too frivolous or dismissive, let me hasten to add that almost any half-way enthusiastic cook might like to own it, too. The Waring Professional Blender, to give its full name, saw the light of day in the US in 1935. Before long it became a kitchen classic. Sturdy, long-lasting and powerful, it was just what the eager cook needed. Cooks love it because it has a two-speed switch and a strong and powerful commercial motor which enables it to cope with tougher foods, such as meats and pates. It is also generously sized, holding 40oz, and it is simple and easy to clean - the top fits straight on to the motor base. The design-set love it because with its heavy metal base, its thick glass and 'Deco' styling it is redolent of the heyday of American soda-bar culture, the golden pre-war period when the US truly seemed the land of opportunity. I like it best in its original chrome but it is also available in three new colours - red, blue or green. It costs Pounds 129 from Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1, Divertimenti of 139/141 Fulham Road, London SW3 and Wigmore Street. For other stockists contact the importers, Robot Coupe, 62 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5SH.</p>

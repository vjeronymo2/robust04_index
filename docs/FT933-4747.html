			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CONSOLIDATION was the keynote of yesterday's trading in the derivatives sector, with dealers unwilling to commit themselves to taking large positions ahead of a week of results from some of the market's biggest companies, writes Joel Kibazo. Early strength in the September contract on the FT-SE 100, which saw it advance 6 points to 3,070 within the first hour of trading, petered out as dealers turned more cautious about the outlook on the corporate results front. Sporadic buying was seen from a number of independent traders. Others simply chose to extend the run of profit-taking into a fifth consecutive session, with the absence of a lead from Wall Street, closed for Labour Day, doing little to boost sentiment. September ended the session at 3,063, some 5 points below Friday's close and at an 8-point premium to the underlying cash market. As the life of the September contract draws to a close, fair value, the premium which allows for dividend flow and financing costs on the underlying Footsie stocks, now stands at zero. Volume in September was a mere 6,738 lots, with dealers reporting the rolling forward into December of around 2,000 contracts. The closing volume in that contract was 2,074. Traded options were dull, turnover falling to 20,142 contracts from Friday's 30,948. Glaxo was the top stock option at 1,324 lots dealt.</p>

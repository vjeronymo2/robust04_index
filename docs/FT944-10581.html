			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Big money still garners big vote Money has always talked in US elections, and it spoke as loud as ever this year in the most expensive campaign on record. In more than 80 per cent of the elections, candidates with the most money to pay for television advertising, direct mailing and telephone campaigning won their races, and lobbying groups that helped finance them are looking forward to an open door at their Washington offices. Republicans won all nine Senate seats left open by retirements, and in seven raised more money than their Democratic opponents. In the two exceptions, Minnesota and Oklahoma, the fundraising advantage was not crushing. Republicans who unseated incumbent Democratic senators in Tennessee and Pennsylvania also outraised their opponents. Mr Rick Santorum, in Pennsylvania, drew heavily on the political action committees, or PACs, through which companies and lobbying groups donate to candidates. PACs have in the past heavily favoured incumbents, regardless of party. But Republican leaders have been twisting arms heavily recently, warning lobbyists they would be frozen out if they continued to give to Democrats. Big winners include the National Rifle Association, which turned its fury on several old allies who had voted for Mr Clinton's crime bill. The NRA's most prized trophy was Congressman Tom Foley, the Speaker, who also voted for the crime bill and conceded defeat yesterday in Washington state. Many candidates, however, dipped deep into their own pockets to pay for their campaigns. By the end of October, according to Federal Election Commission returns, Senate candidates had spent more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 30.4m) of their own money. Most of that came from Mr Michael Huffington, who took his Texas oil fortune to California to run against Senator Dianne Feinstein. He lost, but the Dollars 28m he spent took him close to uprooting a popular and effective senator, despite his non-existent record of achievement, vague political views and employment of an illegal alien as his nanny. Ms Feinstein had to spend Dollars 2.35m of her own in defence of her Senate seat, but mostly raised money from PACs. One oddity was Mr Oliver North, controversial former marine who lost his bid to oust Sen Charles Robb in Virginia. Mr North raised over Dollars 15m, four times that of Mr Robb.</p>

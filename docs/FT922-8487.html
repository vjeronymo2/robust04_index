			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Investor records improvement INVESTOR, Sweden's leading investment company, has announced a strong improvement in profits for the first three months of the year to SKr1.14bn (Dollars 192m) from SKr258m for the same period of 1991. The main reason for the strong growth was the sale of Investor's shares at the beginning of the year in Skandia, Sweden's leading insurance company and the engineering group Asea. At the end of March, Investor's strategic portfolio on the Stockholm bourse was valued at SKr23.078bn. Metra, the Finnish industrial company, is seeking the authorisation of its shareholders on 8 June for a FM60m share issue over the next twelve months. When and whether the company goes ahead will be decided by the board.</p>

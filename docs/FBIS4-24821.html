			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- Customs Procedures of  the People's Republic of China Concerning Levying Import Duties  on Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles and Personal Postal  Articles    (Examined and Approved by the Sixth Meeting of the State  Council Customs Tax Regulations Committee According to the  Decrees of the State Council Nos. 134 and 135, People's Republic  of China)    Article 1. With a view to satisfying the rational need of  imports for personal use and simplifying taxation procedures,  the procedures hereof are formulated in accordance with "The  Customs Law" and "Regulations on Import and Export Duties."    Article 2. Except as otherwise stipulated, import duties  shall be levied on taxable incoming travelers' luggage articles,  personal postal articles, and other personal effects  (hereinafter referred to as taxable personal articles) that are  allowed to enter the country by customs in accordance with the  "Import Duty Rates for Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles and  Personal Postal Articles."    The import duties referred to in these procedures include  customs duties, value-added tax, and consumption tax.    The taxable personal articles referred to in these  procedures  do not include automobiles, motorcycles, and their parts and  accessories. Import duties shall be levied on taxable  automobiles and motorcycles for personal use as well as their  parts and accessories in accordance with the "Customs Import and  Export Tariff of the People's Republic of China" and other  relevant taxation laws and provisions.    The "Import Duty Rates for Incoming Travelers' Luggage  Articles and Personal Postal Articles" (hereinafter referred to  as "Rates") is a part of these procedures. Any readjustment of  the "Rates" will be promulgated for enforcement by the General  Administration of Customs [GAC] after being examined and  finalized by the State Council Customs Tax Regulations Committee.    Article 3. Payers of import duties are: Incoming travelers  carrying taxable personal articles, staff of transport vehicles,  recipients of imported postal articles, and recipients of  taxable personal articles imported through other means.    A taxpayer may go through taxation procedures by himself or  herself or by entrusting an agent to handle the matter on his or  her behalf. The agents entrusted shall abide by the provisions  binding their consigners in these procedures.    Article 4. The GAC shall work out the "Classification Table  for Taxation of Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles and  Personal Postal Articles" (hereinafter referred to as the  "Classification Table") according to the "Rates."    Customs shall classify taxable personal articles according  to  the "Classification Table" and determine applicable rates. In  case certain articles are not listed in the "Classification  Table," customs shall classify them into the most appropriate  category as defined in the "Rates" for taxation.    Article 5. Import duties shall be levied in light of the  prices of articles taxed.    Article 6. Customs shall levy import duties on taxable  personal articles according to rates and duty-paid prices  effective on the day of the issuance of tax-paying certificates.    The amount of import duty is the duty-paid price multiplied  by the import duty rate.    Taxpayers shall pay duties before customs releases taxable  personal articles.    Article 7. If customs finds that taxes levied are short of  the required amount after taxable personal articles have been  released, it may ask the taxpayers to pay the shortfall within  one year from the date of the issuance of the tax-paying  certificates; if customs finds that taxable articles have not  been taxed, it may recover the tax from the taxpayers within one  year from the date of the release of the articles in question.  If there should be any shortfall or evasion due to violations  of regulations on the part of taxpayers, customs may ask the  former to pay the tax within three years from the date of  violations of regulations.    If customs finds or confirms that there is an overcharge of  taxes, it shall return the overcharged part immediately;  taxpayers may also ask customs to return the amount overcharged  within one year from the date of taxation.    Article 8. Should there be any disagreement between customs  and taxpayers, the latter shall first pay duties as determined  by the former and then appeal to the former in a written letter  for reconsideration within 30 days from the date of the issuance  of the tax-paying certificate by the former. If the appeal is  overdue, the former may ignore it.    Customs shall work out a decision of reconsideration and  notify the taxpayer within 15 days from the date of receipt of  the appeal. If the taxpayer is not satisfied with the decision,  he or she may appeal to the GAC for reconsideration within 15  days from the date of the receipt of the notice from customs.  The GAC shall work out a decision of reconsideration and notify  the taxpayer within 30 days from the date of receipt of the  application for reconsideration.    If the taxpayer is still not satisfied with the GAC  decision,  he or she may bring a suit to a people's court within 15 days  from the date of the receipt of the GAC decision.    Article 9. The power to interpret these procedures rests  with the State Council Customs Tax Regulations Committee.    Article 10. These procedures become effective as of 1 July  1994.

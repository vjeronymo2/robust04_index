Kh. Dzhurabekov.    Participants in the meeting were the deputies of the  chairman  of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakstan,  the khokims [administrators] of the oblasts and the city of  Tashkent, and the heads of ministries, departments, concerns,  corporations, and associations.    The question of the situation with execution of the laws  directed to ensuring preservation and rational use of petroleum  products in the sectors of the agroindustrial and construction  complexes was reviewed.    Inspections conducted by the republic procurator's office  and  its organs in the local areas with participation by specialists  showed that measures are being taken at the farms and in the  administrative apparatuses of the Ministry of Water Management,  the Ministry of Agriculture, the state concerns Uzvodstroy  [Hydro Construction], Uzplodoovoshchvinprom  [Fruit-Vegetable-Grape Industry], and Uzpishcheprom [Food  Industry], Uzglavstroydrevprom [Main Administration of  Construction in the Wood Processing Industry], and the  Tashkentstroy [Tashkent Construction] State Corporation to stop  mismanagement in the storage, transportation, and use of  petroleum products. This reduced the number of violations of the  law in the use of fuel and lubricants. At the same time the  proper measures are not always taken with guilty parties. As the  result of connivance on the part of ministries, departments, and  officials at the farms and enterprises there occur cases or  irrational use of petroleum products, unsatisfactory  record-keeping on them, illegal writing off of fuel, poor  technical condition in petroleum storage facilities, and  operation of vehicles with malfunctioning speedometers.  Petroleum products are squandered, stolen, and resold owing to  the neglected state of record-keeping and relaxed monitoring of  their preservation. The sources from which petroleum products  sold by private individuals at speculative prices were obtained  are not identified.    A shortfall of 92,500 liters of various petroleum products  was found at the petroleum storage facilities of just 17 farms  in Andizhan, Bukhara, Dzhizak, Surkhandarya, and Navoi oblasts.    The practice was followed where the customs services would  use confiscated petroleum products for their own needs and sell  them to various organizations instead of turning them in to  state storage areas in Surkhandarya, Andizhan, and Bukhara  oblasts. In just the first quarter of this year more than 88  percent of confiscated petroleum products were used for their  own needs or sold to customs employees and various organizations.    The attention of those at the meeting was called to  compulsory execution of the Cabinet of Ministers decree entitled  "Establishing Order in the Sale of Fuel and Lubricants."    The decision adopted noted that many heads of ministries,  concerns, associations, enterprises and organizations, and local  governmental organs did not draw the proper conclusions from  decisions adopted earlier and did not fully ensure their  realization.    The question of the use of gas, boiler fuel, and thermal and  electrical energy at enterprises in Samarkand, Navoi, and  Tashkent oblasts and the city of Tashkent was examined at the  meeting. Study of the state of affairs in this sphere identified  numerous substantial shortcomings, which lead to significant  losses of gas.    In a sample inspection of just 13 percent of the enterprises  of the above oblasts and the city of Tashkent it was established  that about 100 million cubic meters of gas is being lost because  of direct mismanagement. The losses of other types of fuel,  heat, and electricity are very large. The situation with the use  of energy-conserving equipment remains unsatisfactory. The  attention of the executives was directed to the inadequacy of  the steps being taken on questions of the use of fuel-energy  resources.    It was recommended that the heads of khokim [administrative]  offices, ministries, and departments review the personal  responsibility of the officials guilty of offenses in the  questions reviewed, going as far as discharging them from their  positions.    The commission also examined the question of switching  diesel  pumping stations to electric drive. It was noted that  realization of these measures will make it possible to free a  significant quantity of diesel fuel. A schedule was approved for  switching diesel pumping stations to electric drive and  switching machine irrigation systems to gravity flow watering in  1994-1995. Steps to realize this program were outlined.    Deputy prime ministers of the republic A. Voznenko, K.  Tulyaganov, M. Usmanov, and K. Khankulov took part in the  commission meeting.</p>

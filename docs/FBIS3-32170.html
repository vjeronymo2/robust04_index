In an interview he  granted us he set as his prime objective the fight against  poverty, while promising a policy of economic austerity .    The leading crude oil power in Latin America, Venezuela has  reached rock bottom. The state, up to its ears in debt and  wholly disorganized, is now bankrupt with an estimated budget  deficit of $6 billion. In four years, the dollar exchange rate  has leapt from 38 to 108 bolivares, representing a serious de  facto devaluation. Interest rates have risen from 12 percent to  70 percent. The recent collapse of the country's second largest  bank, the Banco Latino, has forced thousands of anguished small  investors out onto the streets of the capital and continues to  threaten the whole financial system. The fall in the price of a  crude oil barrel ($12) on the international market is a cruel  blow for an economy that is already faltering. The growth rate  was negative in 1993. According to experts, the spectacular  growth rates recorded between 1990 and 1992 (7 percent on  average) were mainly due to the very high interest rates and  inflows of "dirty" money from Colombia, Panama, and the Cayman  Islands -- drug money.    Corruption is widespread and there is growing insecurity --  with 50 deaths every weekend in Caracas -- while the public  administration is bloated and inefficient. Rafael Caldera, 78  years old, has inherited a country traumatized by the economic  crisis and the two attempted military coups in 1992. The  specter of a putsch still hovers and the dismissal of Defense  Minister Admiral Radarnes Munoz has added to the concern.  Certain military coup leaders were recently freed by the  interim government of Ramon J. Velasquez. Colonel Chavez,  however, leader of the uprising on February 1992, is still  imprisoned. The question remains whether he too should be freed.  <H5>  `Free Chavez' </H5>   "Without doubt he should," said Mr. Caldera. "The majority  of the population wants him to be released. Peace will come to  the country if we take this step. Everywhere during my  electoral campaign I heard this popular appeal -- free the  military rebels. As president I have the right to do this. I  hope this decision will be accepted by all of the Armed Forces."  The move risks being denounced by the generals, while the army  has taken an increasing hold over public affairs since 1992.  "That is as may be," Caldera replied dryly, "but I also  believe that everyone accepts the need to reestablish the  predominance of civil power."    It is said that in September 1993 Washington again  discouraged senior Venezuelan army officers who had gone to the  United States to sound out the Clinton administration on  "possible renewed military intervention in their country."  Caracas diplomatic circles confirm that there is a very strong,  even "insistent," North American "presence" in the Venezuelan  capital.    The new president stated: "The United States knows that our  democracy has the value of being a test and a symbol for the  whole of Latin America. It attaches a lot of importance to that  fact. Moreover, the recent incidents in Argentina and Mexico --  the Chiapas revolution -- and the uprisings in our prisons are  all warning signs of the constant risks of social explosion  south of the Rio Grande. For this reason, I am convinced more  than ever that our number one priority must be the fight against  poverty and marginalization. We must revise and amend an  economic policy that is too radical. This is one of the causes  of the general malaise. You can see the same thing in Russia and  in eastern Europe."  <H5>  `We Are No Longer a Country of Independent Means' </H5>   Explain, negotiate, and convince, in Venezuela and abroad:  Mr. Caldera's team has already started talks to renegotiate the  debt (of which in theory only 10 percent can be rescheduled).  The president stated: "Of course, but there are special  mechanisms, not least because the crude oil market plays a key  role in the structure of our debt. The World Bank has assured  me of its comprehension and the international financial  institutions know that we are in a serious situation. The  Clinton administration knows it too. We must save our democracy  and I have high hopes."    Mr. Caldera considers that oil will for a long time remain  the key motor of the Venezuelan economy, even though he is  determined to favor a diversification of the source of foreign  income which at the moment is too dependent on fluctuations in  oil prices. "For a long time we were the Saudi Arabia of Latin  America, but we are not any more. Previous governments  speculated on a regular rise in the price of crude and dreamed  of $50 per barrel. As a result, our budget has increased by a  factor of 100 in 20 years. During my first term of office I was  able to revalue the bolivar. Now, our currency is weakening all  the time, and in 1993 we had inflation of 40 percent. Society  must accept that we are no longer a country of independent means  and that frantic speculation has done a lot of harm to our  country."    How can Venezuela find urgently-needed resources and make up  the budget deficit? Mr. Caldera is a prisoner of his own  electoral promises -- which he says he intends to honor -- but  the commitments are specific. The Velasquez government decreed  a 10-percent VAT [value-added tax] rate which recently sparked  street riots throughout the country. The fear of another  "caracazo" (the bloody uprising of February 1989 caused by  modest hikes in public transport fares) is at the back of  everyone's mind. Can Mr. Caldera perform an economic U-turn and  cancel the Perez government's austerity plan of 1989? In any  case, this is what the main sectors of society are expecting.    The president pointed out: "Almost all the elements of the  1989 plan can be changed. Some things were right, such as the  elimination of preferential exchange rates which were a source  of corruption. We have to revise everything in a pragmatic way.  I announced a policy of austerity and the government must lead  by example. The presidential running costs will be cut by 30  percent. VAT, an unfair tax, must be canceled." VAT has already  been suspended by the outgoing government in response to street  demonstrations, and has been replaced by income tax.    The problem is how to make people pay taxes in a country  where this "custom" is more or less unheard of. Mr. Caldera  does not pretend the difficulty does not exist, but at least he  wants to try. "That will require very severe measures. We have  started living in a protest culture. While VAT has become a  symbol, even a taboo, the same is also true for petrol. It is  almost impossible to touch it. However, public opinion must  accept that price rises are inevitable. The sacrifices made will  be sweetened by the compensations to be had. There again, this  is a long-term task. After the attempted coup of February 1992,  Carlos Andres Perez announced to Congress that everything was  going to change. He was applauded just once -- when he said  that the price of petrol would not go up."    People say that Mr. Caldera is an authoritarian: "I do not  think that is true. I am capable of changing my mind. If I am  right, however, then I vigorously defend my point of view. I  have acquired a false reputation: People have confused firmness  with pride. Here there is a considerable risk that things could  get out of control. I cannot promise miracles or prompt radical  changes, except where assistance to the underprivileged is  concerned.</p>

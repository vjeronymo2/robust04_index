			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The collapse in the copper market (see story above) undermined sentiment in the other London Metal Exchange contracts to varying degrees. The next biggest loser was ALUMINIUM, which added Dollars 31.25 to Monday's Dollars 27 fall to close at Dollars 1,186.25 a tonne in the three months position. Traders attributed the fall to nervous liquidation, which gained momentum after support at Dollars 1,200 was broken. ZINC reversed the recent uptrend with three months metal closing Dollars 9.75 down at Dollars 965.50 a tonne and NICKEL's continuing decline was exacerbated by news of a fresh increase in LME warehouse stocks. The GOLD market began with a test of support at Dollars 390 a troy ounce following an overnight wave of selling by Japanese trade houses. But the subsequent recovery to Dollars 393.75 an ounce, down 30 cents on the day, at the London bullion market close showed that there was 'good physical demand on the dips', said one dealer. 'Investors are happy to take profits at about three to four dollars above the market, while shorts are covering at around Dollars 390 and there are plenty of stops (stop-loss orders) just below that,' he added.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Warning on EC postal plan A TOUGH regulatory regime would be essential to ensure that a universal European postal service was not exploited by monopoly operators, the Consumers' Association said yesterday. A European Community green paper on developing a single market for postal services has suggested the gradual liberalisation of cross-border and direct mail services in Europe. Although many services would be open to competition, some areas of activity could be left to monopolies. The association said in a response to the proposals that they would require a regulatory framework to ensure that market power handed to particular operators 'is not exploited in terms of price, quality, availability and redress provided'. An EC suggestion that persistent failure to meet service targets might result in sanctions against operators - including seeking tenders from alternative providers or the linking of permitted price rises to quality targets - was also welcomed by the association. A survey of UK postal users conducted by the association shows that customers want to keep the present balance of quality of service and price. Most, however, would accept the scrapping of the two-tier postal service in favour of a single class. A majority also had no objection to deliveries being restricted to one a day.</p>

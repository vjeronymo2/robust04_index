			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with the Director of the South African </F> Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Rusty Evans, by reporter Bob  Barker on the "Channel Africa Report" program -- recorded]    [Text] Members of the task force formed to investigate the  unrest in Lesotho are meeting in Pretoria today prior to flying  to Maseru tomorrow morning to conduct on-the-site interviews  with the warring military forces. On the line is the South  African director of foreign affairs, Mr. Rusty Evans.    [Begin recording] [Evans] We had the opportunity yesterday  in  Gaborone to be briefed by two ministers of the ... [pauses] the  deputy prime minister and the minister from the Lesotho  Government. There was consensus among the heads of state  present in Gaborone yesterday, that it would be helpful, at the  request of the Lesotho Government, if a group of people could  take it upon themselves to liaise very closely with all the  parties concerned in Lesotho, with a view to, A, getting a very  clear picture as to what the prevailing circumstances are, and  B, to make a recommendation to government in the region as to  what action might be called for or might be helpful to resolve  any differences that still exist down there.    [Reporter] So the team, actually, who goes down will then  report back to the various presidents of the Frontline States?    [Evans] In fact there is an arrangement whereby there will  be  a ministerial meeting in Pretoria on Monday. This has already  been scheduled. The foreign ministers of the three countries  concerned, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, will be meeting  on Monday and the task group will be reporting to those  ministers here in Pretoria.    [Barker] But there is a chance that there could be a  military  presence from the Frontline States that you have just mentioned,  if it does not work out?    [Evans] I should imagine that, that's a conceivable option  but at this stage I think it's a little premature, frankly. I  think that one should allow the task group to do their work.  They are professional people. They are diplomats and very  senior personnel from the respective ministries of Foreign  Affairs and the Departments of Defense of the three countries.  The problem in Lesotho is essentially a military problem, so  you know, it's necessary to have military expertise in a group  of that nature. [end recording]</p>

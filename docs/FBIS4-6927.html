			<p>CSO     [Text] On 15 April, Nippon Idotsushin (IDO) will launch a  dedicated team to promote the sale of Motorola cellular phones.  As a response to the recent agreement emanating from friction  concerning cellular phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen  to expand the service area and accelerate signing of new  subscribers to provide for early recovery of its investment in  the Motorola system. IDO expects to enlist about 120,000  subscribers within the fiscal year. By expanding the service  area and emphasizing the Motorola system, it hopes to compete  more effectively with NTT's mobile communication network called  NTT Dokomo [Anywhere] and to prevent recurrence of Japan-U.S.  friction.    The dedicated team will be established as the Fourth Sales  Section within the Sales Department. It will be initially  staffed with eight individuals. Since it does not have any  company-owned direct sales outlets, IDO will set up dealers that  specialize in Motorola cellular phones and provide sales support  to distributors.    In the past, IDO had established the First, Second and Third  Sales Sections under the Sales Department and had provided sales  support to dealers which handled both NTT and Motorola cellular  phones. However, now IDO sources say, "If we approach the sales  effort for both rival NTT's Dokomo and Motorola systems in the  same way, there is little prospect of improving sales of  Motorola units." But, now that capital investments in the  Motorola system have been expanded as a result of the agreement,  IDO has decided to place emphasis on the promotion of Motorola  units.    In conjunction with the outright sale of cellular phones  which began in April, IDO as an operator of communications  systems will stock a maximum of 11 models of cellular phones and  provide that eight of them will be applicable to the Motorola  system. It will thus position the Motorola system strategically  in the competition to increase its subscriber share in the  market place.    As a follow-on to the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular  phones, IDO will invest about 60 billion yen to expand its base  stations for the Motorola system and reassign some of the  frequencies currently used on the NTT system to the Motorola  system by the end of September 1995. Further, the operating plan  submitted by IDO to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  contains a passage which states, "We will install a dedicated  sales organization to promote the Motorola system."    IDO subscribers to the Motorola system as of 31 March 1994  totaled about 22,000. This figure is far behind the 310,000 IDO  subscribers for the NTT system, but is close to three times the  number existing at the same time last year.</p>

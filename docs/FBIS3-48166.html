Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with visiting Deputy  Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Tom Hubbard and shared  concern that North Korea not be allowed to delay much longer in  inspection negotiations with the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA). He asked that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher ask China to exert active influence on North Korea  on the nuclear issue, Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the  American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, said in the  post-meeting briefing.    Christopher and his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, are  due  to meet in Paris this week.    Hubbard had come to Seoul Sunday after accompanying Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on an Asian tour. He is the top U.S.  representative to regular contacts with North Korea in New York.    The U.S. official worried at the delay in North Korea-U.S.  inspection talks and declared there will be no negotiations of  any sort between North Korea and the United States without the  Pyongyang-IAEA agreement first.    Hubbard called China's role so far as having been  constructive and promised to seek Beijing's powerful influence  on North Korea at the Paris meeting of the foreign ministers.    Hubbard left for Washington after afternoon talks with South  Korean Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and chief Presidential  Aide for Diplomacy and National Security Chong Chong-uk.</p>

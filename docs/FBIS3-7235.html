			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] North Korea's suspected nuclear development program  has again been referred to the UN Security Council [UNSC]. In  this connection, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] source  disclosed on 23 March that a task force has already been set up  within MOFA to deal with economic sanctions to be imposed by the  UNSC on North Korea and with other situations, and that the task  force is fully prepared to consult with other government  ministries and agencies. Commenting on the prospect of the UNSC  adopting a resolution, the same MOFA source pointed out, "The  UNSC will adopt a resolution urging North Korea to accept  complete nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency and will then see how North Korea responds to the  resolution." The source also added that the possibility of the  UNSC imposing economic sanctions on North Korea at this point is  slim. The source indicated that if the UNSC decides to impose  economic sanctions on North Korea, "Japan is obliged to go along  with them as a member nation of the United Nations." As for the  need to amend current laws and ordinances for Japan to comply  with the economic sanctions, the source clearly said, "Each  government ministry and agency is now closely examining ways to  amend them."    The economic sanctions against North Korea may create a  serious situation for Japan's security, and for that reason the  task force is expected to study 1) ways to ban remittances by  ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea, for these remittances  have been strongly criticized by the United States and other  nations; 2) the possibility of increasing reconnaissance and  information-collecting activities by the Self-Defense Forces in  accordance with UNSC resolutions; 3) ways to airlift about 9,000  Japanese in South Korea back to Japan if South Korea enters an  emergency situation.    The same MOFA source indicated that "it is impossible for  the  Japanese Government to regulate visits by ethnic Koreans in  Japan to North Korea through which money is remitted from Japan  to North Korea." The source, however, declined to definitely  comment on the possibility of suspending the issuing of reentry  visas for ethnic Koreans.</p>

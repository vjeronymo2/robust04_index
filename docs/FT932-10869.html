			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (3): Recession proves hard to shake-off - Recovery expected by end of the year THE unexpectedly persistent recession that has gripped Switzerland since mid-1991 is proving difficult to escape from as businesses come to terms with a future outside the European Economic Area, and consumers adapt to two more years of decline in real disposable income - under the shadow of the country's highest unemployment in 50 years. If unemployment figures were a barometer of real economic performance, then the present jobless rate of 4.9 per cent and rising would indicate the most serious economic conditions since the 1930s. However, while even official sources no longer rule out the possibility of the number of unemployed increasing from the present 150,000 to 200,000 within the next year, the turning point in the economic cycle is no longer far away. In the two previous recessions, in 1974 and 1982, the Swiss government was able to 'export' its unemployment problem, but improved residence rights for foreign workers preclude this course of action. The job market has also contracted because of structural re-adjustments in the domestic economy and the hangover effects of four years of strict monetary policy. The Swiss National Bank's strong medicine has worked, but at some cost. Inflation, which reached a high of 6.6 per cent in the summer of 1991, is hovering at just over 3 per cent, although the reserve bank's year-end target of 2.5 per cent is unlikely to be met. ONE of the most serious concerns on the domestic front is the construction industry. Some estimates suggest that in order to use the over-capacity in commercial and industrial property, another 70,000-90,000 jobs would have to be created between now and the end of the decade. Office rents in the commercial capital, Zurich, are now less than half those of the mid-1980s for new tenants. According to Mr Hans Kaufmann, chief economist of Bank Julius Baer, in Zurich, orders in the construction industry are down 26 per cent in nominal terms. The situation has reached the critical point where capacity might have to be sharply reduced - 'if orders do not pick up this year, the construction sector will have to shed another 15,000-20,000 jobs,' he says. A government attempt to stimulate construction by offering 15 per cent subsidies for public works projects in the 23 cantons, or mini-states - similar to a programme which largely succeeded in the 1980s - is expected to have negligible effect this time. In theory, it could have led to additional spending of SFr1.6bn (Pounds 710m), or 3 per cent of the total outlays in a sector which accounts for 17 per cent of GDP. However, the cantons and municipalities have been slow to make use of this money, the main reason being the soaring overall public deficit of between SFr10bn-Sfr11bn. Some SFr3bn is being carried by the federal government and the further SFr7bn-SFr8bn by the cantons and local councils combined. In the early 1980s they were in surplus. The construction sector is one of the worst examples of Switzerland's cartel-riven and unbalanced internal market. A recent study estimates that the public sector pays SFr7bn-SFr8bn a year more for construction projects than if a free market were in operation. If the federal government or the cantonal authorities wanted to construct a building in Zurich, only Zurich-based companies could legally submit tenders. Analysts at the country's leading banks forecast a further decline in GDP in 1993 of between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent, after a fall of 0.6 per cent last year. But they are unanimous that recovery will be well under way by the turn of the year. Growth forecasts for 1994 are between 1-1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, 1995 is seen as the year of the return of Switzerland's traditional annual growth levels of 2 per cent or more. Optimism is geared to the go-ahead then of large public works; a SFr30bn-SFr40bn alpine tunnels project is to be completed over 10 years, four gaps in the motorway network are to be filled, and work will restart on the SFr8bn Railway 2000 project, only 10 per cent of which has been completed. In the short-term, weak consumer spending will continue to be a drag on the recovery. Private consumption is expected to decline by 0.5 per cent after last year's fall of 0.3 per cent, in the face of job uncertainty, another fall in real wages, and increases in petrol tax and unemployment insurance contributions. Mr Manfred Gutmann, chief economist of the Union Bank of Switzerland, said the banking and insurance sectors would expect to shed more jobs this year. Some analysts expect the job-cuts to be as high as 2,500 to 3,000 - 'banks and insurance companies are no longer able to absorb as before people laid off from the industrial sector as job creation in services has peaked.' He expects unemployment to average about 4 per cent for the next three or four years - a new situation for a country accustomed for decades to near full employment. There appears still to be scope for a further loosening of monetary policy. Mr Georg Rich, the reserve bank's chief economist said he could see interest rates declining further this year, but was cautious on the recovery - 'I think things will improve in the second half, but any improvement will be modest. In my view it has to come from the domestic side because I think the external side still looks relatively grim.' While Swiss exports were the main support of the economy in 1992, growing 5.5 per cent in real terms, they are expected to be flat this year. Exporters are suffering from the slowdown in the EC, particularly in Germany. Given weaker EC investment demand, a fall-off in exports will be felt most in the industrial machinery sector. The negative effects of Switzerland's no-vote in the EEA referendum will take some time to gauge. However, there is a feeling in Bern that the government's traditional perception of itself as a Sonderfall (special case) in the international arena will guide it through any difficulties with the Brussels hierarchy, to whom it has always had privileged access. Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the country's senior negotiator in the Uruguay Round of the Gatt world trade talks, said both the EC and Switzerland could recoup what they aimed to do in the EEA - 'a successful Uruguay Round would in fact solve the problems we would be faced with in the absence of a bilateral agreement in the sense of the EEA, or in the field of public procurement.' Mr Girard said non-membership of the EEA was as likely to cost Switzerland in growth terms no more than would an appreciation of the Swiss franc at any given time. Throughout the EC big Swiss companies are in entrenched positions which may not be easily dismantled. 'We have 8 per cent of our overall trade with Baden-Wurttemberg, one German state. There is cross-border co-operation, the same mentality, the same structures, the same economic conditions,' says Mr Girard. In the meantime, Swiss corporate earnings growth is expected to pursue its upward trend. Falling interest rates are also likely to stimulate the Swiss stock market, as more attractive instruments are sought in which to reinvest some of the estimated SFr700bn in short-term investments. The Swiss franc, which weakened in the first quarter, is expected to strengthen later in the year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      COMPONENTS OF GDP, 1991-94                  YEAR-ON-YEAR GROWTH (IN PERCENTAGE)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           1981-90    1991   1992    1993*      1994*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Private consumption           1.6     1.5   -0.3    -0.5        0.0 Investment                    4.4    -2.8   -6.7    -2.8        0.9  -Construction                3.7    -3.2   -5.7    -2.0        1.5  -Equipment                   5.8    -1.2   -9.3    -4.0        0.0 Total exports                 3.3    -0.7    3.4     0.1        1.2 Total imports                 3.8    -1.7   -3.8    -1.5        0.0 GDP                           2.1    -0.1   -0.6    -0.3        1.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *indicates estimate; source: Union Bank of Switzerland  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

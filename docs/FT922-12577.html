			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Najibullah may leave Afghanistan PRESIDENT Najibullah of Afghanistan may leave Kabul today for exile, possibly in India, senior Pakistani officials said last night. According to reports from Kabul, he appointed a military council last night to take over. The Russian embassy in Kabul was reported by Russian diplomats to have ordered the evacuation of half its 40-member staff. The diplomats said there were fears its staff may be taken hostage in retaliation for the 1979 Soviet invasion. There was intense diplomatic activity last night in the Pakistani capital. Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, chaired a meeting of representatives of various mujahideen factions, adding to intense pressure on them to finalise plans for a representative council to take over government in Kabul. They were due to meet the Pakistani prime minister again today. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general had proposed such a council last week to rule until an interim government is set up with the task of holding fresh elections. However, reports of the fall of the strategic Baghram air base have raised concerns that the process could be derailed.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHP OFFICERS ON CYCLES NOW PATROL CALIFORNIA 78  </P> <P> California 78 has been referred to as a 17-mile-long parking lot. During rush  hour, or whenever there is an accident on the highway, driving is reduced to a  crawl.  </P> <P> Responding to the increasing congestion, the California Highway Patrol in  Oceanside has assigned motorcycle officers to monitor traffic from Oceanside to  Escondido on California 78.  </P> <P> The officers are more flexible in moving through traffic on motorcycles than in  patrol cars, Officer Len Schroeder said. The first motorcycle officer began  patrolling in August, and four more have been added. Another officer will be  assigned to the highway soon.  </P> <P> It had been 15 years since CHP motorcycle officers patrolled North County  highways. They were taken off in 1974 because of a high injury rate, Schroeder  said.  </P> <P> The deployment of motorcycles is up to the commander in each CHP district. They  are widely used in Los Angeles and San Diego.  </P> <P> "It's a hazardous job," Schroeder said. "You never know when a car will pull  out in front of an officer. When an officer falls on a bike, it's not the same  as having the protection of a car."  </P> <P> He said the officers have to go to California Highway Patrol Academy in  Sacramento for two weeks of intensive training.  </P> <P> "We have a 70% failure rate at the academy, with most flunking out the first  week," Schroeder said.  </P> <P> The training begins with the basics. The officers have to learn the parts of  the motorcycle and are taught how to ride slowly before being trained on a  high-speed track.  </P> <P> The five officers rotate on a split shift, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. They will  also patrol unincorporated roads adjoining their beat.  </P> <P> Once a relatively uncrowded route, California 78 has in recent years become  North County's most congested highway. In 1987, $15 million in federal funds  was allocated to widen the east-west highway from four to six lanes along a  17-mile stretch from Oceanside to Escondido, at a total cost of more than $30  million.  </P> <P> Schroeder said construction on the highway has shrunk the road and contributed  to the traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Since 1983, traffic volume has increased 73% on California 78, and accidents  have increased by 200%. Because of booming growth, the number of cars using the  highway peaks at 113,000 daily in some areas, Schroeder said. The road is  designed to handle 65,000 cars a day.  </P></p>

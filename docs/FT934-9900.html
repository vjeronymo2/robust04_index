			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Foreign banks face new curbs in Russia THE Russian government is considering further curbs on the expansion of foreign banks into the Russian market after the granting of operating licences by the Central Bank of Russia to five non-Russian banks, bringing the total to 12. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy economics minister, has warned of 'further regulation' of the activities of the foreign banks - which are only just beginning to open for business. In a decision taken two weeks ago and confirmed in the last few days, three foreign banks - Citibank, Chase Manhattan and ABN-Amro - and two Russo-Turkish joint venture banks have all received licences to operate. The licences allow the banks to open accounts for Russians and foreigners in both roubles and in hard currency. Mr Steven Fullenkamp, vice-president of Chase Manhattan in Moscow, said last night: 'I was surprised that the central bank licensed five all together. I believe there will now be a pause, for perhaps as long as a year, while the central bank sees how the foreign banks perform on the Russian market.' Of the 12 banks with operating licences, only three - Credit Lyonnais (in St Petersburg), Bank of Austria and the Banque Nationale de Paris/Dresdner Bank joint venture in Moscow - have opened their doors for accounts. 'The pie is certainly increasing here, and there are a dozen or two of the Russian banks which are attracting a lot of business as well as the foreign banks,' Mr Fullenkamp said. The main ministers for the economy and finance have voiced strong doubts about the competition offered by the foreign banks. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy minister for finance, issued a press release last Friday saying that 'while in general the government welcomes the creation of foreign bank branches as long as they promote competition', the ministry intended to maintain strict limits to the operations of the banks. He added that the government would not support the 'increasingly evident course' of the central bank in granting licences to a large number of non-Russian banks. Under the central bank's own rules, the total fixed assets in Russia of the foreign banks must not exceed 12 per cent of the total fixed assets of Russian commercial banks. Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank's chairman, said recently that the total assets of foreign banks in the Russian market were no more than 5 per cent. Mr Gaidar said in an interview with the daily newspaper Izvestiya last Saturday that over-hasty granting of licences could lead to 'dangerous and far-reaching consequences' for the Russian banking sector. 'Competition in this sphere is absolutely essential, but we must be very careful that it does not lead to a rapid collapse of the native banking sector. 'Most countries open their doors to foreign banks very slowly. 'We will likely have to take measures for the further regulation of the activities of foreign banks in the transitional period,' Mr Gaidar said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Vitaliy Pidchenko; from the </F> "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] A meeting took place in Kharkov today that was  attended by representatives of the leading space firms in Russia  and Ukraine.    [Pidchenko] The participants in this meeting have been  partners for quite some time. For more than 30 years they have  worked in close contact, creating the country's strategic  missile shield. Now, there is a state frontier between them, the  enterprises, design bureaux, and institutes of the former  Glavkosmos [USSR Main Administration for the Development and Use  of Space Technology for the National Economy and Scientific  Research]. Representatives of them arrived in Kharkov to  discuss the future joint program. In particular, it is proposed  that CIS nuclear power stations, as well as a number of main oil  and gas pipelines, should be fitted with super-reliable systems  of electronic control.    Within the framework of another program ordered by the  Russian Central Bank, it is planned to create a global system of  communications, putting three earth satellites into orbit. This  will allow Russia and Ukraine, to begin with, and then other  countries, to carry out interbank operations almost  instantaneously.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH OUTSIDE SANTA ANA STORE  </P> <P> A man was fatally shot in the back early Tuesday as he walked toward a  convenience store, police said.  </P> <P> Investigators are trying to determine a motive for the killing of Manuel Ayala  Cortez, 21.  </P> <P> He was pronounced dead at McFadden Avenue and Bristol Street minutes after the  shooting, which occurred shortly after midnight, Santa Ana police spokeswoman  Maureen Thomas said.  </P> <P> Cortez and his uncle had been sitting on a bus bench in front of the 7-Eleven  when a car pulled up a short distance away and stopped. When Cortez started to  walk toward the convenience store, two men got out of the car -- one of them  armed with a handgun -- and followed him, Thomas said.  </P> <P> The gunman shot Cortez "several times" in the back. The uncle, Manuel Ayala  Valdez, 23, who was sitting on the bench, ran toward his wounded nephew. The  gunman then spun around and pointed the weapon at Valdez, Thomas said.  </P> <P> "The gunman pulled the trigger again," Thomas said, "but he had expended all  his ammunition. The uncle ran and took cover behind some nearby bushes."  </P> <P> The suspects' car was last seen speeding off west on McFadden Avenue.  </P> <P> Investigators believe that the assailants had waited in their vehicle before  approaching the suspect, Thomas said. Police are trying to determine whether  Cortez knew his assailants.  </P></p>

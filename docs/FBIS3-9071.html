			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by an </F> unidentified correspondent in Washington on 18 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] After signing the  agreement in Washington you first met with U.S. President  Clinton. What do you consider to be the highlights of that  meeting?    [Tudjman] It goes without saying that this meeting was of  exceptional importance to me and the Croatian delegation. We  discussed ways of translating into practice what we had agreed  on by signing the accord. In this regard we primarily stated  that Croatia needed U.S. and European support in order to  resolve the issue of Croatia's territories temporarily under UN  protection; that is, the incorporation of those territories into  Croatia's constitutional and legal system. Naturally, we also  discussed many other issues from the area of international  relations, especially issues of relevance to bilateral relations  between Croatia and the United States.    [Correspondent] Did you have any interesting encounters with  the representatives of the European Union? How do they view  America's sudden decision to join in the process of resolving  the crisis in the region of former Yugoslavia?    [Tudjman] Yes, I met with the troika -- you know what that  means, the present chairman of the European Union, Greek  [Foreign] Minister Papoulias, former Chairman Claes and future  Chairman Kinkel, German vice chancellor and foreign minister --  and then with Van den Broek and with around a dozen European  ministers and ambassadors. We discussed the agreement and  topical issues, primarily -- again -- the integration of the  territories occupied by Serbia and under the protection of the  peacekeeping forces into Croatia.    [Correspondent] Let us go back to the agreements signed and  possibilities for their implementation in the field. In your  opinion, what is the minimum territory the Muslim-Bosniak  federation [as heard] should get?    [Tudjman] Well, there has been no discussion on that subject  here in Washington. However, it has been established in the  course of the talks so far within the framework of the European  conference on former Yugoslavia and on resolving the Bosnian  crisis that the present Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia should  get 51 percent. Namely, it was envisaged at the time that the  Muslims should get 33.5 percent and the Croats 17.5. Therefore,  this is a minimum below which we cannot go, while talks are to  continue on the basis of the Muslim demand for an increase in  these territories, that is, as is often heard on the margins of  diplomatic conversations -- the Serbs would have to pay a price  for joining the confederation. So, it is out of the question  that the Serbs could retain more than 50 percent, as some are  saying.    [Correspondent] Yesterday Mr. Redman was our guest in this  same program. He mentioned not only the amount of territory  that the Serbs should hand back but also the quality of  territory, too. Would you like to specify and tell us what the  most desirable territories are in the event of their being  handed back to the Muslim-Croatian federation?    [Tudjman] I believe that at the moment it would not be  advisable for me to dwell on these issues, which will be  negotiated. It is important to tell our public that the most  important factors of world and European politics are in  agreement that one should seek solutions at the green table,  that a political agreement should be reached. Understandably,  this agreement should be such as to take account of geostrategic  interests too.    [Correspondent] Talking about geostrategic interests, I  believe that Croatia, people in Croatia, may find it  particularly interesting as to whether this possible demand for  the return of territories will sever the corridor to the  so-called Krajina?    [Tudjman] This issue, too, well, it remains to be seen in  the  course of talks. For us it is essential that we have the full  support of the United States and the European Union, that is,  all international factors, for the return of Croatian  territories into Croatia's constitutional and legal system.    [Correspondent] Let us stay a bit longer on  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In your opinion, should, and under what  conditions, the Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina be allowed to join  the Croat-Muslim federation?    [Tudjman] It seems to me that this question is unnecessary  because the Serbs have so far shown no interest in living in a  union. Therefore, what will probably be at issue is whether the  Serbs can be forced to temporarily remain in some kind of loose  union with the Croat-Bosnian federation, for a temporary  solution, a definitive solution. [sentence as heard] The  possibility of forming a confederation within the framework of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is not discussed at all now. What is  important, what the world has tried to achieve, is to establish  peace between Croats and Muslims because it is in strategic  interests to end the war and to reach a demarcation that would,  in the future, guarantee a more stable order in this region.    [Correspondent] In discussions of a global solution to the  crisis in the region, a global settlement is very often  mentioned. People here in Croatia have recently started fearing  a possible revival of some kind of loose union in the region.  Do you think that if the Bosnian Serbs are allowed to remain in  the federation and have some kind of link with Serbia, that the  international community will exert pressure on Croatia to join a  confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Tudjman] It can be supposed that some circles in the  international community would exert such pressure, and some are  still nurturing such ideas. This is a well-known fact.  However, the important and responsible international factors  know that there can be no revival of Yugoslavia, of the Yugoslav  union, and that regardless of what Serbia wants, Croatia on the  other hand is firm in its standpoint that a new international  order in this region is possible only on the basis of the mutual  recognition of sovereign states created on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia.    [Correspondent] A meeting of representatives of Croatia and  the so-called Krajina is scheduled, as we know, to take place in  the Russian Embassy on Tuesday. Some information has been  leaked, so I would like to check it with you. Is it true that  our delegation will be headed by Hrvoje Sarinic and the Serb  delegation by Mile Novakovic?    [Tudjman] Hrvoje Sarinic will head our delegation, that is  true. I also heard before my departure that their delegation  will be headed by....[changes thought] But there will also be  someone else as their political representative. Our public is  probably also interested in the fact that this meeting was  convened by President Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin. This  meeting will be attended by a U.S. representative, too.    [Correspondent] Will this meeting, as Churkin said, focus  solely on a cease-fire, or will some political relations be  discussed nevertheless at this early stage?    [Tudjman] The agenda for this meeting will, of course,  include a cease-fire, meaning the securing of -- shall I say --  a general cease-fire, something that will be an introduction to  the further process of normalizing relations. In this context,  one certainly cannot rule out talks on these issues.    [Correspondent] A question that inevitably arises: Will  Croatia have to alter some of its present laws -- the law on  minorities, the law on the internal set-up, for instance -- in  the process of reintegrating the so-called Krajina?    [Tudjman] Well, Croatia had passed a constitutional law in  conformity with the demands of the European Community, as it was  known at the time -- the present European Union -- and in  accordance with suggestions made by the arbitration commission  headed by prominent French expert Badintere. There will be no  reason for fundamentally altering Croatia's legislature.  Understandably, we for our part will be flexible enough to  reach an agreement on the peaceful integration of those regions  into Croatia's constitutional and legal system while remaining  determined not to allow Croatia's sovereignty to be eroded.    [Correspondent] Could you please clarify this concept, this  syntagma frequently heard of late -- expanded autonomy.    [Tudjman] There can be no talk of any other expanded  autonomy  but the one already discussed. I am referring to two districts  -- Glina and Knin, where the Serbs are in the majority. It is  there that they will have the right to local self-rule in  accordance with our Constitution and constitutional laws. Also,  of course, the entire Serb community in Croatia will have all  human rights guaranteed as well as ethnic community rights in  harmony with international conventions.    [Correspondent] We have heard certain rumors, and some  observers -- we will not name them now -- claim that the  so-called Krajina [Serb-held areas in eastern and southern  Croatia] should be given the status that Kosovo and Vojvodina  had under the 1974 Constitution of the former SFRY [Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. What do you think about that?    [Tudjman] I think that such claims are nebulous. Kosovo is a  province inhabited not only by a huge national minority, but  also by almost 2 million Albanians who have a 90 percent  majority and live in a compact area. In the same way, Vojvodina  is a separate and historical province, which was not part of  Serbia and Yugoslavia until 1918, and it is also ethnically,  nationally mixed. There can be no comparison in that respect  with the so-called Krajina in Croatia, which is not  territorially linked and where the Serbs are in a proportional  minority, except in the two districts that I have mentioned --  Glina and Knin -- which are not territorially linked.    [Correspondent] By all appearances, the sanctions against  Belgrade are the only effective means against greater Serbian  policies. In your opinion, is it now possible to lift the  sanctions in exchange for [Serbia] giving up the so-called  Krajinas?    [Tudjman] Now you have used the term exchange, such an  exchange is possible only when a positive, acceptable solution  is reached simultaneously -- with Serbia's consent -- in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and when Croatia's territories currently  under the peace forces' protection are reintegrated into Croatia.    [Correspondent] In your view, now that the agreement has  been signed, has Croatia's position become stronger in the eyes  of the Security Council, the United Nations?    [Tudjman] Absolutely. In making its demands, Croatia's  position is now very favorable. Croatia's position in the  international community has become such that it has friendly  relations, the closest relations with the United States; it has  the understanding of the European Union in general, especially  the leading European countries and, what is not important [as  heard], the complete understanding -- especially now after the  signing of these agreements on a federation and a confederation  -- of a large number of Islamic countries and nonaligned  countries which, as you know, are numerous and which are playing  an important role in the work of the Security Council and the  United Nations. To this effect Croatia's demands will be met by  far greater understanding because Croatia has again shown that  it is pursuing a consistent policy of resolving matters  peacefully, that its objectives are in conformity with the  international community.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President.    [Tudjman] Thank you and a good night to you.</p>

Perhaps some observers interpret this as an Israeli  attempt to dampen the success achieved in the the Geneva summit  between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton last month,  and to indicate that improving Arab-U.S. relations should be  done via Israel.    For its part, Syria refuses to accept these ideas and  insists  that Israel should negotiate as a party, not as an ally of the  United States.    In statements to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Syrian political sources  have accused Israel of trying to drive a wedge between Syria and  the Arab states. It does not want to achieve any progress on  the Syrian track. This is why it has pointed to the need to  delay any achievement until details of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement have been completed in isolation from the other  tracks. Besides, the praise heaped recently on Syria and  President al-Asad in particular at the expense of Egypt and the  PLO chairman in the seminar held by Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin reflects -- according to the Syrian sources --  Israel's desire to split Arab ranks and deal with personal  matters. Syria rejected and continues to reject this because  its policy is opposed to such orientations. The sources are  surprised by Israel's constant return to secrecy and discussing  the concept of peace before announcing its agreement to withdraw  completely, even though Syria has stressed its willingness to  implement all requirements of a just peace.    A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that in its current  policy Israel is seeking to obstruct all efforts related to the  peace process and to waste time. But Damascus will continue to  display self-restraint, because it believes that time is not in  Israel's interests and that these maneuvers will not help it to  achieve what it wants, because the government's worrying  position in Israel will inevitably push it toward the Syria  gate, from which to move toward all solutions.    The Syrian official added that current factors should help  Israel to recognize the right of the Syrians, Palestinians, and  Lebanese to have their territories liberated from the Israeli  presence. And that Israel tried to play games by working for  bilateral agreements, which Syria believes weaken the Arab  position and has rejected conclusively. [passage omitted]</p>

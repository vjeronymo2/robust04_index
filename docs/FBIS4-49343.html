			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Analysis" page by Andy Ho: "Lu Ping </F> Misses Chance To Win Over HK People"]    [Text] The recent showing off of the Red One Company, Bank  of China's issuing of new banknotes, and Mr Lu Ping's current  visit to Hong Kong could all have underlined China's growing  intimacy with the territory. These events, however, have turned  out to be a public relations fiasco for Beijing and failed to  score any political points in the tussle with the British to win  the hearts of the Hong Kong people.    Mr Lu, the director of the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office, led a delegation of almost 200 Beijing  appointees in Hong Kong to visit the People's Liberation Army  (PLA) stationed in Guangdong. This could have been an excellent  occasion for the Chinese military to polish up its image,  tarnished by its role in the crackdown of the pro-democracy  movement in Tiananmen Square five years ago.    The audience was by and large a compliant one. Combat skills  aside, the army could have easily left an impression that they  were highly disciplined and civilised. But Xinhua chose to veto  all applications by the Hong Kong media to cover the trip, the  first of its kind focusing on the training of the PLA to be  deployed in Hong Kong after 1997. The official reason for the  news agency's ruling was that the tour would involve some  military secrets. That feeble excuse was even challenged by  some of the guests.    A delegate to the National People's Congress, Miss Liu  Yiuchu, for instance, pointed out that there were foreign  passport-holders among those advisers on the invitation list.  She argued that there was no reason why foreign citizens should  be allowed, while the Hong Kong press had to be denied access.  Xinhua was unable to come up with a sensible explanation.    Given the significance of the event, Hong Kong journalists  opted to neglect the reporting guidelines set by the State  Council and tried their luck anyway. To their surprise, the two  main pro-China dailies in Hong Kong and the Guangdong Television  Station were permitted to cover the event. The television  footage on the company's demonstration shown on the local  channels was, in fact, copied from the Guangdong station.    Despite the reporters' technically illegal status, Mr Zhang  Junsheng, the Xinhua spokesman, chose to make public comments  about the merits of the PLA and their need for more contact with  the public through the eager Hong Kong press. This makes a  complete mockery of the Chinese authorities' rules on Hong Kong  reporters' activities on the mainland. Only a few days before,  other Chinese functionaries, such as Mr Wang Fengchao and Sun  Nansheng, declared that it was necessary to weed out illegal  reporting by the Hong Kong media.    The way the NCNA handled the tour has further alienated the  local news media. This incident came within a couple of weeks  of more than 1,300 journalists signing a petition, demanding  China respect the freedom of the press. And another 130-odd  reporters on the China beat further pledged to boycott freebies  offered by official Chinese units for a month.    The display of the PLA's military might was followed by an  auspicious ceremony to mark the Bank of China's admission to the  exclusive club of banknote-issuing institutions in Hong Kong.  The issuing of $3 billion worth of BOC notes does not carry  substantial financial implications, but the move symbolises  Beijing's increasing presence in the territory. It serves as  the most visible reminder of the coming of China, before the  five-star bauhinia flag for the future Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region is raised on July 1, 1997.    Many note collectors were disappointed when the bank  announced that some of the new banknotes with lucky number  sequences were withheld for a charity auction. A press release  by the bank described the distribution of the new notes to its  customers on the first day as orderly. However, it has emerged  that only an estimated 500 of the 12,000 sets for collectors  managed to reach the bank's branch offices for public  consumption. Many of those with lucky sequence numbers had been  reserved reportedly for the bank's own employees and its major  accounts. This serves a reminder to residents of the prevalence  of nepotism within the Chinese bureaucracy.    Mr Lu, who heads the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  attended both the occasions. It does not appear to be the case  that he is insensitive to press coverage. He was seen reading a  pile of local dailies, in both Chinese and English, before  starting the proceedings of the economics sub-group of the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) yesterday. It has thus  remained unexplained why he was so determined to dodge not only  protesters but also the press, during the first two days of his  visit.    It was only on his third day in the territory that he agreed  to make a brief statement in front of the cameras, saying that  the Hong Kong Government's unfriendly attitude towards the PWC  was to blame for his refusal to meet the Governor. Public  opinion is clearly sympathetic to the Governor, as residents are  keen to see the two top officials resume direct dialogue.    Mr Lu was probably speaking the truth when he noted that it  would not be productive even if he were to meet Mr Patten at  this stage, while official Sino-British relations are so sour.  Yet this has reflected badly on his colleagues, who earlier  justified his snubbing the Governor on the grounds that Mr Lu  was too busy and that he was not wearing his hat as the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office's director. His first few lines  in Hong Kong reinforced the widespread impression that official  Chinese spokesmen, including those from both the Foreign  Ministry, Xinhua and Mr Lu's own office, cannot be taken too  seriously.</p>

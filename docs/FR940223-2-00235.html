			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bicycle rodeos are half or full-day events requiring fairly extensive planning and design which teach children of all ages how to ride their bikes safely and correctly. The rodeo allows participants to ride their bicycles while they practice and improve bicycle safety skills and learn about traffic situations while rotating through several activity stations. Some of the skills are also transferable to situations in which children are pedestrians. Complete guides for conducting rodeos are available for assistance. (Can be conducted in conjunction with law enforcement, schools, and youth centers.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Safety Belts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;School Safety Belt Use Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Young drivers and passengers have the lowest safety belt use rates of any age group. Their reasons often include not wanting to wrinkle their clothes, not wanting to appear uncool or wimpy in front of friends, and include myths such as ``I could never be involved in a crash,'' ``I'd rather be thrown clear from the car in a crash,'' and ``I don't want to be trapped if the car catches on fire.'' Safety belt use programs can be designed to correct the misperceptions with facts and include activities that will raise awareness about the importance of wearing a safety belt properly every time a person rides in a motor vehicle. Activities can include taking children out to a car to instruct them how to properly buckle up in both the front and back seats and allowing them to practice, conducting a safety belt speed challenge to show that buckling up only takes a couple of seconds that could save a life, demonstrating the effectiveness of safety belts through a carefully designed egg experiment, taking an observational safety belt use survey of people arriving and departing school property, and having students sign pledge cards to wear safety belts and encourage others to do the same. (Can be conducted in conjunction with schools and student clubs.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Alcohol <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Teen Courts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Teen courts represent an intervention approach that employs the dramatic role of peer influence responding to youth problem behaviors often prompted by peer pressure, such as underage drinking, impaired driving, and other antisocial behaviors. Teen courts could supplement the traditional juvenile justice system in which volunteers (teens or young adults) could work with the local justice system to implement and administer a teen court system, serving as bailiffs, clerks, prosecuting and defense attorneys, and, in some cases, judges. Volunteers would also coordinate recruiting youth jurors from the community to sit on juries for individual cases. Information on how to set up a teen court is available from NHTSA. On the whole, teen courts help provide a diversion from the juvenile justice system, appear to reduce recidivism, and capitalize on peer influence to alleviate illegal behaviors. Additional alcohol-awareness activism for volunteers could include efforts to utilize youth as court room monitors to collect data and make recommendations to solve problems, conduct intergenerational issue presentations, and use impaired driving victim impact panels in presentations. (Can be conducted in conjunction with juvenile justice system, schools, law enforcement, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Volunteer Participant and Program Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the highly technical nature of the program and the limitation of available funds, this project is designed as a pilot program to train the equivalent of 10 full-time youth or young adult volunteers. Volunteers should be between the ages of 16 and 25, with a high school diploma or its equivalent, working in a single city or community. The volunteers should be proficient speaking the dominant language or languages of the area. Volunteers should be divided into two teams of five with two volunteers designated as team leaders. Team leaders should be full-time volunteers with a college diploma or some college experience. Preference will be given to volunteers, especially team leaders, with experience or interest in education, public safety, public health, recreation, physical education, marketing, public relations, journalism, or media relations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eligible applicants will be required to demonstrate, through a letter of cooperation, the support of the traffic division of the local law enforcement agency for the implementation of the planned program. Additional support organizations might include: Highway safety agencies, emergency medical services units, motor vehicle administration, educational institutions, public health officials, and private industry representatives. The applicant shall also provide both the preliminary community assessment and the educational activity plan as part of the application. The program shall incorporate evaluation measurements to determine the level of success of the program activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.6.2&blank;Goals and Priorities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program addresses the following national service priorities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Human Needs._Motor vehicle crashes cost the nation nearly $14 billion in health care expenditures each year. With each serious injury prevented saving approximately $35,000 in health care costs, as much as $1 billion could be saved nationally through the prevention of traffic deaths and injuries. U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pe&ntilde;a has called for stepped-up national efforts to reduce the proportion of alcohol involved traffic crashes to 43 percent and increase safety belt use to 75 percent by 1997 as part of President Clinton's health care initiative and year 2000 objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Education._Traffic safety education for children and youth ages 3 through 13 (prekindergarten through grade 8) aims to increase school readiness and further early childhood development. Before children are able to learn in school, they must be able to arrive at school safely each day. With traffic incidents as the leading cause of death and disability for school age children, they face a risk every day in their transport to and from school and other activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Public Safety._Through better education and peer mentoring, traffic-related crimes can be reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.6.3&blank;Anticipated Outcomes and Results <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Young adult volunteers as mentors can make a constructive contribution to a national and community traffic safety problem while gaining practical learning experiences. The objective of these efforts is to improve the quality of life for young citizens by raising public awareness, reducing the severity and frequency of traffic safety problems, and providing highway safety experiences which could lead to related future career field choices. This program will allow volunteers to work cooperatively with law enforcement and other organizations within a designated community developing a positive, visible, outcome-oriented relationship to decrease death and injury due to motor vehicle crashes. The educational program will expose young children to appropriate behaviors which can become habits they will model to others and will practice to help keep themselves and others safe now and in the future. If the program proves beneficial to the community and agency, future expansion of a refined program with an increased number of participants may be explored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.6.4&blank;Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Funding available from DOT for program development, implementation, and administration is $50,000. Application will be made to the National Service Corporation for any additional program costs, living allowance, education awards, health insurance, and child care costs as appropriate for participating volunteers. It is anticipated that direct funding of the Youth Traffic Safety Education Programs may be available from DOT in future years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.2.5&blank;DOT Agency Involvement and Expertise Available <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA will act as the project monitor working directly with the grantee to develop and implement a traffic safety training program through the local law enforcement department and facilitate additional state and community contacts with other organizations interested in and working on similar efforts. NHTSA may also provide access to additional materials, training, technical assistance, and data as appropriate. In addition to its headquarters staff, NHTSA has ten regional offices that work directly with the states to implement highway safety programs to reduce motor vehicle crashes including related fatalities, injuries, and economic loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.2.6&blank;DOT Contact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Ms. Susan Gorcowski, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of Occupant Protection, 400 7th Street, SW., NTS&hyph;11, Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;2712/FAX (202) 366&hyph;2766. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Jobs: To boldly go beyond perceived limitations - Lucy Kellaway on a communications course which has made strong men weep but merely left her blinking INSIDE each of us is a good communicator. No matter know inept, gauche, bumbling or autocratic we are, we could become user-friendly managers with a little guidance and a bit of effort. It is an attractive view, one that is being peddled by a new breed of consultants specialising in communications courses. Communication, they say, matters more than ever. In the old days, everyone was told what to do and expected to get on with it. But now that corporate hierarchies have been abandoned and workers empowered, it is essential that people get along with each other. But do these courses work? Can we really emerge from them more personable and persuasive than when we went in? To find out, I joined an intensive session designed for a female executive at BZW by Harley Young Associates, which specialises in corporate cultural development. HYA's communications course, run by ex-actor Philip Hynd, has attracted some startling testimonials. One manager, on returning to his office after the seminar, surprised the receptionist by remarking on the fine bunch of flowers on her desk. It was not just that he had learnt the art of small talk: he had never noticed the flowers before. Peter Horne of Apricot, for which HYA carried out a whole programme of cultural change, not only softened his manner but even shaved off his moustache. Grown men, unused to confronting their emotions, had been known to break down and weep during the HYA course. One manager felt that he had been peeled apart like an onion into different layers, and requested an extra day's training in order to be put back together again. The course literature promised to make us understand the effect we have on others, go beyond our perceived limitations, and to question our habitual reactions. It pledged to 'unlock and direct human energy', translating it into achievement. The first step was a questionnaire, sent out in advance, in which we had to rate our skills at such things as 'being authentic', 'being appropriate' and 'building rapport', and then list the personal and professional cycles of behaviour patterns that we most wanted to change. The training day, held at BZW's London office, started with each of us reading out the questionnaires. 'It is not clear what 'being authentic' means', I began. This was wrong. According to Hynd, our 'facilitator', good communicators do not say things that are subjective as though they were objective truths. They always say 'I think' or 'I feel' unless stating a fact, and certainly never say 'you' or 'one', when they could say 'I' or 'me'. The BZW woman groaned at the video camera, which was stealthily recording as we spoke. Apparently, her reaction was telling. The facilitator said it was typical of a deep insecurity inside us all. Even the most senior managers have a sense that they are not good enough, and to avoid being found out take on defensive patterns of behaviour. If these 'work' they are repeated so often they become subconscious. To break the mould, we were asked to dig into our earliest memories and recall times when we were reprimanded unfairly, and then re-experience how we felt about it. From these tales of classroom misdemeanors, significant patterns started to emerge. We were told that the way people react to early traumas divides them into two camps: some deal with their own feelings of inadequacy by seeking approval, while others control their own emotions and the people around them. It turned out that my formative experiences in the playground and at my mother's knee had made me a controlling person. The fact that fellow controllers are Robert Maxwell and Lady Thatcher did not make me feel any better about it. Control people have all the answers, never show their feelings, are dogmatic and arrogant, will not argue unless they can win, and withdraw rather than lose face. Approval seekers - a category shared by my coursemate as well as John Major and Richard Branson - turned out to be not much better. The tell-tale signs are constant smiling, and an earnest, sycophantic manner. Approval seekers are pushovers, and may seem to be behaving in a kindly way but always have a hidden agenda. The point of this exercise was to make us aware of the tricks we play, and thus give us the choice of whether to go on playing them. The problem is that if you do not (as I did not) accept the diagnosis, it is harder to change your ways. The facilitator seemed quite unmoved by my dissent; he said failure to recognise controlling tendencies was a classic characteristic of control people. He then asked us to think of an event in the next week in which we would have behaved in our bad old ways, and then choose a different course of action that might run against the grain, but be more likely to get results. Then we had to choose each other as mentor to talk through the event both before and after. More than a week has gone by. My BZW partner has not called on my help to get her through her meeting with a bully at which she planned to be more assertive. I have not called on her either. It is all very well letting your hair down during a course, but telephoning someone you don't know days later for their advice on how to behave is asking too much. The next stage was about energy. We all (control freaks and sycophants both) spend too much time suppressing our real feelings, and the act of suppressing is as strong and exhausting as the feeling itself. So how do you channel unwanted feelings into wanted ones? The first step is easy: you breathe. We sat there taking deep breaths and trying to become more aware of how we were feeling then (which in my case was faintly irritated). A few large lungfulls of air, and I was feeling much the same. The other techniques were not practical to sample then and there, but we were given the following useful tips. Spend more time with people who have lots of energy. Take a walk around the office. Tidy up. Tie up loose ends in both tasks and relationships. Break a habit, do something differently. Keep agreements; tell the truth. When unexpressed feelings are trapped within us, the message is likely to reveal itself subconsciously through our bodies. We are likely to reveal our thoughts by the way we wiggle our feet even if the words coming out of our mouths are perfectly neutral. To get acquainted with our own body language, each of us had to repeat phrases like 'You are really covert in your communication' and 'Would you book me a ticket by credit card?' and then watch the result on video. Our facilitator thought that my eye contact was a bit too much: I should blink more often. He said that my way of pulling my chin back and holding my head on one side seemed to be saying 'You are stupid and you better sort it out'. These home truths would have been easier to dismiss were it not for the sensible nature of the advice he was giving to my course mate. Her habit of going into a fake cockney voice was much better discarded, as was her frequent raising of eyebrows. We went over the same phrases again for the video's benefit, this time without our habitual gestures. I could see that my course mate looked better eyebrows down. She assured me that my self-conscious blinks and thrusting chin were also an improvement. The problem was how to stay that way: once the training day was over it was all too easy to slip back. If you go along to a communications course out of curiosity (as I did) or because your employer wishes it, you are likely to emerge unscathed. For the first day or two afterwards I blinked when I remembered to. I now do not even do that. Rereading this article, I notice it is riddled with illicit use of the third person, but do not feel inclined to go back and alter it. Perhaps that is just what one would expect from a closet control person.</p>

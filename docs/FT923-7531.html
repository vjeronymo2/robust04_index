			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Shaken to the core: Du Pont, America's biggest chemicals group, is in the process of a radical restructuring It is not just Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries that is attempting to reinvent itself. Recession and the increasingly competitive environment in the world chemicals industry has also caused Du Pont, the biggest US chemicals group, to embark upon the most radical restructuring plan in its 190-year history. The plan, which involves slashing costs, concentrating on core divisions, expanding European and Asian revenues and disposing of non-core assets, will determine whether Du Pont can stay among the leaders of the international chemicals industry during the 1990s. As the eighth-largest of the Fortune 500 companies in the US, with an annual turnover of nearly Dollars 40bn, the restructuring is also a measure of how well US industry is adjusting to the international economic slowdown. The chemicals sector has been hit hard by recession, both in the US and elsewhere. Profit margins have been squeezed by weak demand, while companies are struggling under a burden of overcapacity and excessive costs. In the US, Du Pont has been badly affected by falling demand from industrial customers, especially in the auto and housing industries. The common problems facing international chemicals groups have, however, elicited different responses. In the UK, ICI has announced plans to split off its pharmaceuticals businesses and is engaged in a programme of cost cutting. Similarly, Union Carbide of the US last December set in motion plans to spin off its industrial gases business and create a free-standing company called Praxair. Monsanto, also of the US, raised Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 670m) last month by selling its Fisher Controls valves division, which it viewed as a non-core business. Du Pont's strategy has been developed by Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman and chief executive since 1989. lt aims to reduce fixed costs by Dollars 3bn, or 30 per cent of the total, by 1996, across its principal divisions - chemicals, fibres, polymers and energy (a division which is dominated by Conoco, the oil company). The total workforce of 130,000 is likely to be reduced by almost 12 per cent. To achieve these goals, Du Pont has already announced plans to cut Dollars 1bn of overheads from the chemicals businesses by 1994, resulting in the loss of 8,300 full-time staff and 3,200 outside contract workers. A separate plan, announced in December 1991, involves cutting a further Dollars 2bn of operating costs across the company, with the estimated elimination of another 7,000 jobs. Measures to achieve the two other principal prongs of Du Pont's restructuring policy - geographical expansion and a concentration on core businesses - are also being pursued. Internationally, Du Pont is seeking to almost treble its non-energy European revenues to Dollars 15bn by the end of the decade, according to Mr David Williamson, president of European operations. Mr Woolard acknowledges this is likely to mean 'one or more big acquisitions' in Europe during the 1990s. But he declines to comment on the state of Du Pont's talks with Rhone-Poulenc of France, which have been under way for a year and concern a possible venture in titanium dioxide pigments, used for making dyes. Several steps have already been taken to expand the group's international presence. In Asia, Du Pont is investing Dollars 240m in a new Taiwan pigments plant, taking the competition into the home market of new and lower cost producers. In April this year the group announced it would swap most of its remaining acrylics business for the European nylon holdings of ICI. This would make Du Pont one of the big players in the European fibres business - so big that the European Commission is still examining the implications. The group has also implemented plans to dispose of non-strategic businesses and increase its concentration on core activities. The most significant moves include: A May 1992 decision to invest Dollars 1.5bn over the next 10 years to modernise US nylon production facilities. An investment of Dollars 300m in modernising its US polyester plants, partly in response to a challenge from Nan Ya, a Taiwan-based company that is building a polyester plant in South Carolina. An April 1992 decision to sell the connectors business by the end of the year. This makes components for the computer industry, and has annual sales of Dollars 450m and 3,000 employees. The establishment, in January 1991, of a joint venture between its pharmaceuticals business and Merck, the biggest US drugs company, to form Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical. Du Pont believed its pharmaceuticals business, which had a turnover of about Dollars 500m, was too small and too costly to operate on its own. The sale in April 1991, for Dollars 1bn, of half of Du Pont's coal business to Rheinbraun of Germany. More change is in the pipeline. Wall Street observers say it is likely that Du Pont will eventually sell all or part of its imaging division, which makes film, printing and reproduction equipment. This division, which includes electronic imaging equipment and offset plate businesses, lost an estimated Dollars 40m last year on Dollars 1.25bn of turnover. Mr Woolard admits that the market for imaging equipment has 'absolutely deteriorated' and promises that those parts of the business which cannot be made profitable will be sold. In addition to the numerous disposals and cost cutting, the company's traditionally stolid management culture is also being shaken up. Executives admit in private that until quite recently there was much complacency, even lassitude, among the company's ranks. Mr Woolard himself acknowledges that customers were in the past treated in an arrogant manner and that Du Pont was perceived as a lumbering giant. As a result, the chairman and his colleagues have implemented a rigorous assessment of middle management, replacing and removing those believed to be underperforming. The results of Du Pont's far-reaching restructuring programme will take time to feed through. Even company insiders admit that trying to change course at Du Pont is like trying to alter the direction of a super-tanker. It can be done, but slowly. Yet Du Pont's latest figures for the first half of 1992 show an improvement in underlying profits, once extraordinary items have been accounted for. In fibres, chemicals and polymers (see accompanying chart) the company's revenues are up only slightly, but profits have benefited from cost cutting. The pharmaceuticals business has also enjoyed a turnround following the joint venture with Merck. Losses of Dollars 30m a year have been transformed into profits of a similar size. The Du Pont plan has been helped by the fact that during the 1980s it halved  -to about 20 per cent - the proportion of its non-energy turnover of Dollars 22.8bn derived from low-margin bulk chemicals products. The proportion of revenues from such highly competitive and price-driven bulk chemicals is much larger at Dow Chemical and Union Carbide. The response from Wall Street to Du Pont's restructuring has already been enthusiastic. Du Pont's share price on the Big Board has risen by more than 15 per cent since the start of the year, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 index gain of just 1.3 per cent. Mr John Garcia, a corporate finance executive at Wertheim Schroder, the New York investment bank, says Mr Woolard 'is doing a terrific job'. He praises the Du Pont chief for 'refocusing the corporate culture, forcing the company to be more market-driven, and tackling the cost structure'. Mr Jeff Cianci, a chemicals analyst at the New York investment firm of Bear Stearns, concurs: 'Du Pont historically wanted to be the biggest and the best and would spend the most to get there. They have now transformed themselves into a company that will get there by spending less and spending it more efficiently.' But difficulties lie ahead. The consensus among industry analysts is that the US chemicals business will see only modest growth over the next two or three years. 'The major problem,' says Mr Woolard, 'is that many of our large customers are struggling.' In addition, Conoco, the big oil and gas company which is a wholly-owned division of Du Pont, is suffering in line with the US energy industry as a whole. In the second quarter, profits fell by 65 per cent compared with the same period in 1991. This is a particular worry given that the division accounted for about 41 per cent of total group revenues of Dollars 38.7bn in 1991. Mr Woolard forcefully rejects the notion - favoured by many on Wall Street - that Conoco should be spun off. He believes that its strong cash flow is an important advantage. However, in an effort to trim costs the group plans to cut capital spending at Conoco by 20 per cent this year. In the current recessionary environment, such a focus on limiting costs and improving margins in core areas is likely to be Du Pont's strategy for the foreseeable future. Mr Woolard and his colleagues will be hoping that having set the course of reform, the direction will be maintained. As Mr Jeff Cianci of Bear Stearns, concludes: 'It takes enormous effort to wake up the dinosaur and change its habits, but once you start the dinosaur moving there is nothing that can stop him.'</p>

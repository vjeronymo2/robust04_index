			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY'S PLAN FOR SHOPPING CENTER ADVANCES  </P> <P> Despite objections by some neighbors, the newly built Beverly Connection  shopping center should be rezoned as entirely commercial, a Los Angeles zoning  official has ruled.  </P> <P> The ruling supports a proposal by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky to rezone a  part of the shopping center site that is now zoned for residential use,  provided that restrictions are imposed on further development there.  </P> <P> "This action will not bring about any more commercial floor space or uses other  than those that are already there," said Dick Takase, the city planner who  issued the ruling Thursday after holding a public hearing in August. "It merely  recognizes the existing development."  </P> <P> Some community leaders argued, however, that the neighborhood is already  overburdened by development and severe traffic congestion, and some have  accused Yaroslavsky of caving in to commercial interests.  </P> <P> "This is a sweetheart deal for the developer," said Laura Lake, a longtime  activist in Westside development issues who unsuccessfully challenged  Yaroslavsky in last April's election. "This city is job-rich and housing-poor.  You don't give up residentially zoned property to make it commercial."  </P> <P> The nearly completed Beverly Connection shopping center lies on 8.3 acres of  land directly across La Cienega Boulevard from the Beverly Center shopping  mall. The Beverly Connection has a supermarket, a music store and a sporting  goods store. The developer also plans to build a six-screen, 2,100-seat movie  complex and two restaurants.  </P> <P> The dispute involves a 5 1/2-acre portion of the shopping center property that  is zoned for residential use but has been used mostly as a parking lot under a  43-year-old variance.  </P> <P> Under the ruling, the entire parcel would be reclassified as commercial, and  the development would be restricted to its existing size, about 291,000 square  feet.  </P> <P> Lake and other critics spoke out against the plan at last month's public  hearing, and Lake vowed to continue the fight when the issue goes before the  Planning Commission and the City Council.  </P> <P> Lake said an adjacent parcel, a 70,000-square-foot office and retail complex at  3rd Street and La Cienega, is also covered by the zoning proposal, and that if  this is added, the size of the development is really 360,000 square feet.  </P> <P> If the property zoned as residential is not included, she argued, the developer  would be restricted to 250,000 square feet by Proposition U, the slow-growth  measure adopted by Los Angeles voters in 1987.  </P> <P> "What it amounts to is a windfall for the developer," Lake said. "And if the  property is destroyed or leveled by an earthquake or fire, it would be like  starting with a fresh slate -- nothing to force him to build residential  units."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky was unavailable to comment on the ruling, but he has previously  said that the purpose of his rezoning proposal was not to increase development  but to limit it to what exists there today.  </P> <P> Howard Katz, a spokesman for Beverly Connection developer Avi Lerner, said the  restrictions do not give the owner the windfall that Lake and other critics  claim.  </P> <P> Katz also denounced as ridiculous the suggestion by Lake and others that  Yaroslavsky gave Beverly Connection a sweetheart deal because Katz's wife,  Alisa, is Yaroslavsky's chief deputy.  </P> <P> Harold R. Hahn, president of the Burton Way Homeowners Assn., said he was  deeply disturbed by the zoning ruling.  </P> <P> In addition to being across the street from the 900,000-square-foot Beverly  Center, the Beverly Connection is less than a mile from two proposed  developments of more than 1 million square feet each -- at the Farmers Market  at 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue, and the May Co. site at Fairfax and Wilshire  Boulevard.  </P> <P> City Planner Takase said it would be useless to request an environmental impact  report because most of the buildings are built. "That would be like requesting  a building permit after the construction is completed," he said.  </P> <P> Takase said a proposal to restrict the size of stores was rejected after city  traffic engineers found that smaller stores generate more traffic than larger  ones.  </P> <P> "A 50,000-square-foot store generates less traffic than five 10,000-square-foot  stores," he said. "That kind of restriction would be self-defeating."  </P> <P> Takase said his report recommended that half the space in the adjacent  70,000-square-foot building at La Cienega and 3rd be reserved for office space.  All buildings in the block bounded by La Cienega and Beverly boulevards, 3rd  Street and Croft Avenue are limited to 45 feet in height.  </P></p>

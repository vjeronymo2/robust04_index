			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 17, 1991, the Department issued Program Opportunity Notice Number DE&hyph;PS01&hyph;91FE62271 for Clean Coal Technology IV, soliciting proposals to conduct cost-shared projects to demonstrate innovative, energy-efficient, and economically competitive clean coal technologies. The Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project was one of the nine projects selected from among the 33 proposals received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Environmental Impact Statement Preparation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021). In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Department determined that providing cost-shared funding for the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project constitutes a major Federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Department has prepared a Draft Statement to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action on the human and natural environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A notice of intent (notice) to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement and hold public scoping meetings in Nixon, Fernley, and Reno, Nevada, was published by the Department in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 30, 1992 (57 FR 29067). The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the Environmental Impact Statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited public participation in the National Environmental Policy Act process. Overall, 60 scoping comments were received that assisted in identifying major issues for subsequent in-depth analysis in the Draft Statement. As a result of the scoping process, an Environmental Impact Statement Implementation Plan was developed to define the scope and provide further guidance for preparing the Environmental Impact Statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft Statement considers the proposed action and the no-action alternative, which includes a scenario that reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to atmospheric resources, surface water, groundwater, biological resources (including threatened and endangered species), and socioeconomic resources (including environmental justice) from construction and operation of the proposed Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project have been analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed construction and operation of the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project at the proposed site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Floodplains Notification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR part 1022), the Department hereby provides notice that a new primary electric switchyard proposed as one component of the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Project would be constructed and operated in the 100-year floodplain as depicted on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Insurance Rate Map (Panel Number 320033 0020B). Because of its proposed location in the 100-year floodplain, this switchyard could potentially impede the flow of floodwaters. However, there is neither vegetation present in the affected area nor wetlands or ecologically sensitive areas that would be involved. The electric switchyard, required to provide an electrical connection between the Pi&ntilde;on Pine Power Plant and Sierra Pacific Power Company's existing electrical system, would be approximately 75 square feet in size. The switchyard would be sited adjacent to and would expand the existing switchyard for the Tracy Station Plant. The switchyard would directly impact the floodplain because of site grading and filling and the permanent placement of switchyard equipment within the 100-year floodplain. However, impacts to the 100-year floodplain such as flood storage, flood-flow conveyance, and wildlife habitat are expected to be minimal due to the limited size and open structure of the switchyard. The potential environmental impacts of site selection on the floodplain area are discussed in chapters 4 and 9 of the Draft Statement. Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action on floodplains may be submitted to the Department in accordance with the procedures described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Draft Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the Draft Statement are being distributed to organizations, environmental groups, and individuals known to be interested in or affected by the proposed project.

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: A picaresque romp - Fiction THE FOURTEEN SISTERS OF EMILIO MONTEZ O'BRIEN by Oscar Hijuelos Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 484 pages THE Pulitzer Prize jury got it right with Hijuelos's last novel; The Mambo Kings Sing Songs Of Love appeared in 1989 and established itself as one of the most sheerly enjoyable and skilful fictions of recent years. Its exuberant romp through the life of an irrepressible musician was as much celebration as invention: the New York world created by Hijuelos trembled on the edge of fantasy, yet the magical elements were held in check by the punctilious attention to detail and the richly lyrical force that ran through the Mambo King's life and music. The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is obviously the product of the same generous imagination. The prose is always potent and alive, ever alert to the physical image, the earthy description. To the Cuban-American background in Mambo Kings is now added a dash of Irish blood: the 14 sisters and their single brother are the progeny of an Irish father, Nelson O'Brien of Cobbleton, Pennsylvania, photographer and owner of the Jewel Box Movie Theater, and Cuban immigrant mother Mariela Montez. The unstoppable stream of daughters creates its own diaspora: the eldest Margarita makes a loveless but sexually demanding marriage, Carmen and Marta sell tickets at Disneyland, Violeta marries a Presbyterian minister, Gloria works in Macy's; all of them continue to dote upon their baby brother Emilio. Though always vivid and engaging, the scheme is more ambitious but finally not as convincing as Mambo Kings. It lacks the central thread, the single larger-than-life character whose exploits can consistently thrill and repel the reader in equal measure; it is much more picaresque, yet less consistently entertaining. There is no single exotically dangerous world to explore, just a snapshot sequence of more than a dozen very different lives, some of them mundane, others glossy, glamorous. The strands of Fourteen Sisters are bound together by the family background; Hijuelos weaves his narrative texture out of that bundle of parallel lifelines, sometimes making them converge, elsewhere allowing to plunge off in solitary splendour. Emilio finds his way to 1950s Hollywood and carves out a career as a B-movie star, until his penchant for teenage girls catches up with him. What always anchors him to his home back East is his sisters, and their teasing mixture of familial love and incestuous desire. Emilio's story occupies a good third of the story - the perspective is consistently a male one, the close descriptions of his sisters and each women he meets lubriciously exact. He is not, though, the book's hero. If there is one, it is surely Margarita, whose old age provides a moving coda as effective and resonant as anything in the closing pages of Mambo Kings. Hijuelos's knack of balancing sentiment and truthful emotion, voyeurism and hard-edged description gives his fiction its tang; he is a strong, striking voice, even if this is not his best book.</p>

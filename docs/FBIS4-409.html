			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   Political Position of Zulu Monarchy Viewed -- "The failure  of  the ANC and NP [National Party] this week to persuade King  Goodwill Zwelithini to withdraw his support for the Inkatha  Freedom Party's [IFP] boycott tactics may well count as one of  our country's defining moments," begins a page-26 editorial in  the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 10 April. "The  implications for peace or continuing war are enormous."  Although the king on Friday rejected the proposal of having a  constitutional monarchy entrenched, the editorial urges the king  and his advisers to "carefully consider the implications." "The  institution of the Zulu monarchy has survived war, invasion,  plague and natural disaster," "yet now the king, the  institution, is deeply locked in politics, caught in a violent  war of position between the ANC and Inkatha." The editorial  continues by admitting that "the IFP's decision not to take part  in the election is legitimate and democratic. Its steadfast  defence of federal powers -- long after the National Party had  capitulated in a welter of nudges, back-channel deals and  obfuscatory rhetoric -- is to its eternal credit. But that is  not the point. Inkatha's opposition to the election now verges  on the seditious -- a campaign to destabilise the election and  to deny citizens their fundamental right to vote. Unimaginable  violence looms."  <H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>   Transition Urged on After Failed Leaders' Summit -- "We  believe that after the failure of this summit where the ANC  presented an extraordinary package to address the king's  so-called concerns, to no avail, the ANC, the NP and the South  African society as a whole have finally discovered that  Buthelezi will never be satisfied," states the Johannesburg  SUNDAY NATION in English on 10 April in a page-6 editorial.  "Therefore -- no matter how radical it sounds -- the only  reasonable thing to do is to ignore Buthelezi and move ahead  with the transition process. It is also a shame King Goodwill  Zwelithini has not yet discovered that Buthelezi is geared to  make him lose something for nothing." In conclusion the SUNDAY  NATION writes that "we hope that the three remaining weeks  before the adoption of the new constitution will be enough for  the king to see the light and take a more realistic approach if  he really cares about the well-being of his people and the Natal  province as a whole."  <H8>  RAPPORT </H8>   Kruger Park Leaders' Summit -- "A mountain gives birth to a  mole hill" is how a page-18 editorial in the Johannesburg  RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 10 April dubs the unsuccessful leaders'  summit meeting at Skukuza on Friday night. "In spite of healthy  skepticism from those watching the complicated political  process, there had been great expectations in the South African  public that the summit between the government, the ANC, the IFP,  and the Zulu king would send out a positive message. Correctly  or incorrectly, these expectations had been built up like the  proverbial mountain. The one that gave birth to a mole hill."  "Expectations have been cherished and built up -- but  disappointment and dissatisfaction have followed with regular  monotony." At the Skukuza summit, the ANC reiterated its  standpoint: postponing the election was out of the question.  "And indeed the postponement of the election date was the one  item high on the IFP's agenda." Furthermore, nothing has come  from the proposed international mediation which had earlier  built a "glimpse of hope." "At this late stage, RAPPORT is  appealing to all political leaders to seek with renewed  enthusiasm an all-inclusive solution," while the "thinking"  South African public appeals for "room in which all views will  be considered."</p>

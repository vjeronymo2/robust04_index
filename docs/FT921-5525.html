			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Germans dig in for pay round: IG Metall and the employers are resolute FRANZ Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, Germany's most powerful trade union, says he is used to the sound of employers banging the drum in the overture to wage talks. But squeaking pips have added a shriller note to the orchestration this year. The tally of redundancies, falling orders, passed dividends and looming losses in the engineering sector has grown in the past few weeks almost as quickly as the mountain of pay-round propaganda. Mr Steinkuhler's hardened ear detects an unusual harmony: 'We have never before seen the employers putting up such a solid, radical front,' he says. That solidarity will be put to its first test tomorrow at the launch of this year's rolling round of pay negotiations in Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg. Over the next three weeks IG Metall negotiators, armed with a 9.5 per cent general claim for 4m mechanical and electrical engineering workers, and officials of Gesamtmetall, the leading employers' association, will join the process. Positions on the simple issues - pay and inflation  - have already been marked out. With consumer prices expected to rise by 4.5 per cent this year, the employers will probably settle for anything less than 6 per cent and the union for anything above it. For IG Metall, a 6 per cent deal would be a signal victory in what is to become a battle over principles. Mr Steinkuhler and his lieutenants present themselves as front-line defenders against industrialists, economists, politicians and central bankers allegedly conspiring to impose an average national 5.5 per cent pay rise. Their aim, IG Metall says, is to weaken the unions and, more ominously, to dismantle the internationally admired social contract between workers and employers. By inference, workers' rights in co-determination, shorter working hours, and all the 'extras' which, according to the IW economics institute in Hamburg, make up 47 per cent of an industrial worker's pay, could be at risk. Protecting the country's renowned 'social' economy from transformation into a pure market economy is a principle worth striking for, according to Mr Steinkuhler. Increasing pay will raise purchasing power and give the economy a necessary lift. More importantly, he says, it will compensate wage earners for the unfair burdens of tax and duty surcharges they have had to pay to help integrate east Germany into the federal family. Things seem simpler from the companies' side: industry simply cannot afford big pay awards in the west while investing in the east, they say. Gesamtmetall wants an immediate change in the direction of pay policy and restoration of the country's fabled pay stability and labour market peace. Hourly wage costs, which increased by an average 4 per cent a year between 1982 and 1989, jumped 7 per cent in 1990 and 8.2 per cent last year. They have far outstripped compensatory productivity growth and manufacturers' ability to pass on increased costs to dwindling customers in export and domestic markets. In the short-term, engineering is shedding jobs. In the last half of 1991, when demand in east Germany tailed off and orders failed to materialise in recession-hit export markets, 20,000 engineers lost their jobs and a further 100,000 went on short-time. In the longer term, all industry seems to agree, Standort Deutschland - Germany as a site for investment - will lose its attraction; the 'Made in Germany' label will be too expensive, and worse will follow. IG Metall dismisses the Standort Deutschland argument as a dangerous sham, tantamount to sawing off the branch on which the German economy depends. According to Mr Fritz-Heinrich Himmelreich, managing director of the all-industry employers' association, BDA, the small and medium-sized companies which feed the core of German industrial giants with components are finding it an increasingly uncomfortable perch. This sector, the Mittelstand is in rebellion, he says. As well as having to face steeply rising wages bills, the companies are confronted by demands from their customers, who are trying to retain competitiveness by demanding lower prices or threatening to seek cheaper production bases elsewhere. East Germany, where unions demand that pay should increase to full western levels by the end of 1994, offers no alternative. Another result is that they are more resolute than in the past two years in their stand against IG Metall. Mittelstand companies, each employing up to 250 people, represent 70 per cent of Gesamtmetall's membership and employ a total of 1.8m workers. Summing up, Mr Steinkuhler claims that 'the phase of relative social peace seems to be coming to an end'. Following unification in October 1990, Germany was too busy having a party and pouring products into the former GDR to notice that there was nothing coming back except bills for social welfare benefits for 16m new west Germans. The seeds of the threatening storm were sown when the east's former communist bloc markets disappeared with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Now, as Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, leader of Gesamtmetall, told Mr Steinkuhler last week: 'We are all standing in the rain together.'</p>

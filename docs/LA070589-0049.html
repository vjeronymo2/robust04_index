			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MARSH RACES OUT TO EARLY LEAD, WINS CORONADO HALF-MARATHON  </P> <P> Sleepy-eyed Jerry Marsh wasn't really thinking about winning his second  Coronado half-marathon at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. He thought staying close to the  leaders might be difficult enough to accomplish in weather he described as "too  hot."  </P> <P> But after surveying the field, Marsh realized early that he might have to  re-evaluate his thinking.  </P> <P> "It was not a stellar field," said Marsh, comparing the competition to other  years when the half-marathon has been used as training for the Olympic Trials.  </P> <P> Marsh, a former San Diegan who now lives in Los Angeles, set his own pace and  cruised to a 10-second victory over runner-up Marshall Varano of San Diego in  the 16th Coronado half-marathon.  </P> <P> "Nobody went out and took me out early and when I saw the field, it helped my  confidence," said Marsh, 25, who has been running the July 4 half-marathon  since he was 12.  </P> <P> Linda Cash of Denver won the women's race in 1 hour 24 minutes 12 seconds and  Dan Larson was first among wheelchair participants in 1:10:52.  </P> <P> Marsh's time of 1:10:50 was more than three minutes slower than the winning  time last year and six seconds slower than the 1:04 he ran in 1987 when he won  the race.  </P> <P> "I couldn't do a 1:04 today," he said. "What I did was what I was worth. I  think the heat had a lot to do with that."  </P> <P> The distance may have played a part too. Marsh and four other runners ran an  extra 200 to 400 meters because they were misdirected while running on the  naval base.  </P> <P> Varano, whose previous best was an 11th-place finish in '87, also said he had  no designs on winning the race, but suddenly found himself close to the  front-runners because of a slower-than-usual pace.  </P> <P> "In the old days, I couldn't have been anywhere close to up there," said  Varano, 25. "This time I went out easy and stayed within range. You get down  when you don't see anybody in front of you. But that didn't happen today."  </P> <P> Steve Flynn finished nine seconds behind Varano in third place.  </P> <P> And while the blazing sun and humidity may have bothered many of the runners,  Cash seemed to be unaffected.  </P> <P> "I never felt like I was working very hard," said Cash, a veteran of hilly  Colorado half-marathons and 10Ks. "If you come down from the altitude, it makes  it a lot easier." Cash said her victory was special for a couple of reasons.  </P> <P> "I'm here for a reunion and I didn't know what to expect from the competition  down here," she said. "It was nice because I turn 40 in two weeks and winning a  race on the 4th of July is kind of special."  </P> <P> About 2,500 competed in the half-marathon.  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Worries over Yeltsin's health as keynote speech is put off The health and ability to govern of Russian president Boris Yeltsin have emerged again as an issue of serious concern in Moscow. He has postponed his 'state of the nation' address due on Friday because of what officials yesterday described as a continuing 'bad cold'. Mr Anatoly Krasikov, a press spokesmen, said it was obvious Mr Yeltsin was unwell and this 'could be seen on TV' during a press conference with Mr John Major, visiting British prime minister, in the Kremlin yesterday. Mr Yeltsin, who made no opening speech, which he normally does, stood for about 20 minutes without support, but walked hesitantly and looked tired. It was the president's first public appearance for two weeks, and the first time he had answered journalists' questions since before Christmas. The postponement of what has been billed as a crucial speech that will define the Russian government's policy guidelines is the latest in a list of incidents which are causing concern to foreign diplomats in Moscow and to Russian observers. Among recent examples of Mr Yeltsin's non-availability were: A telephone call from President Bill Clinton to Mr Yeltsin could not be received for three days for what were called 'technical reasons'. The Russian authorities insisted Mr Yeltsin had waited for the call 'as long as decency allowed', but that it had not come through. Mr James Collins, a US special ambassador to the former Soviet states, attempted to talk to Mr Yeltsin and other senior Russian officials on the Bosnian question last week. However, a Moscow newspaper report said Mr Collins only met low-ranking diplomats. Dr Gert Haller, state secretary at the German finance ministry and the country's 'sherpa' who prepares the ground for meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, was also refused a meeting with Mr Yeltsin recently, after having been told several times that he would see the Russian president. Diplomats from several countries say attempts to pass high-level messages to Mr Yeltsin from their heads of state or governments are often met with the response that he is unavailable. The Russian Information Agency, quoting presidential sources, said last night the state of the nation address had been postponed until February 24. RIA's sources gave the formal reason for the delay not as illness but the 'lack of preparedness of the Marble Hall in the Kremlin'. Philip Stephens in Moscow adds: Mr Major said last night it was clear Mr Yeltsin was suffering from a bad chest cold. But the prime minister said he was not aware his host was suffering from any more serious ailment.</p>

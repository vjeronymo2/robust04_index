			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> &bull;A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points for substantial error in the fiscal year 1993 market basket forecast; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An adjustment of zero percentage points for scientific and technological advances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When PPS was established, it was clear that prospective payment based on DRGs could not be applied universally and that certain providers would need to be excluded. At this time, five types of specialty hospitals (psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term, children's, and cancer) and two types of distinct-part units in general hospitals (psychiatric and rehabilitation) are exempt from PPS. These providers are excluded primarily because DRGs fail to accurately predict the resource costs for the patients they treat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PPS-excluded hospitals and distinct-part units are subject to the payment limitations and incentives established in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). Each provider is paid on the basis of its current Medicare-allowable inpatient operating costs per discharge, or a target amount. The target amount is based on the provider's allowable costs per discharge in a base year, trended to the current year by an annual update factor. Medicare's share of allowable capital costs is paid in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under TEFRA, a facility with inpatient operating costs per discharge that are less than its target rate receives its costs plus either 50 percent of the difference between its cost per discharge and the target or 5 percent of the target amount, whichever is less. A facility with inpatient operating costs per discharge above its target rate receives the target amount plus half the difference between that amount and its cost per discharge, but no more than 110 percent of the target. Further, the Secretary is required to provide for an adjustment to a facility's payment when events beyond the facility's control distort its cost increase for a cost reporting period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Congress legislates the update to the TEFRA target amounts, ProPAC and the Secretary of Health and Human Services are required to recommend an annual update factor. For fiscal years 1994 through 1997, each facility will receive an update ranging from the projected increase in the market basket to the market basket increase minus 1.0 percentage points. The Commission recommends an average update to the target rate equal to the market basket increase minus 1.0 percentage points for fiscal year 1995 (see Table 2&hyph;4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Market Basket_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The update recommendation is determined primarily by the projected increase in the PPS-excluded market basket index, which measures the price of inputs used by these facilities in treating Medicare patients. The current HCFA market basket increase forecast for fiscal year 1995 is 3.7 percent. There is no difference between the HCFA and ProPAC market basket forecasts for 1995, so no adjustment to reflect this difference is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forecast Error Correction._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC believes the update should be corrected for substantial past market basket forecast errors. Because projections must rely on available data, they cannot accurately anticipate all future economic conditions that may affect input prices. Updates based on market basket forecasts, therefore, may result in overpayments or underpayments to PPS-excluded facilities, which should not be carried forward to subsequent payment years. The market basket projection used to update TEFRA target amounts in fiscal year 1993 was 4.2 percent. The actual market basket increase, however, was only 3.2 percent. Therefore, ProPAC's update recommendation includes a ^1.0 percentage point adjustment for fiscal year 1993 market basket forecast error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2(0,,),p0,8/10,i1,s50,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 2&hyph;4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> ._Recommended Update Factor for PPS-Excluded Hospitals, Fiscal Year  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1995_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Components of the Update <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=2 --> Fiscal year 1995 HCFA PPS-excluded market basket forecast*  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjustment for difference between HCFA and ProPAC market baskets  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Correction for fiscal year 1993 forecast error  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ^1.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowance for scientific and technological advances  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=2 --> Total update  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.7 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> *Market basket forecast provided by the Health Care Financing Administration, Office of the Actuary, December 1993.

This allowance is intended to encourage providers to adopt quality-enhancing technologies, even when they increase costs. It reflects the Commission's judgment about the expected growth in the cost of providing inpatient services resulting from scientific and technological advances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To reach an informed judgment on the appropriate allowance, ProPAC examined emerging technologies used in PPS-excluded facilities to estimate their operating costs and predict their increased use in fiscal year 1995. (See Appendix A for a full discussion of ProPAC's methodology.) To be included in the estimate, a technology must be emerging (that is, diffused beyond minimal use but not fully diffused), quality-enhancing, and cost-increasing. The contractor identified two scientific advances that met these criteria: the drugs sertraline hydrochloride and ondanestron hydrochloride. The total increase in operating costs due to these advances is estimated to be $140,000, or 0.002 percent of Medicare payments to PPS-excluded facilities in fiscal year 1995. Therefore, the Commission is recommending no allowance for scientific and technological advances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike the update for PPS hospitals, the update for excluded facilities does not include a productivity adjustment. The productivity adjustment to the PPS update is based on the principle that Medicare should share in the savings generated by productivity improvements. However, Medicare automatically shares in the savings under TEFRA because part of any productivity increase is factored into reduced Medicare payments. ProPAC believes a further reduction in payments for gains in productivity is not appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Revising the Payment Method_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In October 1992, the Commission submitted an interim report on payment reform for PPS-excluded providers. The findings suggested that in aggregate, TEFRA payments to PPS-excluded facilities appeared adequate for most provider types. Notable exceptions were psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part units, and long-term hospitals. However, substantial variation in the proportion of facilities with costs exceeding their target rate was found across and within all provider types. Further, the Commission could not make definitive conclusions regarding the adequacy of the TEFRA payment system due to the lack of information on the amount of exceptions payments made to PPS-excluded providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specialty hospitals and distinct-part units were excluded from PPS primarily because the DRG patient classification system does not adequately group patients in these facilities according to resource use. However, considerable effort has been put into developing a patient classification system for rehabilitation hospitals and distinct-part units based on patient functional status. The Commission supports such efforts in hope that a prospective payment system for specialty facilities can be developed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although at this time prospective payment for these facilities is not feasible, modifications to the current TEFRA payment method may be possible. Each type of PPS-excluded provider has unique patient characteristics and cost experiences, yet for payment purposes all types are treated similarly. TEFRA does not recognize varying factors that affect costs, such as changes in case mix and treatment patterns, and all providers receive the same basic update to the target rate. A more complete understanding of the factors that differentiate these facilities may help to identify appropriate revisions to the current TEFRA payment system and update formula. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC encourages the Secretary to examine further the factors contributing to cost increases among these facilities. The Commission will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the TEFRA system for PPS-excluded providers, and will respond to the Secretary's proposal for payment reform when it becomes available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 14: Update to the Composite Rate for Dialysis Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fiscal year 1995 update recommendations for the composite rate for dialysis services accounts for the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

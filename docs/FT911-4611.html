			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Royal Opera reports Pounds 1.1m profit Covent Garden, which budgeted to make a loss of Pounds 1.9m in 1990-91, has produced a profit of Pounds 1.1m, writes Antony Thorncroft. As a result, its accumulated deficit is Pounds 1.7m, rather than the Pounds 4.7m it had originally forecast. The turnround has been achieved partly by attracting record audiences of 94 per cent of capacity, but mainly by selling one of its properties for a Pounds 1.6m profit. Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general manager, said that he hoped to clear most of the deficit in 1991-92.</p>

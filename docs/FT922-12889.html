			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Boise Cascade losses deepen BOISE CASCADE, the US forest products group, remained in the red during the first three months of 1992, reporting an after-tax loss of Dollars 42.9m. This compares with a Dollars 16.8m deficit in the same period a year earlier. Sales fell from Dollars 992.7m to Dollars 953m. Boise, based in Idaho, blamed 'severely depressed prices' for some of its key paper grades for the loss. It said that prices for most grades of pulp and paper were down on a year ago, while prices for its most important products fell 'substantially' from already-depressed fourth quarter levels. This latter category includes coated and uncoated business and printing papers and newsprint. Boise Cascade shares fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 5/8 .</p>

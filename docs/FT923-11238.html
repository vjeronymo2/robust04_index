			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: If you need a friend, lean on me - Henry Edmunds whittles a new collection of blackthorn sticks THROUGH AN accident, an old and treasured Irish blackthorn walking-stick came to a sad end a few years ago. I set out to buy a replacement but had no luck, in spite of a wide search. As the sloe or blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) is widely distributed in local hedges and thickets, I then decided that it would not be too difficult to find, cut, cure and trim a suitable piece growing in the wild to form another walking-stick, tailored exactly to fit my hand and length of leg. Winter was obviously the best time, for only then could one see potentially suitable pieces. However, I quickly ran into a prickly problem: while the textbooks I had read faithfully recorded the existence of thorns on the branches, they failed to mention their number, length or spear-like sharpness, which easily penetrated ordinary clothing. So very early experience indicated that protective clothing was a must, starting with a stiff pair of leather gloves, a thick oilskin coat and rubber boots. I began to understand why blackthorn sticks were so scarce, compared with hazel, which can be cut with relative ease. More often than not a good deal of preliminary clearing had to be done even to reach a likely-looking piece. This meant secateurs and a small handsaw to remove obstructing growth and, later, to trim the thorns once the stick had been cut. It soon became obvious that pieces of walking-stick potential were few and far between. On the other hand, lengths for shorter thumb-sticks were more numerous. Railway embankments turned out to be relatively good areas. This does not mean that sticks were plentiful, but an afternoon's search sometimes resulted in one or two lengths, of about 50 in, with thumb-stick potential. Other fruitful habitats were the overgrown gardens of derelict cottages, the result of rural depopulation. No difficulty existed on farmed land, especially in isolated thickets distant from the farmhouse. The specie prefers the company of its own kind and, if left undisturbed, eventually spreads to formidable dimensions. This was the kind of place that produced shapes best suited for walking-sticks of about 36 in length. Not only had the length and thickness of the stem to be of the right dimensions, but it also had to be growing off another branch - an angle of 90` provided the very best handgrip. As thumb and walking-sticks are derived from natural growth no two were ever exactly alike, for Nature abhors uniformity. Each required individual treatment in the seasoning process. Invariably, some degree of straightening was required, which was best done before the sap had dried out. Most pieces responded to knee pressure which, provided it was gently applied every two to three days over four to six weeks or so, removed most of the bends. If left longer than this, the stems cracked easily on surprisingly little pressure, especially stems for mature walking-sticks. During the drying out, all thorns were taken off. Blackthorn, properly seasoned after about six months, is an extremely tough wood, so any manicuring of the stems proved much easier in the early stages. They also needed some sandpapering to smooth any rough edges before the final treatment with three or four coats of clear varnish. Each took took about six months on-off work from start to finish. The choice of ferrule is a matter of individual taste. A metal one may look neat, but it eventually wears out and is difficult to replace. Personally I prefer a rubber piece, which gives a better road grip and is easily renewed. Over the last five or six years I cut about 30 or so pieces, leaving me with 15 walking sticks and around 15 thumb sticks. I did not really need the latter, most of which were sold to local gift shops for Pounds 5 or Pounds 6 each. The thumb-stick is best suited to the young and energetic walker who wants some help in covering stretches of rough country. It is for the hiker, the long-distance man who thinks of miles per hour. The walking-stick, on the other hand, is for those of mature age. It is a product of dense thickets, often showing the scars, sometimes very deep, of its fight just to survive. A glance at any stick will tell you immediately what sort of passage it has had through life; the phase of smooth uninterrupted growth as well as the friction inflicted by other vigorous stems in the upward drive for sunlight. There is an understanding and mutual respect between a man and his stick. Before long, it ceases to be a mere prop and becomes, instead, a true companion.</p>

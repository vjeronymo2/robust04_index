			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: The great share-price mystery - London One sometimes feels a certain sympathy with the elderly and bewildered Mirror Group Newspapers shareholder who at Thursday's annual meeting asked why it was that sometimes the share price went up and at other times it went down. The same question can be applied to the whole stockmarket. The past week has demonstrated the old paradox that 'good' economic news can be 'bad' stock market news. A string of statistics indicated that the economic recovery is strengthening. This has been taken to mean that inflation will surge again, the run of interest rate cuts is over and base rates will have to be up to choke off price increases. Thus, economic recovery is 'bad' news for share prices. But that ignores other figures which tended to show that inflation is not getting out of hand. Monday's producer prices numbers, which showed input prices still falling and output prices rising at their slowest rate since September 1992, added to the previous Friday's low inflation number, suggest that the threat of a resurgence of inflation is not a serious one. Even so, on Monday the Footsie fell 30.1 points, as US interest rates rose by a quarter of a percentage point. But London has perhaps been unduly influenced by Wall Street. The US authorities have to cope with rather more growth than the UK, with US industrial production up at an annual rate of 7.7 per cent in the first quarter. After another 10.2 point fall on the Footsie on Tuesday, the market fell sharply on Wednesday with the index dropping 29.7 points. That followed the release of average earnings figures showing a 3 1/2 per cent rise over the year to February, a number which is a little worrying. But there may be some truth in the official explanation that larger annual bonuses increased earnings and the figure should not be extrapola-ted. Another concern was the equally 'bad' news that 30,300 unemployed people found a job in March, cutting the percentage of the workforce unemployed to the lowest level since June 1992. By that logic, the stock market should be thrilled by the 1,000 job losses announced this week at London International Group, the 800 at Texas Instruments and the 450 at Babcock International. Yet more 'bad' news came in the shape of retail sales figures for March, on Thursday, which were 3.8 per cent up year-on-year compared to expectations of a 2.7 per cent rise. Although the revival in consumer spending has been a mainstay of the economic recovery, the assumption was that this month's tax rises would have already dampened spending in shops, which in turn would encourage an interest rate cut. While some stores shares managed to rise on the news, and Austin Reed which announced an excellent profit increase on the same day jumped 22 1/2 p to 199 1/2 p, the retail sales figure was taken to mean that interest rates would go no lower for some time yet. After losing exactly 70 points over the first three days of the week, to go just below the 3100 level, the market managed to turn in a 35.4 point bounce over the last two. It was a dose of old-fashioned bid fever that inspired the reversal. On Thursday Lloyds Bank launched a Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, a deal regarded as so good for Lloyds that its shares rose 9 per cent on the day, which alone accounted for more than Thursday's 2.9 point rise in the Footsie. Friday morning witnessed Inchcape's recommended Pounds 176m cash offer for Hogg Group, the insurance broker. With the influence of a firmer Wall Street close on Thursday night as well, the Footsie closed the week with a day's rise of 32.5 points, leaving it a net 34.6 points lower. With yet more bids rumoured - especially one for Lasmo, the oil group, which has a market value approaching Pounds 1.5bn - it might be argued that corporate investors are focusing on the value available from buying companies at the beginning of a recovery rather than whether interest rates will be cut by a quarter point. Perhaps financial investors should follow their lead. Or as Andrew Bell, economist at BZW puts it: 'The bears ought to be dipping their paws in the honey rather than swatting at bees'. Having said that, though, corporate news over the week has been somewhat gloomy. Both Babcock and LIG announced the need for chunks of investors' money if they are to restructure themselves. Both sets of shareholders may get a sense of having seen all this before. Babcock, the engineering contractor, has been through all sorts of turmoil since being taken over by FKI in the late 1980s and demerged again. LIG's recent history seems to have been nothing but rationalisation costs and a rights issue in 1991. While both groups' problems have been well known for a while, the announcements this week - a Pounds 79m, four-for-seven rights issue, losses and job cuts at Babcock and a restructuring charge at LIG likely almost to eliminate Pounds 120m of net assets requiring a substantial equity injection  -show that even economic recovery is not sufficient to rescue some parts of industry. Lloyds Bank's move makes up for all that. The creation of the fourth largest mortgage lender in the UK should enliven the mortgage market. And Lloyds may have shown investors a new way of making money. The Pounds 500 minimum payment to more than 1m C &amp; G voting members might spawn a new investment game. Pick a few building societies likely to be taken over, open an account with each, and wait for the money to roll in. It would, at least, be simpler than trying to understand why share prices sometimes go up and other times go down.</p>

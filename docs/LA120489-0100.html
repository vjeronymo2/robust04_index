			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S MUSEUM OPENS NEW WING;  </P> <P> EXPANSION: WITH NEW SCIENCE AND THEATER ROOMS AND A PRESCHOOL PLAYPARK, THE LA  HABRA FACILITY EXPECTS TO DOUBLE ITS ATTENDANCE -- AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN  TEACHING YOUNGSTERS.  </P> <P> Six-year-old Patrick McCollum, one of 500 people who came Saturday to the grand  opening of the Children's Museum of La Habra's new wing, looked at a mysterious  mechanical exhibit and asked his dad:  </P> <P> "What's it do?"  </P> <P> Patrick, wearing an orange baseball cap and missing a few teeth, was asking  about four metal plates and a microamperes meter on display in the new Science  Station room, which is filled with hands-on displays and experiments for  children.  </P> <P> Mitch McCollum, Patrick's father, motioned toward two of the plates and said,  "Put your hands on them." Then he pointed at the meter. "See? You have  electricity flowing through you."  </P> <P> "Oooh!" said Patrick, pulling his hands away.  </P> <P> The museum has encouraged children to use their hands to learn since it opened  12 years ago, and now with a new wing that triples its space and a new schedule  allowing it to be open on Saturdays, there's that much more room and time for  the children to touch -- and discover.  </P> <P> There are two other rooms in the new wing: a Kids on Stage room, where children  can try on donated costumes and can work spotlights and play with props; and  Preschool Playpark, where toddlers can play inside an artificial tree. The wing  also contains an auditorium for performances and office space.  </P> <P> The museum's older attractions remain, including the Nature Walk exhibit where  children can pet stuffed wild animals and view a live bee colony through glass.  </P> <P> The new wing is designed in a California mission style to blend in with the  original museum facility, a 1923 Union Pacific train depot. The wing, new  equipment, exhibits and operating expenses cost $700,000, raised mostly through  private contributions and grants.  </P> <P> Assistant director Melissa Banning said the museum expects that its attendance  will double to 200,000 a year now that there is the room, the staff and, with  Saturdays, the time to handle more visitors and tours.  </P> <P> "We're more of a learning center than we've ever been," Banning said. "We've  always wanted to do art programs, craft programs. Now we can do it."  </P> <P>  The Children's Museum of La Habra is at 301 S. Euclid St. and is open from 10  a.m. to 4 p.m. every day but Sunday. Admission: $1.50 for ages 2 to 16, $2 for  adults. Free for children under 2. Information: (213) 905-9793.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS, HARVEY REACH AGREEMENT  </P> <P> Relief pitcher Bryan Harvey, whose 25 saves last season matched the  second-highest total ever achieved by an Angel pitcher, agreed to a one-year  contract with the Angels for $332,500 Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's only been two seasons. I think I'm doing pretty well," said Harvey, who  was 3-3 with a 3.44 earned-run average and 78 strikeouts in 55 innings last  season.  </P> <P> "I think they've been pretty fair, and I'm very happy," Harvey said.  </P> <P> Harvey and Rob Dibble of the Cincinnati Reds each averaged 12.8 strikeouts per  nine innings last season for a major league record. His 25 saves in 32  opportunities equaled Dave Laroche's second-place mark, set in 1978; Donnie  Moore set the Angels' single-season record with 31 saves in 1985.  </P> <P> In his career, Harvey is 10-8 with a 2.58 ERA, 42 saves and 158 strikeouts in  136 innings.  </P> <P> With the threat of a spring-training lockout, Harvey may have to wait awhile  before throwing the first pitch under his new contract.  </P> <P> "We're just waiting around til Feb. 9 (when owners meet and could decide to  postpone the opening of camps) to see what happens," said Harvey, who left his  off-season home in Chattanooga, Tenn., to work out with his fellow pitchers at  Anaheim Stadium. "I'm just getting ready to play. All I can do is be ready."  </P> <P> The 1990 salaries of four Angel pitchers and four other players are due to be  determined in arbitration hearings that will begin Friday. Pitchers Chuck  Finley, Scott Bailes, Kirk McCaskill and Bob McClure; first baseman Wally  Joyner, third baseman Jack Howell, center fielder Devon White and catcher Bill  Schroeder filed for arbitration and have not agreed to new contracts.  </P> <P> General Managers Fred Claire of the Dodgers and Mike Port of the Angels will be  among the speakers today at an 11 a.m. press conference at the Gene Autry  Museum to announce the expansion of the Reviving Baseball in Inner City (RBI)  program.  </P> <P> The program, to be funded this year by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los  Angeles, began in 1987 with the aim of exposing disadvantaged inner-city youths  to baseball and helping them refine their skills.  </P></p>

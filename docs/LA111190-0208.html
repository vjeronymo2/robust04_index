			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WIND-FED FIRE DESTROYS 330 APARTMENTS;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: AN ERRANT SPARK TOUCHES OFF FLAMES THAT TAKE FIREFIGHTERS SEVEN  HOURS TO CONTAIN. THE COMPLEX WAS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  </P> <P> A fire sparked by a plumber's torch raged through 22 luxury apartment buildings  in Thousand Oaks on Saturday afternoon, injuring two firefighters and causing  at least $7 million damage.  </P> <P> Fed by gusting 25 m.p.h. winds, the blaze erupted shortly before 3 p.m. and  quickly consumed 330 of the 544 apartments at The Knolls on Avenida de los  Arboles.  </P> <P> About 240 firefighters from Ventura and Los Angeles counties fought the fire  into the night.  </P> <P> The fire was contained about 10 p.m., but firefighters didn't expect to have it  out until this morning. Firefighters couldn't get equipment close enough to two  burning apartment houses. "The buildings are too unstable to get people close  to them," said John Wade, Ventura County Fire Department spokesman.  </P> <P> Only charred, smoldering scaffolding remained in portions of the complex where  firefighters allowed the blaze to burn itself out while they tried to save  other structures. No occupied apartments were destroyed. Some of the apartment  buildings were still under construction.  </P> <P> Ventura County Fire Capt. Larry Henry was taken to Los Robles Medical Center  suffering from heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation, fire officials said. He  was treated and released. An unidentified, off-duty Los Angeles firefighter who  lives in Ventura County was also injured in the blaze but was not treated.  </P> <P> Fire investigator Bill Hager said the blaze was ignited on the first floor of a  building by a plumber using a torch to solder a piece of plastic pipe.  </P> <P> The plumber realized too late that the flames had raced to the second floor,  Hager said. A security guard at the site said the plumber came screaming out of  the building to warn him of the spreading blaze, and he contacted the Fire  Department.  </P> <P> Fire officials declined to identify the plumber employed by Interstate Plumbing  Inc., at the company's request.  </P> <P> Firefighters struggled to quench the fire from the only two accessible fire  hydrants in the complex. Other hydrants were quickly engulfed by the flames,  and firefighters were driven back by the searing heat.  </P> <P> "The radiant heat from this fire was unbelievable," Wade said.  </P> <P> One Ventura County fire captain said his crew had trouble attacking the blaze  because of poor water pressure.  </P> <P> When hydrants on hand failed, firefighters set up a modern-day bucket brigade,  a "relay" of five or six firetrucks, linked up to pump water from hydrants in a  housing complex more than a quarter of a mile from the fire.  </P> <P> Water mains within The Knolls were apparently either broken or shut off, fire  engineer Karry Ellison said. Fire officials will investigate whether the mains  were broken, or whether they had been shut off while plumbing work was being  done, Wade said.  </P> <P> Firefighters were aided by two helicopters that whizzed over the area, dumping  water on the flames.  </P> <P> A five-acre brush fire was started southwest of the construction site by embers  from the blaze.  </P> <P> Geoffrey L. Stack, president of Regis Homes Corp. in Newport Beach, said the  initial damage estimate of $7 million does not include vehicles and  construction equipment destroyed in the inferno.  </P> <P> Regis is the contractor and partial owner of the project in partnership with  Lang Ranch Co. The entire project is valued at $40 million, Stack said.  </P> <P> Stack declined to comment on any action that might be taken against Interstate  Plumbing Inc.  </P> <P> "I think this is an unfortunate thing. It appears to be accidental," Stack  said.  </P> <P> He said he was deeply disappointed. "We have people planning to move in and  make this their home."  </P> <P> Bill Green, manager of Lang Ranch Co., said: "We'll clean it up, and get it  built as soon as we can."  </P> <P> Officials said the fire was one of the biggest structure fires to hit the  eastern part of the county in more than 16 years.  </P> <P> "It's a big loss. It's a real big loss," Wade said.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said she saw thick black smoke curling  above the hills near her Thousand Oaks home and raced to the scene.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's been a fire in Thousand Oaks with this kind of  destruction in 16 years," Schaefer said.  </P> <P> The apartments destroyed in the blaze were touted by the developer's  promotional brochures as a resort-like complex with racquetball and tennis  courts, spas, swimming pools and saunas. None of the recreational facilities  were destroyed in the fire, fire officials said.  </P> <P> Chris Kleiner, a secretary for Regis Homes Corp., who raced to the fire when it  began, said construction on the project began in January. The complex was to  open for occupancy on Nov. 19.  </P> <P> Kleiner said about 80 units had been rented for $700 to $1,200 a month.  </P> <P> Despite roadblocks set up by authorities, the blaze drew hundreds of  bystanders. Some hiked and bicycled over hills to watch the flames and  billowing smoke.  </P> <P> Fire officials did not evacuate nearby residences. At one point as the fire  threatened to race over dry hills south of the development, firefighters  considered evacuating a home for cerebral palsy patients in the North Ranch  area of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> The fire was so hot it melted firefighting equipment on fire engines, Ventura  County Fire Capt. Keith Mashburn said. One engine had to be sent back to its  station because of heat damage.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of fire that needed tremendous amount of water," Mashburn  said.  </P> <P> Fire officials said the fire was able to consume unprotected wood on  half-finished homes. Some of the apartments escaped destruction because they  were protected by tile roofs.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Amy Louise Kazmin contributed to this story.  </P></p>

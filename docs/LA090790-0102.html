			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LOURDES BAIRD SWORN IN AS NEW U.S. ATTORNEY  </P> <P> Before judges, prosecutors and lawyers assembled in a courtroom of the federal  courthouse in Los Angeles, the new U.S. attorney for the Central District of  California, Lourdes G. Baird, was officially sworn into office on Thursday.  </P> <P> Baird, 55, a native of Ecuador and a former Los Angeles County Superior Court  judge, was nominated by President Bush last May to replace U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Robert C. Bonner.  </P> <P> Taking into account Baird's Latino background and the fact that Southern  California is an ethnic melting pot with a large Latino population, her former  law partner, Molly Munger, said that "Lourdes is symbolic of Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Baird, who raised a family before pursuing a legal career, gave credit to other  women in her profession. "I clearly got here hanging on to the skirts of my  predecessors," she said.  </P></p>

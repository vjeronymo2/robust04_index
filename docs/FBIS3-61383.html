An  INFOTAG agency correspondent conducted a brief interview with  him.    [INFOTAG] Mr. Birshteyn, how do you see the current  situation  in Moldova?    [Birshteyn] In my opinion, as compared to neighboring states  the situation in the republic today is healthy. Healthy in the  sense that all three branches of power have found a very  sensible compromise. This leads me to the conclusion that  Moldova is going the right way.    [INFOTAG] The opposition would disagree with you.    [Birshteyn] The existence of an opposition is a normal  phenomenon inherent in any civilized state. Everybody has a  right to his own opinion. Some political forces believe that  Moldova should unite with Romania; others--with the CIS; and  still others see it as an independent state.    [INFOTAG] Which one of the three options is more realistic?    [Birshteyn] What is realistic is that in the final analysis  the people choose their own way. My opinion is this. Since  Moldova has gained independence, it should be preserved. I know  many examples of countries fighting for their independence. But  I cannot remember a single reverse example of a country looking  for a way out of independence.    [INFOTAG] Why do you think this is happening?    [Birshteyn] I think that the roots of this phenomenon are in  the current difficult economic situation. But if we look today  at Moldova, which is in a deep economic crisis, and compare it  with neighboring states, I am optimistic. For instance, the  Ukrainian leadership today is facing a much heavier burden of  problems than the Moldovan authorities.    [INFOTAG] This does not make it easier for the people.    [Birshteyn] The population must realize that it is  impossible  to build a new healthy economy without having lived through the  current difficulties. Moldova has an absolutely realistic  opportunity to become, shall we say, in about five years a pearl  in the center of Europe.    The Seabeco Group has an interest in working in Moldova. As  a  human being, I like this land and the people living here. I  think that the company has already demonstrated in practice that  we did not come here to grab something--we came here to help.    [INFOTAG] What about business interests?    [Birshteyn] We are not hiding the fact that in time we count  on making money here. I want to point out that I am not in the  position of a businessman looking for quick profits. I am in no  hurry because I understand that any serious business begins with  investing money.    [INFOTAG] There is a lot of controversial information in  Moldova regarding Birshteyn's "mission" in stopping the  bloodshed in Bendery. What really happened?    [Birshteyn] My role was quite modest. I simply brought  together all those people who were in a position to adopt a  sensible decision.    [INFOTAG] Tell us your secret: What projects is the Seabeco  Group working on in Moldova these days?    [Birshteyn] There are several projects in the works that we  hope to implement in the republic. All involve agriculture...    [INFOTAG] And to be more specific...    [Birshteyn] These are projects involving complete-cycle  production facilities that will make ready-to-use products  instead of selling raw materials. It is profitable both for the  state and the producer to sell the finished product. My opinion  is that it would be wrong to shift production into  nontraditional spheres.    Agriculture is a traditional business for Moldova. This is  what we need to develop.    [INFOTAG] Your company has ceased working in Kyrgyzstan.  Why?    [Birshteyn] I am flabbergasted over people's lack of  integrity when I hear my name "trashed around" in the Kyrgyz  parliament. This is all dirty intrigues and dirty politics...    [INFOTAG] What about the gold reserves? Is it true that they  have been taken out of Kyrgyzstan?    [Birshteyn] We have not taken anything out of Kyrgyzstan. On  the contrary, we have invested a lot of money and effort. Logic  says that people should be grateful to us. Alas. History puts  everything in its proper place, however. By such, if I may call  them "actions," Kyrgyz politicians are making a reputation for  themselves.    Instead of creating conditions to attract foreign  investment,  some current politicians in Bishkek are choosing the option of  going around the world begging. This is not a solution.    [INFOTAG] By the way, speaking about conditions--how are  they  in Moldova, in your opinion?    [Birshteyn] Moldova is creating precisely these conditions.  I  do not want to say that there are no difficulties for foreign  businessmen here. They do exist, and unfortunately quite a few.  But it also is absolutely clear that in the end, when searching  for a solution to any problem, no matter how complex, we will  find mutual understanding.    [INFOTAG] From the point of view of a businessman, which  economic sectors in Moldova deserve major financial infusion?    [Birshteyn] In my opinion, the potentially promising sectors  in the republic would be agriculture, light industry, and  tourism. Moldova is a very beautiful corner of the world;  provided a certain infrastructure is in place, it could become  attractive for many categories of tourists.    [INFOTAG] On 29 November the republic introduced its own  national currency--the Moldovan leu. Since that time the foreign  currency exchange has been registering a small but steady  decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar in relation to  the leu. In your opinion, is this a real or an artificially  created phenomenon?    [Birshteyn] Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the real  situation in this area. But I want to say that introducing a  national currency is a competent step, and most importantly,  timely. A monetary unit is one of the attributes of statehood.    With respect to the decline of the U.S. dollar rate in  relation to the leu, my guess is that the National Bank probably  has a stabilization fund. I think that we should not get  euphoric on the subject of the declining exchange rate of the  American currency. Although of course it is necessary to strive  for stability of the leu. Even though it will not be easy to  maintain the rate.    [INFOTAG] In your opinion, should political forces in  Moldova  learn a lesson from the election results in Russia?    [Birshteyn] I think there is not much of a lesson for  political parties in Moldova to be learned from the results of  the elections to the State Duma of Russia. Why? The situation in  Chisinau is completely different. I think there will be no  surprises at the elections to the new parliament. I am certain  that the winners in the elections will be logic and common sense.</p>

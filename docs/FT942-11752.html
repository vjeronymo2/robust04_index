			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Deficit for Premium Underwriting As promised in its prospectus, Premium Underwriting issued a progress report yesterday showing pre-tax losses at Pounds 32,442 for the initial period to February 28. The prospectus statement expected costs to exceed income until 1997 when Lloyd's results for 1994 were declared and paid. Although it was too early to make predictions of the underwriting results for 1994, the directors believed the year had 'started satisfactorily'.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PITCHING, DEFENSE GIVE KENNEDY PERFECT ENDING  </P> <P> There were no errors for Kennedy High School Saturday, only perfection.  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish defeated Saugus, 1-0, in nine innings at Dodger Stadium to  win the Southern Section 3-A baseball championship. They did so by relying on  their strengths -- pitching and defense.  </P> <P> Greg Hansell supplied the pitching, allowing five hits and striking out 10,  including the first six batters.  </P> <P> When Hansell did allow someone to actually hit the ball, his defense was there  to lend a hand. The Fighting Irish did not make an error; the Centurions  committed two, including one that led to Kennedy's run.  </P> <P> "Pitching and defense has carried us all season," Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal  said. "This was nothing new today."  </P> <P> Kennedy's solid play in the field was highlighted by shortstop Steve Rath and  third baseman Paul Ruark. But it was Todd Murakami, a reserve outfielder, who  made the biggest play of the game.  </P> <P> In the top of the seventh, Saugus had runners on first and second when Scott  Warr sliced a foul ball down the left-field line. Murakami, who had replaced  Scott Ethington an inning earlier, gave chase. The ball hit his glove about the  same time his knee hit the fence.  </P> <P> Everyone froze, including pinch-runner Jayme Riggio, who has halfway between  second and third.  </P> <P> Murakami raised his glove to show he'd made the catch, threw the ball back to  the infield, then collapsed in pain. The runners went back to their bases.  </P> <P> "I never saw the fence until I hit it," Murakami said. "I knew I was hurt, but  I was more worried about the runners. So I got the ball back to the infield and  then worried about myself."  </P> <P> Murakami was then surrounded by a doctor, a trainer and Pascal.  </P> <P> Said Pascal: "We got out there and Todd is saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't  breathe.' We started looking at his ribs and he said, 'It's my knee.' "  </P> <P> Murakami left the game with a bruised knee. His play was one of four that kept  the Fighting Irish tied. But it was, by far, the most spectacular.  </P> <P> "Let's face it, he literally sacrificed his body for the team," Rath said.  "That's what playing defense is all about. That play fired us up."  </P> <P> Rath followed Murakami's catch with a defensive gem of his own.  </P> <P> With runners still on first and second, Glenn Terry hit a line drive toward  left field. Rath moved to his right, snagged the ball and flipped it to second  to double off Riggio. End of inning, end of threat.  </P> <P> Rath also made a running catch on a shallow fly to take a hit away from Roger  Salkeld in the eighth.  </P> <P> "Steve and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye," Pascal said. "He sometimes does  things that I don't like and I sometimes do things he doesn't like. But when  it's time to play, he plays his butt off."  </P> <P> In the fourth, Saugus had a runner on second with two outs. J.B. Johnson hit a  hard grounder between Ruark and the third-base bag.  </P> <P> Ruark dived to his right and smothered the ball. Although he threw late to  first base, he prevented a run from scoring.  </P> <P> "Paul saved our butts right there," Pascal said.  </P> <P> Hansell struck out the next batter to end the inning.  </P></p>

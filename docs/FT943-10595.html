			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / BT to cut cost of directory inquiries British Telecommunications is cutting the cost of directory inquiries for UK numbers, Alan Cane writes. BT said yesterday that from September 1 calls to directory inquiries will cost 25p including value added tax compared to the 44.2p now charged. BT said technical improvements had made the cut possible. Charges were introduced three years ago. Inquiries for international numbers will still cost 44.42p. Oftel, the industry watchdog, and the Telecommunications Users' Association both welcomed the move. The association said its research showed that 64 per cent of customers had either stopped using the service or switched to a cheaper alternative since the charges , thought to be among the highest in the world, were introduced.</p>

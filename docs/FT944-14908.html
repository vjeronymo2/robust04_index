			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India cuts import duty on aluminium India's federal government has cut the import duty on aluminium to 10 per cent ad valorem from 25 per cent because primary aluminium consumption is rebounding strongly. Domestic producers, although operating at a high level of capacity, are not able to fully meet the demand for the metal from fabricators and extruders. According to industry officials, the rising price of aluminium on the London Metal Exchange was also behind the government's decision to lower the customs duty. But even at the revised duty, the imported metal will cost more than locally produced aluminium. In recent months all domestic producers have raised their aluminium prices. Last year India imported about 45,000 tonnes of aluminium, while domestic production was less than 500,000 tonnes. In the current year there has been a sharp rise in demand for aluminium from the automobile and electrical industry. India's state-owned National Aluminium Company (Nalco) is to cut alumina output by 10 per cent because of slack demand, Reuter reports from New Dehli. In 1993-94 Nalco produced 753,000 tonnes of alumina and exported 372,000 tonnes. Nalco's annual alumina production capacity is 800,000 tonnes a year against world output of 40m tonnes. An official said: 'Nalco had targeted exports of 400,000 tonnes of alumina in 1994-95 but in the present scenaria the company might achieve exports of 370,000 tonnes. 'Demand for alumina had fallen mainly because of moves by the world aluminium industry to deal with oversupply,' he added.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> On the 17th anniversary of the legalization of abortion, pro-choice forces won  a victory Monday as the U.S. Supreme Court tossed out a case against San Diego  abortion clinic personnel who placed protesters under citizen's arrest.  </P> <P> "It's a very clear message to anti-abortion groups that there are limits to  their actions, and that support for their actions is getting smaller and  smaller," said Rina Berkhout, executive director of Womancare Clinic.  </P> <P> "Anti-abortion protesters are losing more and more ground."  </P> <P> Five demonstrators were placed under citizen's arrest in October, 1985, when  they picketed the Womancare Clinic in the 2800 block of 6th Avenue. The case  involved almost five years of litigation as the demonstrators charged that they  had been denied their right to free speech and subjected to false arrest,  emotional distress and negligence. Although the group was initially awarded  money, the case was reversed in a court decision in January, 1988.  </P> <P> The final blow came this week when the Supreme Court declined to hear the  protesters' case.  </P> <P> "We are very disappointed," said Lloyd Tooks, the attorney representing the  five demonstrators. "I believe this will encourage citizens to make arrests  instead of police."  </P> <P> But Berkhout said Womancare officials would continue to depend on police to  keep protesters from disrupting the clinic's operations. The Supreme Court's  action does, however, give clinic officials an additional tool to help protect  their clients, she said.  </P> <P> "If we have to make citizen's arrests, we will do it," Berkhout said. "We will  protect our clients."  </P></p>

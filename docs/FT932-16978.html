			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Bonds: Latin American borrowers raise Dollars and D-Mark funds A NUMBER of Latin American borrowers tapped the international capital markets yesterday, raising both dollar and D-Mark funds. In the D-Mark sector, Venezuela launched a DM150m five-year issue, via Commerzbank. The bonds carried a 10 1/4 per cent coupon which proved attractive to European retail investors, as well as specialist Latin American fund managers. The double-digit coupon and wide spread of more than 400 basis points over the five-year bund yield was seen as sufficient compensation for buying what is currently viewed as a very risky credit. The uncertain political situation in Venezuela, ahead of elections at the end of the year, has caused substantial volatility in Venezuela's par bonds which are now trading at less than 60 cents in the dollar. Also in D-Marks, the Inter-American Development Bank launched a 10-year deal priced to yield 13 basis points over the comparable Bund yield. The deal, arranged by Deutsche Bank, met some demand in the Far East, as Japanese investors returned to the market at the start of their new fiscal year. Meanwhile, Uruguay is expected to launch its second Eurobond issue today, following its return to the market last year. The five-year deal, arranged by Chase, is expected to total Dollars 75m, but could be increased to Dollars 100m. The price talk is for a launch spread of 220 to 230 basis points above the five-year US Treasury yield, a more aggressive pricing than had been suggested when the deal was first mandated, but several dealers reported demand at that level. Meanwhile, a Dollars 130m five-year issue for Controladora Comercial Mexicana, a Mexican retailer, arranged by Citibank, met strong demand. Dealers said the spread of 370 basis points over the five-year Treasury yield appeared generous, and the deal was oversubscribed. Also in the sector, Argentina's Banco Medefin launched a small Dollars 30m one-year deal, via Credit Lyonnais. In the Australian dollar market, Shell Australia launched the first issue since the Labor party's recent election victory. The Dollars 100m five-year deal was arranged by Hambros Bank.</p>

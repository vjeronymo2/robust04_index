			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilians expand plantings Higher world market prices for green coffee since the introduction last October of the producer's export retention scheme resulted in expanded plantings in Brazil's Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo states, the German coffee industry association DKV said yesterday, reports Reuters from Hamburg. The use of fertiliser had also increased, according to an article in DKV's bulletin assessing Brazil's crop damage following the frosts in June and July. Some farmers might still be able to reap good harvests and to reinvest their higher earnings in the wake of frost damage to the 1995-96 crop, DKV said. About 1bn Brazilian coffee trees, a quarter of the total, had been felled between 1991 and 1993 as depressed world prices made production largely unprofitable. Brazil's 1994-95 crop would be in a range of 22m to 25m bags (60kg each), while the 1995-96 crop should be reduced by 9m or 10m from 25m to 30m bags expected before the frosts, the article said, citing US and trade estimates. The Brazilian authorities had put the frost-hit crop at 15m to 17m bags. Depending on the extent of the damage, which will not be fully apparent until October, Brazil could return to good harvests as early as 1996-97, DKV said. In any case sizeable crops were likely to re-emerge in 1997-98.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Ace plan would trump the 'Budget for business' - Corporation Tax YESTERDAY'S Finance Bill contained the details of the 'Budget for business' announced by the chancellor last month. The main elements concern corporation tax: the rate is to be progressively cut to 33 per cent and losses may now be carried back for up to three years instead of one. The aim of these measures is, according to the chancellor, to 'help business through the recession in the short term' and to 'encourage them to invest in the long term'. But he needs to be far more radical to achieve either of these goals. In the short term, as much as Pounds 2bn of companies' corporation tax liabilities is a tax on inflation, not on profits; it arises only because there is no indexation relief to provide against the tendency of historic cost profit (on which corporation tax is based) to overstate true profit. The cuts in the tax rate, worth only Pounds 380m this year, do little to address this problem. Reducing the tax rate has only a tiny impact on the incentive to invest  - mainly because the value of tax allowances is also reduced. Nor will it really increase Britain's attractiveness to foreign investors. The tax incentives to inward investment, as international companies know well, go far beyond a comparison of tax rates. The chart gives the costs of capital for inward investment in various countries - a measure of tax incentives to foreign investors. It also compares them to statutory tax rates. It is clear that the UK already had a relatively attractive tax system, with the lowest cost of capital among the G7 countries, and that the latest cut in the tax rate did not alter its ranking. But between the Budget and the bill the Institute for Fiscal Studies capital taxes group published a new proposal which would have radical effects on business in both the short and long run - and which could be implemented without loss of tax revenue. The basis of the proposal is a new corporation tax relief - an 'allowance for corporate equity' or Ace. The relief would be very similar to that given for interest payments: a notional return to equity would be calculated by multiplying the amount put into the business by the interest rate. The allowance would then reflect the amount which the shareholders could have earned elsewhere - in economists' jargon, the 'normal' profit. The Ace would replace the current imputation system, which is defective in two ways: it gives relief on dividend payments, but not on retained earnings, and it gives relief only at the imputation rate of 25 per cent, not at the full corporation tax rate of 33 per cent. Under the Ace, tax would only be paid when profits exceed a 'nominal' rate - perhaps the rate on a medium-term gilt. This is already the case for debt-financed investment, so that the Ace system treats all investments in the same way, regardless of the method by which they are financed. Because the Ace 'levels up' the treatment of equity, it also removes the current disincentive to invest. Any investment that is expected to earn more than a 'nominal' profit before tax will still earn more than a 'nominal' profit after tax, and should still be worth undertaking. Finally, there is the effect of inflation on the tax base; inflation pushes up nominal interest rates and hence the value of the new allowance, so that there is no need for specific indexation provisions. The aim of the Ace relief is fiscal neutrality, removing tax distortions. The advantage of the scheme is that it is based on familiar measures of profit, and that the timing of tax receipts is more convenient for the government. Of course, the 1984 reforms were also aimed at fiscal neutrality. Some argue that neutrality is best achieved with a broad tax base and a low tax rate, along the lines of the current system. But the Ace system would not substantially reduce the size of the tax base and may even widen it. If the chancellor really wants a radical 'Budget for Business', rather than a few cosmetic changes, he should study the Ace proposal carefully. Important tax reforms usually take place just after elections rather than just before, so, electorate permitting, he has up to 14 months to do just that.

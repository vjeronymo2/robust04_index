			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANDON HIRES BEAR STEARNS TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL OPTIONS  </P> <P> Tandon Corp., a once-thriving computer equipment company that has struggled  since 1985, said Tuesday that it hired investment banker Bear, Stearns &amp;  Co. to help it explore its financial options.  </P> <P> Tandon's executive vice president and corporate secretary, Ranjit Sitlani,  declined to say what alternatives the company was considering. Such options  often include spinoffs and leveraged buyouts and other types of acquisitions.  </P> <P> Bear Stearns plans to present Tandon with a "menu" of options by late October  and to complete any resulting transactions by the end of the year, said Michael  E. Tennenbaum, the firm's vice chairman of investment banking.  </P> <P> The company's stock closed Tuesday at 75 cents a share in the over-the-counter  market, down 6.25 cents. The stock has fallen from a peak of $34.25 per share  in 1983.  </P> <P> Tandon has tried to reposition itself as a maker of personal computers,  primarily sold in Europe, since competition and a slumping market for its disk  drives led to losses totaling $198 million in 1985 and 1986. The company hired  a number of industry veterans to help its PC efforts, but most have since left  the company.  </P> <P> Tandon completed the $49-million sale of its hard disk-drive business to  Western Digital Corp. of Irvine in March, 1988. This year, Tandon reduced its  U.S. work force by 35%, or 240 people, through a combination of layoffs and  attrition.  </P> <P> The company lost $20 million on sales of $309 million last year, and lost $12  million on sales of $190 million in the first half of this year.  </P></p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Arts: Where opera goes from strength to strength - Andrew Clark reviews 'Francesca da Rimini' at the increasingly popular Bregenz festival A glance across Europe's burgeoning festival landscape suggests that few have a more consistent record of success in recent years than Bregenz. While other festivals struggle to create or maintain their market niche, Bregenz has quietly gone from strength to strength. It has made an asset of its geographical setting, drawing audiences from three countries around the Austrian corner of Lake Constance, and using the lake as a natural backdrop for performances on the floating stage. More than 200,000 people have bought tickets this summer, and for many it will be their first experience of opera. Bregenz also proves that an open-air spectacle does not exclude artistic seriousness: it is guaranteed by the David Pountney - Stefanos Lazaridis production of Nabucco, which has returned for a second year with casts including Sergei Leiferkus and Rosalind Plowright. To balance the popular fare outside, Bregenz chooses a rarity for performance indoors in the comfortable 1700-seat Festspielhaus. Catalani's La Wally and Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa have been staged in recent years (and praised on this page). This year's choice was Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini. Next year Harry Kupfer will direct a Russian cast in Rimsky-Korsakov's Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, while Pountney and Lazaridis return for Fidelio on the floating stage. Bregenz owes its international reputation to a shrewd balancing of commercial and artistic priorities - largely the achievement of the current director, Alfred Wopmann. When he took over ten years ago, the festival attracted less than a third of the patrons it has today. Founded in 1946, it had survived on a diet of operetta fed to a predominantly local audience. Wopmann put the festival on a more independent financial footing, improved technical and rehearsal facilities, and upgraded the quality of performance. As a former violinist in the Vienna Philharmonic, who later built a successful career as a stage director, he knew exactly what he was doing. Jerome Savary's production of Die Zauberflote in 1985 was the turning point. Box office jumped 25 per cent, and has continued to rise. State subsidy has also grown, but its proportion of the budget has dropped from 68 per cent to 33 per cent. Thanks to the festival, money is pouring into the region and the local authorities are investing Sch220m (Pounds 14m) in a new multi-purpose hall on the festival site, a useful insurance against inclement weather during rehearsals and an additional year-round performing space. Wopmann, 57, has never courted controversy as a way of generating publicity. He avoids prima donnas. With 6,000 seats to fill each night on the floating stage, he says he cannot afford to be highbrow. 'I'm not interested in a production with footnotes - the kind where the director needs to explain his intentions in the programme book. I'm a believer in Kunst fur alle - art for all. That does not mean we only deal in superficial entertainment. You have all the naturalism you need in the background setting here. On stage we want artists and public to draw the link with their inner nature.' He says he tries to choose directors for their ability to define the nucleus of a work, and to bring out its relevance for today. 'Opera needs a lot of head, but ultimately it makes its impact through the emotions. When all the different components come together in the right way, when the artists give their all, the work shines alone and the audience identifies with the characters on stage. These are the moments when you can say art changes the world.' The Bregenz production of Francesca da Rimini may not have changed the world this summer, but it has certainly altered perceptions about a work which has traditionally been viewed with a degree of condescension. Based on D'Annunzio's cruel fin-de-siecle love story and premiered in Turin in 1914, Francesca is verismo distilled through a spectrum of late Romantic influences. That it emerged as a seamless whole in Bregenz is a tribute to the unified approach of the production team. The young Italian conductor Fabio Luisi drew all the rich Mediterranean atmosphere from Zandonai's instrumental palette, making it sound refined and clear-cut rather than mushy. Climaxes never descended into crude orchestral rhetoric, and there was a strong sense of forward momentum. The sultry warmth of the instrumental colouring was reflected in Antony McDonald's decor and costumes - a seductively beautiful match of sight and sound, preserving the medieval setting in clean lines, haunting shades of pink and turquoise, and a sense of evening sun. Despite Wolfgang Gobbel's superb lighting, the Act 2 battle was a disappointment: the chorus hung around like supernumeries, and the scene ended with a risible attempt at 'contemporary relevance' - a modern high-rise block going up in flames. Robert Fortune's stage direction was otherwise a model of discretion. Francesca was sung by the Bulgarian soprano Elena Filipova. Her voice is not big, but the timbre is rich and clear, and she never forces. Young and beautiful, she looked the part. She was partnered by Frederic Kalt, an American whose physical stature and lustrous tenor made him an ideal Paolo. Philippe Rouillon captured both the ugliness and the humanity of Francesca's lame husband Giancotto, while Kenneth Riegel was in excellent form as the one-eyed ogre Malatestino. All Francesca's ladies-in-waiting deserved their solo bows, especially Lorena Espina, the sensuous slave girl. A footnote for visitors: Bregenz itself is not very prepossessing. Instead of staying in an expensive lakeside hotel, try one of the charming villages in the surrounding region (I stayed at Horbranz), where the inns are quiet and welcoming, and Bregenz is still only a few minutes away by car.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jebul Rehman: "Internal Conflict of the Ruling </F> Party Can Affect the Nation"]    [Text] Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP [Pakistan People's  Party] founder, wrote a letter to his daughter from the Central  Jail in Rawalpindi on 21 June 1978. He had given the party  leadership to her through this letter. Her father had given  Benazir advice about policy. Mr. Bhutto had written: "Since the  slogans of days past are like old songs, they lost their quality  of ravishing one's heart. Therefore, new slogans should be  raised in each era; however, the principles should not be  changed." The Central Committee of the PPP elected Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto as chairperson of the party instead of  Begum Nusrat Bhutto and followed late Bhutto's 1978 decision.  Rejecting this action, taken after 15 years, Begum Nusrat Bhutto  said that the party's Central Committee had made her chairperson  for life when the Supreme Court had rejected her late husband's  request for bail. The kind mother of the prime minister said  that no one else could become the chairperson or chairman of the  party as long as she was alive. The Central Committee's  resolution to appoint the new person to this position on 5  December 1993 was unconstitutional and illegal. In light of the  stand Begum Nusrat Bhutto's has taken, we can say that, if the  mother and daughter did not make up their differences, the PPP  will remain in two camps, and the daughter will have to compete  against the mother. After Mr. Bhutto was hanged, Benazir Bhutto  spent some time in jails, and was released on condition that she  would leave the country. In 1986 she was not only given  permission to return to Pakistan, but to participate in  politics. The Americans had gotten assurance from then-Pakistani  rulers that Benazir Bhutto would not be arrested, all possible  arrangements would be made for her safety, and no restriction  would be imposed on her public meetings and rallies. In 1986 she  became the joint chairperson of her father's party. Her mother  had agreed to her getting this new position in the party. Nusrat  Bhutto was happy that her talented daughter with her high-level  education, unique intelligence, and courage was successfully  reinstating the popularity of the PPP. The mother, in her joy,  had given her daughter free hand to run party affairs. After  marrying Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, there some changes appeared in  Madam Bhutto's policies that worried some senior party leaders.  The mother began to get new complaints about her daughter's  attitude almost daily. It is said that these complaints were not  removed despite Begum Bhutto's efforts. As a result, many old  associates of the late Mr. Bhutto began to leave the party one  by one. Madam Bhutto had no regrets at losing her political  uncles because she felt that these alleged uncles had not made  any serious efforts to save her father from hanging.    In addition to her personal feelings, the late Ziaul Haq's  supporting lobby had also effectively spread the rumors that  some of these senior leaders had advised in favor of hanging  Bhutto. According to Zia's lobby, some of these wanted to avenge  Mr. Bhutto for his contemptuous attitude. Some of them were  hoping that the leadership of the PPP would turn to them once  the candle of Mr. Bhutto's life was extinguished. When these  deluded leaders were disappointed, they not only said goodbye to  the PPP but began to sow seeds of distrust in the mind of exiled  brother Murtaza Bhutto against his sister and the  brother-in-law. Murtaza Bhutto was told that Asif Zardari was  trying to take over his ancestral rights and that Zardari's hold  on the PPP affairs was also tightening. It is said that some  officials of one of the Pakistani intelligence service were  involved in efforts to persuade Murtaza to act against his  sister. Murtaza Bhutto became very eager to return home. When  Madam Bhutto became the prime minister, Nusrat Bhutto insisted  that arrangements should be made for Murtaza Bhutto's return.  When this was not done, both mother and the son had the  misunderstanding that the prime minister did not want Murtaza  Bhutto to return. When he returned, his arrest naturally was  very unpleasant to his mother. Murtaza Bhutto was brought into  the election arena and when he competed against PPP-nominated  candidates, his mother openly supported him. Subordinates told  the prime minister and her husband that Nusrat Bhutto and her  son had started plans to take over the PPP. A plan to remove  this danger was made. According to it the honorable mother was  to be removed from the party chairperson's position, and a joint  chairperson was to take over all responsibilities. This plan was  approved and for simple display or out of respect the daughter  appealed to the mother to relinquish the highest position of the  party and become the chief patron. This appeal was rejected.  Murtaza Bhutto's associates requested Begum Nusrat Bhutto to be  adamant and declare that she was the permanent PPP chairperson.  Begum Nusrat accepted the advice of her son's political advisors  and supporters.    The party well-wishers who were upset at this  mother-daughter  conflict and who do not want the party to divide into two groups  joined forces and decided to persuade Benazir Bhutto to meet  with Nusrat Bhutto along with Asif Zardari and find a way to  make her change her mind. It was decided that Murtaza Bhutto's  cooperation was necessary for this effort. Thus, the prime  minister is to be advised to start negotiations with her dear  brother, and if necessary go visit him in jail. The party  well-wishers feel that arrangements should be made to get  Murtaza released on bail immediately and that efforts be made to  take back all the cases against him in order to improve Nusrat  and Murtaza Bhutto's mood. Former National Assembly Speaker  Ma'raj Khalid, who is considered one of the party founders, is  very active in these reconciliatory efforts. Ma'raj Khalid  maintains that there are examples of recalling cases based on  serious crimes when the greater national interest was involved.  The present situation demands that political stability be  established in Sindh. To attain this important national goal the  present PPP government should not hesitate in taking the cases  against Mir Murtaza Bhutto and MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement]  leader Iltaf Hussein. In this context if President Farooq  Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto use their special  privileges, all perceptive Pakistanis who know the need for  political action to improve the situation in Sindh will be  relieved.    The opponents of the PPP have a different opinion about the  conflict between Nusrat Bhutto and her daughter. The Pakistan  Muslim League (Nawaz) leaders declare it a major political drama  to give the opposition the message not to start a campaign  against Benazir's government. They should respect the prime  minister's pro-federal politics and support her decisions on  sensitive issues; otherwise, the extremist elements in Sindh  might raise their head with full force. If we consider the point  expressed by the Muslim League (N) observers to be wrong and  dismiss this theory of staging drama, we still have to admit  that it is necessary that the PPP leadership remains in  Benazir's hands to strengthen Sindh's allegiance to the nation.  Her position in Sindh should not become weaker, and the new  efforts of cooperating between the MQM and the PPP should be  successful. If the division within the PPP is not stopped and if  it does not establish stable relations with the MQM, then  deployment of soldiers for a long time in Sindh will become a  necessity. Such measures will affect Sindh's developmental  plans. As Sindhis feel the pinch of deprivation of basic  amenities, the question about where aid from the central  government to Sindh goes will arise painfully. It should be  remembered that Sindh provides 60 percent of the central  government's total revenue. Therefore, we can say that the  welfare of Pakistan depends on Sindh's staying within Pakistan  and on the fact that the anti-national and separatist elements  do not flourish in the nerve center of this state, Karachi. The  MQM representatives, while discussing the neglect of Karachi  residents' basic needs and the result of this neglect, have  advised prominent national leaders to establish a separate task  force to study Karachi's economic problems and find solutions  for them. This task force should be composed of representatives  from the PPP, MQM, industrial organizations, commerce groups,  and labor unions and should be asked to present its report  within two months. This report should identify the problems and  also suggest ways and means to resolve these problems.    Sindh had to spend about 2.5 billion rupees for the military  operation last year. One Sindhi senator had appealed to the  president, the prime minister, defense minister, and the high  command of the armed forces against these charges. He asks what  reasons there are for charging additional money for the  Pakistani military service when it is doing its duty within  Pakistan? According to the constitution, it is the duty of the  Army to help the civilian government when need arises. The  question raised by a Senate member is not the only one which  needs attention, several questions related to defense expenses  need be answered. The National Assembly does not have the  constitutional right to audit defense expenses. At the same  time, the feeling is becoming common that the fundamental reason  for our nation's backwardness is the fact that our defense  expenses are much more than our resources. After increasing our  foreign debt to meet defense needs, the money left for meeting  our people's basic needs is nominal. Governments increase taxes  without reason to make up their monetary shortages. This sends  the price of commodities up. As a result people with limited  income are suffering. The number of psychological patients is  increasing daily, the increase in crime and accident is ruining  the society's piece of mind, and the rate of illiteracy is  touching new heights.    According to a recent report issued by the education  ministry, there are 121 countries in the world with very low  literacy rates. Pakistan's position is 111 in that list. In  other words, only 10 other countries have higher illiteracy  rates than that of Pakistan. The situation in the area of food  is so bad that we have to import wheat, pulses, and edible oils.  The scarcity of electricity has forced us into the problem of  load shedding. The nation was told on the television last week  that we will need at least 60 billion rupees to enable us to  generate enough electricity to meet our needs. Even when we get  this huge amount, we still will have to wait a few years to get  rid of the practice of load shedding. The spokesmen for the  federal finance ministry are telling us the good news that the  amount of our foreign exchange reserve has increased. However,  they do not tell us how much foreign exchange will be left after  the interest and the next installments of foreign debts are  paid. It is not clear how we will repay the foreign exchange  deposited by private individuals spent by our government.  Instead of keeping the Pakistani people in the dark, it would be  better to admit openly that our country is going through a  serious economic crisis. In order to get out of it, we must  change our foreign policy in such a way that our geographical  borders are secure and we do not have to purchase new weapons  costing us tens of millions of dollars, that the military and  economic aid now suspended is reinstated, and that foreign  investment in our country on large scale becomes a reality.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Building societies want broader lending rules BUILDING SOCIETIES are urging their regulator to soften the force of planned guidance on lending policy, saying that it is too detailed and prescriptive in its present form. They have warned that the draft prudential note put forward by the Building Societies Commission could inhibit their ability to compete in mortgage lending unless it is changed. The 40-page draft sets out guidance covering the whole range of a society's lending, including issues such as assessing risks, limiting exposure to fixed rate and capped lending, and dealing with arrears. Prudential notes have a particular status in the way that building societies are regulated. Any society which does not comply with such a note normally has to explain itself to the commission and might also find its credit rating affected. Several of the larger societies have already expressed their concerns to the commission, and these are reflected in a response from the Building Societies Association, the industry's trade body. The unease is felt particularly strongly as lending is one of societies' core activities. Issues of contention include the ways of assessing a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage and a society's exposure to fixed-rate mortgages. Societies have recently been losing their share of the mortgage lending market to banks, whose fixed-rate mortgages have proved particularly popular. In the face of the industry pressure the commission is likely to back down and agree to issue the guidance in a different form, which carries less weight. The association suggested that only broad guidance should be contained in a prudential note, and that more detailed advice about what is 'best practice' could be issued separately, perhaps by the association rather than by the commission. Societies are also concerned that parts of the guidance are not suited to the whole of the industry from Halifax, the UK's largest society, to the smallest operators in the sector. Some of the largest societies believe that in certain lending issues the commission should seek to reach agreements with individual societies instead of trying to set blanket limits for the industry as a whole. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest society, said the draft guidance was part of a trend which could see the commission moving increasingly into societies' operational matters. He said: 'A common view in the industry is that the commission is getting into realms that could be commercial rather than prudential.'</p>

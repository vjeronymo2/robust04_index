			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- China's fodder  industry has become important in the national economy.    According to a recent cross-Taiwan Straits seminar on grain  and edible oil production, the total fodder output on the  mainland has increased from less than one million tons per year  in the late 1970s to 40 million tons now.    The annual growth rate of fodder output is 34.46 percent.    At present, there are more than 6,200 fodder enterprises and  685 of them can turn out 46 million tons annually.    In the 1990s, the proportions of the fodder output changed  remarkably. The feed for pigs accounts for 44 percent, the feed  for chickens accounts for 48 percent, and that for dairy cows, 7  percent.    Up to now, China has set up more than 180 Sino-foreign joint  ventures in the fodder industry.    However, experts noted that at present, 75 percent of the  fodder on the mainland comes from grain, but in developed  countries, less than 20 percent of fodder involves grain.</p>

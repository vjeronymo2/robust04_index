			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Frogmore scorns Southend's sums FROGMORE ESTATES, the target of a Pounds 130m offer from Southend Property Holdings, is likely to emphasise the contrasts between the two companies' gearing and dividend policies when it publishes its defence document at the end of next week. Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said that Southend's description of its superior financial record in its offer document had used selective statistics and given an incomplete picture. 'We also have a very good record. It depends on your starting point,' he said. Mr Davies said that Southend's emphasis on Frogmore's large overheads bill relied on out of date figures. Sharp overhead reductions had taken place since the market turned down, he said. Southend's bid suffered a setback this week as it lost apparent control of a block of 10 per cent of Frogmore's shares. The irrevocable undertaking to accept Southend's offer given by De Zoete &amp; Bevan ceased to apply when de Zoete declined to purchase the 4m Frogmore shares over which it held a call option. Mr Dennis Cope, chairman of Frogmore, criticised Southend for giving the impression from the outset that it controlled 20 per cent of Frogmore's shares. However, Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend, said that he was relaxed about the decision as he had always thought it unlikely that it would get control of the shares from de Zoete. The shares have reverted to Markheath Securities, which holds, with its associates, 17 per cent of Frogmore's shares. The other main Frogmore shareholders are Equitable Life. London &amp; Manchester and Sun Life.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Transfer Technology in Pounds 7.1m expansion TRANSFER Technology, the West Midlands specialist engineering group, is expanding its automotive components business with the takeover for Pounds 7.1m of Fenworth, a private group owned by Mr Peter Munday, Mr Clive Francis and their respective family trusts. Fenworth, comprising two companies - one manufacturing engine and body parts, largely for Ford and Rover, and the other marketing and selling the parts - is based near Stroud, Gloucestershire. In the year to March 1992 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m and had net assets of Pounds 2.75m. TransTec is paying Pounds 5.1m in cash and making up the balance with the issue of new ordinary shares. Mr Neil Logue, finance director, said the payment would raise TransTec's gearing to 35 per cent, but it would fall to 15 per cent by the end of the year. The acquisition of Fenworth extends the range of the group's automotive component products. Hitherto, TransTec had supplied parts only for vehicle power trains. A further acquisition may be in the offing for TransTec's control and manufacturing technology division. Mr Logue said the group was having talks with Cincinatti Milacron, US machine tool group.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: RAMS, CHIEFS CARVING OWN PLACE IN HISTORY  </P> <P> The bus eases to a halt in front of two solemn columns of granite. A brown  shirt leaves the guard station, waves the bus through and pushes a button that  retracts a gate of black wrought-iron spikes.  </P> <P> The bus weaves to the left, passing alongside the rugged gray walls, the steel  bars and the stained limestone pillars, heading to a side entrance where  another guard awaits its arrival.  </P> <P> The bus carries no prisoners, just the Rams to their Tuesday morning workout.  </P> <P> Berlin's Olympiastadion, a monumental failure in both objective and design,  gets a second chance at sports history Saturday when the Rams and the Kansas  City Chiefs play in American Bowl '90. This time, it hosts the first National  Football League game in Germany. Last time, it hosted the 1936 Olympic Games,  two weeks that neatly foreshadowed the fall Adolf Hitler would have nearly a  decade later in another arena.  </P> <P> The 1936 Olympics were in tended to be Hitler's games, a five-ringed  international propaganda rally. The Aryan race was going to rule these races  and the rest of the world was going to gain an education in Hitler's wacked-out  theory of success-through-genetics.  </P> <P> Since Olympiastadion was to serve as Hitler's stage, it was built to look the  part. The result was as grim and foreboding as a Nazi storm trooper, a  76,000-seat military barracks cast in limestone, marble, granite and basalt.  </P> <P> Apparently, Cleveland Stadium was drawn from the same blueprint.  </P> <P> Hitler oversaw all the architectural planning, down to the selection of the  stone blocks. Natural stone and not concrete was to be used, Hitler decreed,  because it symbolized "indomitable German strength and the enduring nature of  the National Socialist ideology."  </P> <P> One thing Hitler ignored, however, is now also cast in stone, on the wall next  to the Olympic torch -- a complete listing of 1936 gold medalists.  </P> <P> The first two lines read:  </P> <P>  100m LAUF: OWENS, U.S.A.  </P> <P>  200m LAUF: OWENS, U.S.A.  </P> <P> A young American black named Jesse Owens forever altered the meaning of those  games with the four gold medals he swept away, including the long jump -- then  known as the broad jump -- and the 4 x 100-meter relay. The broad jump pit  occupies the same spot as it did then -- situated, tauntingly, only feet away  from the Fuhrer's private box.  </P> <P> It is eerie to watch the Rams train amid such surroundings. They practice  outside the stadium, at the adjacent Maifeld, where Mussolini addressed a crowd  of 900,000 Germans in 1937. They run pass patterns in the shadow of the Bell  Tower, which was destroyed by Soviet troops during World War II and rebuilt  during the 1950s. To get from the field to the locker room, they pass between  two mammoth sculptures of German athletes and walk down a corridor decorated by  Gothic iron torches. All that's missing is a gargoyle by the bench.  </P> <P> The facility does not sport one swatch of paint. It is a uniform mausoleum  gray, save for the black scorch marks sustained during Allied bombing near the  end of the war.  </P> <P> According to stadium manager Peter Schliesser, the south half of the coliseum  was shelled after the Allies learned the Nazis were manufacturing radio  equipment underneath the stands. Had they been enemies of real taste, they  would have hit the northern half, too.  </P> <P> In truth, the building was spared greater damage for strategic purposes, since  Allied pilots often used Olympiastadion as a directional checkpoint during  their raids on Berlin.  </P> <P> Reconstruction began in 1952 and lasted a decade. It has been restored with its  original Teutonic austerity in tact, although several concessions to  contemporary demands have been added.  </P> <P> Today, an electronic scoreboard, capable of rendering full-color replays, hangs  from the east end. In preparation of the 1974 World Cup, an acrylic rain  cover-and-light-structure was suspended above the north and south rims of the  stadium.  </P> <P> Also, the schedule of events has changed. Two second-division soccer teams,  Hertha BSC and Blau-Weiss 90, play their home games at Olympiastadion. The  annual West German Cup soccer final is also held there. On the stadium grounds,  an outdoor amphitheater shows American movies -- a recent viewing of "Dirty  Dancing" drew 20,000 -- and the Maifeld is now used for rock concerts.  </P> <P> "The Maifeld seats 60,000 in the stands plus 250,000 on the grass," Schliesser  says. "All the promoters are looking forward to getting that in their hands."  </P> <P> The Globetrotters have also played Olympiastadion, most notably in 1953, when  Owens accompanied the team for his first post-Olympics return to Berlin. The  event attracted an overflow crowd of 77,000 -- most of them uninterested in  exploding basketballs.  </P> <P> "Jesse Owens is very popular here," Schliesser says. "When he died, they named  a street after him, Jesse Owens Allee. It runs right by the stadium."  </P> <P> Schliesser said Owens made many visits after that. "I must have met him five  times," Schliesser says. "He liked to come back here."  </P> <P> Owens was one of the few, but then, he was one of the proud.  </P> <P> The Rams and the Chiefs? They are here on a different mission. This week, the  disbelievers are soccer fans, who have yet to observe a better brand of  football than their own brand.  </P> <P> The conversion attempt will take place Saturday night. By then, Olympiastadion  will be festooned with giant inflatable Ram and Chief helmets. Its bleachers  will be dotted with Ram and Chief T-shirts. Its end zones will be painted Ram  blue and Chief red.  </P> <P> Good. The place could use some color.  </P></p>

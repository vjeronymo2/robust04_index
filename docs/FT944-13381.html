			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had another day of wide swings, ending the session back under 3,000 in much reduced volume, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract rose steadily through most of the morning but peeled off in the final couple of hours, diving steeply in the dying moments of the day's trading. Against a 3,040 best of the day, the contract was 2,993 at the official 4:10 close, down 16 points. At this level the premium to the cash market was 10 points with fair value premium around 14 points. Activity was dull with 10,594 contracts comparing bleakly with the previous day's 18,600 contracts. Most of this was concentrated into the morning session. Afternoon trading was left mostly to the whim of smaller deals but there was an upsurge of excitement right at the close when two big sell orders from two major houses went through. Traded options activity edged ahead with 50,760 lots, against 49,676 lots on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for around 20,500 lots. British Steel stood out among individual stock options, turning over 8,100 lots, or more than twice as much as the second busiest stock option, Marks and Spencer (3,084 lots). Thames Water, Hanson and Sainsbury were also active.</p>

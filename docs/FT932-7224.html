			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Complacency on the ERM JUDGED BY the lessons they draw from the turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism, the principal monetary officials of the European Community have, like the Bourbons, forgotten nothing and learned nothing. This is a pity. 'The Community,' asserts the EC's monetary committee, 'needs plain speaking, confrontation on policy issues and critical probing of forecasts and policy intentions.' But it also needs these virtues when analysing EC-wide policy systems, like the ERM. Unfortunately, neither its report nor that from the committee of central bankers display them. It would help if the authors showed some appreciation of the scale of the disaster that has befallen the EC. The Monetary Committee is correct in its castigation of policy failures in member states. But the rigid application of the ERM itself spread the consequences of German unification to the rest of the EC, so creating today's damaging, but largely unnecessary, EC-wide recession. Subsequent turmoil in the ERM damaged both the credibility of individual governments and relations among them, in the process transferring huge sums from taxpayers to speculators. If the reports had confronted this record head on, they might have been less complacent. For their conclusion is simply that 'current institutional and technical arrangements in the EMS remain on the whole appropriate'. Many recommendations The principal recommendations from the monetary committee are 'the adoption of stability-oriented economic policies in all participating countries'; 'improved co-ordination of economic policies'; orientation of monetary policy towards price stability; sound public finances; symmetric policy action, 'in the sense that all countries are obliged to pursue stability-oriented policies'; and appropriate responses to inflationary divergence, including 'exchange rate changes . . . to offset, at least partly, the effects on competitiveness'. These recommendations are to be made effective by frank discussion of the economic position of member states and 'action, when necessary, well in advance, of the development of expectations of change on the markets'. But the ERM will retain 'fixed but adjustable exchange rates', not turn into a 'crawling peg' system. In short, the system is fine. It is politicians who have been foolish. This is an understandable position for countries still in the system to take, but that does not make it the right one. No consistency In the first place, the ERM has failed to provide consistent help to stability-oriented policies. Spain, for example, did indeed suffer a 'significant and cumulative deterioration' in its competitive position that undermined the credibility of the peseta. Nevertheless, Spain's problem in the ERM was for years not a weak exchange rate, but a strong one. Similarly, the fiscal problems of EC member states have been exacerbated in recent years by the adverse effects of the ERM on the cyclical position of member states. In the second place, the ERM cannot be made stable by more timely adjustment of exchange rates. Markets read the same statistics as policy-makers, but react far faster. With the illusion of stability departed, investors will analyse every EC member state for signs of cyclical or structural disequilibrium. When they find one, they will move. The authorities must then either resist or give in. If they normally accede to the pressure, their currencies will be pushed towards floating. If they resist, their credibility will be at stake and the temptation to play 'double or quits' will be overwhelming. The way fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates work in the absence of exchange controls is well known. They cannot survive by offering a series of hugely profitable one-way bets to speculators. As a result, the ERM will not become more stable if substantial pre-emptive jumps in the exchange rate are made more frequently than hitherto. The well-known answer is to move either towards credibly fixed exchange rates, or towards managed floating. Given the politics, it is not surprising, that the dilemma has not been confronted. But there are flaws in the ERM. They must be eliminated.</p>

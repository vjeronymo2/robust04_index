			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's first reaction to the  incidents yesterday and early this morning at Lisbon Bridge was  that the whole thing was planned and organized by professional  agitators. The prime minister made these comments at the end of  the Corfu summit. He went on to say that extremist forces were  behind the crowds:    [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] The action that took place  yesterday in Lisbon is totally unacceptable in a democratic  state. Attempts were made to block the city of Lisbon and,  according to information I have received, these were organized  attempts, planned by professionals who clearly were attempting  to destabilize the country and cause agitation. We cannot be  complacent, despite the openness and dialogue that we offer,  when we can see clearly that the intention was to engage in  agitation, provocation, and violence. I would like to praise the  security forces, who, despite the extreme provocation, stayed  calm and knew just when to act in defense of our country's  legitimate democracy.    It is obvious that we were concerned. According to  statements made by some people, we believe that apart from the  professional organizers -- and it is not possible to carry out  such an action without methodical planning aimed at agitation --  there may be some extremist political forces behind the action,  given the language that was used and the people among those who  were agitating the crowds, people linked to the Communist Party  and the far left. I am also bearing in mind the statements made  by several members of the Communist Party. There were some  people that journalists recognized among the protestors as  members of the Communist Party.

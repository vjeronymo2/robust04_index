			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cupid's cash call flops MORE THAN 80 per cent of the shares in Cupid's 1-for-2 rights issue were left at the altar for the sub-underwriters to pick up. The USM-quoted bridal wear company, which includes the Pronuptia retail business, announced yesterday that 18.1 per cent of the 82p-a-share issue had been taken up. Mr Mike Murray, chief executive, said the result was disappointing, but it came against the background of a falling market between the June launch and the closing date. Cupid's share price closed down 2p at 79p yesterday. On the day the Pounds 2.68m issue was announced it shed 5p to finish at 90p. Mr Murray said the money was raised to finance retrospectively last winter's purchase of the Youngs formal wear business from the receiver. That had pushed up borrowings to Pounds 4.2m - gearing of 93 per cent. The issue proceeds would wipe out debt during the current favourable period for cash.</p>

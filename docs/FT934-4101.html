			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Whitehall officials forecast up to 6,000 job cuts More than 1,000 civil service jobs will go within a few months of implementing the Budget plan to merge unemployment benefit and income support into the jobseekers' allowance in 1996, say Whitehall officials. They also say that up to 6,000 jobs will be lost over the following few years. It has long been accepted in Whitehall that the unemployed should be served by one department rather than two as at present - the Department of Employment for job-finding and the payment of unemployment benefit, and the Department of Social Security for the payment of income support, which is received by 70 per cent of the unemployed. Officials say it is probable that the payment of the jobseekers' allowance will be centralised in the Employment Service, a semi-autonomous agency in the Department of Employment. The department's residual functions are likely to be shared between the trade and industry and education departments. One insider said: 'If the Conservatives win the next election (the Department of) Employment is not likely to survive, but they will only be able to close it if unemployment is falling,' Currently about 32,000 people in the Employment Service and 12,000 in the DSS are involved in the payment of unemployment-related benefits. If the payment of JSA was to be concentrated on the DSS the benefit would lose its labour-market focus. This has just been reinforced by the government's insistence that JSA recipients must sign a jobseeker's agreement. Claimants already agree a 'back to work plan' with an official at their local Job Centre. But in the new agreement people will have to sign a document and the onus will shift to claimants to prove that they are actively seeking a job. As well as reducing the duration of non-means-tested unemployment benefit from 12 months to six months, under the JSA there will be no no higher rate for people who are married or have dependants. But in the harmonisation of the rules between the JSA and unemployment benefit the partners of the unemployed will benefit, being allowed to work 24 hours a week rather than the previous 16 hours.</p>

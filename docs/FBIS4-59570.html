			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 13, IRNA -- Following the disclosure of  the British Government's bugging of the Iranian Embassy here,  other ambassadors in London are skeptical of the security of  their embassy vis-a-vis the government's espionage activities.    An Asian diplomat here has told his Iranian counterpart that  there is a high likelihood that the British intelligence has  carried out similar activities regarding the other embassies.    "We intend to carry out a thorough search in our embassy for  sure," he said.    He noted that embassies of the Islamic countries are more  exposed to the British eavesdropping due to the London's concern  over the increasing growth of Islamism in Britain.    "Even the ambassadors of the European countries who are  concerned over the issue, sarcastically ask the British  politicians in their meetings as in what part of their embassies  the British Government installed its eavsedropping devices,"  said the diplomat.</p>

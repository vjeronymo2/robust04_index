			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BARS HEART ASSN. MEAT OR POULTRY SEAL  </P> <P> The Agriculture Department has barred the use of an American Heart Assn. seal  of approval on any food product containing meat or poultry, the heart  association said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Although we share the desire to provide information to consumers that enables  them to make informed food choices, we are unable to approve this labeling  program," said Lester Crawford, who heads the department's Food Safety and  Inspection Service, in a letter made public by the heart association.  </P> <P> The association has said it plans to test several hundred foods and allow its  HeartGuide seal to appear only on those low in cholesterol, fat and sodium. The  seal is to begin appearing on non-meat groceries in February.  </P></p>

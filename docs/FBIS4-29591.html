			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Monday [20 June] it  has crafted a provisional legal framework on export controls for  strategically-sensitive products.    The move follows the international scrapping of Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Control (Cocom) rules in March.    The Western-bloc Cocom was set up in 1949 to prevent the  transfer of military technology to communist countries but was  disbanded in line with the demise of the communist bloc.    Revisions to part of the foreign exchange control ordinance  and the export trade control ordinance will be in effect until  Japan and the 22 other former Cocom members work out a new  international framework for checking exports of  strategically-sensitive products around October, MITI said.    The revisions will be approved by the cabinet Tuesday and to  be enforced on July, the ministry said.    Under the provisional rules, some of the former Cocom items  regarded as especially strategically sensitive, will be subject  to export controls for all destinations other than the 23  countries, MITI said.    Among such items are cipher equipment and components for  unmanned submarines, it said.    Other former Cocom-designated products will be subject to  export controls for the "watch-list" countries of Iran, Iraq,  Libya and North Korea.    Export monitoring, less strict than controls, will be  applied  to exports of many former Cocom items to all nations except the  23 former Cocom members and the four watch-list countries.    There are no Japanese export items that are immediately  affected by the new provisional rules, a MITI official said.</p>

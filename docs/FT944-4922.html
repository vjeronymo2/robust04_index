			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Artemis sells construction operation to Investcorp Artemis, the holding company which controls Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the French retail group, yesterday announced it had sold Primeco, one of the biggest groups in the US construction equipment rental market, to Investcorp, the international investment bank. The French group declined to disclose the amount of the transaction, but said the assets of the Texas-based company were valued at about Dollars 300m. Primeco is principally involved in the rental of construction and public works machinery and in trading activities related to these markets. Artemis, through which Mr Francois Pinault controls Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, acquired Primeco in the middle of last year. It bought the company from Pinault-Printemps to reduce the debt burden of the retail group. Mr Pinault said at that time that he would sell the US company when conditions were favourable. The acquisition is the latest in a series of deals by Investcorp, which was established in the early 1980s by founding shareholders from Arab countries. In October, the Bahrain-based investment bank completed the acquisition of Ebel, a leading Swiss manufacturer of luxury watches and in August it bought Star Market, a leading chain of supermarkets in Boston for Dollars 285m. Other companies and assets controlled by Investcorp include Gucci, the luxury goods company, Saks of Fifth Avenue and Tiffany's of the US. Artemis declined to indicate how the proceeds from the sale of Primeco would be used.</p>

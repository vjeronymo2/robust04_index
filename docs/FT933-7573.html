			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Palmerston seeks new capital PALMERSTON Holdings, the lossmaking property group, yesterday announced it was in talks with its bankers with a view to agreeing a financial restructuring by way of a company voluntary arrangement. The directors believe that, as a result of a revaluation of the company's assets, there is a shortfall in shareholders' funds of about Pounds 24m. They said it was essential for the company's future that there was an injection of new equity share capital. Talks were underway with a new potential investor which, together with a CVA, might lead to a resolution of its problems.</p>

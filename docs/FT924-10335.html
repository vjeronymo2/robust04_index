			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Experts cool on Treasury think tank SEVERAL leading monetarist economists responded coolly yesterday to the prospect of being invited to join a new Treasury committee to feed insights into the government's forecasting process. They said they might find it difficult to co-operate with the panel unless the Treasury changed tack on economic management and emphasised techniques to monitor the money supply. Mr Bill Martin, a monetarist who is chief UK economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'I would probably not want to join the group, unless it becomes clear that the panel is a definite effort to rethink policy and avoid the kind of mistakes made over the past few years.' Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University's economics department said he was 'disgusted' with the Treasury's approach to running the economy. He said the Treasury continued to pay too much importance to the value of the pound, and should instead have 'embraced monetary targets as a centrepiece of economic policy'. Mr Paul Turnbull, another monetarist who is chief UK economist at brokers Smith New Court, said he would want to find out exactly how the committee would fit in with policymaking before agreeing to any invitation to join. Mr Turnbull this week came top in an FT survey measuring economists' growth projections in the recession. Invitations to the panel are to be sent out shortly by Mr Alan Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser. The group is intended to provide innovative ideas to Treasury economists and thus help improve the accuracy of government projections on the economy. The panel of between six and 12 people is due to start up over the next few months. The Treasury said it wanted people with a spread of opinions on economics. People on the committee are likely to be mainly from the City and academic groups. The average forecast of private-sector economists is that the economy will contract by 0.8 per cent this year, according to the latest assessment by the Treasury of City and academic projections. The consensus is that output will grow 1.4 per cent next year.</p>

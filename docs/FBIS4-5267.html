			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Akihiko Ota] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, 9 Apr -- It was disclosed on 9 April  that North Korea (DPRK) had supplied, as a grant to Cambodian  Government forces, armored personnel carriers and tons of arms,  including shells. It was further reported that in late march  Government forces used the arms to successfully seize Pailin,  the Pol Pot faction's major stronghold. The disclosures to the  SANKEI SHIMBUN came from a Cambodian Army source in Phnom Penh,  and it can be seen that in doing this favor to the Cambodian  Government, North Korea aims to secure a beachhead which it can  use to break free of international isolation in the future.    The Cambodian Army source said six armored personnel  carriers  and tons of arms, including shells for howitzers, mortars and  small weapons, were and supplied to Cambodian Government forces  as a grant. The vehicles and arms were flown to Cambodia in  mid-February. He said North Korea has decided to provide tons  of additional ammunition by early April.    Cambodian Minister of National Defense Tie Banh has  reportedly flown to Pyongyang in profound secrecy to express  gratitude.    With North Korea's military assistance, Cambodian Government  forces started intensive shelling of the Pailin area in  mid-March and were able to seize Sala Krau, one of the Pol Pot  faction's strongholds, on 19 March, and then Pailin on 21 March.    The same source said: "Making a low assessment of the morale  and ammunition supplies of the government forces, the Pol Pot  faction stationed only 280 guards in Pailin city. The  government forces were, therefore, able to bring the city under  their control very quickly by surprise attack. Without North  Korea's supply of ammunition, it would have been impossible for  the government forces to subdue Pailin, and without its  additional assistance, they would not have been able to maintain  control over the city."    The same source disclosed that government forces worked out  a  plan to attack Anlong Veng, a stronghold in the northern  province of Siem Reap, and Pailin, the major stronghold in the  south, to mop up those members of the Pol Pot faction that  rejected any form of dialogue.    Anlong Veng was attacked first. However, lax discipline  within the government forces caused weapons and ammunition to  flow out onto the black market in large amounts. They subdued  Anlong Veng, but paid the price for allowing weaponry to be sold  off when they lost it again in February due to a shortage of  supplies.    The government, meanwhile, tried to get assistance from  neighboring allies, Vietnam and Laos. However, they turned down  the request, saying "nothing can be done to help Cambodia."    Desperately, the Cambodian Government called on North Korea  to assist by supplying arms through the North Korean embassy in  Phnom Penh. North Korea's response was to say that it would  provide "two shipments of arms in the form of a grant."    Asked why North Korea decided to provide arms to Cambodian  Government forces, the same source said: "Due to the nuclear  inspection issue, North Korea has become further isolated in the  international community. By doing a favor to Cambodia, which is  now the focus of international attention in Southeast Asia,  North Korea intends to obtain a future ally."    North Korean President Kim Il-song and Cambodian King  Norodom  Sihanouk have long maintained a relationship as allies since  President Kim provided support for King Sihanouk when he was  forced to flee the country because of a coup.    Every year King Sihanouk would visit Pyongyang and stay at a  luxurious villa reserved exclusively for him. North Korea's  decision to supply of arms to Cambodia at short notice was  likely made against the background of the "honeymoon  relationship" between President Kim and King Sihanouk.</p>

Liu Sung-fan, president of the ROC Legislative Yuan,  accompanied by Yuan Vice President Wang Ching-ping and  legislator Pan Wei-kang, is the most senior parliamentary leader  from Taiwan to visit Australia since Canberra switched its  recognition to Beijing in 1972, TECO representative Francias Li  said.    Li said Liu met Steven Martin, speaker of the Australian  House of Representatives, in Canberra. Liu told Martin that  Taiwan wanted to rejoin the UN because it is the world's 14th  largest trading nation and its foreign exchange reserves are  among the world's largest.    "Our country wants to play a role in the world community and  it's unfair that we are barred from the UN," Liu said.    Martin said he fully understood Taiwan's stance.    Liu and his party also met Senator Steven Loosley, chairman  of the joint committee of foreign affairs, defense and trade.  Liu asked Loosley to support Taiwan membership in the  Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF), he said in an interview.    Loosley and 10 members of parliament of the Australian  Labour  Party and the opposition told Liu they support Taiwan's APPF  membership bid and understand its aspirations to enter the UN,  Li said.    "The visit by President Liu will certainly help cement our  substantive ties with Australia," Li noted.    The delegation will leave for New Zealand on Thursday to  meet  their New Zealand counterparts before returning to Taipei on  February 6.</p>

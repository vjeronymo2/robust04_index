			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER'S STANCE ON GAYS AND LESBIANS  </P> <P> In response to Dannemeyer's comments, I think the congressman has done the  world a favor by removing all doubt about his identity as a hateful bigot. If  Californians are as "discriminating" as he suggests, then why have they  repeatedly rejected the congressman's radical proposals on AIDS and other  sensitive topics? If American citizens are such "discriminating people," then  why do they elect a vast majority to the House of Representatives and Senate  who repudiate Congressman Dannemeyer's simplistic and insensitive approach to  addressing the nation's health problems.  </P> <P> I can only hope that equally as discriminating voters in the 39th Congressional  District will one day wake up and realize who we have sent to Congress, and  give Dannemeyer the retirement he so justly deserves.  </P> <P> RICK BARONOWSKI  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

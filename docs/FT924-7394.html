			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Brick industry expects 1,000 jobs to be lost THE RECESSION in construction is expected to cost more than 1,000 jobs this year in the brick industry alone. The Brick Development Association estimates that the industry's workforce will have fallen by 37 per cent to 8,800 by the end of the year from a peak of 14,000 in December 1988. Manufacturers forecast further job losses and plant closures, with capacity continuing to outstrip demand in spite of previous closures and redundancies. The association expects sales of bricks to fall by a further 3.5 per cent this year to 3bn. That compares with an annual manufacturing capacity likely to remain at 3.7bn, which is a 24 per cent reduction from the peak of 4.85bn at the end of 1988. Stocks of bricks have soared as sales have slumped in the worst recession to hit housebuilding and commercial property development for more than half a century. The association says manufacturers are likely to be left with a stockpile of 1.52bn unsold bricks, equivalent to 30 weeks' supply, by the end of the year. About 60 per cent of brick sales are for housebuilding. Stocks held by manufacturers are estimated to be enough to build 150,000 homes. The industry is hoping that interest rate cuts and measures to reduce the stock of empty homes, announced in last week's Autumn Statement, will lead to a recovery in sales and prices later next year. Closures and redundancies by brick manufacturers since early summer have been announced by: Ibstock Johnsen, which intends to reduce its output from 280m bricks this year to 230m by the end of the 1994. This is likely to involve the closure of several smaller plants. Tarmac, which is closing four plants at Motherwell, Chesterfield, Kibblesworth in Tyne and Wear, and Avonmouth, near Bristol, reducing its capacity from 270m to 170m a year. Redland, which has closed six plants with a combined annual capacity of 170m following its merger with Steetley, a rival UK building materials company.</p>

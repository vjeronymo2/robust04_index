			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE STUDENTS BRING PETS TO KEEP VET PROGRAM ALIVE  </P> <P> Shortly after county officials removed animals from Pierce College last month,  Angela Daniel volunteered her pet cocker spaniel to fellow students practicing  veterinary skills.  </P> <P> When Ebony's turn came up last week, six students and an instructor from the  college's veterinary assistants training program practiced cleaning the small,  black dog's teeth as she lay anesthetized, her legs splayed and her pink tongue  lolling.  </P> <P> Ebony and the pets of 14 other students have become the program's sole source  of animals since officials from Los Angeles County's Department of Animal Care  and Control removed 14 dogs and cats from the school's kennels.  </P> <P> County officials decided to return the animals to the county's Agoura Hills  shelter about four weeks ago after animal rights activists objected to their  use in teaching Pierce students clinical procedures such as insertion of  catheters and intravenous tubes.  </P> <P> "We're not saying the animals we removed were in pain or traumatized," said  Bruce P. Richards, assistant director of the county department, when he  announced the decision last month. "But we never agreed to let the students use  them to learn how to insert catheters or intravenous tubes, or take X-rays or  blood."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Student Experience  </P> <P> The county's removal of the animals -- lost dogs and cats that were claimed by  no one and that were scheduled for euthanasia by the county -- has left Pierce  in a quandary. Phil Des Marteau, director of the college's animal health  technology program, said that unless the college finds a larger supply of dogs  and cats soon, students will not get enough hands-on experience to become  competent veterinary assistants.  </P> <P> Des Marteau said he hopes shelter officials will change their minds and  eventually resume supplying the program with animals. He said the animals are  sedated to make the procedures, such as drawing blood, as painless as possible.  </P> <P> But animal rights activists say stricter regulation of the college's use of  animals, including banning procedures that are not necessary for the animals'  health, should be established first. They said students get enough practical  experience working with animals during internships at animal hospitals and  other facilities.  </P> <P> "We do not have the right to cause the slightest unnecessary pain, discomfort  or fear to sentient beings, especially when knowledge can be gained in other  ways by using a little ingenuity," said Aaron Leider, a spokesman for the North  Hollywood-based animal rights group, Last Chance for Animals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clear Understanding  </P> <P> Brian Berger, director of Animal Care and Control, said the earliest the county  would resume supplying the college with animals would be next fall. He said  that before that happened, he "would want an understanding so clear that there  was nothing that could be perceived by anyone as misuse of animals."  </P> <P> Throughout California, officials at public and private animal shelters have  become more hesitant in recent years to lend animals to teaching institutions,  say veterinary instructors at schools statewide.  </P> <P> As a result, the six community colleges and several private vocational schools  that train veterinary assistants have been increasingly forced to rely on the  willingness of students to volunteer their pets for laboratory sessions.  Sometimes they call on other sources, such as program supporters willing to  donate animals.  </P> <P> "The climate today is very tense," said Joe S. Gloyd, assistant director of the  American Veterinary Medical Assn., which accredits 62 animal health technology  programs in the United States. "The number of animals used for instructional  purposes has really diminished as a result. The bottom line is students come  out less qualified to care for clients' animals because they've had less  practice."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strict Guidelines  </P> <P> In rare cases when agencies do lend animals, strict guidelines govern their  use. For instance, the Pomona Humane Society lends Mt. San Antonio Community  College in Walnut about 25 dogs per year, said Chuck Hewitt, coordinator of the  college's agricultural sciences department. The agreement allows the school to  perform only necessary procedures, such as spaying and neutering, and animals  cannot be kept longer than overnight, Hewitt said.  </P> <P> "We do take some heat from students and the industry that our graduates aren't  as proficient at inserting intravenous catheters as they would be if they had  more chances to practice," Hewitt said. "But I'd rather take the heat than have  people tell me we're cruel to animals."  </P> <P> The agreement between Pierce and Los Angeles County was not as specific about  allowable procedures and time limits as the pact at Mt. San Antonio.  </P> <P> The county's agreement, spelled out in a 1982 letter from Des Marteau,  explained the treatment of animals the college had formerly received from the  Veterans Administration hospital in West Los Angeles. County officials inferred  that cats and dogs from the shelter would be treated in a similar manner, said  Richards.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treated for Ailments  </P> <P> Animals from the VA were treated for any ailments they had, the letter said.  Students "give them their vaccinations, and blanket them with loving  attention." In return, the letter said, students "learn how to give injections,  how to restrain properly, and how to make critical evaluations of the animal's  health."  </P> <P> At the end of an animal's stay, which ranged from three weeks to three months,  students in the program would try to find them homes, the letter said. It also  said that "at no time are the animals experimented on or are they used for any  research project."  </P> <P> County officials said they did not realize until last month that animals were  being put under general anesthesia about once a month so students could  practice such procedures as inserting catheters, drawing blood and giving  injections.  </P> <P> Des Marteau said that a dog might be injected five to 10 times in the course of  a lab session, but said that "there is no trauma" because the animal is  sedated. However, county officials withdrew the animals after learning of the  procedures through citizens' complaints. Techniques practiced at the college  are "not medical experimentation, but we have the public's confidence to  consider, in addition to the fact that they're not doing what's stated in the  1982 correspondence," Richards said last month at a press conference announcing  the removal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Student Upset  </P> <P> The withdrawal of the animals upset Daniel, 22, of Ventura, who said she is  studying to become one of about 18,000 veterinary assistants in the nation  because "I love animals, not because I want to hurt them. If there was anything  wrong with what we were doing -- if the animals felt anything -- I wouldn't let  them use Ebony."  </P> <P> In the search for alternatives to animals that come from shelters, some  programs have purchased animals, said Paul F. Cook, a veterinarian and  president-elect of the Assn. of Veterinary Technician Educators.  </P> <P> But Pierce lacks the funds to spend $200 to $500 per animal, Des Marteau said.  Enrollment in the college's program, and consequently funding, has declined in  recent years, although the demand for veterinary assistants has increased, he  said.  </P> <P> Fewer people are studying to become veterinary assistants because it is not a  lucrative field, said Gloyd of the American Veterinary Medical Assn. Annual  salaries for veterinary assistants, most of whom are female, range from about  $11,000 to $25,000, depending on experience, Gloyd said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> School-Owned Animals  </P> <P> Some programs, such as the one at Cosumnes River College in Sacramento, house  groups of school-owned animals on campus and find homes for them at the end of  each school year. The animals are donated by program supporters because using  strays can present legal problems, school officials said.  </P> <P> At Cosumnes River College, for example, strays were used after they had gone  unclaimed for two weeks until a local animal rights group objected on grounds  that the animals' owners might still be trying to find them, said Cheryl Buch,  an animal health technology instructor at the college. The animals were sent to  shelters after the group objected, she said.  </P> <P> "I think it's a total waste to send those animals to the shelters where most of  them will be destroyed," Buch said. "When they join our colony, they are only  used four times a year and are adopted out in the summer."  </P> <P> Des Marteau also pointed out that one effect of the Pierce program is to extend  the lives of animals that otherwise might be destroyed at county shelters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quality of Life  </P> <P> But Barbara Fabricant, president of the Humane Task Force, a private, nonprofit  organization based in Canoga Park, said: "An animal is not an inanimate object  to be practiced on. I strongly believe it's not life, it's the quality of life  that counts."  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles also would rather see animals put to death than have  them used in Pierce's program or for any other medical purpose, said Walter E.  Ziegler, chief veterinarian for the city Department of Animal Regulation. In  fiscal year 1986-87, shelter officials put to death 60,671 or about 68% of the  89,357 live dogs and cats they received, Ziegler said.  </P> <P> But Gloyd disagreed, saying "waking up from anesthesia is better than not  waking up at all."  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: East Asiatic faces shake-up THE EAST Asiatic Company, the shipping and international trading group, faces an urgent need to cut debt and restructure its capital this year, according to Mr Michael Fiorini, the chief executive, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The company fell into the red last year with a loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 184m), compared with a profit of DKr245m in the previous 12 months. The loss cuts EAC's equity capital from DKr3.14bn in 1991 to DKr1.75bn last year. EAC will not pay a dividend this year after a 9 per cent pay-out in 1991.</p>

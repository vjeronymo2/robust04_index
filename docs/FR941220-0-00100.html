ETA is also responsible for compiling and maintaining a list of labor condition applications and makes such list available for public examination at the Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N4456, Washington, DC 20210. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Employment Standards Administration (ESA), DOL, is responsible, in accordance with subpart I of this part, for investigating and determining, pursuant to a complaint or otherwise, an employer's misrepresentation in or failure to comply with labor condition applications or the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Department of State (DOS) responsibilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) accepts the employer's petition (INS Form I&hyph;129) with the DOL-certified labor condition application attached. INS is responsible for approving the nonimmigrant's H&hyph;1B visa classification. In doing so, the INS determines whether the occupation named in the labor condition application is a specialty occupation or whether the individual is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability, and whether the qualifications of the nonimmigrant meet the statutory requirements for H&hyph;1B visa classification. If the petition is approved, INS will notify the U.S. Consulate where the nonimmigrant intends to apply for the visa unless the nonimmigrant is in the U.S. and eligible to adjust status without leaving this country. See 8 U.S.C. 1184(i). The Department of State, through U.S. Embassies and Consulates, is responsible for issuing H&hyph;1B visas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Employer's responsibilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Each employer seeking an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability has several responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The employer shall submit a completed labor condition application on Form ETA 9035 and one copy to the regional office of ETA serving the area where the nonimmigrant will be employed. If the labor condition application is certified by ETA, a copy will be returned to the employer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The employer shall make a filed labor condition application and necessary supporting documentation (as identified under this subpart) available for public examination at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of employment within one working day after the date on which the labor condition application is filed with ETA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The employer then may submit a copy of the certified labor condition application to INS with a completed petition (INS Form I&hyph;129) requesting H&hyph;1B classification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The employer should not allow the nonimmigrant worker to begin work, even though a labor condition application has been certified by DOL, until INS grants the worker authorization to work in the United States for that employer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The employer shall develop sufficient documentation to meet its burden of proof with respect to the validity of the statements made in its labor condition application and the accuracy of information provided in the event that such statement or information is challenged. The employer shall also maintain such documentation at its principal place of business in the U.S. and shall make such documentation available to DOL for inspection and copying upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> .710 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Complaints. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Complaints concerning misrepresentation in the labor condition application or failure of the employer to meet a condition specified in the application shall be filed with the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division (Administrator), ESA, according to the procedures set forth in subpart I of this part.

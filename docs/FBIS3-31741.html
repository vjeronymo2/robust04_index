Tudor's  `Objectionable' Attacks"]    [Text] "Esteemed Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, I would like  to reassure you on this occasion too, of the affection I nurture  for you. It is my duty to say this now, at a moment when your  life and the work carried out by you are denigrated publicly in  an abominable manner," reads the open letter that Adrian  Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies, sent to Traian  Chebeleu, the spokesman of President Ion Iliescu.    Without spelling out the name C.V. Tudor -- or of the  magazine ROMANIA MARE, for that matter -- Adrian Nastase  vehemently disapproved of the calumnies published in the  aforementioned weekly about the presidency's spokesman: "You  will always be above such calumny which, as far as you are  concerned, will never be approved or believed."    In conclusion of the document sent to Traian Chebeleu,  Adrian  Nastase mentions: "I choose this way to write to you because I  also wish to sound the alarm signal that has not been heard for  a long time. Without suggesting actions that would limit the  rights and the power of the press, I believe that it is  necessary for the newspaper guild to display an ethical and  concrete solidarity that should isolate and eliminate from the  journalistic world the filthy attack -- no matter in what paper  it is published -- that is multiplied on the rotary printing  press."</p>

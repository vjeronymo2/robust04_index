			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN TO CANDIDATES  </P> <P> The voters of all San Diego County will shortly have the opportunity to express  themselves in the most momentous criminal justice system decision in two  decades. In selecting the leadership for the Sheriff's Department in the June 5  primary, they may well be setting the tone for law enforcement leadership for  the county in the foreseeable future.  </P> <P> Much has been made over the leadership style of John Duffy. Whatever one thinks  of that style, it cannot be denied that, during the very difficult governmental  time of Proposition 13 management, he has led the department to a position of  national preeminence in several areas.  </P> <P> If what we wish to change most is the personality at the top, we would do well  to listen to not only what the candidates say, but also how they say it. Jack  Drown has been termed a Duffy "clone," but in his statements he sounds  reasoned, ethical and responsible. The candidate from the city school board  sounds more political, more confrontational and more childish.  </P> <P> Methinks Jim Roache doth protest too much.  </P> <P> BILL SOUTHWELL  </P> <P> Ocean Beach  </P></p>

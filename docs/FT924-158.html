			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Collor quits but senate votes to continue impeachment process THE BRAZILIAN senate pressed ahead last night with the impeachment of Mr Fernando Collor de Mello over corruption charges, despite the president's resignation in an attempt to halt the decisive session of his trial. The vote to continue the impeachment process, by 73 to 8, brought to a climax the battle over the political career of Mr Collor, who had been suspended from office since September when Congress approved the impeachment charges. Final impeachment of Mr Collor, which would require a two-thirds majority of senators and which looked likely last night, would lead to his being banned from public office for eight years. By resigning, Mr Collor loses his presidential immunity. He could face criminal charges. A spokesman for Mr Collor said 'the president had resigned because the whole country knew that the sentence was already delivered'. The senate decision to proceed with impeachment came despite a request from Mr Collor's lawyer for the hearing to be halted, given that the president had resigned. Mr Itamar Franco, who had been acting president and who was sworn in yesterday as Mr Collor's successor, is expected to address the nation this morning. Last night, at the presidential palace, he described the new economic order in Brazil as 'unjust' and said it had to be changed. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the foreign minister, said: 'This will now allow us to get on with governing the country.' After a volatile session the Sao Paulo stock market closed down 1.2 per cent. The parliamentary drama began when the Supreme Court chief justice called on Mr Collor's attorney, Mr Jose Moura Rocha, to begin questioning his first witness. The lawyer said he had spoken to Mr Collor and that the president would resign. He then passed a note in Mr Collor's hand to senate president Mauro Benevides which said: 'I am resigning my mandate as president of the republic, a position to which I was elected in the elections of November 15 and December 17 1989.' Mr Franco, 62, read the oath of office before a roaring gallery of supporters singing the national anthem and chanting: 'The people united will never be defeated.' People in the galleries tossed T-shirts emblazoned with 'Collorbuster' to the Chamber of Deputies and teenage activists cheered the inauguration. Brazil's beached playboy bows out, Page 2</p>

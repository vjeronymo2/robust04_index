			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER SLAIN, GIRL AIDS IN SEIZING SUSPECT  </P> <P> Barefoot, dirty and frightened, three young children wandered up to the Mission  Bay visitor's center and told a horrifying story of how their mother was  brutally killed by a courthouse security guard she had turned to in a desperate  plea for help for her homeless family.  </P> <P> The ingenuity of the oldest child, a 10-year-old girl, who kept notes of their  three days with the stranger, led to the arrest Friday of 31-year-old Kevin  Kulo, a private security guard at the downtown San Diego County Courthouse. The  girl was able to describe to police how Kulo allegedly beat her mother, put her  body in a bag and dumped it off Murphy Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Police said the girls, ages 10 and 4, and their 2-year-old brother apparently  witnessed the death of their mother, Mary Jo Zavala, 34. Police are also  investigating the oldest girl's report that she was allegedly handcuffed by  Kulo after she jumped on his back when he tried to rape her 4-year-old sister.  </P> <P> "All of the cases we deal with are tragic enough," said homicide Lt. Gary  Learn. "But when you get children involved, that adds another whole dimension."  </P> <P> Ted Jardine, the owner of the Mission Bay Visitor's Information Center, broke  into tears Friday when he described how the oldest girl, waiting for police in  his office Thursday, doodled on a note pad these words: "Mom come back" and  "Kevin, you'll pay for this."  </P> <P> "I looked at her and then saw all these strained looks on everybody's face, and  tears were coming down all the cheeks of our employees," he said. "It was gut  wrenching."  </P> <P> In discussing the information the 10-year-old girl gave police, Learn said,  "Her help was very crucial."  </P> <P> He said she provided a detailed description of the suspect, the color of his  uniform and specifics about his blue car and brown-and-white trailer, all of  which were pivotal in helping authorities locate Kulo on Friday morning in El  Cajon.  </P> <P> He was arrested inside the trailer while it was parked near Orange and Cypress  avenues. By Friday night, he was booked on suspicion of murder and was being  held in the downtown County Jail, where he had worked as a private security  guard under contract with the county.  </P> <P> County officials said Kulo was a member of the Equity Security force and had  worked on and off for the county since 1985.  </P> <P> Police said Kulo had no permanent address and lived in his trailer, often  moving to different locations within the county.  </P> <P> Authorities said the children told detectives that their mother took her family  to the courthouse Tuesday, where she approached Kulo, and sought his help for  her homeless family.  </P> <P> "They apparently started up a short relationship after they met," Learn said.  </P> <P> Zavala's body was found about 1 p.m. Wednesday, in the gulch off Interstate 15  and Murphy Canyon Road. The children remained with Kulo Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The oldest girl said Kulo dropped them off Thursday at Mission Bay. Workers at  the Mission Bay visitors center said they spotted the children about 1 p.m.  outside their booth near Interstate 5 and Clairemont Drive. The kids were  barefoot, their clothing full of dirt and sand.  </P> <P> The oldest girl had a book with her notes and several dollars folded inside.  Police said the girl told them that the money had come from the man who killed  her mother. She also said that she had promised him that she would not tell  anyone what he had done.  </P> <P> But she told police that she had also promised God that she would never lie.  </P></p>

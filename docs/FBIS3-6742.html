			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, March 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Chang-su, deputy  chief of the Havana mission of the South Korean National  Democratic Front (Hanminjon), called a press conference here on  March 15 and exposed the dangerous nature of the nuclear frenzy  of the South Korean puppet clique.    He disclosed that a huge amount of nuclear waste has  annually  come from the nuclear power stations now under operation in  South Korea and their storing facilities in South Korea have  already reached the limit.    South Korea has turned into a nuclear powder magazine in the  true sense of the term due to the nuclear weapons development  manoeuvrings of the puppet clique and the deployment of more  than one thousand nuclear weapons of the U.S. forces, he noted.    He referred to the racket kicked up by the puppets over the  fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North as an intrigue to cover  up their nuclear armament.    Nuclear threat comes from the South, not from the North, he  said, adding that the South Korean authorities should  unconditionally and immediately get the U.S. nuclear weapons,  the hotbed of a nuclear war, withdrawn and discontinue for good  the "Team Spirit" manoeuvres that may cause a nuclear war.</p>

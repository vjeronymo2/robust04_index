[passage omitted]    On behalf of the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Committee, Guan  Guangfu delivered a work report amid warm applause. He said:  The current congress will strive to accomplish the following  tasks: 1) To implement conscientiously the spirit of the 14th  CPC Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; 2) To review and sum up Hubei's practice and  experience over the last five years, and especially its  experience over the last decade, since the reform and opening  up; 3) To define clearly the future tasks and goals; 4) To  elect a new provincial party committee and a new provincial  discipline inspection commission; 5) To mobilize the broad  masses of party members, cadres, and people in Hubei to further  emancipate their minds; open up new vistas; forge ahead into the  future; firmly grasp the current historic opportunity;  vigorously press ahead with reform and opening up; push Hubei's  economic development onto a new stage; and achieve the grand  goal of having a comparatively well-off livelihood in Hubei by  the end of the century.    Guan Guangfu's work report was entitled "Emancipate the  Mind,  Grasp Opportunities, Vigorously Push Ahead With Reform and  Opening Up, Strive To Attain the Grand Goal of Achieving a  Comparatively Well-off Livelihood in Hubei at a Faster Pace!"  It was divided into the following three parts: 1) A Review of  Past Five Years; 2) Strategic Goals and Main Tasks for the  1990s; 3) Step Up Party Building and Improve Party Leadership.  The work report contained approximately 25,000 characters.    Reviewing Hubei's work over the past five years, Guan  Guangfu  said: Over the past five years, the broad masses of cadres and  people in Hubei have implemented comprehensively the party's  basic line; have acquired an in-depth understanding of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; have further emancipated their minds; have made  constant efforts to explore, in light of Hubei's realities, new  ways and means aimed at deepening reform, expediting  development, and smoothly attaining the strategic goal of making  Hubei rise in central China; have persistently deepened all  reforms; have further expanded opening up to the outside world;  have gradually accelerated the pace of economic development; and  correspondingly have improved people's livelihood. Over the  past five years, party committees at all levels in Hubei have  grasped persistently and simultaneously the two key aspects of  work; have taken the overall situation into account; and have  united and guided the broad masses of party members, cadres, and  people in unswervingly forging ahead and constantly opening up  new vistas.    After fully affirming Hubei's achievements in four main  sectors in the last five years, Guan Guangfu stated: Now that  the entire country is accelerating the pace of reform and  opening up, and now that many fraternal provinces and  municipalities are accelerating their economic development, we  face increasingly keen market competition. Should we fail to  accelerate our own development, we soon will find ourselves  lagging behind. In view of this situation, we should strive to  develop a sense of crisis, of urgency, of historical  responsibility; we should seize each and every opportunity;  accelerate development; catch up with and overtake others;  safeguard Hubei's position as a strong industrial base; and live  up to the ardent expectations of the more than 50 million  diligent and talented Hubei people.    Guan Guangfu maintained that Hubei's practice over the past  five years has fully attested to the great importance of  adhering to the party's basic line under the guidance of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We  should work in a creative manner and in light of Hubei's  realities. Speaking specifically, we should focus on the  following six work aspects: 1) To vigorously step up  theoretical study and ideological transformation and to  constantly emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts; 2)  To more clearly understand that development is the last word [fa  zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810] and  to unswervingly unify speed, efficiency, and reserve strength;  3) To deepen reform, expand opening up, and build a socialist  market economic structure in a more expeditious manner; 4) To  make overall arrangements and constantly optimize Hubei's train  of thought and strategic layout; 5) To continually allow  overall policies to create a micro-atmosphere and bring into  full play the enthusiasm and creativity of all areas and all  quarters; 6) To carry out party building successfully and to  grasp both key aspects of work firmly and at the same time.    Speaking of Hubei's strategic goals and main tasks for the  1990s, Guan Guangfu observed: In the 1990s, Hubei should strive  to attain the following 11 basic goals: 1) To maintain average  annual gross national product growth at or above 9.2 percent;  2) To gradually push economic growth onto three new stages; 3)  To have tasks outlined in the province's eighth five-year plan  fulfilled by 1994 -- one year ahead of schedule; 4) To have  gross national product quadrupled by 1997 -- three years ahead  of schedule; 5) To raise gross national product to more than  200 billion yuan on the basis of constant prices recorded in  1990; 6) To rapidly raise total rural social output value,  industrial output value, and tertiary industrial output value;  7) To raise the technical and equipment level of all major  trades and professions to or near the country's advanced level;  8) To strengthen overall scientific and technological capacity  by a large margin; 9) To have nine-year compulsory education  basically implemented, juvenile illiteracy eradicated, and labor  quality comprehensively improved across the province; 10) To  extend afforestation and improve the ecological environment to a  great extent; 11) To raise the net per capita income of  peasants to 1,400 yuan, eradicate poverty in poverty- stricken  areas, and raise the average net per capita subsistence income  of urban residents by 6 percent or more annually.    Guan Guangfu stated: In order to attain all grand goals set  for the 1990s, we should make every possible endeavor to  accomplish the following 13 major tasks: 1) To vigorously press  ahead with all reforms; 2) To rapidly build a socialist market  economic structure; 3) To expeditiously expand opening up to the  outside world; 4) To energetically expand the proportion of the  export-oriented economy; 5) To readjust and optimize the  economic structure; 6) To improve the overall provincial  national economic quality, as well as its structural efficiency;  7) To further perfect the province's regional economic layout  by devoting more energies to developing and exploiting the  Changjiang economic belt; 8) To comprehensively implement the  strategy of developing Hubei by virtue of scientific,  technological, and educational development; 9) To actively and  persistently build socialist democracy and the legal system;  10) To firmly grasp both key aspects of work at the same time;  11) To step up socialist spiritual civilization building; 12)  To conscientiously implement all basic national policies, such  as family planning, land management, and environmental  protection; 13) To constantly heighten people's living  standards and improve the quality of their livelihood.    Speaking of stepping up party building and improving party  leadership, Guan Guangfu noted: Stepping up party building and  improving party leadership are the key to enabling Hubei to  enter the market economy orbit, to attain the desired economic  construction goals, to consolidate and develop a lively  political situation of stability and unity, and to promote  two-civilizations building to a new stage. Thus we should make  unreserved efforts to concentrate on the following nine work  aspects: 1) To profoundly study the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics; 2) To build strong  leading bodies,as well as competent contingents of cadres; 3)  To step up the building of party style and clean government and  resolutely further the anticorruption struggle; 4) To build  strong party organizations, as well as competent contingents of  party members at the grass-roots level; 5) To persist in the  system of democratic centralism and strengthen vitality of the  party organizations; 6) To strengthen leadership over  propaganda and ideological work, and create a favorable social  and public-opinion environment for reform, opening up, and  economic construction; 7) Party committees at all levels in  Hubei should adhere to economic construction as the center, take  overall interests into account, and have the overall situation  well in hand; 8) To strengthen unity within the party and among  the whole people so as to consolidate and develop a patriotic  united front in the new historical period; 9) To constantly  improve work style, seek truth, and carry out work in a  down-to-earth and thoroughgoing manner.    Guan Guangfu concluded: As we are facing onerous tasks and  shouldering heavy responsibilities in the 1990s, we should  implement the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the spirit of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in  an in- depth manner; mobilize the broad masses of party members  and people in Hubei; work with one heart and one mind;  constantly strive to become stronger; vigorously forge ahead  into the future and improve work; firmly grasp the current  golden opportunity; bring about a historic revolution with  regard to reform and opening up, a great leap forward in  economic construction, and gradual improvement of people's  livelihood; strive to successfully fulfill all tasks laid down  at the current congress; and greet the forthcoming 21st century  with a new attitude!    Also sitting on the rostrum were: Han Ningfu, Liu Huinong,  Ni Erzhong, Li Wei, Sen Yinluo, and some other veteran comrades  who were invited to attend the congress, as well as figures from  the provincial branches of various democratic parties and  well-known firgures without party affiliation, including Shen  Kechang, Zhou Zibai, Dai Jianneng, Ping Linbo, Wang Zizuo, Han  Nanpeng, and others, all of whom were invited to attend the  congress as guests. In addition, persons in charge of the  relevant party institutions also attended the congress as  non-voting delegates.</p>

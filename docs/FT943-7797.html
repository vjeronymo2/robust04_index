			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Attractive Italians - Appetisers Asda has a particularly good range of Italian wines this summer, and its prices are keen. Barbera d'Asti 1990 Gemma is just Pounds 3.99 and is bursting with ripe, chestnut and fruit flavours, displaying bite but not harshness. Chianti Classico 1990 Quercia al Poggio at Pounds 4.99 is an underpriced plum cleverly extracted from the somewhat dubious pie that is modern Chianti (which can offer DOCG wines, supposedly Italy's crema della crema, for sale at Pounds 2.99). Maurizio Castelli is oenologist at this fine estate, and the seductively fragrant, substantial wine has benefited from its stint in new French barrels. A chance for city slickers to enjoy a free lunch next month. The second City food and wine fair is being held at Sutton's Hospital, Charterhouse, London on September 22 from 11am until 7pm. Some of the city of London's best-known food businesses will be offering product samples including: Ashby's, the butcher's and Ashdown, the fishmongers, both of Leadenhall market; City Herbs, of New Spitalfields Market; Philip Dade boulangerie and patisserie, of Middlesex; Mostly Smoked, of south London; Spicers Hampers, of Kent and many more. Not only is it an opportunity to sample a glass of Jacquesson 'Perfection' brut non-vintage champagne, courtesy of Mayfair Cellars (which is organising the tasting), but you can probably drink it from a Riedel glass, too. Admission is by invitation only. If you would like one, send details of your company and position to: John Trendell, Mayfair Cellars, 14 Rushworth Street, London, SE1 ORB. Tel: 071-928 8899 or fax: 071-401 8041. Snod's welsh pork and leek sausage. Now there's a name to conjure with. Particularly as the sausage is being produced by two brothers, Hugo and Oliver Woolley, in Kent. Their traditional hand-linked products, using prime cuts of meat, natural casings and no artificial additives, are drawing a loyal following in Tunbridge Wells. The shop offers 18 varieties. I like the sound of Mrs Goudini's Italian sausage - coarse ground pork, garlic, Italian wine, oregano and basil - and also Alan Woodward's Sussex Village sausage with herbs, spices, juniper and a hint of gin. Freezer packs are available but there is no mail order service - yet. The address is: The Hugo Oliver Sausage Shop, 37 Monson Road, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TNI 1LS. (Tel: 0892-545644). JJ Talking of sausages . . . those who want to make their own can obtain casings from The Natural Casings Company, PO Box 133, Farnham, Surrey, GU10 5HT. Tel: 0252-850454. Fax 0252-851284. A Pounds 5.50 pack of hog casings (post and packing included) contains 25 yards (enough to make 20lbs of sausages), seasoning, plus instructions and recipes.</p>

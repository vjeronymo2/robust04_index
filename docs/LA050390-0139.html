			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD UNCLE SAM GET INVOLVED IN TECHNOLOGY AS A VENTURE CAPITALIST?;  </P> <P> POLICY: A SHAKE-UP AT A FEDERAL AGENCY HAS FANNED THE DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S LINKS TO INDUSTRY SHOULD BE EXPANDED.  </P> <P> Little Lanxide Corp. was barely a spot on the map of the vast chemical and  materials industry dominated by the likes of Dow and Du Pont until, less than a  year after its birth in 1983, Lanxide was tapped on the shoulder by an obscure  Pentagon agency.  </P> <P> Getting anointed with a mere $1 million from the government gave Lanxide the  credibility it needed to attract $250 million more from private investors and  big corporate partners, including its Delaware neighbor Du Pont Co.  </P> <P> Today Lanxide employs 350 people and is on the verge of seeing its versatile  ceramic materials incorporated into protective shields for soldiers and tanks  as well as industrial uses ranging from airplane parts to mining equipment.  </P> <P> Stories like Lanxide's, of how a little money from the small Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency has made a big difference, are likely to be told with  growing passion around Washington these days as the debate resumes over the  role of government in sustaining certain industries.  </P> <P> Ignited by the abrupt removal late last month of the Pentagon agency's earnest  director, Craig Fields, the squabble threatens to drag once-obscure DARPA into  a messy political bout that insiders fear could irreparably damage what is  widely acclaimed to be among the most effective of all federal agencies.  </P> <P> Although he probably never meant to play the role, Fields, in his year as  DARPA's outspoken chief, had come to symbolize the view that the nation must  make a dramatic shift away from the arm's-length government-business  relationship that has seen it through four decades of stunning industrial  growth.  </P> <P> Popular on Capitol Hill, but anathema to the Bush Administration, is the notion  that government should somehow help shore up certain key industries -- not  specific companies, but underlying commercial technologies such as the making  of computer chips and advanced materials -- in the same way that it played a  role in building a national transportation system of highways and railroads.  </P> <P> "There is a turning point," said Bell Laboratories President Ian Ross. "The  government should not just be supporting basic research but it also should be  supporting generic, precompetitive technology that does have an impact on our  industrial strength."  </P> <P> With the worldwide easing of military tensions, the simmering debate over  whether government should play a larger role in key areas of the private sector  -- so-called industrial policy -- is growing more complex. More than ever,  economic competitiveness is an important factor in the global balance of power,  blurring the lines between what is good for the military and what is good for  the economy.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration would generally prefer that the government stick to  weapons, period. But beyond that is an assortment of positions, ranging from  those who want a stronger industrial base because it's good for the Pentagon to  those who say government involvement can be justified, much like in Japan, on  purely economic grounds.  </P> <P> But instead of closing the book on this nagging debate, as the Administration  apparently had hoped, the mysterious transfer of Fields by Pentagon higher-ups  would seem to throw it wide open, offering a window of opportunity to business  and political leaders who back a variety of proposals for expanding  government's links with industry.  </P> <P> How did DARPA land in the center of the dispute?  </P> <P> The reason is that the maverick agency has been remarkably successful at doing  just what Administration ideology abhors: meddling in the private sector as a  sort of high-tech venture capitalist.  </P> <P> "The record of DARPA is spectacular," said C. Gordon Bell, a noted computer  designer and the former assistant director of the National Science Foundation.  "It's the only part of the government that is producing anything that is  keeping the country afloat."  </P> <P> Founded in reaction to the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik, DARPA has shown  considerable skill at fulfilling its charter to pursue "high-risk" technologies  with potentially high payoffs. Sheltered from the whipsaw of partisan politics,  its clubby, sometimes cocky technologists, many armed with Ph.D.s and a nonstop  sense of excitement, are given considerable latitude to put money into projects  at both universities and companies.  </P> <P> Operating out of shabby quarters in a Rosslyn, Va., office building, the staff  of 140 oversees a budget of $1.2 billion, just 3% of the Pentagon's research  and development funding and slightly more than 1% of total federal R&amp;D  spending.  </P> <P> All along, the thrust of DARPA's efforts has been to strengthen the military --  not industry. It backed some of the early research leading to the Stealth  aircraft, for example. It funded work on a type of acoustic sensor, shunned at  first by the Navy but later adopted for submarine tracking. It developed  techniques for simulating combat now used by the Army to train soldiers. And  the agency, having funded research in seismic detection of nuclear blasts,  advises U.S. participants in disarmament talks.  </P> <P> The unit has also had its share of flops. After spending $200 million, it  closed the books two years ago on an experimental combination  helicopter-airplane. Another project that has fallen short was a scheme to use  so-called artificial intelligence to guide a combat vehicle over rough terrain.  </P> <P> While most of its money goes to specialized Pentagon projects, the agency is  better known for its uncanny ability, proven long before the buzzword "dual  use" came into vogue, to delicately finesse research results with both civilian  and military payoffs.  </P> <P> Sometimes, as in the case of Lanxide, the projects begin with purely military  intentions. Acting quickly, after only two months of talks, DARPA seeded  Lanxide with the initial $1 million in the hopes of spawning a ceramic material  that could be used for armor.  </P> <P> "One of the things that was important to the company was finding somebody  outside that was technically qualified that could say, yes, this is  significant, or it isn't," said President Marc Newkirk, who was an unemployed  materials scientist before founding Lanxide. DARPA's nod, he said, helped the  fledgling firm attract private funding to leverage its research into commercial  products.  </P> <P> Other DARPA projects begin with less specific targets but only a sense that the  generic technologies would somehow benefit national defense. So it was with  DARPA's backing of research that proved seminal in the advancement of computer  science, including the design of fast microprocessor chips and techniques for  sending data over telephone lines.  </P> <P> Some say he's wildly exaggerating, but Michael Dertouzos, director of the  Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  figures that $1 billion funneled out by DARPA over 25 years spawned half of a  $400-billion computer and computer-related industry.  </P> <P> In perhaps the most dramatic example, a clutch of Stanford University computer  scientists working a decade ago under DARPA contracts acted on the agency's  encouragement to set up private companies. Three of the resulting firms -- Sun  Microsystems, MIPS Computer Systems and Silicon Graphics -- today employ 12,000  people and have combined annual sales of roughly $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> "The developments we did on DARPA budgets were things other companies were  ignoring," said Andreas Bechtolsheim, a Sun co-founder and vice president of  technology. "Without DARPA, it might never have happened this way."  </P> <P> To those who believe in an expanded role for the government as an industrial  godfather, DARPA's Fields had emerged as an unlikely hero. Seeming to worry  about commercial competitiveness, he has expressed concern, for instance, over  the increasing number of U.S. high-tech firms falling into Japanese hands.  </P> <P> Among 151 firms that control the U.S. industry producing semiconductor  equipment, for example, more than 30 have been acquired or received funding  from Japanese firms in the past three years.  </P> <P> Fields, who declined to comment for this story, has been a firm proponent of  Sematech, the novel semiconductor-manufacturing research center funded by both  DARPA and private industry.  </P> <P> He strongly advocated -- but backed with a relatively meager $30 million --  efforts to revive a large-scale consumer electronics industry by fostering  research in high-definition television displays. And most recently, in a move  that may have led to his transfer, Fields authorized funding of a small Silicon  Valley chip firm under a new program that allows DARPA to share financially in  the company's success.  </P> <P> But none of these efforts actually represents radical departures from some of  DARPA's earlier activities. "What (Fields) was doing could have been justified  in terms of just building the defense technology base," said William Perry, a  former undersecretary of defense and now a matchmaker for high-tech firms. "He  seems to have been caught in a semantics war of whether it was industrial  policy or whether it was doing just well-conceived defense technology  programs."  </P> <P> What did rankle Pentagon bosses, according to Administration sources, is that  Fields and DARPA were swept into the limelight. Bright and articulate,  43-year-old Fields played well with high-tech industrialists and on Capitol  Hill, where he appeared at least to ally with Democrats who have "economic  competitiveness" high on their political agenda.  </P> <P> The official word from the Pentagon is that nothing will change at DARPA except  the person at the top. Many outsiders, however, think the agency will be  expected to tie its funding more closely to specific military projects,  shunting aside anything that might smell of bolstering industry, even in the  interests of defense.  </P></p>

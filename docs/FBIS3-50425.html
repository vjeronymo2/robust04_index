Contrary to a report by the deputy health  director, Health Minister Lisandro Vasquez Sosa reported that  this is the beginning of a new outbreak. Four people have died  and 700 have been affected by the cholera bacteria since 24  December.    [Begin Vasquez recording] Medical personnel are on alert at  all health centers. [end recording]    Health officials declared the emergency after 700 cases of  this mortal epidemic were reported, an epidemic that is again  taking its toll.    [Begin Vasquez recording] Today we have a complete  laboratory study, and this is why we say that the deaths were  cholera-caused. Four people have died and 700 cases have been  reported. [end recording]    All this occurred since 24 December when a new outbreak was  registered. According to the minister, 95 percent of the cases  were a result of food that was handled without taking the proper  hygienic measures.    [Begin Vasquez recording] Food was sold in the streets,  foods that were improperly prepared and cooked; in fact, there  are places where food is sold that are not suited for the  handling of food. [end recording]    The health minister said that all of his personnel have been  deployed to tend to the increasing cases. He said that it is  untrue that hospitals have no more beds.    [Begin Vasquez recording] The hospitals have the capacity to  face the problem. [end recording]    The minister said that they foresee another outbreak during  the year's end festivities, but this could be avoided if people  follow the proper recommendations.</p>

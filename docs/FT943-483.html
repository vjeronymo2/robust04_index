			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Labour faces minimum wage row Labour made clear yesterday that it would not allow its party conference to decide the level of minimum wage to be adopted by a future Labour government. Instead, it made it clear that its Economic Commission, chaired by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, would fix the level of a minimum wage after it has completed its findings next year. But the TGWU general union, the largest union affiliated to the party, intends to force the issue to a debate on the first day of the conference in Blackpool next week, setting the scene for a battle with the party establishment. The union wants a minimum wage of at least Pounds 4 an hour. Ms Ann Clwyd, a senior Labour frontbencher who speaks on employment, said the party would 'take the TGWU's view into account'. But she warned that a minimum wage would be set only by the Commission. Ms Clywd, who published a survey underlining the party's support for a minimum wage, said: 'We are not talking about levels or a formula,' she added. 'We will not put a figure on it.' She declined to specify her personal preference. However, a vote in favour of a minimum wage at conference would be an significant embarrassment to the party's leadership. Mr Tony Blair, party leader, and Mr Brown, are understood to want to reduce the party's previous commitment to setting the minimum wage at a half of male median earnings. The TGWU warned that the party's existing policy was clear. 'Anyone who wants to change it will have to make a strong case to conference.' Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, warns in an article in next Monday's New Statesman that the 'army of working poor' looks to Labour for hope and that the party should adopt a Pounds 4 minimum. 'That's just Pounds 160 before tax for a 40-hour week,' he writes. 'If this figure is open to criticism, it should be on account of its excessive modesty. No one is going to live the high life working for Pounds 4 an hour.' She strongly opposed the Liberal Democrats' support for a regional minimum wage, criticising it as divisive, although her own survey showed big geographical differentials in the average gross weekly wage. Ms Clywd added: 'The introduction of a minimum wage will help lead people out of dependence. Labour's aim is to create a nation at work.'</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Cri de coeur from Kohl on burden-sharing CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's reiteration yesterday of the scale of German aid already promised to Russia was 'in some ways a cry for help,' a foreign ministry official said. 'He wants greater burden- sharing.' In a statement aimed at the US administration, and the European Community, Mr Kohl said Germany had provided more than half of all western aid to Russia. Germany was already saddled with financing the economic rebuilding of eastern Germany. The stakes for Germany are high. If the reforms carried out by Russian President Boris Yelstin failed, and the country slid into anarchy, then Germany would be faced with a massive refugee influx, officials warned yesterday. Mr Kohl promised no fresh money, but said Germany would 'continue to help within the bounds of its possibilities'. Support for reform was 'an investment in a peaceful future. . . a slide back into a confrontation would put burdens on all of us which would be far greater than the aid that is now necessary.' Mr Kohl said the debt rescheduling granted to Russia by the Paris Club of creditors last Friday would cost Germany DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn). This was in addition to substantial amounts of aid already committed by Germany to Russia for this year and 1994. These include: DM80bn credit facilities to the former Soviet Union, most of which has been earmarked for Russia since 1989. Export credit guarantees totalling DM5bn since 1992. The guarantees are targeted at restructuring and modernising the Russian economy. DM8.4bn in 1993 and 1994 towards cleaning up after the occupation of Soviet troops on eastern German territory on top of DM17bn already spent in the five new eastern German Lander. The remaining 220,000 troops from the former Soviet Red Army will leave Germany by August 31 1994. In addition, Bonn is financing a DM550m programme to build 36,000 houses for soldiers returning to the former Soviet Union. DM510m this year for creating democratic and market economy structures. This includes education and retraining programmes, as well as creating a legal environment for setting up small and medium sized private enterprises. DM100m for improving the security of nuclear power stations in 1993. A further DM32m has been committed for 1994.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Case on Piper payouts opens ELF Enterprise Caledonia, the oil company, yesterday began a Pounds 110m court action to try to recover compensation paid after the 1988 Piper Alpha platform disaster in the North Sea in which 167 men died. The company is the successor to Occidental, which then operated the platform. It is seeking at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to recover from 24 contractors the money paid to survivors and to victims' relatives. The contractors deny liability and claim the operators were solely at fault.</p>

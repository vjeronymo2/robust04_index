			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Nadir community keeps its silence Headless chickens left pinned to the door, a dead cat flung through the window; such have been the threats against the lawyer acting for Polly Peck's administrators and the former head of Asil Nadir's privately owned bank on the island of Cyprus. The Pounds 1bn UK financial scandal is straining the loyalties of this tiny Mediterranean community, where no one dares break ranks and tell what may have really happened - least of all the government which has benefited from Nadir's, or rather PPI's, generous financial support.

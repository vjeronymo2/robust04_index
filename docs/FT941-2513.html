			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Business offered role in schools: Dearing wants training for vocational qualifications to start at 14 Employers will be allowed unprecedented influence in compulsory schooling under proposals for new vocational qualifications announced by Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests. In the most radical overhaul of public examinations in England and Wales for a decade, 14-year-olds will be allowed to spend one day a week studying for qualifications in subjects such as health services, leisure and tourism, and manufacturing. The new qualification, as yet unnamed, would take up a fifth of school time over two years and would be equivalent to two GCSEs. It would be voluntary, but the aim is to encourage children who are less interested in academic subjects to gain skills and stay in full-time education. Employers, education-business partnerships and Training and Enterprise Councils are being consulted about the content of exams and funding for them. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications, an employment department quango, will have responsibility for vetting and administering the qualification, giving the department greater influence over compulsory education. Sir Ron told the Secondary Heads Association's annual conference in Bournemouth at the weekend that he hoped the new qualification could be offered from 1996. He denied claims that the scheme would mean the return of academic selection, at 14 years rather than 11, or that the new scheme would be a 'soft option'. To prolonged applause from head teachers at the conference, he said: 'I am all too conscious of the common tendency to consider the academic as first-rate and the practical applications of knowledge and understanding as second-rate. It is a tragedy that we have the value structures we do, and I rail against them.' Under Sir Ron's plans, which have already been approved in principle by the education department, five vocational subjects would initially be on offer: manufacturing; art and design; health and social care; leisure and tourism; and business and finance. Those mirror the first subjects introduced for the new general national vocational qualifications to be taken alongside A-levels by 18-year-olds. The Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department quango headed by Sir Ron, is considering allowing credits in other GCSE courses to count towards the vocational qualifications. Others subjects may follow, although Sir Ron emphasised that education for 14-year-olds would not embrace crafts as specific as plumbing or bricklaying. Mr John Sutton, SHA general secretary, welcomed the proposals but said they must be adequately resourced. Mr John Dunford, also of the SHA, said the qualifications would allow pupils time to take seven GCSEs at the same time, reducing the risk that they would appear to be in a separate 'stream'. There is widespread support among teachers and employers for allowing 14-year-olds a vocational option, but opposition is likely from conservative educationalists who fear pupils taking the exams would be stigmatised, or that schools specialising in them would appear 'second-rate'. Sir Ron and the NCVQ will consult schools after he presents a report to the education department in the next few weeks. Let's think boldly about education, Page 12</p>

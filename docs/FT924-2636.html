			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Clinton names five who will shape US economy US PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday reached into Congress and Wall Street for five senior positions on the team that will shape his administration's economic policies. In unveiling his nominees, whom he described as 'seasoned, skilled and incredibly able', Mr Clinton repeatedly emphasised that sustainable economic growth was contingent on 'a serious, credible, long-term deficit reduction policy'. As expected, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the 71-year-old senator from Texas and chairman of the Senate finance committee, becomes Treasury secretary, with Mr Roger Altman, 46, of the Blackstone Group, Wall Street investment banker, as his deputy. Congressman Leon Panetta from California, 54, and chairman of the House budget committee, will take over as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Dr Alice Rivlin, 61, who is attached to the Brookings Institution, will be Mr Panetta's deputy. Mr Robert Rubin, also 54, and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Wall Street investment bank, takes the new position of economic counsellor to the president, operating from the White House. Mr Clinton did not yesterday name a new head of the Council of Economic Advisers, as some had expected, but said this did not mean he intended to downgrade the CEA, which he said would continue to provide independent economic consultation and advice. Mr Rubin's job, he added, was to be co-ordinator of a new economic advisory body under the president's chairmanship and analogous to the existing National Security Council. Its members would include those named yesterday and other hitherto unrepresented cabinet departments, such as commerce, labour and the interior. Mr Bentsen, Mr Panetta and Dr Rivlin bring formidable qualifications and congressional experience in budgetary matters to the new administration, an indication of Mr Clinton's determination to tackle the deficit of more than Dollars 300bn (Pounds 197bn) while pursuing the goals of 'a high wage, high growth, strong and vital economy'. Mr Panetta, for example, is known as a deficit-reduction 'hawk'. Dr Rivlin, the only economist of the five, set up the independent Congressional Budget Office in 1975.

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Vard losses deepen to NKr213m VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, reported an increase in net losses in 1992 to NKr213.5m (Dollars 30.49m) from NKr180.9m a year earlier, due mainly to a rise in foreign currency losses, high interest payments, and a huge loss on the disposal of a cruise ship. Vard forecast a weak first quarter for Kloster Cruise, its cruise business. However, the group said it was continuing with efforts to improve its capital structure through a disposal or equity partnership. Last autumn, Vard declared its intention to find a partner to invest in the cruise business. Group revenue edged ahead to NKr5.47bn from NKr5.36bn while operating expenses dipped to NKr4.67bn from NKr4.77bn. Net financial costs, comprising mainly interest expenses to service debt, widened to NKr480.3m from NKr399.81m, and foreign exchange losses shot up to NKr108.93m from NKr61.33m in 1991. Group operating profit, however, advanced to NKr459.3m from NKr274.4m On the bright side, Vard's ferry business posted a record result last year.</p>

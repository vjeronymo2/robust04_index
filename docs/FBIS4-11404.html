The exchange balance in March stood at  $1.735 billion. Although this balance was 32 percent lower than  February's when it totalled $2.528 billion, the government was  forced to issue 289.8 million real cruzeiros in certificates to  prevent the monetary base from increasing. Particularly because  the demand for foreign exchange in March was also less than the  February one.    The high interest rate policy, which was adopted at the end  of last year, has increased the federal domestic public debt  balance from 7.7 percent of the GDP to 8.8 percent in March. In  nominal terms, the domestic public debt balance in March was  49.75 percent higher than February's. In real terms, however,  after deducting the March inflation rate, the increase totalled  only 3.99 percent. From January to March, the federal domestic  public debt increased 14.36 percent above the inflation rate.  The international reserves increased $1.4 billion in February,  increasing the balance to $30.5 billion.</p>

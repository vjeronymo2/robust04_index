			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS BLOCK LIQUOR LICENSE AT NEW RALPHS  </P> <P> Shoppers at the new Ralphs supermarket in the Beverly Connection shopping  center have been looking elsewhere for beer, wine and spirits since the store  opened last month because protests from neighbors have blocked its liquor  license, at least temporarily.  </P> <P> Ralphs sold liquor for 30 years at its old store on the corner of 3rd Street  and La Cienega Boulevard. But a handful of protests have stymied the chain's  attempt to transfer its license to the new location two blocks away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 100 Locations  </P> <P> "This community has suffered enough with the number of liquor licenses in the  area," said Diana Plotkin, vice president of the Beverly Wilshire Homeowners  Assn.  </P> <P> Plotkin, one of six residents who filed protests with the Alcoholic Beverage  Control Board, argued that restaurants, stores and other outlets sell liquor at  more than 100 locations within a third of a mile of the new store.  </P> <P> The neighbors also said that granting the license would lead to parking  shortages, traffic jams, loitering and juvenile delinquency.  </P> <P> "We're investigating to determine if these allegations are valid and if this  license should be issued," said Warren Tankersley, district administrator of  the alcoholic beverage board. He could not predict when the issue would be  resolved.  </P> <P> Although Ralphs has appealed to its shoppers to sign petitions urging the board  to transfer the store's liquor license, Tankersley said the decision was up to  an administrative law judge.  </P> <P> "This is not a popularity contest. It's a matter of whether the issues are  accurate," he said.  </P> <P> At the new Ralphs, replete with gourmet goodies to compete with the Irvine  Ranch Market across the street, petitions at checkout stands urge the alcoholic  beverage board to allow the sale of liquor from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.  </P> <P> A placard apologizes to shoppers for liquor department shelves stocked with  encyclopedias and stuffed Easter bunnies. "We ask that you sign the petition  and talk with your neighbors about helping us obtain a liquor license so that  we can continue to serve you," the sign says.  </P> <P> Several thousand patrons have shown their support by signing the petitions,  said Gene Brown, senior vice president of the 136-store chain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Previous Complaints  </P> <P> He said there were no complaints about the sale of liquor at the old store,  which closed Jan. 18, and that Ralphs does not expect any problems at the new  location, which opened Jan. 19.  </P> <P> The old site, which is across the street from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,  was bought by the hospital in 1987. Cedars-Sinai intends to use the site for  parking, a hospital spokesman said.  </P> <P> The new location, twice as big as the old one, is part of a Ralphs strategy to  open new stores in the 50,000-square-foot range while abandoning the chain's  70,000- to 100,000-square-foot Giant emporiums. Its liquor department was  intended to have a wide selection of wines and a full complement of beer and  spirits, Brown said, adding that liquor departments are very important for  supermarkets.  </P> <P> "You obviously don't like to have a customer make a stop someplace else,  because that's inconvenient to the customer," he said.  </P> <P> But Plotkin said that shoppers could just as well patronize the fully stocked  liquor department at the drugstore at the Beverly Boulevard end of the shopping  center.  </P> <P> "I don't think people in the community who live near that Ralphs will have any  problem breaking up their shopping. If they want it bad enough, it's certainly  available in the area," she said.  </P> <P> Plotkin, a vocal critic of City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said her group  acted against Ralphs because the city has failed to protect the neighborhood  against the impact of the new development, which is catty-cornered from the  controversial Ma Maison Sofitel hotel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scaled Down  </P> <P> But Yaroslavsky said prolonged negotiations resulted in a scaling-down of the  Beverly Connection project from an original proposal of 1.1 million square feet  of office buildings and a hotel to its final size of 296,000 square feet of  mainly commercial uses.  </P> <P> He said the parking garage next to the new Ralphs contains five parking spaces  for every 1,000 square feet of floor space, which would be "more than adequate  for their needs."  </P> <P> Saul Panski, president of a condominium association on nearby Croft Avenue,  said his group would withdraw its objections to the liquor license if Ralphs  cuts back its hours of operation.  </P> <P> "We're not opposed per se to Ralphs selling alcoholic beverages, but we are  opposed to them being allowed to operate 24 hours. Some of the other homeowner  groups have more global concerns," he said.  </P> <P> But Brown said that although the issue of restricted hours came up in the  negotiations, Ralphs decided to open on a 24-hour schedule once it became clear  that Plotkin and her associates would not drop their objections.  </P> <P> He said that only six outlets in the Ralphs chain are not open 24 hours.  </P> <P> Similar protests were filed against the sale of liquor at supermarkets in West  Hollywood and Beverly Hills in 1987, but the alcoholic beverage board  eventually granted the liquor licenses on condition that no alcohol be sold  after 11 p.m.  </P></p>

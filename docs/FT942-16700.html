			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: GE says earnings 'at high end of estimates' General Electric, the US conglomerate, said its earnings for the first quarter of the year were 'at the high end of analysts' estimates', which ranged from Dollars 1.45 to Dollars 1.50 a share. The announcement marked an attempt by the industrial giant to scotch rumours that its financial services businesses, which have been one of the main engines of profits growth in recent periods, had suffered from rising US interest rates. In particular, market speculation centred on possible losses at Kidder Peabody, the group's Wall Street brokerage house. In a statement, GE said that first-quarter earnings at both Kidder and GE Capital Services, its financial services unit, would be 'excellent'. Dennis Dammerman, the group's senior vice president in charge of finance, also said that GE continues to expect record earnings for 1994 as a whole. Kidder has had a patchy record in recent years and has been consistently less profitable than its main competitors, leading to frequent speculation that GE was looking to sell the business. Last year operating profits jumped to Dollars 439m from Dollars 300m.</p>

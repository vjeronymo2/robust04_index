			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS  </P> <P> Noteworthy films, with mini-reviews by Times critics.  </P> <P> Moon Over Parador  </P> <P> Cinemax Sunday at 9 a.m., Tuesday at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Paul Mazursky's hilarious, 1988 satire about a minor American actor (Richard  Dreyfuss) strong-armed into masquerading as an inconveniently deceased Latin  American dictator never quite got the attention it deserved.  </P> <P> With Sonia Braga, Raul Julia.  </P> <P> Platoon  </P> <P> ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Oliver Stone's 1986 film brought the Vietnam War home at last with a fiery  implacability impossible to ignore or forget. Charlie Sheen stars as Viet vet  Stone's young alter ego, caught between two rival sergeants, the brutal Tom  Berenger and the humane Willem Dafoe. There's one key disappointment: the  presence and contributions of blacks are slighted, even though Forest Whitaker  is in the cast.  </P> <P> Wall Street  </P> <P> Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Another major Stone film, in which an ambitious young stockbroker (Charlie  Sheen) latches onto high roller Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas, so deservedly an  Oscar winner) of no discernible principles whatsover -- but no pretensions  either. This vastly absorbing and exciting 1987 film remains a morality play  for our time.  </P> <P> The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  </P> <P> Part 1 A&amp;E Thursday at 1 p.m., again at 1 a.m.  </P> <P> Part 2 Friday at 1 p.m., again at 1 a.m.  </P> <P> This is the Michael Powell-Emeric Pressburger 1943 British classic, starring a  superb Roger Livesey as a kindly, aristocratic career officer, a symbol of fair  play who finds himself obsolete with the outbreak of World War II.

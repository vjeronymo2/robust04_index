			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Amer buys Atomic to expand sports side Amer of Finland is strengthening its position as the world's second-largest sports equipment group by buying Austria's Atomic group for Sch900m (Dollars 83.6m). Atomic collapsed into bankruptcy in September after several years of losses. Amer, however, believes it can revive the company's fortunes, partly because of overlaps with its own activities. The purchase will increase the Finnish company's commitment to its core business, while expanding its sports operations. Atomic, the world's second largest manufacturer of alpine skis, has an 8 per cent share of the ski equipment market. It also ranks as Austria's biggest producer of equipment for alpine and cross-country skiing and in-line skating. Its marketing names include Atomic, Dynamic, Koflach, Ess, Colt and Oxygen. Mr Seppo Ahonen, Amer chief executive, said Atomic had a strong market position in Europe and Japan. 'It operates globally, balancing the seasonal fluctuations of our present sporting goods businesses,' he said. Amer is a diversified company which combines sporting goods with car sales, tobacco processing, and printing and publishing. However, the group wants to concentrate more on sporting and leisure goods. Sports equipment as a percentage of total sales will rise to 60 per cent following the purchase, compared with 48 per cent now. Atomic, with annual sales of FM700m (Dollars 150.6m), has eight subsidiaries in Austria, Canada, France, Switzerland and the US. Around 56 per cent of sales are generated in Europe, 24 per cent in Japan and 19 per cent in North America.</p>

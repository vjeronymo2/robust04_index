			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At their plenary session today, the deputies  adopted the bills for the 1994 budget. Toure Carlos Yerekpin  reports:    [Yerekpin] The bills adopted after being studied by the  deputies should enable the government to adequately control  personnel spending through a more rigorous management of the  civil service, the departure of workers who have reached the age  of mandatory retirement, and the acceleration of voluntary  retirement. A total of 4.9 billion CFA francs was provided for  this. A bill to streamline the recovery of state revenue  through the decentralization of the tax department and another  to readjust operating expenses to take into account the tasks of  the various ministries and the new conditions were also adopted  at the session.    The new allocations greatly favor ministries involved in  human resources development such as health, social affairs,  national education, higher education, and scientific research.  The general operating budget bill also provides for the gradual  divestiture of state ownership through accelerating the  privatization program for 54 companies and the strengthening of  primary health care. The bills adopted also provide for  creating jobs by estabilishing a more flexible and appropriate  institution -- the Research and Promotion Agency -- to replace  the Ivorian Labor Office; the continuation of the training  policy by maintaining and stepping up grants -- an amount of  10.3 billion CFA francs was allocated, representing an increase  of 25.6 percent while subsidies amounting to 11.1 billion were  allocated to private schools, representing an increase of 26.1  percent; and the continuation of domestic debt repayments  through the part payment of liabilities to the tune of 3.591  billion CFA francs.    The special capital budget for the 1994 fiscal year, which  was presented to our deputies, was balanced at 220.728 billion  CFA francs, an increase of 56.24 percent over last year's. To  stimulate activities in rural areas and promote local  agricultural production, four special budget items were created:  an agricultural diversification and exports promotion fund with  1.25 billion CFA francs; an animal production promotion fund  with 450 million CFA francs; an agricultural guarantee fund with  1 billion CFA francs; and a mechanized farming support fund with  1.3 billion CFA francs. [passage omitted]    In light of the extensive program launched to provide  television and radio coverage nationwide, the allocation for  this department amounted to 25.543 billion, seven times the  usual amount. The problem of license fees for the special  parastatal, Cote d'Ivoire Radio and Television, was permanently  resolved by our deputies.    The rural electrification sector and the roads program were  also given special attention at the National Assembly. The  creditors of the former National Agricultural Development Bank  could soon have the smiles back on their faces with the adoption  of the repayment plan. Studies are under way on the high cost  of the new national identity card, as well as on penalties for  late payment of bills from the Ivorian Electricity Company, Cote  d'Ivoire Telecommunications, and the Cote d'Ivoire Water Supply  Company. The deputies would like to see the penalties removed.  [passage omitted]</p>

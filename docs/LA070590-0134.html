			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CERRITOS;  </P> <P> $74.6-MILLION BUDGET IS UP $8.6 MILLION OVER LAST YEAR  </P> <P> The new fiscal budget in Cerritos is $8.6 million higher than last year's.  Nevertheless, the city's approximately $20-million surplus is still intact and,  overall, spending is still on a downward trend.  </P> <P> This year's budget totals $74.6 million, in contrast to last year's $66  million. The Redevelopment Agency's share this year is $42.2 million, compared  to $35.8 million last year.  </P> <P> In 1988-89, however, the city budget was about $90 million because the  Redevelopment Agency was knee-deep in capital projects. Most of those are now  complete. The biggest exception is the Community Arts Center, which is expected  to cost $46.4 million by the time it is completed next year in the Cerritos  Towne Center.  </P> <P> When the council first authorized construction of the arts center three years  ago, cost estimates were around $18 million. Since then, however, extensive  architectural revisions have been made in order to allow the center to be used  by community groups for meetings and other events.  </P></p>

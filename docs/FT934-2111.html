			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Solid final quarter checks Degussa fall A clear improvement in the final quarter helped Degussa, the metals and chemicals group, to restrict the fall in earnings to just 14 per cent in the year to the end of September. The company, which reported pre-tax profits down 26 per cent after nine months, said yesterday in an interim report income would rise in the current year, even though there were still no signs of an overall improvement. Earnings for the period under review totalled DM172m (Dollars 101.2m), on sales up 16 per cent at DM15bn. The sales rise reflected a sharp increase in precious metals trading and new consolidations. Excluding these factors, turnover was unchanged. The group attributed the new year's expected recovery to the effects of restructuring measures, and was cautiously optimistic that the two-year slump in the chemicals business was coming to an end. In line with expectations, the 1992-93 dividend would be unchanged at DM7. Mr Gert Becker, chairman, said last March the payout would not be increased before the 1994-95 financial year. Cost-cutting and the economic recovery in North America generated improved earnings in the chemicals sector, which contributed 46 per cent to group sales. The banking business also lifted profits. However, losses in base metals deepened in spite of a 4 per cent rise in sales. Precious metals trading, which boosted turnover 53 per cent, made a smaller contribution to earnings than last year. Turnover in pharmaceuticals rose 17 per cent, to DM2bn, on the strength of first-time consolidations, but was unchanged after adjustment. Income was 'substantially below the very high previous year's figure'. The effects of rationalisation showed up most clearly in the German parent company, Degussa AG, where pre-tax earnings tumbled 65 per cent to DM32m on sales up 4 per cent at DM6.9bn. While the group workforce was reduced by 4 per cent and payroll costs remained unchanged on the year, numbers employed at the parent were cut 14 per cent, and wage costs fell 12 per cent. Overall capital expenditure was cut 18 per cent to DM498m, with spending at the parent reduced 35 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> The Upbeat, 12745 Garden Grove Blvd., Garden Grove. Open daily 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.  (714) 530-4101.  </P> <P> This is the kind of country club where Donald Trump would never be accepted as  a member. It's more the down-home sort of place where Clint Eastwood could  comfortably set up filming should he ever decide to make another sequel to  "Every Which Way But Loose." RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

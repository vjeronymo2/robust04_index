			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IBM STARTS LATE BUT 'VENGEFUL' PUSH INTO WORKSTATION SALES  </P> <P> Years after faster-charging rivals paved the way, International Business  Machines Corp. moved with a self-proclaimed "vengeance" Thursday to stake its  share of the fast-growing technical workstation computer market.  </P> <P> IBM introduced nine new systems claiming to offer the most desktop power for  the lowest price. The new systems -- arguably IBM's most important product  rollout since the 1981 launch of its personal computer -- represent the latest  attempt from the world's largest computer maker to win a large piece of one of  the most promising segments of the lackluster electronics industry.  </P> <P> Now growing at an estimated 30% annually, the $6-billion-a-year workstation  market had eluded IBM since 1986, when engineers and scientists, the primary  customers for workstations, shunned its first offering as under-powered and  over-priced.  </P> <P> IBM said its follow-up system, a family of computers called RISC System 6000,  is designed to reverse its workstation fortunes -- and quickly. "We're entering  this market with a vengeance," proclaimed Terry Lautenbach, president of IBM's  domestic operations. "We are very, very serious about this market."  </P> <P> Workstations, relatively new and highly sophisticated desktop machines, have  been glaringly absent from IBM's product lineup, prompting criticism from Wall  Street analysts who questioned how serious the company was about tapping  emerging technology markets before its competition.  </P> <P> Analysts said Thursday that while the new systems would have little immediate  impact on IBM profits, which sagged 35% in 1989, the aggressive introduction  did signal the company's strong intent to improve its fortunes.  </P> <P> Although the new systems won several rave reviews for their price, speed and  power, analysts and competitors still questioned whether IBM would achieve its  objectives of stealing market share from such established workstation  manufacturers as Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment. Those  rivals all have promised to introduce yet more powerful and competitively  priced systems over the coming months.  </P> <P> Early skepticism centered on how quickly software programs could be introduced  to operate on the new systems, how qualified IBM's sales force is at working  with scientists and engineers, and whether IBM would soon have a system costing  less than the current base price of about $13,000.  </P> <P> Still, International Data Corp., a Boston-area market research firm, estimated  that the company would ship about 15,000 RISC systems this year, and three  times that number in 1991. "With such success, IBM could rank in the top four  among workstation vendors in the 1992-93 time frame," the research firm  predicted. RISC systems (RISC stands for reduced instruction set computing) can  process information more quickly than conventional computer systems because  they have fewer commands to handle.  </P> <P> Shipments of the workstations, which will range in price from about $13,000 to  $74,000, are scheduled to begin within 90 days. And IBM executives promised  that at least 175 software programs would be ready for use by that time. The  number of available programs is expected to increase by hundreds by the end of  the year.  </P> <P> According to industry insiders, IBM spent millions of dollars to entice  software programmers to write packages that would operate on the new RISC  systems. In one case, said an executive who requested anonymity, IBM paid $5  million to the creators of a noted program. IBM executives acknowledged that  independent software companies had been working for as long as the last year to  have programs immediately available when the machines hit the market in a few  months.  </P> <P> Some analysts and competitors said they are still puzzled about how IBM intends  to position and sell the new systems. Noting that IBM traditionally has enjoyed  its success among general business customers, one competitor wondered how the  company would train its sales force to make the sale to more technically  oriented engineers and scientists.  </P> <P> "These boxes do not sell themselves," said John Hime, vice president of systems  products at MIPS Computer Systems, a Silicon Valley workstation maker.  </P> <P> Others wondered whether IBM's traditional commercial customers needed the high  level of power the RISC machines offered, or would they rather have  lower-priced systems. Some further questioned if the new workstations would  cannibalize sales of IBM's more expensive IBM AS/400 mid-range computers.  </P> <P> "Welcome to the intra-IBM product wars!" Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex  Research, said in a commentary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Workstations are desktop or side-of-desk machines that are much more powerful  than personal computers. Some even match the power of mainframes. They are used  widely by scientists and engineers for such processing-intensive tasks as  three-dimensional computer modeling of new products. The workstation market is  small but is among the fastest-growing segments of the computer industry. And  uses for the machines are expanding.  </P></p>

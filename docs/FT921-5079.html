			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Upjohn downgraded as Halcion sales fall THE continuing controversy over the safety of Halcion, the sleeping pill alleged to have harmful side-effects, was among the key concerns that led to the downgrading yesterday of the long-term debt rating of Upjohn, the US drugs company, by Moody's Investor Service. The rating agency said that sales of Halcion were 'falling sharply due to adverse publicity and regulatory actions'. Moody's noted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had recently said its data supports Halcion's effectiveness, but stressed that deeper investigation by the FDA and other regulators 'could result in additional restrictions on Halcion or all drugs of its class'. Moody's lowered the rating of Upjohn's long-term debt to Double-A3 from Double-A2. About Dollars 520m of debt is affected. Upjohn has steadfastly denied charges that it failed to disclose the side-effects of Halcion to the FDA and has launched a lawsuit against Dr Ian Oswald, a Scottish psychiatry professor who is a leading critic of Halcion. Aside from concern about Halcion, which has Dollars 260m of annual sales and is Upjohn's second biggest drug product, Moody's also noted that Upjohn's marketing exclusivity in the US for Xanax tranquilliser, Ansaid anti-inflammatory agent and Halcion expires in 1993. Moody's said these three products represent a significant portion of Upjohn's pharmaceuticals earnings, which could fall when the exclusivity ends next year.</p>

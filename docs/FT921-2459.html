			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): Buzzwords explained HERE are some of the technical terms you will encounter in this issue of Software at Work. The following brief definitions are for readers who may not have a technological background: OPEN SYSTEMS: front ends. A relational database stores 'relationships' between data items, as well as the data itself, so that information from different files can be combined in one search. Previously, 'hierarchical' systems were organised in separate files, each with a unique index, and a search for information might require a custom-built report program, (such as now can be managed with a one-line SQL statement). SQL: This product, the Standard Query Language originated by IBM, has become the lingua franca for access to all relational databases. Blobs: The types of data items (or 'attributes') held in relational databases are normally restricted to strings of characters, of fixed length, and numbers, to hold, for example, names and addresses and salaries. It is becoming increasingly common to support a further type of data, the binary large object or Blob. This is a data item of any variable length, and containing any kind of data. The most common use for Blobs is to hold text and digitally stored picture data. OLTP: Online transaction processing is the instant entry and handling of business transactions, for example, orders. Such systems have to be robust, reliable, and 'failsafe,' and usually make heavy demands on the computer. Poor performance is often caused by an 'i/o bottleneck' (input/output), a traffic jam of transactions queueing between the processor and data storage. A fourth generation language or 4GL, is a marketing term applied to software products used for writing programs. They provide short cuts for programmers (and sometimes end-users). Typically, a one-line 4GL statement, often in an English-type form, translates into several lines of code in a traditional ('third generation') computer language, such as Cobol.</p>

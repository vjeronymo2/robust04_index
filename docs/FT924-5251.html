			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin tumbles 42% on downturn in bulk shipments MACDONALD Martin Distilleries, which produces Glenmorangie and Glen Moray malt whiskies, suffered a sharp setback at the interim stage as bulk shipments to its international markets were reduced. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds 2.69m, a 42 per cent contraction on the comparable Pounds 4.67m. Turnover declined 23 per cent to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 15.2m). The shares fell 70p to 400p. Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said discounting by competitors and depressed trading, particularly in Australia, New Zealand and the US, had affected both volumes and margins and the group had been compelled to reduce prices. The position was partially ameliorated by another good performance in Japan where sales were ahead despite a seasonal decline in shipments. Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director, said total shipments of Glenmorangie were in line with last year following increased worldwide marketing expenditure in the brand. The distillery was currently operating at about two-thirds of capacity and was likely to remain that way. Nevertheless, the brand had outperformed the market with sales up 2 per cent against an industry downturn of about 4 per cent. The smaller Glen Moray distillery was working at full capacity, he said. The brand had been repackaged and repositioned in the market place. Profit margins in cased blend whisky were cut to protect existing markets. Overall margins fell from 31 per cent to 28.5 per cent, with the decline totally attributable to blended whisky, Mr McKerrow said. Malt whisky margins had been maintained, he added. Industry price discounting and an uncertain Christmas season made prospects for the second half difficult to forecast. Earnings per A share dropped to 13.08p (22.74p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 2.2p.</p>

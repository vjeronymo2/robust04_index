			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: National Power There is no denying National Power's confidence. In part, the mood reflects the increasing likelihood that the government will sell its remaining 40 per cent stake in the two electricity generators once British Coal has been privatised. More generally, the company has much to be confident about. Yesterday's 10 per cent dividend increase was a curt response to PowerGen's larger increase last week. While National Power's Pounds 101m of extra provisions looked unnecessary in the short term, the company was admirably forthcoming about its desire to protect future profits. It is not just that several thousand more jobs are to be cut over the next two years. National Power is also accelerating its plant closure programme, which means higher depreciation charges than anticipated at privatisation. Put back the provisions, and pre-tax profits grew by more than twice the stated 18 per cent. Equally, PowerGen's figures contained one-off income and Pounds 127m of provisions, without which profits growth would have been a similar 40 per cent. The main difference is in the underlying operating performance, where, by most measures, National Power was the more efficient. It has plenty of scope to restore the parity of its dividend in future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Vladimir Taranov and </F> Boris Krivoshey]    [Text] Moscow, 7 April -- The appearance of the document on  setting up Russian military bases in CIS countries and Latvia  has come as a surprise to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The  Russian Foreign Ministry did not take part in agreeing the  document. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the press and  information directorate of the Russian Foreign Ministry said  this at a briefing today.    It is necessary to study the contents of the document, he  said, and then we will give a really qualified assessment of its  contents through diplomatic channels. The Russian diplomat did  not rule out that explanations would possibly be provided in a  different form.    Karasin stressed that he was against attaching unnecessary  sensationalism to the matter. It should be sorted out, we  should look at the document, at its wording, and who presented  it, and after that we will promulgate our official point of  view, he said.    According to him, the Russian ambassador in Riga was invited  to the Latvian Foreign Ministry where he had talks on the  matter. Military aspects of bilateral relations between Russia  and Latvia were resolved and are reflected in relevant  agreements initialed by the two countries. We confirm once  again, the Russian diplomat said, that we adhere to the  agreements. We regard Skrunde as a facility and not a military  base, so there cannot be questions here.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World markets react calmly to air strike WORLD financial markets reacted calmly to the allied attack on Iraq yesterday, write our Economics and Foreign Staff. Reports that President George Bush was planning an attack had pushed the dollar to a high of DM1.6333 in European trading, from a previous close in London at DM1.632. White House confirmation of bombing raids lifted the dollar higher in the US, to DM1.635, before profit-taking brought it back to DM1.6225. In Tokyo, the dollar opened weaker at DM1.6185, although analysts said the US currency should benefit from heightened tension, as it was seen as a 'safe haven'. The Nikkei average was down slightly in early Tokyo trading on concern about further conflict. US shares retreated on news of the attack, but later recovered. Having fallen 20 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down just 1.08 at 3,263.56. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed down 12.6 at 2,745.3. Oil prices were unchanged late yesterday after moving up about 30 cents a barrel on the immediate news of the attack.

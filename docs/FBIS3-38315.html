			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Khasapopoulos] </F>   [Text] Foreign military attaches, mainly European and  American, have lately been seen visiting the Defense Ministry as  a delegation of higher-ranking officers of the National Defense  General Staff [YEETHA] prepares to pay an official visit to  Cyprus to cooperate with Cypriot National Guard officers to draw  up a unified defense strategy. There has not been so much  movement of foreign officials and diplomats at the Pentagon  [Greek military headquarters] since March 1987, during the  Greek-Turkish crisis over the search for oil by the "Piri Reis"  [Turkish oil exploration ship] in the Aegean.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's proclaimed new  strategy of unified defense between Greece and Cyprus and  Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis' meetings in Thessaloniki  with Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official opposition  leader, and Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, during which the  exclusive topic of discussion was the unified defense space  between Greece and Cyprus, appear to have raised concern among  NATO military attaches. The NATO military attaches in Athens  immediately requested a meeting with the ministry's military  leadership for further clarification. It is indicative that the  military attaches of Germany, Britain, and the United States  asked Arsenis if NATO knows about Greece's plans to expand its  defense space. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles also asked Arsenis  the same question.    Arsenis' answer is that Greece, as a guarantor power in  Cyprus, is obliged to look after its defense and he stated that  in 1960, Greece did not inform NATO that it was sending the  900-member ELDIK [Greek Forces in Cyprus] to the island, as part  of the Zurich Agreement. Turkey did the same with TURDIK  [Turkish Forces in Cyprus]. Arsenis assured the foreign  diplomats that the military plans being drawn up for Cyprus'  defense are clearly defensive, not offensive. He also noted  that Greece and Cyprus estimate that they face the same threat,  which comes exclusively from Turkey, and must prepare a common  defense.    There has been no official Turkish response yet, despite  Turkey's military delegation at NATO seeking in every way to  learn Greece's plans. But there has been reaction by Britain.  Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind expressed particular interest  in the issue during a recent meeting with Defense Minister  Arsenis in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit.  British Ambassador in Athens Anthony Miles has requested an  official meeting with Arsenis and one of the issues that will be  discussed is the defense of Cyprus, since Britain is also among  Cyprus' guarantor powers.    The first step toward common defense is Lieutenant General  Nikolaos Vorvolakos' appointment as commander of the National  Guard. Vorvolakos is being briefed at headquarters. The second  and perhaps most important step will be the visit this week of a  delegation of military officers to Nicosia to draw up the new  defense plan to cover both countries. The third step will be  National Defense Minister Arsenis' visit to Cyprus during the  second half of February and the last will be the signing of an  accord by Prime Minister Papandreou and Cypriot President  Kliridhis, probably at the beginning of the summer.</p>

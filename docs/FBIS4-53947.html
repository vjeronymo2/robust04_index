			<p>BFN     [Text] Sapporo, May 23 KYODO -- Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro  Yokomichi said Monday [23 May] he will not seek reelection next  spring, prompting speculation that he may return to national  politics as a prominent political figure.    It was the first time that the 53-year-old Yokomichi said  publicly he will not run for a fourth, four-year Hokkaido  governorship term, but he declined to answer whether he will  later run for a House of Representatives election.    His decision was widely interpreted as the start of  Yokomichi's campaign to return to the lower house and the launch  of efforts to band "democratic liberal" forces together.    Yokomichi, a former lawyer, was elected four times to the  lower house from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) beginning in  1969. He successfully ran for Hokkaido governor in 1983 and was  reelected twice.    Yokomichi told reporters at Hokkaido prefectural government  headquarters that he has not decided what to do, when asked  whether he will run for election to the lower house if it is  dissolved in the near future.    His chief strategist, Tetsuro Kaneko, said Sunday night at a  news conference in Tokyo that Yokomichi will formally announce a  decision not to seek a new term as governor of Japan's  northernmost main island.    The governor told Kaneko that "you can begin selecting a  successor to me," Yokomichi said.    Kaneko is head of the Hokkaido chapter of the Japanese Trade  Union Confederation (Rengo), Japan's largest labor organization  with eight million members. Rengo is the principal support  group for Yokomichi.    The governor said he is likely to officially announce his  decision not to seek a new term when a Hokkaido Prefectural  Assembly session is called in mid-June.</p>

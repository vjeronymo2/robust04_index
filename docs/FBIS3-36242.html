Estonia at the latest round of talks for the first time  formally accepted Russia's proposal to pull its troops from the  country by Aug. 31, said the Estonian Ambassador to Russia, Juri  Kahn.    He said the only issue on which the parties had failed to  reach a final agreement was that of paying compensation. The  topic has to be settled at the level of heads of state.    Russia has said it would agree to call a summit meeting of  the two countries' leaders only after Estonia provides social  welfare guarantees for the retired Russian military under the  conditions set by Russia.    Kahn quoted Russian officials as saying their side would not  present a detailed timetable for the withdrawal of units from  Estonia until the two countries have agreed on the issue of  social welfare guarantees for the military who retired after  Aug. 20, 1991.    The ambassador said this latest stance was causing  bewilderment to Estonia, as the countries earlier had agreed to  solve any problems one at a time without linking them to one  another.    Kahn dismissed Russia's allegations of Estonia's  unwillingness to resolve the border issue as groundless.  "Russia's wish to establish the border along the line where its  border guards now stand is unacceptable for Estonia," he said.  He added that Estonia on many occasions had sought taking  international law as basis for discussion of the border issue.    The next round of Estonian-Russian talks is to be held at  the  beginning of March. It is possible that Estonian Foreign  Minister Juri Luik will meet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitali Churkin in the meantime, Kahn added.</p>

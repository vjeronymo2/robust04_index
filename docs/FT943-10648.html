			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / German jobless said to hit 3.7m German unemployment surged by 100,000 to around 3.7m last month, after easing slightly in June, according to a senior official from the federal labour office. Ms Ursula Engelen-Kefer, chairman of the labour office board, pre-empted today's release of official figures with a claim that numbers out of work in the west had risen almost 19 per cent this year. The jobless total in the east was 8 per cent higher, she said. Ms Engelen-Kefer, also a board member at the DGB trades union federation, was apparently attempting to overshadow more optimistic statements from the office's president, Mr Bernhard Jagoda. He said earlier that the annual average jobless rate in the west this year could turn out to be less than 2.6m, compared with the office's official forecast of 2.67m. German jobless figures usually increase at the start of the holiday period, when large parts of industry fall into the Sommerloch or 'summer hole'. Last July the recession and the seasonal downturn combined to increase unemployment by 160,000. West German chemicals companies increased their turnover by 4 per cent to more than DM83bn (Pounds 34.2bn) in the first half of the year, the VCI industry association said yesterday. Incoming orders showed foreign demand, which led the recovery, was continuing to rise, while domestic bookings were an increasingly important factor. However, the association warned that prices were still unsatisfactory - down an by an overall average of 0.1 per cent in the first half - and further structural changes and job losses were unavoidable.</p>

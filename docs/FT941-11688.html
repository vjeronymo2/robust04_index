			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Labour refuses to debate Clause 4 The Labour Leadership yesterday dismissed Mr Neil Kinnock's call to drop Clause 4 of its constitution as 'a massive distraction' from winning elections, Roland Rudd writes. The former Labour leader said he wanted the controversial clause - committing the party to nationalisation - to be replaced. He argued that the clause was not an adequate definition of modern socialism, which should be concerned with individual liberty. The Labour leadership said it had no intention of 'opening up another flank' in the run-up to the local and European elections by taking part in a debate which could prove distracting.</p>

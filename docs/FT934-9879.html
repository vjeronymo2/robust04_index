			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / New Zealand bank moves to assure markets: Currency eases, equity market closes 6% down, bond market under close scrutiny DR DON BRASH, governor of the New Zealand Reserve Bank, moved quickly to reassure financial markets yesterday that it was 'business as usual' in spite of the unexpected political upheavals of the weekend general election in which no clear winner emerged. Dr Brash said the bank would intervene if the dollar fell so far as to effect its anti-inflation targets. However, yesterday the dollar, which initially fell sharply, recovered ground against the US currency. The equity market closed down more than 6 per cent, recovering from a 10 per cent fall at the opening. Analysts commented that the market would remain nervous over the next few days and the bond market would be watched closely. The leaders of the four parties now represented in parliament emphasised yesterday that the financial markets had nothing to fear from the minority government The National party won 49 seats on Saturday night, while the opposition Labour and two minor parties the Alliance and New Zealand First have 50 between them. Mr Mike Moore, Labour party leader, who has 46 seats and refuses to concede defeat, made a highly publicised pilgrimage with his finance spokesman, Dr Michael Cullen, to the Reserve Bank yesterday to emphasise that his party would not change the act which gives Dr Brash independence in setting monetary policy, with the aim of securing low inflation. Mr Jim Anderton, leader of the two-seat left-wing Alliance party, yesterday reaffirmed his support that National should continue in office as it had won most seats on Saturday. He also praised Prime Minister Jim Bolger's handling of the post election situation, while sharply criticising Mr Moore, ruling out any early discussions with his group. Commentators now expect that the Alliance party will allow National to continue to govern, if the present state of the parties remains unchanged after 200,000 special votes are counted and following any recounts. Financial markets were waiting the response from US markets overnight to the changed New Zealand political situation. Some investors fear that the US may react negatively to the possibility that the country's economic reform programme has stalled, perhaps permanently. However, others noted that most of the US investment was in the form of long term investments. Dealers and brokers expect the nervousness to continue over the next few days as the Americans assess what will be a changed political scene in New Zealand. Even if National increases its majority after special votes are counted, it is considered unlikely that it will press ahead with the next round of reforms. Key players in the financial markets last night said investors in Australia and Asia had accepted that nothing really had changed, and that it would pay to wait at least until the final outcome of the election is known in 10 days or so. C S First Boston dealer Mr Chris West said that Australian and Asian investors were happy to watch developments. 'Several said they still liked the New Zealand economic story. However we are very nervous over the way the Americans might react.' Americans have invested heavily in New Zealand over the past four years. They have made no secret of their support for the radical economic reforms instituted by the previous Labour government and extended over the past three years by National. The reforms have received widespread favourable press in the US where they have been enthusiastically endorsed by the economist Professor Milton Friedman and industrialist Dr Tony O'Reilly, whose company Heinz last year paid NZDollars 600m (Pounds 226.5m) for food processor Wattie Industries. Other companies such as Bell Atlantic, Ameritech, Bell South and International Paper have invested millions in New Zealand over the past four years on the assumption that the reforms will continue. Early trading in the bond, fixed interest and equity markets was dominated by fears of what offshore investors might do. Bond yields rose by nearly 1 per cent, the dollar plunged and the share market fell by 216 points on the NZ Top 40 capital index, as small investors panicked. By midday after the governor's statement the selling pressure eased as offshore investors remained on the sidelines. World Stock Markets, Page 39; Currencies, Page 33</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 48m at UES UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings group in which GKN has a 39.1 per cent stake, plunged to a record pre-tax loss of Pounds 48.1m last year, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 10.3m in 1992. The latest deficit could increase the pressure on GKN to resolve the future of its stake in UES, which is the last link with its past in steel, forgings and related 'nuts and bolts' businesses. The rest of UES is owned by British Steel. Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, said yesterday: 'Quite frankly, this is not a business we want to be in'. It is included among the peripheral businesses which GKN wishes to divest, but Sir David said prospects for an orthodox disposal were 'pretty poor'. The loss at UES, in which GKN's share is Pounds 19m, comes in spite of a rise in turnover from Pounds 565m to Pounds 591m, due partly to a full-year contribution from Lee Bright Bar, acquired in October 1992. Scrap prices paid by UES rose more than 60 per cent last year, and with selling prices depressed, margins were squeezed. On top of that, electricity costs rose faster than inflation, it said. Mr Rod Beddows, the steel consultant, said the European engineering steels market was in great difficulties. Also, Thyssen and Saarstahl, the two main competitors of UES in leaded, so-called free-cutting steel, used blast furnaces and did not rely on scrap as their raw material. UES suffered an operating loss of Pounds 21.1m last year, against a deficit of Pounds 12.2m in 1992. The latest figure includes Pounds 2.9m of redundancy costs as UES cut average employment from 8,322 in 1992 to 7,653 last year. Exceptional costs were Pounds 26.9m in 1993, with Pounds 19.6m of closure costs - principally related to the closure of the Templeborough works in Rotherham late last year - and Pounds 8m of reorganisation and restructuring costs, offset by small exceptional credits. The latest loss is only the second since UES was formed in 1986, and compares with peak profits of Pounds 67.3m in 1989. On a brighter note, UES did increase exports last year from Pounds 222m to Pounds 242m. Mr Don Ford, chairman, said there was some evidence of restocking in January and February, but signs of a sustainable uplift in volumes and margins had yet to be confirmed. Some observers believe the best solution for GKN would be to sell its stake to British Steel, which could then combine and rationalise the steel side of UES with parts of its own business. But it is understood GKN does not want to sell at a price which would force it to make a big write-off on the carrying value of its stake. In the meantime Sir David said UES has to continue attacking its cost base.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips Bullough shares Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group, yesterday warned that pre-tax profits for the year to October 31 would be about Pounds 8.5m, after carrying costs of Pounds 3.3m for redundancy payments. The shares shed 6p to 83p. The decline was attributed to the worse-than-expected results from Atal, the French subsidiary, where new management had initiated a redundancy programme. The group said yesterday that it intended to recommend an unchanged final dividend of 4.3p for a maintained total of 6.05p. In July, when reporting a midway fall to Pounds 5.89m (Pounds 7.18m), Bullough said that full-year profits would be below last time's Pounds 20.8m.</p>

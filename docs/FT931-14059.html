			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crunch time for the better-bred potato crisp A PROBLEM which has long bothered the potato crisp industry will be eliminated if field trials on a genetically-modified potato this year by Maribo Seeds are successful. Mr Leif Kjaergaard, managing director of the company, which is a subsidiary of the Danisco sugar and distilling group, said that discolouring arises if carbohydrates in the potato break down into sugar when the crisps are dipped in frying oil. Maribo Seeds has modified the carbohydrate make-up in a strain of potatoes, reducing the sugar content. The potato has been developed in co-operation with the European Chips and Snacks Association and the European Community.</p>

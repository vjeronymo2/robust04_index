			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Big shortage taken out THE great mystery of whether the UK will cut base rates in the near future intensified yesterday as money market dealers scrutinised the Bank of England's operations for clues, writes Peter John. Some suggested that although there was no obvious pointer the Bank was certainly not being obstructive to the market's drive for lower rates. Three-month lending rates - the best indicator of where base rates are heading, fell to just over 5 1/2 per cent, down from 5 15/16 a month ago. If the Bank is unhappy with the market's enthusiasm for rate cuts it can hold back in its daily dealings. Such operations force overnight rates higher, with these changes possibly also forcing up three month rates. However, no signals of this kind were detected yesterday. As one dealer said: 'If the Bank sent those sort of signals on a day when Europe is easing it would behaving like King Canute telling the tide to go back.' Short sterling futures, which currently reflect a mid-way view between between half a percentage point and one point off rates, trod water yesterday and closed only marginally firmer. In the money markets, the Bank of England offered an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 2.1bn, later revised to Pounds 2.05bn. Among factors affecting the shortage, Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 655m, higher note circulation withdrew Pounds 820m and T-bills and maturing assistance sapped Pounds 698m. The Bank of England provided Pounds 1.876bn of assistance at the established rates of 5 7/8 per cent in an early round of bill offers, including Pounds 615m of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on November 11 and 12 at 5 29/32 per cent. It did not operate in the money market at midday but provided Pounds 20m in the afternoon, via band one bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent, and late assistance of Pounds 150m bringing total help for the day to Pounds 2.046bn. The German short term interest rate contract for December almost hit 94.00 and closed closing nine basis points up at 93.97 on turnover of more than 70,000 contracts. The French futures contract for December lifted nine basis points to 93.83 and was beginning to discount rates of almost 6 per cent following the decision by the Bank of France to lower its intervention rate.</p>

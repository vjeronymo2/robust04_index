Chen Huanyou, secretary of the  Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee, gave an important speech at  the meeting. Sun Han, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial CPPCC  Committee, delivered the work report of the Seventh Jiangsu  Provincial CPPCC Committee Standing Committee at its request.    Chen Huanyou said: The second session of the seventh  provincial CPPCC committee is an important meeting held at an  important juncture when Jiangsu is restructuring its economic  system in accordance with guidelines laid down by the 14th  National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee. The meeting will be significant for  mobilizing all CPPCC organs and members, democratic parties,  industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and  people of all walks of life in Jiangsu to achieve greater  successes in CPPCC operations and to expedite Jiangsu's reform,  opening up, and modernization. On behalf of the Jiangsu  Provincial CPC Committee, he warmly congratulated the session  and extended his cordial regards to all CPPCC members, all CPPCC  organs, democratic parties, industrial and commercial  federations, mass organizations, and people of all walks of life  in Jiangsu.    After briefly reviewing the fruitful results which Jiangsu  achieved last year in seizing opportunity, deepening reform, and  opening up wider to the outside world, as well as simultaneously  promoting a material civilization and socialist ethics, Chen  Huanyou pointed out: These successes are the results of the  hard work done by the vast number of cadres and people in  Jiangsu--including all CPPCC organs, democratic parties,  industrial and commercial federations, mass organizations, and  people of all circles--under the correct leadership of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council. CPPCC organs at all  levels in Jiangsu and the vast number of CPPCC members have  played an important role in the overall development of Jiangsu.    Chen Huanyou also pointed out: 1994 is a very crucial year  for expediting reform, opening up, and modernization in  accordance with the guidelines laid down by the 14th National  Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. Seizing the opportunities, deepening reform,  opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development,  and ensuring stability are requirements of overall importance  set for the entire party and the entire country by the CPC  Central Committee. Work in all quarters must obey and serve  these requirements. While doing our work, we must fully adhere  to the general policy set for accomplishing this year's  assignments, and must pay special attention to properly handling  the relationship between reform, development, and stability.  This year's assignments are formidable. Under such  circumstances, people's political consultative organs are  important organs for multiparty cooperation and political  consultations under the CPC leadership, as well as important  avenues for fostering a socialist democracy. We must improve  CPPCC operations and make this year's assignments successful by  continuing to unite all forces which can be united and by  mobilizing all positive factors.    Chen Huanyou urged the provincial CPPCC committee to do  three  things. First, achieve a consensus of view by thoroughly  studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the "decision" made by the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. To  promote unity and cooperation among member units and people of  various circles, to properly perform their basic political  consultative and democratic supervisory duties, and to attain a  higher level of participating in administration and state  affairs discussion, members of the provincial people's political  consultative committee must thoroughly study and comprehend the  theory and decision until a consensus of views and common  understanding have been achieved. Second, members of the  provincial CPPCC committee must earnestly perform their basic  political consultative and democratic supervisory duties so as  to contribute to Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic  construction. The provincial CPPCC committee must organize and  mobilize its members to investigate, inspect, and discuss  decisions in a planned manner as well as come up with ways and  means for reform, opening up, economic construction, social  development, and other major issues. The provincial CPPCC  committee must make active efforts to promote the development of  science and technology, education, culture, health, sports, and  other social services; it must contribute its wisdom and  strength to Jiangsu's socialist spiritual construction. During  the course of improving party conduct, promoting administrative  ethics, and fighting corruption, the provincial CPPCC committee  must intensify its supervision. In safeguarding social  stability, it should actively assist party committees and  government departments in handling all types of contradictions  among the people and in dissolving all factors of instability so  that stability and political unity can be maintained.    Third, the provincial CPPCC committee must foster democracy  and unite more closely so as to consolidate and develop the  patriotic united front. As reforms continue to deepen, a  stronger and broader patriotic united front has become even more  essential for expediting economic construction. This is an  important mission placed on the shoulders of the people's  political consultative organs during the new period. While  doing its work, the provincial CPPCC committee must foster  democracy, unite more closely, and display the spirit of  providing democratic consultations. It should give full scope  to the roles played by all democratic parties, industrial and  commercial federations, and mass organizations. It should  strive to create a democratic, united, and harmonious  environment, and to unclog and broaden all democratic channels.  To promote the great cause of the motherland's peaceful  reunification, it should also strive to broaden the patriotic  united front overseas.    In conclusion, Chen Huanyou stressed: The party must provide  stronger leadership over CPPCC organs. Party committees at all  levels must do an even better job in upholding all rules  governing political consultations and democratic supervision.  Meanwhile, they should actively create conditions essential for  CPPCC members to participate in administration and state affairs  discussion, and should give CPPCC organs the support they need  for carrying out their projects so that CPPCC organs can give a  broader scope to their roles.    In his report, Sun Han pointed out: Since the seventh  provincial CPPCC Standing Committee began operating a year ago,  it has, under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC  Committee, extensively rallied all democratic parties, mass  organizations, patriots without party affiliation, and  representatives of various circles in Jiangsu; organized and  guided members to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as  the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee; actively carried out political  consultations and democratic supervision, centering around  Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization; actively  established relations with friends overseas for the motherland's  reunification; continued to collect cultural and historical  material; and strengthened itself so that its members can  function more effectively as a whole. All this shows the  provincial CPPCC committee has achieved new success in  consolidating and developing the patriotic united front; in  expediting Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization; in  building a better socialist democratic and legal system; and in  promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland.    Speaking on projects for 1994, Sun Han stated: In accordance  with the basic policy of the party and the state, as well as the  provincial party committee's planning, we will continue to  organize and guide our members to study the third volume of the  "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress; will  follow through with the "decision" made by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and actively carry  out consultative and supervisory activities, centering around  economic construction; will establish stronger relations between  members of the provincial CPPCC committee and people of all  walks of life in society; will actively carry out theoretical  studies about operations of CPPCC organs; and will continue to  build CPPCC organs into stronger bodies. I hope CPPCC organs at  all levels and their members will work with one heart and mind,  make concerted efforts, and make greater contributions to  achieving the grand objectives set for Jiangsu's reform and  development.

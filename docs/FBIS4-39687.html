			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 9 Jun -- Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, a member of  the Russian State Duma who chaired the foreign policy committee  in the former Supreme Soviet, has made a strong appeal against  the Russian parliament's ratification of a Russo-Georgian  treaty. In his words, Armenia has already become Russia's  strategic ally in the Caucases; therefore, there is no need to  make any concessions to Georgia.</p>

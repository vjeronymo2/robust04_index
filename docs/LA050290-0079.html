			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'FUNNY FACE' TO CLOSE AFI FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> A fresh print of Stanley Donen's glorious 1957 "Funny Face" closes the AFI Film  Festival on Thursday and then opens a one-week revival at the AMC Century 14.  Fred Astaire stars as a Richard Avedon-ish fashion photographer and Audrey  Hepburn is a mousy Greenwich Village bluestocking transformed into a radiant  model.  </P> <P> Featuring Gershwin standards, "Funny Face" is even more enjoyable than when it  was new; they don't make witty, high-style, sophisticated romantic musicals  like this anymore.  </P> <P> A Norma Shearer retrospective gets under way at the L.A. County Museum of Arton  Friday at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. with "Marie Antoinette" (1938), a landmark  costume picture in which Shearer nevertheless gives a remarkably shaded  portrayal of a frustrated, frivolous but finally gallant and brave queen.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 857-6010.

Nothing less than a warning cry was sounded last week by  officials of the Large Solid Rocket Booster Group, alias G2P.  The little-known consortium of SEP (75 percent) and SNPE (25  percent) designs and produces solid rocket engines for tactical  (Pluton and Hades) and strategic (SSBS and MSBS) nuclear  ballistic missiles. The Group's appeal coincided with the new  nominations of Pierre Betin, SEP deputy general manager, as  administrator and general manager of G2P, and of Emile Blanc,  SNPE CEO, as its Supervisory Board president (see AIR &amp;  COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1446).    In its first public statement since its inception in 1972,  G2P is desperately sounding the alarm to "save the national  capability" in large ballistic-missile propulsion systems. That  capability, stresses Emile Blanc, "represents an approximately  Fr25 billion investment over the last 25 years"!    Indeed, the leaders of the group and its parent companies  worry about a far-from-hypothetical risk that France could lose  its technical and industrial expertise in the manufacture of  big, military solid rocket boosters. For the last 10 years, the  country has mainly conducted a dwindling number of "exploratory  developments" (somewhere between research and actual  developments), and has failed to produce new missiles (or  propulsion systems). The S45 was shelved, and the new Navy M45  strategic missile copies the propulsion system of the M4 that  came out in 1980. Worse, the French Defense Ministry now appears  ready to delay the introduction of the future M5 strategic Navy  missile for two years.    "The current situation is certainly not upbeat, since there  have been no developments in propulsion since the M4," stresses  Jean Sollier, SEP's CEO. "The S45 was a great source of hope,  quickly dashed" since the program launched in 1987 was halted in  mid-1991.    True, the S45 was followed by several exploratory  development contracts foreshadowing the M5. But, says Sollier,  the contracts came along after 10 years of no activity and staff  reductions. And according to SEP's CEO, there is now "a national  problem" that "may cost the country the credibility of its  dissuasive force by 2005 or 2010"!    SNPE and SEP have already seen their total strategic  ballistic powder booster staff fall to less than a thousand, or  40 percent of the number employed in the eighties. Most  important, stresses Pierre Betin, the "hard core" of  "technologists" (engineers, technicians, and workers) with real  know-how in all aspects of big military rockets, from design  through production, has been reduced to "the bare minimum." A  detailed study of each position by G2P showed that this  irreplacable capability had been whittled away to a mere 500-550  by late 1993.    As far as Pierre Betin is concerned, "There would seem to  be,  if not peril, at least some danger"!    For as Emile Blanc stresses, the last few years have seen  the  scrapping of the Hades and the S45, the completion of the S3 and  M4 (with the only production extension being the M45), and the  delayed and still-threatened startup of the M5.    The G2P "can still survive", says P. Betin, "but not too  long  without government help"!    For government help is indeed the issue in a  strategic-missile solid booster industry which, unlike space  propulsion and its commercial offshoots, depends--as do the  missiles--on government's willingness to fully back dissuasive  policy. And France's strategic missile propulsion industry has  not fallen down on the job, quite the contrary. As expert Pierre  Betin, who has spent 30 years in the field, points out "There  have been no failures in ballistic rocket flight since 1977"!    "But today we are weakened", he says, and "the lack of  developments for the next 10 years poses a real danger of  destroying our store of expertise." Moreover, space propulsion  cannot replace strategic propulsion work among manufacturers.  Although there can (and should be) certain synergies between the  two, space and strategic propulsion are two different fields.  Performance and technical demands (structural ratio, total life,  environmental resistance, etc.) are greater for solid military  boosters. This is illustrated by Nitralane, developed and  perfected in France for the M5, and ultimately never used  despite the fact that it reportedly boosts French missiles to  the same level as the best American ones (Trident D2). Despite  budget restrictions, the United States takes great care to  preserve its expertise!    In France, in contrast, the situation is already red alert.  According to P. Betin, France's strategic propulsion industry  and know-how would be jeopardized if the M5 program were  temporarily halted as announced. And Emile Blanc fears that "We  will start next year at this year's level, then reduce funding  another 10 percent."    According to Blanc, neither research nor production can take  care of the situation alone. France urgently needs to apply its  store of know-how by making and regularly firing missiles (the  current timetable is one every two years). "If we get stuck in  exploratory developments only, our expertise will evaporate and  our personnel lose motivation," says Pierre Betin. The  government must therefore pursue development of the M5's  propulsion system.    But Emile Blanc insists that "The M5 will not be enough, for  there are no plans to follow it up with anything." This is  because France no longer has a regular, continuing series of  ballistic missile programs (under development or production), as  before. Consequently, the industry also needs to continue  exploratory development and refinement of big powder boosters  "to preserve the field."    Concretely, says the knowledgable Emile Blanc (a former  General Weapons Delegate), France must spend a minimum of Fr1  billion a year to keep its strategic propulsion capability  afloat. Half, or Fr500 million, must go to keep the "hard core"  of about 500 specialists intact. That amounts to only two  percent of the funding for the national dissuasive force, which  gobbles up approximately Fr25 billion a year!</p>

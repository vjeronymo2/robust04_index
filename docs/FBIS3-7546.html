			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hsu Shui-teh, secretary general of Taiwan's  Kuomintang, delivered a speech at a Tokyo hotel on 24 March, and  stated: "Taiwan has achieved its economic liberalization and  made advances in its political democratization. Our future task  is internationalization." Thus, he indicated Taiwan's strong  intention to return to the international community through its  admission into the GATT and the United Nations.    While stressing that Taiwan's economy is growing smoothly,  Secretary General Hsu stated that it is also advancing in its  political democratization under President Li Teng-hui's  leadership. Then, while disclosing good prospects for "the  direct presidential election by residents next year," Hsu  added: "As a result, democratization will be fully realized."    Touching on the issue of Taiwan's UN admission, Hsu  expressed  his dissatisfaction, and said: "It is unfair that Taiwan's  admission has not been approved while it has economic potential  and also intends to fulfill its mission as a member state of the  international community." Then, Secretary General Hsu, who is  also former representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural  Representative Office in Japan, called on Japan for its  cooperation in supporting Taiwan's UN admission.    On the issue of reunification with China, Hsu pointed out:  "While China's democratization is an indispensable factor, the  economic disparity is still too big." "However," he added,  "exchanges at the private level have been proceeding smoothly  but in a cautious way." Thus, he disclosed Taiwan's intention  to upgrade the level of dialogue to promote reunification.    Hsu also touched on Taiwan's achievements in the diplomatic  field. For example, President Li Teng-hui paid unofficial  visits to three ASEAN member nations last month with good  results. Moreover, he also stated that "we want to be admitted  into the GATT through our participation in the Asian Pacific  Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum." Thus, he stressed that "the  most important future task for Taiwan is its  internationalization."</p>

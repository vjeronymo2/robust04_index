			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was of the opinion that the activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of administering or scoring ability-to-benefit tests should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the examples of what the Secretary considers to be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer activity because these activities constitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the determination of student eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees with the commenter that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities could be considered to be an aspect of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of Title IV, HEA programs and therefore should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated. However, the Secretary believes that any abuses in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these types of activities will be protected against in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations governing the administration of ability-to-benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests. The Secretary plans to issue an NPRM on this subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shortly. Therefore, the Secretary does not believe it necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to regulate administering or scoring ability-to-benefit test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities as part of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters requested that attorneys litigating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on behalf of institutions to collect loan funds or interpreting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory or regulatory requirements be excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of third-party servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary generally considers attorneys not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be covered by the definition of a third-party servicer under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations. The Secretary, in promulgating the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of third-party servicer, applied the definition to a set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities relating to the administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, and thus is not regulating distinct entities by their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identity but rather the activities that individuals or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations perform in contracting with institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provision of legal advice is not one of these activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, it is conceivable that an attorney would be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer under these regulations if the activity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attorney, performed on behalf of an institution, constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. It would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to state that attorneys are never considered third-party servicers as that would permit services to escape oversight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simply by being provided under attorney signature or by non-attorneys working for attorneys or their law firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.8&blank;Eligible Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters believed that the definition of ``equivalent of an associate degree'' would be difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer because colleges do not have consistent standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepting two-year programs for full credit toward a bachelor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree and for qualifying a student for admission into the third  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year of a bachelor's degree program. Some of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that any person who completes the equivalent number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit hours necessary to receive an associate degree should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in this definition as long as the person earned those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits from an institution that was accredited by a nationally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized accrediting agency. Other commenters suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any program that leads to an occupational objective that requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing or certification and equals at least the length of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical associate degree program, should be added to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition. Another commenter expressed support for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision as written in the February 28, 1994 NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the February 28, 1994 NPRM, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition is modeled after section 1201(a)(3) of the HEA, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to measure the educational backgrounds of students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admitted to programs offered by a proprietary institution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that a student does not have the equivalent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an associate degree unless he or she has completed an educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program that includes two critical characteristics: the student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successfully completed at least a two-year program that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor's degree and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student qualifies for admission into the third year of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bachelor's degree program. The alternatives suggested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters lack these characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments about the absence of consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, the Secretary notes that inconsistent standards apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to students with associate degrees as well. The two-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs completed by students with an associate degree may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully transferable to some institutions offering bachelor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree, but not to other institutions. Institutions that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs leading to a bachelor's degree also have different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for determining a transfer student's standing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualitative Factors. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters argued that short-term programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (programs of less than 600 clock hours) should not be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be in existence for a year before establishing eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the rate of technological change in the workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dictates rapid responses by institutions in offering educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs to meet those changes. Some of these commenters also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that factors related to quality should be determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies. Another commenter suggested that initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility for these programs should be based on an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track record of success rather than the existence of the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for one year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that a good track record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success is whether an institution can maintain a new program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one year. The Secretary agrees that the quality of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs should continue to be monitored by accrediting agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the history of abuse in these programs necessitates Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory standards as well. Institutions are not prevented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from responding rapidly to the demands of the economy by offering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new short-term programs, but institutions must be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that these new programs can meet the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placement and completion rate standards before Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds are provided to students enrolled in these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obviously, this data cannot be provided unless the program has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been in existence for a period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters objected to limiting the length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a program to no more than 150 percent of the minimum number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock hours required for training in the recognized occupation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which the program prepares students, as established by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State in which the program is offered, if the State has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established such a requirement. Some of these commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed that the requirement would create inconsistent standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because States have different requirements and that maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program lengths should be determined by accrediting agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter argued that differing State standards would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make it difficult to train students from neighboring States if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those States have higher standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters believed that ``course stretching'' was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent source of abuse. They cited examples of institutions'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combining short programs into one accredited course that does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically lead to licensure, purely for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the statutory 600 clock hour minimum. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the standard in the February 28, 1994 NPRM was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> too lenient and that the program length should not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum State standard. Some commenters suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum licensing standards of the Federal government should also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be taken into account in limiting the length of a program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that exceptions should be made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general standard if the education provided by a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program was better than average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that 150 percent of the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum allows enough latitude for institutions to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality programs and furnishes a sufficient safeguard against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abuses of course stretching. Because States have different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing standards, the Secretary does not believe that a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for a maximum program length is appropriate. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argument made by one commenter about training students from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighboring States with higher standards only serves to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illustrate the importance of recognizing each State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Training students who will not be able to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing requirements of the States in which they intend to work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a terrible disservice to those students. The Secretary agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these regulations ought to recognize any minimum standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by various Federal agencies for applicable short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision is revised to prohibit a short-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible program from exceeding by 50 percent any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum number of clock hours required by a Federal agency for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training in the recognized occupation for which the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

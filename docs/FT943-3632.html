			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nestor-BNA in the red after disposal The sale of its hospitals and nursing home division earlier this year pushed Nestor-BNA, the healthcare and personnel group, into the red for the 24 weeks to June 17. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.5m was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 4.2m, reflecting a loss of Pounds 4.5m on the sale of the division offset by a gain of Pounds 290,000. The loss compares with profits of Pounds 2.01m. Turnover rose from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 56m, including Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 5.01m) from discontinued operations. Mr Mike Rogers, chief executive, said there had been strong growth in the UK nursing agency business, which is the biggest in the country and accounts for about half of turnover. Operating profits rose from Pounds 862,000 to Pounds 1.2m. However, the nursing agency business in the US had suffered in extremely difficult markets and operating profits fell to Pounds 356,000 (Pounds 744,000). The disposal reduced fixed assets from Pounds 18.4m at the end of last year to Pounds 2.9m, and shareholders' funds from Pounds 5.66m to Pounds 2.42m. Borrowings dropped from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 5.54m, cutting gearing from 324 per cent to 229 per cent. Losses per share were 4.11p (1.93p earnings). The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.15p. COMMENT Getting out of hospitals looks like a good move, enabling the company to concentrate on the growth area of flexible health care. The debt situation is also clearer, with interest cover much improved. Stripping out the exceptionals, earnings per share of about 4p can be expected for the full year, so the dividend looks safe despite the disastrous foray into the US. At the moment the yield of 8 per cent - almost double the market average - is the only reason for any interest in the stock. The question is, how long will the US albatross delay a dividend increase?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Iulian Radulescu, a  Gypsy self titled "Emperor Iulian the First of all Roms," was  freed on bail on 30 May, a few days after his arrest by the  police.    Involved in bulk misappropriation of electrolytic copper  from  the Ampelum copper field of Zlatna, Iulian Radulescu had been  accused of selling, jointly with his accomplices, stolen copper  to Turkey through a connection the ramifications of which are  not entirely known yet.    On 20 May this year the police and prosecutor's office of  Alba County issued a warrant, his apprehension proper being  possible as late as 26 May, when Radulescu returned to Romania  from Spain, where, according to his statement, he had been  invited to take part in an international symposium of Romanis  held in Seville.    "I want an inquest fitting my imperial status," he said upon  his arrest, and promised to cooperate with the police for the  clarification of the circumstances.    According to the population census of January 1992,  registered as living in Romania are 409,720 Gypsies (Romanis or  Roms,) which form the second largest ethnic minority after  Hungarians recorded as numbering 1,620,000. Gypsy leaders speak  of figures higher than the official records.    Iulian Radulescu "crowned" himself "Emperor of Roms  Everywhere" in August 1993, more than one and a half years after  the ceremony during which a cousin of his, Ioan Cioaba,  proclaimed himself "International King of Roms in Romania on  Five Continents." The two "crowned heads" are in-laws, their  children having been married in 1989 in the United States. Both  Radulescu and Cioaba live in Sibiu.    The Gypsies in Romania do not seem to take the two  "monarchs"  seriously, most of them ignoring them completely.    As in the case of other ethnic minorities, their leaders  failed to be elected to parliament in the September 1992  elections. The Gypsies are yet represented to the legislative  body by a deputy thanks to the provisions of the Romanian  Constitution, which enables each ethnic minority to appoint a  representative to parliament.</p>

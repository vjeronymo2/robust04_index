			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The cabinet held a periodic meeting under Acting  Prime Minister brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar this  morning. It discussed topics on the agenda. Discussions focused  on the supply situation in the republic and on the regulations  governing the distribution of the necessary foods and consumer  goods.    The cabinet set up a working team to directly supervise all  storing, distribution, and transportation operations in order to  secure regular delivery of all these goods to all governorates.  This is because supplying the necessary commodities to citizens  will complement and enhance all military and political field  activities.    The cabinet stressed the need for contributions by all  official and popular organizations and institutions. It also  emphasized the need to pool all efforts in order to make  successful the transportation and distribution operations,  disburse the stored commodities, and solve the problems  pertaining to transportation and distribution operations, in  addition to organizing the monitoring operations, implementing  strict measures against those who violate the supply regulations  and laws, and addressing this issue with seriousness and high  discipline on the part of the institutions in charge of control.    The cabinet also discussed a memorandum submitted by the  brother minister of planning and development requesting approval  of an agreement between the Yemeni government and the Arab Fund  [not further identified] on financing a project to rehabilitate  the electric, water, and sewage disposal installations in Aden,  the economic and commercial capital. The cabinet approved this  agreement and asked the parties concerned to make all  arrangements in order to accomplish this vital project for Aden,  the economic and commercial capital.    In view of what the forces rebelling against the  constitutional legitimacy are carrying out in terms of  subversive and destructive acts against the vital economic  installations--the latest of which was the raid on the power  station in Mocha, in the governorate of Ta'izz, which inflicted  serious damage, martyred 17 citizens mostly women and children,  and wounded 33 others--the cabinet expressed its indignation and  condemned these continued crimes committed by the rebels against  public property and vital facilities of the homeland and  citizens. It also emphasized that those who commit these  treacherous crimes will receive punishment sooner or later as  criminals acting against the people and the homeland.    Moreover, the cabinet saluted the valiant Armed Forces'  great  efforts to protect all national gains and achievements,  safeguard the civilian and vital installations and public  utilities, and maintain security and stability. It stressed the  need to increase vigilance in order to foil all hostile and  conspiratorial schemes designed to fragment the homeland and  destroy its resources and capabilities.

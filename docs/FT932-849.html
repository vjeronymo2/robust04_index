			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Revival forecast for construction THE 'long and painful' recession in the construction industry appears to be coming to an end, the latest forecasts from industry leaders show. These indicate that construction output is expected to fall by only 0.5 per cent this year  - just a quarter of the fall it had forecast previously. The joint forecasting committee for the construction industry  - drawn from a cross-section of construction, building materials, banks, and financial and industrial companies  - expects construction output to rise by 0.5 per next year and 2.5 per cent in 1995. This would follow a fall in output of almost 10 per cent in 1991 and a decline of 5.5 per cent last year. The improvement in outlook had been caused entirely by a bigger rise than expected in housebuilding and residential repair and maintenance. The figures were prepared by Construction Forecasting and Research, which was previously sponsored by the National Economic Development Office. Its forecasts are regarded as one of the best guides of the industry's expectations. The organisation said yesterday that private-housing activity was expected to increase by Pounds 600m this year, 'leading the UK construction industry out of its two-year slump'. Its findings are supported by construction order figures published by the Department of the Environment which this week showed that contracts won by construction companies from February to April rose by 10 per cent compared with the previous three months. Orders were also 1 per cent higher than during the corresponding period last year. The improvement, however, is patchy, and Construction Forecasting and Research warned that areas of construction other than housebuilding were likely to remain depressed.</p>

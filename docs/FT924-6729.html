			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Motorists to pay as they go MOTORISTS COULD be paying to use roads in London and other cities by the late 1990s, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, signalled yesterday. Tolls would be collected electronically, with meters in cars activated by roadside transmitters clocking up charges according to distance travelled, vehicle type and time of day. Mr MacGregor appears to have accepted that charging motorists on a pay-as-you-go basis is likely to provide the only feasible long-term solution to worsening urban traffic congestion. He has the support of environment ministers who favour such charges as a way to curb the rise in carbon dioxide emissions that accompanies rapid traffic growth. Speaking at a London traffic conference yesterday, Mr MacGregor in effect launched a campaign to soften up public opinion in readiness for the likely introduction of road pricing in the late 1990s. He said no firm decisions would be taken before the completion of a three-year feasibility study at the end of 1994, but his intention was to get a debate going. Mr MacGregor acknowledged that road pricing was likely to prove unpopular, but said that the alternative could be even worse. 'Is increasing congestion, and ultimately gridlock, a more attractive option?' he asked. Road pricing would shorten journey times, improve bus services and cut transport costs, he said. It would also help trade and commerce by making cities more attractive places in which to live, shop and work. The initiative may yet face opposition from Mr MacGregor's cabinet colleagues, some of whom will argue that road pricing could become a transport version of the poll tax.</p>

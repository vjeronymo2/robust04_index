			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Withholding tax agreement helps lift German paper NEWS that an agreement had finally been reached in Germany on withholding tax on interest income lifted bund prices yesterday, with gains for both short and longer-dated bonds. But the bund market failed to take any further heart from comments by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, that the German authorities are in a position to cut interest rates soon. Mr Brady's suggestion that German interest rates could come down - 'not tomorrow, not the next day, but some time in the near future' - was widely seen as a manifestation either of wishful thinking or politicking. A sharp fall in the dollar helped to spur some other bond markets, particularly Japan. Yesterday's agreement for a 30 per cent withholding tax in Germany, reached by an arbitration committee, was in line with the market's hopes. No attempts will be made to reduce bank secrecy, stemming fears of a capital flight from the country. The new tax, to be levied from the beginning of next year, is projected to contribute some DM4bn in 1993 and 1994 to the German unity fund. The news helped lift prices - though with a larger than normal issue of bonds expected later in the week, the reaction was muted. The 8 per cent bonds due 2002 rose to 100.20 by the close, from 100.16 the previous day. On Liffe, the bund futures contract, which opened up at 88.19, eased off during the day to end at around 88.15. FURTHER sterling weakness yesterday meant a lacklustre day for UK government bonds, with the pound dropping closer to the 2.88 level against the D-Mark. The Bank of England was able to supply more gilts to the market, selling more of the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked issue announced last Friday. However, the bulk of the Pounds 700m announced continues to hang over the market, holding back prices. Prices moved up during the day, only to fall back to around their opening levels. The partly-paid 9 per cent bonds due 2012 gained  1/32 of a point on the day to 36 7/8 , while the 11 3/4 per cent bonds due 2003/07 lost  1/32 of a point. Losses among shorter-dated bonds were more marked, continuing the disappointment at the Bank of England's failure to engineer an interest rate cut after optimistic signs on Friday. The 10 per cent gilts maturing in 1996 lost  5/32 of a point, to 103 5/32 . US Treasury securities retained their firm tone, and with demand stronger at the market's short end the yield curve continued to steepen. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/32 at 104 5/8 , yielding 7.598 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 101 3/16 , to carry a yield of 4.350 per cent. For the second consecutive day investors showed a preference for shorter over longer-dated securities, with the yield on the two-year note falling further than the yield on the 30-year bond. Analysts said that the steepening of the yield curve was a reflection of investor concern that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate cut last week could eventually revive inflationary pressures in the economy over the longer term. JAPANESE government bonds continued their advance as the yen gained ground against the dollar. Although the Bank of Japan continued to signal that a cut in the Official Discount Rate, currently at 3.75 per cent, was not imminent, the market remained confident that a cut would come before long. The benchmark No 129 was trading late in the day in London at a yield of below 5.20 per cent, down from 5.23 per cent yesterday.</p>

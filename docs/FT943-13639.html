			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Tougher rules demanded on low-rent homes Housing experts have called for tougher regulation of housing associations, the voluntary organisations that provide almost all new low-cost homes for rent. Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes government grants to associations, said yesterday that he needed stronger powers to regulate housing association finances. And in a report out today, Professor Valerie Karn of Manchester University and Ms Linda Sheridan of Liverpool University call on the government to impose minimum building standards on housing associations. Mr Mayer said he had asked the government for stronger regulatory powers as he launched the corporation's annual report. This showed that the number of cases the corporation identified as requiring supervision last year was 81, up from 44 in the previous year. Mr Mayer said that the Department of the Environment would soon be publishing a discussion paper on new powers for the corporation. These would include proposals for faster intervention in associations when financial problems arose. Mr Mayer said that the existing procedures for intervening were 'cumbersome' and should be replaced by powers similar to those of receivers in companies that went into liquidation. The corporation wants associations to provide it with information on their unregistered subsidiaries. These subsidiaries, often set up to build low-cost homes for sale, can have a significant impact on association performance. The call for stricter regulation on building standards comes in a report published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. The report says that building standards are falling. It says most new homes have insufficient storage space and many lack enough space for families to eat together. The authors call on the government to specify minimum standards for housing association homes. Mr Greg Lomax, deputy chief executive of the corporation, said that the research had been undertaken in 1991 and did not take account of improvements made since then. Independent research carried out for the corporation had indicated no cause for concern. New Homes in the 1990s. Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 40 Water End, York YO3 6LP. Pounds 8.50.</p>

It  said the bank's board approved Czechoslovakia for all the agency's programs,  including subsidized loans and guarantees of private bank loans to help other  countries import U.S. goods. Among countries formerly under hard-line Communist  rule, the bank was already doing business with Hungary and Yugoslavia.  </P></p>

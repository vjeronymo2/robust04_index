			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Yevgenyev: "The Establishment of </F> Interstate Bank Marks the First Step Toward an Economic Union";  first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] Bankers from national banks of the CIS countries met  in Moscow to discuss the future structure of a financial  community.    The Central Bank of Russia held a three-day seminar with the  participation of the International Monetary Fund and the  European Political Research Centre in order to organize an  interstate bank.    The interstate bank is meant to be a supranational structure  for effecting settlements between the CIS countries for state  deliveries. In the course of discussions the participants which  included representatives of central banks of the Commonwealth  countries became distinctly aware that the interstate bank will  either never get off the ground or will require participant  countries to reform their financial systems.    The decision on the formation of the interstate bank with  its  headquarters in Moscow was discussed for several years and was  made last autumn. All members of the future bank agreed that its  main function would be to deal with interstate trade. The  present system of state payments between the CIS countries does  not suit most of them since sums for exported goods are entered  to accounts of enterprises of the CIS countries in Russian  commercial banks. (The exporters of the "near abroad" countries  regard the ruble as a relatively hard currency.) Bankers believe  that the flight from national currencies to the rouble does not  help stabilize other soft currencies, encourages the leakage of  capital and causes the shortfall in taxes. State agencies are  interested therefore in changing the order of interstate  settlements.    Ironically, the seminar was prepared by specialists of the  International Monetary Fund and conducted by the Central Bank of  Russia. The interstate bank still has no office, equipment and  staff. (It is true that it has received a contribution from  Russia of 2.5 billion roubles, which is half of the total. The  contributions of other participants vary depending on their  share in interstate trade.) But this arrangement is quite  justified since the choice of the bank's model will determine  the methods of solving several problems of principle which are  not directly connected with its activity. For example, the  experts of the International Monetary Fund discovered on the  very first day of the seminar that, although the colleagues from  the CIS countries showed interest in the subject, they were on  the whole sceptical. It became clear from subsequent talks that  their doubts stemmed not from the bank's model but from the  conditions in which it will have to be implemented. The  interstate bank can be considered stillborn if a single  settlement mechanism is applied to countries with different  currency, monetary and licence rules. The participants in the  meeting became distinctly aware of the necessity of the  unification of several conditions, which is, alas, beyond their  competence.    Russia, which has a positive trade balance, can painlessly  change over to a new system of interstate settlements. The  situation of Turkmenistan is also quite satisfactory. The other  states have debts to repay for which they will need credits.  Sources of credit are needed and debts must be formalized.  Specialists from national banks admit that countries find it  difficult today to separate the debts of states from those of  individuals. Thus most countries will be in a quandary because  of the changeover to the new system which does not allow  arbitrary crediting. When the debt exceeds the established limit  the account of the participant country in the interstate bank  can be blocked, which means that payments will be frozen and  trade will stop. The debtor state will then have to sell part of  its hard currency reserves in order to cover the debt balance.  The changeover to a system of settlements through the interstate  bank will also mean for most CIS countries the automatic  introduction of compulsory 100 per cent sale of proceeds in hard  currency since clearing settlements between countries will be  done in roubles and with the final clients in their own national  currency. (It may be noted for comparison that Kazakhstan has  until recently practised 30 per cent compulsory sale of hard  currency. The exporter kept 70 per cent of the total, which was  often kept abroad.) The deportation of exporters' money home,  especially in national currency, can hardly be welcomed by them.    The establishment of the interstate bank should, according  to  the intention of the contracting countries of the former USSR  conclude the first stage of a new economic union. During the  second stage they plan to form a payments union for countries  which cannot satisfy the current conditions to enter the  interstate bank. Settlements between the participants in the  payments union will be also effected in roubles which will be  considered the reserve currency.    The uncoordinated market rules in the various former union  republics make it difficult to establish a payments system  similar to the European one. It is entirely unclear now, at the  first stage what goods will be entered in the list of state  deliveries, whether they will be licensed, whether the system of  settlements through correspondent accounts in commercial banks,  practised until now, will be preserved, and how rates of  exchange will be coordinated. The European payments system  presupposes, for instance, a mechanism to regulate exchange  rates (introduction of a fixed rate of exchange) with a  permissible deviation of plus-minus one. But in order to  introduce such a system all states participating in the union  should possess adequate currency reserves for supporting the  fixed rate of exchange by means of currency interventions in the  market. Most CIS countries have insufficient reserves of hard  currency. If the rate of exchange is established freely, through  a currency exchange or an auction, it should cover all deals  concluded in the country and not be divided into official and  black-market rates. It should not be forgotten, above all, that  the elaboration of a currency policy is a state matter and that  banks are totally powerless to change the rules of the game.    In any case the establishment of an interstate bank would  shorten the time required for payments and their guarantee.    At the same time the interstate bank will not work if the  rules of the game in the countries participating in the union  remain uncoordinated. Since suppliers find it better to live  "under the old regime" it will evidently be necessary to  introduce bureaucratic checks as well.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Italy told to recall Somali force chief THE United Nations has demanded the recall to Rome of the freewheeling commander of Italian troops in Somalia and may have to consider removing his entire contingent, a senior UN official disclosed last night. Mr Kofi Annan, who is in charge of all UN peacekeeping operations, told a press conference that General Bruno Loi would soon be 'rotated' home, at the express request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general. Italian soldiers serving with the UN would probably be redeployed north of Mogadishu, away from the scene of recent bloody clashes. Alluding to Gen Loi's reported defiance of orders by Gen Civek Bir, the Turkish commander of all UN troops in Somalia, Mr Annan said the option of removing a national contingent altogether might have to be considered when it placed an entire enterprise in jeopardy. He warned other governments that had presumed to dictate to their troops over the heads of Gen Bir and former US Admiral Jonathan Howe, the secretary-general's special envoy, that this behaviour was unacceptable. One contingent had even refused to accept assignments for a month, placing an extra burden on other troops who were not so well equipped, he revealed, without identifying the recalcitrant unit. He denied reports that the UN refused to negotiate with Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive Somali warlord or that the warlord, whose arrest and detention have been ordered, was singled out as a special villain. The UN was prepared to deal similarly with any other rebel faction, if necessary. He observed that the governments that committed troops to the UN command knew what they were getting into and that it was an enforcement operation, not the traditional peacekeeping mission. Violence was mainly in southern Mogadishu, the Aideed stronghold, while much of the rest of Somalia including the northern part of the capital, had been pacified and was co-operating with the UN. Somali militants yesterday distributed leaflets in the streets of south Mogadishu in which they vowed to kill all US troops serving with the UN mission and called on Moslems worldwide to kill Americans in their countries. The 'fatwah', a Moslem death warrant, was a clear sign that Gen Aideed's militias are steeling themselves for a protracted struggle against the 14,000 UN troops stationed in the capital. It also appeared to be an attempt to drive a wedge between the 4,000 American soldiers and other contingents fighting under the UN flag. 'We appeal to all countries of the multinational force to stay far from the American sites in Mogadishu,' the leaflet, signed by The Moslem Voice, said. 'We are going to launch an attack to the American compounds in Mogadishu,' it said. Mr Barry Walkley, the UN spokesman in Mogadishu, said he had not seen the pamphlets, but placed little importance on them. 'It sounds like a plea of desperation to me. I don't think we will see massive attacks against US installations,' he said. Meanwhile, the death toll from Monday's Cobra assault on an Aideed compound continued to rise. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has access to Mogadishu's primitive hospitals, said 50 people were killed.</p>

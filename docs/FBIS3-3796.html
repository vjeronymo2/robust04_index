Our station  reporter Yao Sukun and Liu Hao sent the following report:    [Hosokawa briefly heard, speaking in Japanese, fading into  Chinese translation] Shanghai is the locomotive of China's  economic development. I wanted to come and visit Shanghai for a  long time. Today I have realized my wish. I am very happy  indeed.    While giving his impressions of the visit to Pudong,  Hosokawa  pointed out: I am moved that Pudong has managed to develop to  the present scale within a very short period.    Hosokawa showed great interest in the development of Pudong  New Area. He said: Pudong should step up efforts to publicize  itself in order to attract more Japanese entrepreneurs,  especially those of medium and small enterprises, to come and  invest here. He also hoped that Pudong New Area would provide  facilities for schooling and housing for children of Japanese  investors.    Speaking on efforts to strengthen economic cooperation  between Japan and China, Premier Hosokawa pointed out:  Strengthening economic cooperation between Japan and China is  conducive to the economic development in the world. Economic  cooperation between Japan and China can further push forward the  world's economic development. Japan will continue to make  efforts toward this end. Prime Minister Hosokawa hoped that the  ties between the two countries will move toward an even better  direction. He said this is the very purpose of his current  visit to China.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Greenspan testimony to guide dollar - Currencies The dollar will stay the focus of attention this week, with markets focusing on the Humphrey Hawkins testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, on Wednesday. While the US currency remains gripped by bearish sentiment, it did benefit last week from the firmer tone of US bond markets. If Mr Greenspan can convince markets that the Fed is on top of the battle against inflation, this could support the bond market rally, and hence the dollar. Although good inflation figures and a modest rise in retail rates mean policy moves will probably wait until the next FOMC meeting on August 16, there is a possibility of a pre-emptive strike ahead of Mr Greenspan's testimony. The Fed chairman is reputed to prefer to explain what has already been done, rather than what lies ahead. The Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday will also be in the spotlight. The June M3 growth figure will be released earlier in the week, and with the market expecting it to fall to 12 per cent - some forecasts suggest closer to 10 per cent - from 13.7 per cent, the way may be open for the Bundesbank to cut official interest rates. Lower rates could help the dollar. A raft of statistical releases in the UK could also support sterling. The distributive trades survey on Tuesday, retail sales data on Wednesday and second quarter GDP estimates on Friday should confirm a picture of a stronger growth trend, with inflation remaining at a low ebb. Subject to the dollar not turning sharply lower again - this would inevitably drag sterling with it - the economic data could support a move into UK assets, evidenced by the firmer tone of UK shares and bonds at the end of last week. In Europe markets will be watching the tussle between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, and the anti-corruption magistrates which last week threatened to drive the lira below L1,000 against the D-Mark.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Rouble fall threatens to undo everything Russian and foreign experts agree that if what is driving the fall of the rouble - which dropped a further 6 per cent yesterday - is not corrected, the government's economic achievements over the first eight months of this year will be set at nought. In danger, now, is the future of its economic strategy, of further assistance from the international financial institutions, and even of the government, they say. However, some dealers and bankers view it differently. One said the rouble's fall - by more than 16 per cent this month alone - was merely the Central Bank of Russia's way of driving down the rate in order that it can sell hard currency to help pay the government's debts, especially delayed wage bills. Another said the central bank periodically adjusted its rate by intervening or (as now) refusing to intervene until a rate which suits it is reached - 'and then the rouble becomes relatively stable there'. A third, more worriedly, said: 'It should not get much worse. But if it does then the situation may run out of control very quickly.' The less sanguine analysis is that it will get out of control quickly. Mr Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister, leader of the main liberal party Russia's Choice and head of the Institute for the Study of Problems of the Transitional Period, said yesterday that the rouble's fall reflected the rise in money supply which had been going on since April and was only now working its way through in higher inflation because of the long time lag between credit expansion and inflation. The period in the summer when people had found it more profitable to keep their money in roubles had ended, he said, and there was now a flight to the dollar driven by fears of rising inflation. 'This is dangerous . . . .because it carries the risk of long term stagnation which would not be ended by the time of the (parliamentary) elections at the end of 1995.' 'The trouble is that everyone tends to move one way in Russia,' said a western finance official, 'and this increases the speed of a collapse. And if you get the rouble falling rapidly, few governments can sit back and watch it without attempting to clamp controls, like suspending trading.' The immediate effect of the drop will be a feed-through to higher prices for imported goods, and an upward twist to inflation already said to be rising this month from last month's low of 4 per cent to a level estimated by the government at 7 to 8 per cent and by others to be up to 10 per cent. Mr Gaidar said that a rise this month and the next two is 'inevitable' even if the government immediately tightened its monetary policy. The finance ministry, supported by the prime minister, has tried hard to screw down on spending - though extra credits were issued over the summer totalling Rbs7,000bn and Mr Gaidar said that monetary growth doubled in the second quarter of the year compared with the first. Already, the energy and military lobbies have opened the first rounds of the fight for more credits and the government's hopes of getting the 1995 budget through the parliament with the same ease as it did the 1994 budget earlier this year seem certain to be dashed. The danger signals come just as the International Monetary Fund is staging its annual meeting, in Madrid, where it will entertain Russian demands for a standby credit and other support. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said in Washington on Monday that Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn could be available from the international financial institutions plus a further Dollars 6bn later to stabilise the currency - if the Russian government managed to adopt and stick to a reform programme more rigorous than their present one. 'The IMF should go to Russia and see what the situation is, see if there is something to support. Clearly it can't support any old programme,' said one US official yesterday. However, the difficulty for the IMF, as for the Group of Seven advanced industrial nations, is to risk losing the present government if it is not supported with more aid - or to lose the aid if it is applied to a defective programme. Mr Gaidar, in comments yesterday, appeared to believe the Fund should be cautious. Asked what he would advise the IMF to do, he said: 'I would look very carefully at the credit expansion in Russia in the past three to four months. I would look at the planned expenditure of the budget and the real possibilities of financing that expenditure - that's the fundamental problem and if it's not solved then support could be ineffective.' As Mr Yevgeny Yasin, an economic adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, warned last week, 'the government is standing on a very narrow strip of ground and can easily be pushed off it'.</p>

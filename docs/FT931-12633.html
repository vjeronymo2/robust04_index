			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Royal LePage dividend passed after heavy loss ROYAL LePage, Canada's leading residential and commercial real estate brokerage, a sister company of troubled Royal Trustco, suffered a heavy loss for 1992 and has eliminated its 10 cents-a-share quarterly dividend completely. LePage, publicly traded and a household name across Canada, is 53 per cent controlled by the Edper Bronfman group, which is also seeking a buyer for Royal Trustco, the country's second-biggest trust company. LePage has been hit by the recession and property market collapse in Canada. Commissions are under heavy pressure and the company has been losing market share to national franchise groups. LePage posted a 1992 loss of CDollars 16.3m, or Dollars 1.04 a share, against a profit of CDollars 800,000, or 5 cents, in 1991. Revenues slipped 1 per cent to CDollars 481m. The company had already cut its dividend last summer, and Trilon Financial, the Bronfman holding company which controls LePage, has been taking its dividends in stock for two years.</p>

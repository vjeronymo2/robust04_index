			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 CHEMICAL SKEWS DATA LISTING STATE FIRST IN TOXICS, OFFICIALS EXPLAIN  </P> <P> A government survey released Monday showed that the volume of toxic pollutants  emitted into the air, water and underground wells of California far exceeds  that of any other state.  </P> <P> But government officials said that finding represents an exaggerated picture of  the state's performance, noting that the chemical principally responsible for  the state's poor showing is no longer regarded by the Environmental Protection  Agency as toxic.  </P> <P> If that chemical -- sodium sulfate -- were excluded from the government  assessment, the state's emissions of toxic substances would rank ninth in the  nation, well behind Texas and Louisiana, which then would head the list.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 26% of U.S. Total  </P> <P> The assessment is contained in a government report that seeks for the first  time to provide a national inventory of more than 300 cancer-causing and other  hazardous chemicals released by manufacturing facilities into the air, land and  water.  </P> <P> Of 22.6 billion pounds of toxic chemicals emitted into the environment in 1987,  California was responsible for 5.8 billion pounds -- about 26% of the national  total, the report showed.  </P> <P> But about 90% of the state's total derived from a Central California plant's  vast emission of sodium sulfate, which was removed last week from the  government's most-hazardous list because of its apparent lack of toxicity.  </P> <P> The facility, a Kerr-McGee chemical plant in Trona, Calif., 180 miles northeast  of Los Angeles, takes sodium sulfate from dry Searles Lake and uses it in the  production of a variety of products, including potash and soda ash.  </P> <P> Among the products is sodium sulfate itself, which is known as salt cake and  used in detergents and the paper-pulping process. But most of the chemical,  about 3.7 billion pounds, is discharged into surface water each year, while an  additional 1.5 billion pounds is injected into underground wells.  </P> <P> Sodium sulfate was included in a list of more than 300 toxic chemicals that  Congress required industry to monitor closely under a 1986 law. But senior EPA  officials said Monday that they believe listing the chemical as toxic was a  mistake by lawmakers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Basically Innocent'  </P> <P> "We think sodium sulfate is basically innocent," Charles Elkins, director of  the agency's toxics program, told reporters at a briefing.  </P> <P> Other toxic pollutants released in greater volumes in California than in most  other states included toluene, arsenic, lead and lead compounds and a variety  of pesticides.  </P> <P> Separate EPA estimates of toxic emissions into land, air and water across the  county had already been made public. But the release of the comprehensive  "toxics release inventory" Monday marked the first time that the agency had  analyzed many of its findings by geographical region.  </P> <P> The survey will be released publicly through a new computer database maintained  by the National Library of Medicine. Under the program, individuals can use  library facilities to obtain information about toxic pollutants released at  facilities near them.  </P> <P> Among the available information will be estimates of the volume of toxins  released at each site and an explanation of the health hazards each chemical  may pose.  </P> <P> No official assessment will be made of the health risk posed by toxic releases  at individual industrial sites, even though preliminary EPA studies have  identified more than 200 sites believed to pose a particularly high risk of  cancer.  </P> <P> Agency officials emphasized Monday that such studies are not final but said  that they believe it important for the raw information about toxic emissions to  be made public.  </P> <P> The new database, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said, is a "breakthrough  that will facilitate citizen involvement in assessing the risks of toxic  chemicals and developing community strategies to prevent pollution."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a separate list of major toxic polluters, based on EPA data and  released by a leading environmental group Monday, lists a Compton plant among  the nation's 30-largest sources of cancer-causing air pollutants by volume.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Crain Industries facility released more than 1 million pounds of  methylene chloride, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense  Council. The chemical, a solvent used as a paint remover, is classified by the  EPA as a "probable human carcinogen."  </P> <P> Officials at Crain could not be reached for comment Monday on the report.  </P> <P> By comparison, the nation's top-ranking producer of toxic air pollutants -- an  Eastman Kodak Co. facility in Rochester, N.Y. -- emitted nearly 9 million tons  of methylene chloride that year, according to the report.  </P> <P> The National Resources report is based on industry reports to the EPA. An  earlier list of polluters, drawn from preliminary EPA data based on health  risks from certain chemicals, included several Southern California facilities  but not the Crain Industries plant.  </P></p>

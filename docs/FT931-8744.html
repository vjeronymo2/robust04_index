			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Socialists trailing in France FRANCE'S centre-right coalition is on course for a crushing victory against the ruling Socialists in next month's parliamentary elections, according to the latest opinion poll. This suggests the coalition could win four-fifths of the National Assembly's 555 mainland seats, The Sofres poll suggested that 40 per cent of French voters favour the conservative RPR and UDF alliance, with 21 per cent backing the Socialists. This would give the conservatives 453 seats and the Socialists 80, compared with their present tally of 247. Support for the ecologists, who pushed the Socialists into third place in recent polls, has slipped to 15 per cent. President Francois Mitterrand, who has hitherto stayed aloof from the fray, will tonight stage the first of two live television programmes in which he will answer questions from voters. The Socialists hope the programmes will be as successful as his TV debate before September's Maastricht referendum. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, however, is still hampered by the row over the FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) interest-free loan he received from Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, a financier later charged with insider trading. The justice ministry on Tuesday rejected a judge's request to investigate the loan. But Liberation, the centre-left newspaper, yesterday published a stinging editorial, criticising Mr Beregovoy for accepting it.</p>

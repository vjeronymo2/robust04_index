			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kermans retain hold on Bristol Scotts Attempts to loosen the Kerman family's grip on Bristol Scotts, the property and leisure group, were unsuccessful at its annual meeting yesterday. Three of the seven directors are family members, but Mr Anthony Kerman, whose re-election as chairman was not opposed, disputed claims by two shareholders that there were too many Kermans on the board. Bristol Scotts has had what its chairman acknowledged was 'a miserable time' in recent years, although it was now in a much better position. It made heavy losses on Scotts restaurants, acquired four years ago, suffered from the property recession, and in February there was a fire at its Bristol greyhound stadium. . There is also a dispute over ownership of a share stake. The group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 246,073 in 1993, reduced from the previous year's Pounds 2.58m. It has now closed its restaurants division, which lost Pounds 637,890 last year. 'We've got rid of all our lossmaking businesses, reduced debt and hope to look forward to better times ahead,' Mr Kerman said. Mr Colin Forsyth, a shareholder, said Scotts had been acquired despite opposition and, now it had closed, it would be better 'if certain Kerman members were to retire.' Mr Nicholas Kerman is deputy chairman and Mr Isidore Kerman, who is in his late 80s, a non-executive director. The chairman himself was not a board member at the time of the Scotts acquisition. The family owns about a third of the shares. Sir Ian Rankin, who became a non-executive director in December, described it as 'a private company to all intents and purposes' and said he wanted the shareholdings expanded. 'The company has got to change from its minute size to something substantial.' It was agreed to change the company's name to BS Group.</p>

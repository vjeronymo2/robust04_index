Mr Martin Redrado had vowed he would not resign, insisting he was legally entitled to tenure until 1996 to insulate him from political interference. Mr Redrado's dismissal was precipitated by his criticism of proposals by Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston of the US to handle the sale of Dollars 720m-worth (Pounds 493m) of stock in the privatised oil company YPF held by Argentine pensioners. He had attacked the commission rates for the sale.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, declared that  the Palestinian and Israeli sides have reached agreement on the  size of the Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho area during the round of negotiations that ended in  Cairo today.    Speaking at a news conference today at the conclusion of the  negotiations, Sha'th said that the police force agreed upon will  comprise 9,000 personnel; 2,000 from inside [the occupied  territories] and 7,000 from outside.    He added that the agreement stipulates that 6,000  Palestinian  policemen will enter immediately after the signing of the  executive agreement of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement and then  another 1,000 will enter within three months of the signing of  the agreement. [passage indistinct]    Sha'th went on to say: As to the weapons of the 9,000  Palestinian policemen, they will be modern automatic rifles for  policemen, and officers will also be issued pistols. He said  that the Palestinian police will be supplied with a number of  machine guns and some armored personnel carriers.    Regarding the issues on which no agreement has been reached  so far, Sha'th said that these are: roads; the crossing points  between Gaza, Jericho and Israel; joint patrols; the security  measures on the roads; how to deal with any military operation;  wrapping up the water issue. He added that these issues will be  referred to the round that will be held in Cairo on 17 April.    On what Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, said  in  his news conference today, that Palestinian detainees who are  members of Hamas will not be released, Sha'th said that the  Palestinian side in the negotiations represents all the  Palestinian people and it is its responsibility to negotiate to  release all the detainees and not only the Fatah ones.    He added: I know that there is some sensitivity on the  Israeli side, especially after the recent 'Afula incident in  northern Israel. However, agreement was reached today to  release 5,000 detainees and negotiations will be conducted to  release the others. He stressed that the negotiations are being  held in the name of the entire Palestinian people.    He went on to say: We are not negotiating for some detainees  and not others. The peace we want to conclude is a peace between  the entire Palestinian people and the entire Israeli people and  not a peace between a Palestinian organization and an Israeli  one. He said: We must shoulder the responsibility for an  agreement on a general amnesty that will lead to the release of  all the detainees.    Sha'th underlined the Palestinian side's determination to  continue the negotiations to release all the detainees so that a  real peace can be achieved, one which halts the conflict that  has lasted for a long time and of which the detainees constitute  a part.</p>

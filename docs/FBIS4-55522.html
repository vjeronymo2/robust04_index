			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nedim Gendzhev, former chief mufti of </F> Bulgaria, by Diana Petrova; place and date not given: "Dogan  Works Against Bulgarian State, Lyutfi Is Indebted to Moon"]    [Text] [Petrova] Dr. Gendzhev, the Bulgarian Turks  invested much hopes in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms  [DPS], which promised to protect their interests. Now the DPS  is in the parliament, there is a cabinet formed with the DPS  mandate, but its constituency is the poorest in the country.  What are the reasons for the DPS' failure?    [Gendzhev] I am well-informed and I know that the DPS was  formed by the former Bulgarian Communist Party and State  Security. The establishment of the DPS pursued two goals: The  first was to prevent the Muslims from voting for the Union of  Democratic Forces [SDS]. If they would have voted for the SDS,  it would have won the first elections.    The second goal was to prevent the restoral of the rights of  the Turks and Muslims in Bulgaria. They succeeded also in this  sphere. What rights that existed before 1984 were restored?  Before 1984 there were three Turkish theaters in Bulgaria. Now  there are none. The Bulgarian radio had three two-hour programs  in Turkish; now there are only 15-minute programs. The DPS  promised a two-hour television program. Instead the wives of  Yunal Lyutfi, Vedal Sakalu, and others paraded around in Turkey  for six months.    Up to 1959 there were 1,390 Turkish schools. Now we do not  even have the right to four hours of compulsory Turkish language  studies, and I do not mean special schools.    They also lied to the people about the tobacco issue. They  tamed the strike and pocketed the commissions from Bulgartabak.  Let Dogan tell me now who will vote for him in Krumovgrad or  Kurdzhali region. I will curse them if they cast a single vote  for Dogan.    They did not accomplish even five things in five years. In  my village, Glodzhevo, 600 people get their bread on credit --  the owner of the bakery shop writes their names in his ledger.  Unemployment among Bulgarian Muslims is 80 percent. The Law on  the Land does not help us at all. People from Kurdzhali live in  the village of Listets, Silistra region. They moved there after  the local Turks emigrated to Turkey. In August 1944 the land  was purchased by five or six wealthy landlords, and in September  a collective labor farm was formed. The owners never saw their  land. However, instead of returning the land now to those who  worked it all those years, they return it to the same landlords.  The people do not even have money to lease the land. A  businessman from Petrich cultivates it. This is the merit of  the DPS.    The people understood that Dogan does not serve the  Bulgarian  state. He serves foreign interests. I know very well that he  was recruited in Paris.    [Petrova] In the chief mufti affair the DPS opposed you.  Was the only reason your personal feud with Dogan?    [Gendzhev] Destroying the structure of the Muslim religion  in Bulgaria was another goal the DPS successfully achieved. The  DPS also participated actively in destroying the Bulgarian  Eastern Orthodox Church. Yunal Lyutfi visited the United States  as Moon's personal guest! It became clear who was interested in  destroying the two religions. The Eastern Orthodox Church will  never again be united in Bulgaria. Even if Patriarchs Maksim  and Pimen retire to monasteries, Galaktion and Neofit will not  work together, while the priests and the people already are  divided. There will never again be a united church. I will  take Metodi Spasov [former director of the Department of  Religions] to court and claim compensation for the moral and  material damage that was inflicted on me. I will demand 500,000  leva as compensation for the damage done by dismissing me. The  Supreme Court already stated that I was illegally dismissed from  the chief mufti post, and now I will demand to restore me to  this post.    [Petrova] Now Mehmed Hodzha wants to form a new DPS. Do  you think he has a chance?    [Gendzhev] No! At present he has absolutely no chance at  all. To form a new DPS within the SDS is childish. The people  get smarter. Why is it that no political party is interested in  new elections? I am sure that this parliament will function  until October 1995, when the regular parliamentary elections  will take place. Let those who deceived the people worry!  Mehmed Hodzha could organize a small group of supporters, if  the SDS contributes a penny or two, so that he could organize  branches. However, this is not what the people want. They want  to know, for example, how did Mehmed Hodzha manage to acquire a  tailor shop in the village of Kaspichan and employ 40 women  there. The people want to know who did what. This also applies  to all other parties. Now it appears that the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] and the SDS each have the support of 20  percent of the voters. Well, those are the BSP pensioners and  those who benefited from the restitution initiated by the SDS.  And what about the other 60 percent? They have not decided  yet. For my part, I do not see a real force that could attract  those voters. Look, the Social Democratic Party shrunk. [Party  leader Petur] Dertliev got involved in various polemics and  personal quarrels, and weakened his party. Aleksandur Tomov  from the Civic Alliance for the Republic also is a losing card.  The same applies to Ludzhev's New Policy Center. Those are  formations without supporters.    [Petrova] Did you register your party, and will you  participate in the future elections?    [Gendzhev] Yes, the Democratic Party of Justice registered.  Of course we will participate in the elections. We already are  preparing -- we seek cadres and ascertain our possibilities. We  are also preparing our program and are not making too much  noise. It is too soon for this. We will probably participate  in a coalition with other parties. For the time being I see  only the Aleksandur Stamboliyski Bulgarian Agrarian National  Union [BZNS] as a possible partner. This is the real BZNS which  has structures. All the rest are hot air. I also rely very  much on the intelligentsia, which now shuns politics. This is a  potential force without leadership claims. It is a high time  for an intelligent party to emerge. Such a party will not serve  nationalism, but will protect Bulgaria's national interests  instead.    [Petrova] It is well-known that you established a foundation  which supports the religious life of Muslims in Bulgaria. How  many mosques are under construction at present in Bulgaria?    [Gendzhev] I contributed $15,000 to the construction of the  mosque in Madan. We contributed to rebuilding the burned-down  mosque in Khaskovo, and to building mosques in Rudozem and  Chepintsi. We are also building mosques in the Deliorman region  -- I mean in the villages of Listets and Vulkan, and there are  other construction projects.    I think that the most important factor is that even after  the  difficult period of 1985-86 we succeeded to preserve the respect  between Muslims and Christians, as well as goodneighborly  relations between Bulgarians and Turks. The attempts of certain  persons to set the people against each other represent a crime.  It is not serious to talk about some Islamic arcs and  Panslavonic axes that cross Bulgaria. After all, the Bosnia  Muslims also are Slavs! Our state must protect the tranquility  in the country and prevent all attempts of inciting ethnic and  religious feuds!</p>

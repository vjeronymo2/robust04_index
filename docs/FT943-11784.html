			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lex Service blames exceptionals for drop Lex Service, Britain's largest car distribution and leasing group, yesterday announced a 64 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits. The result was distorted, however, by large exceptional gains items a year earlier and failed to reflect higher vehicle sales. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 81.6m to Pounds 29.7m under FRS 3, although trading profits in the six months to June 26 rose from Pounds 25.1m to Pounds 28.2m on increased group turnover of Pounds 696.8m (Pounds 484m). The company said the fall in pre-tax profits reflected a lower gain in the latest half-year from the sale of shares in Arrow Electronics, which it received in September 1991 as part payment for its North American electronic components distribution businesses. Shares sold in January generated profits of Pounds 7.7m, compared with Pounds 60.1m from sales a year earlier. Operating profits, which exclude contributions from associated undertakings, increased to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 6.4m). Although Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said the underlying performance was encouraging, the shares fell 30p to 447p after he warned that retail demand had weakened in the second quarter and the group had lost Pounds 800,000 on its Hyundai Car imports business. 'We should have done a bit better in the retail group and not lost money on Hyundai,' he said. 'Our margins were hit by slowing demand and the drive by manufacturers for increased volume.' He blamed the second-quarter downturn on reticence among fleet purchasers and private customers ahead of the August new car registration, which last year accounted for 24.8 per cent of annual sales. The deficit at Hyundai was caused by high marketing and promotion costs. Nevertheless, trading profits in the group's core car and truck retailing division rose from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 12.1m; while profits on its associated vehicle contract hire business increased 70 per cent to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 7.1m). Sir Trevor said the downward trend in trading margins on cars had been partly offset by improved truck sales, while the fork lift truck and servicing businesses were making 'good progress'. Pre-exceptional earnings per share came out at 15.5p (12.5p), although they fell from 74.8p to 20.8p under FRS 3. An interim dividend of 5.6p (4.7p) is declared, but the group warned there was unlikely to be a similar increase at the year end. COMMENT At the pre-tax level, Lex appears to have been involved in a serious pile-up. But the distorting effect of exceptionals disguises generally favourable market conditions. Demand may have slowed but the trend remains firmly upward, and the group should benefit significantly from the August car rush. However, Sir Trevor's caution persuaded analysts to leave full-year pre-tax profit forecasts unchanged at about Pounds 55m. With plenty of room for Lex to increase its sales volumes, the shares - on a forward multiple of 11.7 - remain under-valued.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRETT'S PERFECT DAY LIFTS ROYALS PAST ANGELS, 4-3;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HE GOES FOUR FOR FOUR, HITS WINNING HOME RUN AND INCREASES HIS  AVERAGE TO A LEAGUE-LEADING .332.  </P> <P> George Brett, who is trying to become the first player to win batting titles in  three decades, says he is as surprised by his chances as anyone.  </P> <P> "Starting the season I had no intention of winning the batting championship,  but I thought we'd be in contention," Brett said. "It turns out we aren't in  contention, and I may win the batting championship."  </P> <P> Brett went four for four as the Kansas City Royals beat the Angels, 4-3,  Saturday. The decisive hit was Brett's tiebreaking home run in the seventh  inning.  </P> <P> "He'll do it. He's going to win the thing," Royal Manager John Wathan said.  "There's no doubt about it."  </P> <P> Brett, 37, won batting titles in 1976 and 1980. He increased his average to  .332, 9 points ahead of the Texas Rangers' Rafael Palmeiro and 10 points ahead  of the Oakland Athletics' Rickey Henderson.  </P> <P> Brett said he feels vastly different than in 1980, when he was trying to finish  with a .400 average and ended up at .390.  </P> <P> "I'm not putting any pressure on myself," he said. "I don't feel like I have to  do well. Maybe that's why I got four hits."  </P> <P> Angel Manager Doug Rader doesn't normally talk about players on other teams.  </P> <P> "But in George's case I'll make an exception," Rader said. "There's more to him  than just as a player. The way he projects himself, the way he handles himself  on the field. The way he competes. He's something special. I admire him very  much."  </P> <P> Brett's home run against Jim Abbott (10-14) was his sixth consecutive hit. It  also was the 280th home run of his career.  </P> <P> Mark Davis (2-7) pitched 1 1/3 innings of perfect relief for his first victory  since May 14.  </P> <P> The Angels took a 2-0 lead in the first against Hector Wagner on singles by  Luis Polonia and Johnny Ray, second baseman Frank White's error, Dave  Winfield's run-scoring single and a double-play grounder by Lee Stevens.  </P> <P> Brett's single in the first inning scored Kevin Seitzer, but Winfield's 20th  home run made the score 3-1 in the third.  </P> <P> The Royals' Gary Thurman scored when third baseman Donnie Hill committed an  error on Bo Jackson's grounder in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> Kansas City tied the score in the sixth when Mike Macfarlane scored on Brian  McRae's single.  </P></p>

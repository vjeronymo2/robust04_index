			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ  </P> <P> "Gabo Talks" quotes Garcia Marquez as saying: "Rome labored in a gloom for 20  centuries, until an Etruscan king anchored it in history." Rome was founded in  756 BC; about a century later, Lucius Tarquinius, a Roman citizen of  Graeco-Etruscan origin, was elected; his last descendant, Tarquinius Superbus,  was deposed in 508 BC, and Rome became a republic.  </P> <P> Rome assimilated peoples and cultures and drew from the knowledge and  technology of older Mediterranean civilizations to reach its greatness. The  United States did it by absorbing various cultures and catalyzing them into a  new and stronger one.  </P> <P> This is what Latin America has been unable to do. It has failed to build onto  its great indigenous civilizations and the cultures of its conquerors. Five  centuries after the European conquest, Latin America is still Third World. How  long does it take to recover from a brutal invasion? Through his character  Marquez whines, "Let us have our Middle Ages in peace." Despite devastating,  recurring bouts of Black Death, the European Middle Ages was a period teeming  with vitality: Men built soaring cathedrals and great walled cities, stimulated  commerce, developed industrial innovations and above all produced great  leaders. If this is indeed Latin America's Middle Ages, it is one of  corruption, bankruptcy and social injustice.  </P> <P> Marquez latest book shatters the myth of Simon Bolivar. But despite his newly  discovered flatulence and pedophilia, Bolivar was a man of vision and action.  Where are Latin America's great leaders of today? Castro?  </P> <P> Men and nations cannot hope to improve their lot until they recognize their own  shortcomings. Latin America will never achieve its potentials as long as it  continues to blame the United States for all its ills.  </P> <P> LIDA BATES  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

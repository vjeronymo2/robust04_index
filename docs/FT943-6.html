			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (65): Hitches in reform policy - South Korea: a study in contrasts The South Korean economy is a study in contrasts as the East Asian nation prepares to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1996. The economy has returned to robust health after two years of the slowest growth in more than a decade. A boom in exports, aided by a weak Korean currency, has sparked a large expansion of industrial facilities. GNP is expected to rise by 8.3 per cent in 1994. But there are growing worries in Seoul that the economic upsurge may only prove to be temporary since it is largely based on the strong Japanese yen undercutting the competitiveness of Korea's chief industrial rival in Asia. There are doubts whether Korea can perform as well once the yen weakens. A warning about the future of the Korean economy was recently given by a joint report from the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum, which concluded that Korea has slipped from third to seventh place among developing nations in global competitiveness since 1991. The independent study gave Korea poor marks for trade protectionism, the internationalisation of its financial system, and strong government interference in the economy. Korea has already outlined an ambitious programme of economic deregulation and financial liberalisation to solve these ills and help gain support for its OECD membership bid. But the reform policy already appears to be running into trouble in its initial stages, although the bulk of the changes are not due to be implemented until 1996 or later. There are several reasons for the problems that the reforms are encountering. There is bureaucratic opposition among the economic ministries, which fear a loss of power as a result of the changes. The government worries that the rapid introduction of reforms would remove restraints on the expansion of the big conglomerates, or chaebol, which would increase their economic dominance at the expense of small and medium businesses. Officials, for example, are opposing the entry of Samsung and Hyundai into the car and steel industries, respectively, in spite of promises to deregulate the economy from state control. A programme to privatise 47 state-owned companies has also become bogged down because of government concerns that it will offer an opportunity for the chaebol to expand their industrial empires. The public is also sceptical about the benefits promised by a fall in trade barriers and increased foreign investment. Memories of harsh Japanese colonial rule until 1945 are still strong and the public perception is that foreign investment represents a new threat of economic exploitation by outside interests. Finally, there are worries about the disruptive effects that the reforms would impose on the economy. The free flow of capital into Korea, for example, could increase inflationary pressure. The internationalisation of the Korean won might cause it to appreciate, which would harm exports. Financial liberalisation is being held back by the poor state of the nation's banks, which have sizeable bad debts on their books because of previous government directives that forced them to lend to favoured industries with little regard for their creditworthiness. An overhaul of the banking industry is necessary before the financial reforms can proceed. The chaebol have also built huge debt-equity ratios that could expose them to financial problems if reforms are quickly introduced. It is not surprising then that the government has adopted a cautious approach on the reforms. But critics claim that the slow pace of implementation could rob the reform programme of whatever momentum it had when the government of President Kim Young-sam announced the changes a year ago. Although the proposed reform schedule is rapid by the historical standards of Korea, it still appears leisurely compared to the market opening efforts of other countries in Asia, including China. The financial liberalisation measures to be introduced within the next year are minimal. The government, for example, has promised to raise the ceiling on foreign ownership of stock from 10 per cent to 15 per cent by next June. But there are doubts among foreign securities houses in Seoul whether this target will be met because of government worries that an increase in the ceiling could cause share prices to climb. The ministry of finance is already intervening to keep the bourse from overheating as part of its anti-inflation effort. Although the bond market has recently been opened to foreigner investors, they are limited to buying convertible bonds of small and medium-sized companies and long-term state and public bonds. The raising of overseas funds by Korean companies is only being gradually eased because of fears that an excess amount of capital will flow into the country and increase inflation. This approach is being taken in spite of arguments that increased overseas borrowing would improve the country's competitiveness because it would allow industry to take advantage of lower interest rates abroad. Cheaper overseas capital would improve the ability of companies to make necessary investments to counter a rise in wages. Foreign investment restrictions are only being dropped in selected areas. Foreign participation in infrastructure projects is being encouraged because of the need to remove transport bottlenecks that are hampering economic growth. Reduced restrictions on foreign investment have been limited so far to high-tech companies. 'Welcome as these measures are, they still reflect a desire on the part of government to micro-manage the economy by targeting specific industries and keeping the playing field uneven,' said Merrill Lynch, the US securities firm, in a recent commentary on the Korean economy. The climate for reforms could worsen in the coming months. The national assembly is expected this autumn to debate approval of the Uruguay Round of Gatt measures, which has already provoked a storm of protest in Korea because it would force the opening of the rice market.</p>

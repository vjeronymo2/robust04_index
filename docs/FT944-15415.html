			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Paribas buys rest of Luxembourg units' shares Paribas, one of France's leading banks, yesterday announced the purchase of all outstanding shares in two Luxembourg financial companies in which it had long held strategic stakes. The purchase came in an agreement signed with Groupe General Mediterranean Holding-Compagnie Internationale de Participations Bancaires et Financieres (GMH-CIPAF), the holder of the remaining shares. The bank bought the remaining 20 per cent of shares in Banque Paribas Luxembourg, which was created in 1964 and separated from Paribas at the time of its nationalisation by the French government in 1982. It also bought the remaining 50 per cent of outstanding shares in Banque Continentale du Luxembourg, which had developed links with Paribas and GMH-CIPAF since 1982. Both sides declined to reveal the price. Banque Continentale du Luxembourg last year reported net assets of FFr473m and net profits of FFr50m (Dollars 9.45m), while Banque Paribas Luxembourg had assets of FFr880m and profits of FFr150m in 1993.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / CBI proposes single framework for exams A UNIVERSAL system of credits enabling 16 to 19-year-olds to buy any course of vocational or academic training, and to help bridge the continuing gulf between the two, was proposed yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI also suggested a single framework of examinations and qualifications stretching from vocational NVQs to academic A levels in England and Wales, and a system of awards mixing the academic and vocational called 'careership certificates'. Sir Bryan Nicholson, head of the CBI's education and training affairs committee, who presented a report yesterday, said: 'The government has been half-hearted in its approach to 16 to 19-year-old education and training. We need bold moves to put a cohesive system in place.' The CBI document said the report of the 1992 World Economic Forum ranked the UK 20th out of 22 countries, just above Italy and Greece, for the quality of its people's skills. 'Although government initiatives are producing results, the UK still compares unfavourably with its competitors.' The report calls for the extension of the training credit system to sixth forms and further education colleges, integration of qualifications, a 'careership profile' for all 16 to 19-year-olds and additional investment in careers guidance for all 14 to 19-year-olds. The CBI says the UK and Greece are the only two European Community countries where some careers teachers in schools receive no training. The CBI says its plans for 16 to 19-year-olds would be broadly neutral in public expenditure terms and cost employers only a little more. The aim is to eliminate any employment for those under 18 not involving structured education and training, but it insists this must be done voluntarily. Routes for Success.

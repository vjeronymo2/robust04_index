			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Warning over rail cuts CUTS IN rural rail services are resulting from reductions in government grants to British Rail, the head of the official rail passengers' body warned yesterday, Andrew Adonis writes. The government grant to run services on loss-making lines has been cut from Pounds 1bn in 1983 to Pounds 500m this year. It is projected to fall to Pounds 345m by 1993. 'There have been savage cuts on some services,' said Major-General Lennox Napier, chairman of the Central Transport Consultative Committee. Lines affected include Cambridge-Bury St Edmunds, Middlesbrough-Whitby, Leeds-Lancaster, York-Pontefract-Sheffield and Barrow-Whitehaven. Tube strike vote, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special report: "Request for Mediation"] </F>   [Text] Following the bloody clashes among the Iraqi Kurds,  which started a month ago in northern Iraq and which has led to  hundreds of deaths and wounded, recently Mas'ud Barzani, leader  of the Kurdish Democratic Party; Jalal Talabani, leader of the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan; and Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz,  leader of the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan--the heads of  the conflicting groups in northern Iraq--have requested  officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran to mediate in ending  the bloodshed among them. This comes at a time when the Western  forces deployed in northern Iraq are pretending that they have  exerted great efforts to end the bloodshed! However, the Iraqi  Kurds have documented proof in hand that shows that not only  have the Western forces not taken any effective steps to this  end, but they have been the major fomenter of these conflicts,  hence their call for their leaders to ask the officials of the  Islamic Republic of Iran to mediate in ending the bloodshed.</p>

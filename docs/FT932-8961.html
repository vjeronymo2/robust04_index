			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: Betrayal in Piccadilly and Rome - Two flawed novels and one satisfying one SUGAR CANE by Paul Bailey Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 228 pages CAESAR by Allan Massie Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 228 pages AMONG THE DEAD by Michael Tolkin Faber Pounds 14.99, 229 pages PAUL BAILEY reaches for big themes of loneliness, fragility and disguise in his seventh novel, but in spite of his clear, pared-down writing, the result is a disappointment. Sugar Cane's central figure Stephen, a mixed-race runaway from Halifax, teases the story along by posing riddles about his life. The narrator, Esther Potocki, a doctor of venereal disease, rightly guesses that he is a prostitute. But it is left to her lover Gabriel to deduce that Stephen's mysterious 'Bish' is the notorious, self-styled 'Bishop of Wandle', jailed years before the book opens for running a ring of rent boys from a Wandsworth warehouse. Bailey is good on dialogue - particularly that of Esther's edgy patients - and on interweaving Esther's memories of her parents with Stephen's revelations. But although one of his themes is the claustrophobic ties between children and parents, he gives improbable accounts of how his characters try to break them. We are to believe that Esther chose venereology to rebel against her mother's wish that she become a ballerina; and that Gabriel can get an erection only by putting on his mother's polka-dot dress and then shedding her memory as he takes it off. The result of this constricted psychology is to turn the characters into grotesques. But the greater weakness of the book is that the prolonged suspense is not warranted by the eventual revelations. Gabriel explains to Esther that Stephen 'needs to bewilder you. He has to make himself as opaque as he possibly can, in order to keep you interested in him. He's scared of your finding him ordinary'. The book takes the same risk, and fails. Stephen's account of how he was lured into the Bishop's 'palace' is hardly the 'descent into hell' that Esther claims. He expresses no despair and little revulsion - or excitement - even at the regular duty of masturbating the 'Bishop'. Soon after introduction to the punters of Piccadilly Circus, he concludes 'the funny thing is that after a time the hundreds would all merge into one'. And his tale - which makes up the second half of the book - is delivered as a tape recording to Esther and Gabriel because 'I could never tell you this to your face'. Bailey thus spares himself an exploration of their disgust or pity, and, because the Bishop is already jailed, of their responsibility to act. The ducking of a confrontation between Stephen and Esther leads to a moral blankness at the heart of the novel, nor does Bailey manage to show why the reader should share his fascination with Stephen's descent. The narrator of Allan Massie's Caesar has more substance. This version of the plot to kill Julius Caesar is told through the eyes of Decimus Brutus, the protege whom Caesar most trusted and who became one of his assassins. Given the difficulty of bringing historical figures to life, it is unexpectedly rich and detailed, particularly on Caesar's manipulation of loyalty. It carries echoes of Margaret Thatcher's blindness to opposition and of her eventual fall: 'I have heard Caesar deny the very existence of society', says the narrator. But the pace often slows to that of a politician's memoirs, and some sentences take schoolroom concentration to comprehend: 'So nothing was done on his (Ptolemy's) behalf, until, as a result of the famous meeting between Pompey, Caesar and the millionaire booby Marcus Crassus at Lucca, the three of them formed what Cicero (in private) described as a 'criminal conspiracy to share sovereignty and dominate the Republic'.' Readers who dare skim over those passages will be left scrabbling for the six-page chronology and list of characters at the front. In contrast, Michael Tolkin's highly amusing second novel is an effortless read. Like his first, The Player, it will no doubt translate easily into a satirical film of West Coast life. Frank Gale, a 'loser' by Los Angeles standards, has been unfaithful to his wife. But he is convinced that with the right words, and a trip to Mexico, he can repair his marriage. His self delusion is laid bare in the opening pages as he designs what he believes will be a more honest life. When the aeroplane he has missed crashes, however, killing his wife and child, the inexorable exposure of his fantasies becomes a nightmare. In the end, the only one who has the right words is the author, who manipulates the characters' fates with the comic deftness - and cruelty - that he showed in his first book. Satisfyingly, with immense speed, retribution arrives.</p>

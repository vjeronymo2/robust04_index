			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence favouring car supermarkets Sir, In your editorial on the European Commission's decision on the block exemption for the car dealer system ('Brussels' foot on the brake', October 6), you appear to assume the present system is more expensive and offers less choice and convenience to consumers than possible alternatives, notably some form of car supermarket. The evidence does not support these assumptions. A typical UK car dealer retains less gross profit margin before his expenses than the large grocers make as net profits: the total asset turns of the two industries are broadly similar. As margins are driven down by the fierce competition between dealers and manufacturers, selling new cars is close to being intrinsically unprofitable; there is very little scope for reducing prices on the back of lower costs. Research in both conventional retailing and the dealer industry indicates that increased outlets would not significantly reduce operating costs. Grocery superstore profit benefits flow more from market power and logistics (that do not apply to the car market) than outlet operating economics. Car supermarkets would use their local market power to raise margins and prices to the detriment of the consumer. There is no reason to believe that car manufacturers could lower costs as a result of increased retail concentration. European manufacturers already face the problem of overcapacity of 4m vehicles, a far more worrying problem. Would consumers really want car supermarkets? There would be fewer of them, presumably much further apart, so the average distance travelled to buy would increase and the car would have to be serviced by a different company. As for the benefits of several makes in one showroom, research shows that, because the single-franchise outlets are more experienced with the product, they are preferred by many consumers. Many decide what to buy long before they reach a dealership, their decision being based on magazine reviews, their own and friends' experience etc. Fewer dealers would mean less intra-network competition, again giving the seller more opportunity to raise prices. Product choice would also be reduced. In a competitive market, car supermarkets would have to adjust their selling effort to respond to the relative success of different car models. As cars are physically large and as there are more than 500 car models sold in the UK, the supermarkets would make frequent choices of which selection of cars to support. This would raise the volatility of demand at product-line level, raising risk in the industry, forcing the manufacturers to ask for higher margins and putting pressure on them to cut marginally profitable niche products. Those who draw analogies between different industries - as BEUC, the European consumers' organisation, and others seem to be doing - should beware being over simplistic.

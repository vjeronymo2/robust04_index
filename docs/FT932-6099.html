			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Love, guilt and adventure - Books PILLION RIDERS by Elisabeth Russell Taylor Peter Owen Pounds 14.95, 165 pages SECOND SPRING by Max Egremont Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 275 pages A RIVER SUTRA by Gita Mehta Heinemann Pounds 9.99, 277 pages A MIRROR FOR LARKS by Victor Sage Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 9.99, 439 pages SHORT sentences in a very short narrative, a buried world under the one we are shown: Elisabeth Russell Taylor's Pillion Riders is a small masterpiece of reticence. The story of an 'absolute' love, where no cost is counted, it becomes a tale of disillusion because the beloved is not worth the feeling he arouses: physical joy is all and it proves to be not enough. Petulant and bored, a poor little rich girl married to a much older husband, Opal is ready to be swept off her feet when Jean-Claude, a young composer, turns up. On first meeting, in post-war Paris, without a language in common, they flee to a freezing attic with a single cold tap and a hole in the floor, shared with a house full of other tenants. For some years, passion warms them, though both are unfaithful. Selfish disagreeable though Jean-Claude is, one can believe how Opal is dazzled. But the vicious attitudes of his peasant family come through, including anti-Semitism fuelled by guilt at having betrayed Jews during the war. Opal, though she still passionately desires him, is unable to stand more, and leaves. In this chilling tale of the failure of romantic love, the writing is precise, tight-knit, beautifully paced, and never in any spurious sense romantic. Max Egremont's Second Spring is more leisurely in style, set in the present with its roots in a not-so-distant past. Alex von Kierich's right hand, with its crushed fingers, declares something; as a conspirator in the plot to kill Hitler, he was tortured. Was he the hero he seems, though? Is his aide, the English Edward West, right to idolise him? Rumours force him to resign as head of an aid agency, and he retires to the quietest life he can find. Edward has also retired: to an English village, to gardening, local politics and attraction to the daughter of nearby friends. Even after a meeting with his old chief in Germany, things remain ambiguous. Edward finds no way of judging Alex. Nor do we. 'We were all under fire then,' Alex says. Guilt and betrayal are not as straightforward as they are in the ugly post-war France of Pillion Riders. As in Edward's village politics, carefully observed, resentments, hatreds, even snobberies play a part. Who can judge? This novel is full of vignettes from varied lives, of social observation and the memory of unthinkable evil; of contrasts the mind can hardly accept, and possibilities no-one dares face. Written with grace and humanity, times and places are interwoven with panache. Sutra means a thread or string, and is also a term for literary forms. On the thread of the river Narmada, a holy site of pilgrimage, a number of Indian stories in Gita Mehta's A River Sutra are told to the manager of a rest house, a vanaprasthi or forest dweller, one who has withdrawn from the world. The job gives him time for reflection and the story suggests the variety of those he meets or hears about on the edge of river and jungle. They are sad, violent, paradoxical and touching, always infused with religious feeling; they involve people of all social levels and all religious groups, except Christian. These fleeting encounters, with their stories of change and development, of new identities and often terrible sadness, are valuable to an outsider as peepholes into Indian life and attitudes. They give a sense of landscape, conjuring sounds, colours, textures, light, the monsoon, the river in every mood and season, in a direct, dramatic way, without explanation or apology. To read them is to be steeped in Indian life, to experience at least something of its culture, although much of the mystery remains for an outsider. High finance, bloodstock and betting, which often go together, are mysterious to outsiders and have a glamour all their own. Victor Sage's first novel, A Mirror for Larks, is about all three, and the Italian phrase which the title translates means bait, lure, false inducement. It is also something almost unheard of today, a love story more or less without sex. The narrator, Raymond Bosanquet, owns racehorses, loves betting, and plans to set up a stud farm, all of which takes money, plenty of it. So when he is introduced to a scheme for shifting millions to and from third world governments, with a rake-off for himself on the way, he is not surprisingly agog. From Florence to Monte Carlo to Paris, he and his cronies chase the elusive but, for a while, not implausible millions and the whole thing bowls along at a tremendous pace. Till the end, when realism takes over and the tone changes. The face of someone who has just jumped from a sixth floor window and is lying still warm in the morgue can hardly be described in anything but horrifying terms. The narrative is stretched, but most of the way it is irrepressibly good company, with a sense of knockabout adventure that allows one to do what real life so often forbids - to dream the impossible, never counting the pennies or, in a wider sense, the moral cost.</p>

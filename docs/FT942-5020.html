			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Intellectual rights given precedence - European Court Where intellectual property rights conflict with the interests of free competition, intellectual property rights should take precedence, according to a preliminary opinion of the European Court of Justice. The interests of undistorted competition should prevail only where the exercise of a given intellectual property right was not necessary to fulfil the essential function of that right, according to the opinion of Advocate General Gulmann in the appeal in the Magill TV Guide cases. The cases concerned attempts by Magill to publish a comprehensive weekly television guide. Copyright in TV scheduling information belonged to the BBC, Independent Television Publications and the Irish broadcaster, Radio Telefis Eireann, all of which published guides of their own listings. The companies licensed daily and weekend comprehensive guides. Magill complained to the European Commission. The Commission found the three companies had abused their individual dominant positions by preventing the publication and sale of comprehensive weekly TV guides in Ireland and Northern Ireland. It ordered them to supply each other and third parties with their individual weekly listings - that is compulsory licensing. The companies appealed to the Court of First Instance, which found in the Commission's favour. They then appealed to the ECJ. Before dealing with the points raised by the parties, Advocate General Gulmann made some remarks on the special nature of copyright. He said by their nature copyright laws give copyright owners the right to restrict competition. He also noted that the copyright laws of the member states generally balance the interests of copyright owners and undistorted competition by restricting the exclusive rights of copyright owners in certain ways, such as giving others the right to make certain use of copyright material on payment of a royalty. He said that, although such a balancing of interests did not preclude further limitations on the copyright owners' exclusive rights on the basis of the EC Treaty's competition rules, it did mean that caution should be exercised. Six grounds of appeal were lodged in total by the parties and interveners. The only ground on which the advocate-general thought that the appellants should succeed related to the concept of abuse of a dominant position. The appellants claimed the CFI had misconstrued this concept and its judgments should thus be annulled. The CFI had upheld the Commission's finding that the refusal by the parties to grant licences constituted an abuse of a dominant position. The central issue was whether, and if so under what circumstances, a refusal to grant a copyright licence could constitute an abuse of a dominant position. It was agreed a refusal to grant licences in itself did not constitute an abuse. However, there would be occasions where such a refusal had been exercised under such special circumstances that it created an unacceptable obstacle to undistorted competition and that therefore the copyright owners' rights should be restricted by EC competition rules. But, the advocate general stressed that, given that compulsory licensing constituted a serious interference in copyright, there had to be substantial and weighty competition grounds if the right to refuse copyright licences were to be regarded as unnecessary to fulfil the essential function of the copyright. He considered some of the CFI's findings on this point were flawed and not sufficient to be considered special circumstances. For example, the CFI found the copyright owners' rights were capable of being restricted because their refusal to grant licences prevented the emergence on the market of a competing new product. However, the advocate general considered that such action could be taken only where a refusal to grant a licence prevented the emergence of a non-competing product. Where a competing product was restricted, the interests of the copyright owners should prevail over those of consumers.

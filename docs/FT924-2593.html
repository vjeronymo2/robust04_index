			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: AIB agrees deal on insurance liabilities ALLIED IRISH Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, has reached a settlement with the government on liabilities arising from its foray into the general insurance business in the early 1980s. Under the agreement AIB will contribute IPounds 8.8m (Pounds 9.4m) a year from 1993 for 20 years, which will be matched on a 50:50 basis by the government, to settle outstanding debts of the former Insurance Corporation of Ireland which went into receivership in 1985. AIB said the contribution will be equivalent to 0.8p per share 'and can be borne over the period without reducing the capital strength of AIB'. AIB had bought the Insurance Corporation in 1983 for IPounds 45m, as part of a strategy to diversify into the general insurance industry. AIB then found that the insurance company had 'significant underprovisioning', mainly in its reinsurance business written through London. AIB injected a further IPounds 40m into the company before finally allowing the government to take it over and pass it into receivership in 1985. Under the terms of the 1985 agreement, AIB was to advance IPounds 70m for repayment in the year 2000, and contribute IPounds 5.5m a year for 15 years to meet the insurance company's liabilities. Its domestic business was sold off in 1990 to a joint venture of AGF, the French insurance group, and Irish Life. Its remaining business still faced unmatched liabilities of some IPounds 270m in late-1991, so the government approached AIB for further funding. Mr Peter Sutherland, chairman of AIB, said yesterday 'The board considered the bank's participation, and the finality brought to the issues involved, to be in the best interests of its shareholders and staff, as well as meeting the concerns of customers and the community at large'. The 1985 agreement still stands under the new arrangement, but AIB was emphatic yesterday that it now has a solemn agreement with the government that no further contributions will be sought from AIB on the matter.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Narborough Plants higher at Pounds 162,000 Narborough Plantations, the Malaysian rubber and palm oil producer, reported pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 up from Pounds 153,000 to Pounds 162,000. Lower operating profits were offset by higher income from investments and an exchange gain rather than a loss. Turnover was Pounds 335,000 (Pounds 372,000). Earnings per share were 0.96p (0.74p). The proposed final dividend is unchanged at 1p gross for a maintained total of 1.5p gross.</p>

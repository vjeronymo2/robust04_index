			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFF-DUTY OFFICER KILLS MAN AT DISCO;  </P> <P> CRIME: FIGHT IN PARKING LOT PROMPTED SHOOTING, BUT SANTA ANA VICTIM'S BROTHER,  FRIEND DISPUTE POLICE VERSION.  </P> <P> An off-duty Los Angeles police officer working as a security guard at a night  club shot and killed a Santa Ana man early Friday during a parking lot brawl,  police said.  </P> <P> The 2 a.m. incident erupted when seven people began fighting outside the  Carnivale Club at the Orange Fair Mall. Gunshots were heard by two security  guards who were sitting in a car in the parking area on South Lemon Street, Los  Angeles Police Sgt. Elmer Pellegrino said. Both guards are LAPD officers.  </P> <P> Pellegrino said that Eric Parga, 22, was killed after he allegedly fired a  .22-caliber, semiautomatic pistol at a crowd of people who were fighting.  </P> <P> Officers Rancy Garcia, 34, and David Navarro, 32, jumped out of their car when  they saw Parga with the gun, Pellegrino said, and Garcia ordered Parga to drop  his weapon.  </P> <P> "Parga ignored his commands, pointed the weapon toward the group and fired  three rounds," Pellegrino said. Garcia then fired, hitting Parga.  </P> <P> Fullerton police offered a similar version of events. But Fullerton Sgt. Neal  Baldwin said the guards were coming out of the Carnivale Club when they saw  Parga and were not sitting in a car.  </P> <P> Parga died shortly after being taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital with a bullet  wound in the chest, a hospital official said.  </P> <P> Two witnesses to the shooting, Parga's brother, Brian Parga, 26, and a friend,  Raymond Arzola, 20, insisted that Parga was unarmed and that he was shot in the  back while running toward the car of a friend who had driven them to the disco.  They said they did not hear a warning before the shots were fired by the  off-duty officers.  </P> <P> "Someone yelled that the police were coming, so I pushed Eric to try to get him  away (from the fight)," Arzola said. "We were both running side by side, and I  thought that he tripped. Then I looked down, and my pants were covered with  blood."  </P> <P> Both Arzola and Brian Parga confirmed that they heard gunshots before the  off-duty officers arrived. They said, however, that the shots were not fired by  anyone in their group of five, nor did they appear to be fired by the two men  with whom they were fighting.  </P> <P> Baldwin said the people involved in the fight were interviewed by investigators  and released. The case is being investigated by Fullerton police, the district  attorney's officer-involved shooting team and the LAPD robbery-homicide  division.  </P> <P> Garcia and Navarro have been with the LAPD for 10 and four years, respectively,  Pellegrino said.  </P></p>

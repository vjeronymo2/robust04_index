			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sea Containers rises and plans expansion Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing group, reported net earnings up by 8 per cent from Dollars 39.8m to Dollars 42.9m (Pounds 29.3m) for the 1993 year. Revenue fell from Dollars 421m to Dollars 417m, principally because of the strengthening of the dollar against the pound. Earnings emerged at Dollars 2.66 (Dollars 2.35). The company also announced two share transactions. With a view to acquiring the 58 per cent of Orient-Express Hotels it does not already own, it is offering 0.17 Class A Sea Containers common shares for each Orient-Express common share. If, following the offer, it owns more the 90 per cent of Orient-Express, it intends to merge it with a Sea Containers subsidiary on the same exchange ratio basis as the offer. In addition, Sea Containers plans a public offering of 5m Class A common shares with the primary purpose of retiring the 2.3m 1982 series Dollars 2.10 cumulative preferred shares at their current redemption price of Dollars 15.56 apiece. The dividend rate on these shares is 14 per cent a year. The additional equity, in combination with bank borrowings, will help the company fund its container and ferry capital expansion programme, the company said.</p>

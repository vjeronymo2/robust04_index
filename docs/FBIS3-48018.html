			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>   [Text] The Japanese Government has been trying to cultivate  contacts with Robert E. Rubin, an assistant to President  Clinton. Mr. Rubin, who is in charge of the National Economic  Council (NEC), plays a key role in coordinating economic policy  as a confidant of President Clinton. The Japanese Government  appears to have concluded that to break the stalemate in  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, it is more effective to  make direct contacts with the assistant than with U.S. trade  officials who are anxious to score points at the talks. Despite  his flexible attitude toward setting numerical targets, Mr.  Rubin is making a tough demand that Japan make "efforts  commensurate with an economic power," and the Japanese  Government should not pin rosy hopes on him.    The Japanese Government has been exploring contacts with Mr.  Rubin through senior officials of major ministries who have  recently visited Washington because the Japan-U.S economic  framework talks remain stalled after government officials from  the two countries have failed to smooth over their confrontation  over the principle of setting numerical targets.    The confrontation between the U.S. Trade Representative and  the Japanese side is not likely to be addressed. At bilateral  negotiations on the insurance sector, the U.S. Trade  Representative, which has made the tough demand that Japan allow  foreigners to attend the Insurance Deliberation Council and  present the United States with a draft amendment to the  Insurance Business Law, continues to stick by his demand. As  for the improvement of institutions on the part of the United  States, the U.S. side has refused to discuss it, claiming, "This  is not subject to bilateral negotiations." On the other hand,  U.S. Government officials, especially U.S. Trade Representative  Kantor, have hinting at sanctions against Japan, which differs  from White House and the State Department statements that the  "United States will not link the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks to sanctions." The Japanese Government has good reason to  count on Mr. Rubin, who is known as a leading troubleshooter,  rather than listen to Mr. Kantor's proposal for cabinet-level  consultations.    Mr. Rubin earned a high reputation as a troubleshooter while  successfully keeping the confrontation between the White House  and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) over monetary policy from  spiraling out of control by using his economic sense fostered on  Wall Street and his personal ties.    It is a big mistake, however, to take his attitude as "soft  with Japan." At a NEC meeting, he said: "Our goal is to have  Japan fulfill it promises to rebuild Japan's economy into an  economy driven by domestic demand and cut its current account  surplus." He then instructed each government agency to work to  achieve that goal. He has spearheaded the U.S. demand that Japan  present the United States with measures to stimulate the economy  and open the market. It is highly possible that if Japan tries  to cultivate contacts with Mr. Rubin simply as a negotiating  tactic without making a decision on the measures, it will get a  strong punch from the U.S. Trade Representative.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Navigation Mixte may make bid for Ebro COMPAGNIE de Navigation Mixte, the diversified French holding group, yesterday confirmed its interest in buying Ebro Agricolas, the big Spanish sugar processor from the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO). 'We cannot but be interested in what happens to Ebro,' a Navigation Mixte spokesman said. Opportunities to buy an operation like Ebro, Spain's largest sugar processor, did not occur regularly in the sugar business in which the French holding company is already involved, he added. Mr Marc Fournier, Navigation Mixte's president, has said he is actively examining a possible purchase of Ebro, but has admitted difficulties about with whom to negotiate. These difficulties arise, the Navigation Mixte spokesman explained yesterday, partly because Ebro shares have been used to guarantee bank credits to Torras, the KIO's Spanish investment company, which has gone into receivership. Though it has minority stakes in some companies, 'we generally like to be the majority shareholder', said the Navigation Mixte spokesman. In Madrid, the government has warned that it would disapprove of the sale by the KIO of its 36 per cent holding in Ebro Agricolas, the domestic foods company, to another foreign group. Ebro controls an estimated 52 per cent of the Spanish sugar market. 'We want a Spanish interest to control Ebro,' a Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman said. 'A non-Spanish acquisition worries us very much.' The government's concern came amid reports that European conglomerates were preparing to take positions in Ebro following a decision by the KIO last month to award a mandate to Credit Suisse First Boston for the sale.</p>

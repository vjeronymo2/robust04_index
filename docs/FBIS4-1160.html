			<p>BFN     [Text] There was tension yesterday in the center of the  northern Province of Kayanza. Population at the center of the  province was in an unrest in the afternoon following a kind of  uprising by a group of young men following the execution of the  director of the Lycee [government secondary school] of Kayanza  by his own pupils in his own office. Last Thursday [21 April],  the pupils of the Lycee of Kayanza had demonstrated to demand  the resumption of classes which had been suspended following the  departure of a group of pupils from that school. Until now,  however, there hasn't been any response to this demand.</p>

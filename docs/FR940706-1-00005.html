Currently, Springdale, AR has Class D airspace during the hours of operation of the Springdale Air Traffic Control Tower. This action is proposing to provide controlled airspace, Class E, upward from the surface to contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations during the hours that the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace to contain IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed at Springdale, AR. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before August 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to Manager, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;42, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The official docket may be examined in the office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Southwest Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 662, Fort Worth, TX, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A that describes the application procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Springdale, AR. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower is closed to contain IFR operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace, during the hours that the control tower is closed, for IFR operations at Springdale Regional Airport, Springdale, Arkansas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 958 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

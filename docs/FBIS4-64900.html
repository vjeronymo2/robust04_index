			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD leader Rudolf Scharping by Elisabeth </F> Niejahr and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date not given: "I Still  Have My Head"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Eggs were thrown at the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] chairman at a May rally in  Hamburg. In Trier, Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian  Democratic Union) had to cut short his speech because of the  asylum policy and weapons exports to Turkey. There is general  indignation about the entire political mess. This is all  because of your flirting with the Union.    [Scharping] Seven thousand people in Hamburg, 200 from the  "Black Bloc," two dozen eggs, and then indignation toward the  entire political mess. Do you seriously consider the "Black  Bloc" to be a barometer of political development?    [DER SPIEGEL] That is how 1968 started. A grand coalition  was in power then.    [Scharping] There will be no grand coalition this time; you  know that. It is historically inaccurate to compare the reform  and student movement of the 1960's with the violence-prone  "autonomists" of today.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you not worried about being called "Helmut  Scharping" or "Kohl with a beard" all the time?    [Scharping] That is enough of the cliches. Shall we get to  the point?    [DER SPIEGEL] Many citizens say you and Kohl share a similar  understanding of politics -- both of you want power.    [Scharping] No political changes can be made without a  majority. But my understanding of politics is fundamentally  different from that of Dr. Kohl. Let me give you an example.  In over 200 public meetings over the space of several months,  the SPD discussed a government program and opened itself up to  nonmembers. No other party has done that.    [DER SPIEGEL] An internal paper for the Union faction  leadership says: "One should note that a lot of the starting  positions presented by the SPD could also be adopted by the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union [CDU/CSU]  without any alterations. The programmatic declarations about  the need to safeguard jobs, create new jobs, and combat  unemployment cannot be emphasized highly enough."    [Scharping] All that means is that the Union wants to adopt  the SPD's definitions. Anyone wishing to understand the CDU's  policies must view the results of those policies -- for  instance, the highest state debts and highest unemployment ever.    [DER SPIEGEL] Despite the fact that unemployment has hardly  fallen at all, how do you explain that surveys indicate that  your popularity and that of the chancellor are growing closer  together, and that the Union once again comes before the SPD in  terms of economic prerogatives?    [Scharping] I read quite different opinions last week, even  in DER SPIEGEL.    [DER SPIEGEL] Perhaps more and more voters are becoming  discouraged because you and the SPD lack a profile. Take a look  at employment policy.    [Scharping] In Germany this year, there are about 500,000  more unemployed people than there were last year. Foreign  demand is increasing. That means we are reaping the fruits of  better economic policies in other countries. On the other hand,  this government has drastically cut the amount of funds  available for an active labor market policy, resulting in  700,000 people losing their jobs. We must close the gap  concerning investments and innovation or else there will be no  new jobs.    [DER SPIEGEL] On the subject of social justice, your own  supporters do not see any originality. The magazine of IG  Metall wrote that the SPD and the CDU's concepts of taxation  policy are as effective as a fire extinguisher in a prairie fire.    [Scharping] No. We are going to make three decisions.  First of all, we will effectively help families with children  by means of a child benefit of 250 marks [DM] per month for  every child. Second, we will make the lowest wages free of tax.  Third, we will dispense with Kohl and Waigel's idea of a  7.5-percent surtax on every taxpayer and replace it with an  extra tax on incomes from DM120,000 upwards in the case of  married couples, and DM60,000 upwards in the case of single  people. That will relieve over 80 percent of the population,  release demand, and set the economy on its legs.    [DER SPIEGEL] How will you fill the DM40-50-billion tax  loophole that will arise when you make the lowest wage levels  free of tax?    [Scharping] If the problem is solved within the framework of  the taxation system, there will he no loophole. We will see  what the experts Waigel has appointed to deal with the tariff  reform suggest.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your central topic is the combating of  unemployment. Have you a chance of winning when the economic  upturn occurs?    [Scharping] Yes. The SPD's chances are increasing. Apart  from that, I would be happy just like every sensible person if  unemployment dropped. But before that can happen, the economic  situation in Germany must improve. Therefore, we do not want to  raise state expenditures above the levels planned in 1995, and  even reduce them in the medium term.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is the economic upturn not already visible?    [Scharping] Tyll Necker, chairman of the Association of  German Industry, says that what we have now is no upturn. It is  merely a "turn" without the "up." All the experts agree.    [DER SPIEGEL] According to surveys, more and more people  believe things will improve. Thus, more and more people no  longer belong to the SPD.    [Scharping] The SPD is in the lead, and a good thing, too.  The coalition has not had a majority for months.    [DER SPIEGEL] The SDP has once again eaten away at your  leading position with the debate on the speed limit.    [Scharping] I consider this debate premature. In any case,  the SPD also wants a speed limit on freeways. Just like in the  United States and Japan, we must treat environmental change as a  scientific challenge. All development must be environmentally  friendly.    [DER SPIEGEL] That is exactly what the automobile industry  is saying. After all, it is the SDP that said for decades that  a low speed limit is a gauge of environmental responsibility.    [Scharping] That is why the speed limit forms part of the  program.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have not included a 130-kmh speed limit in  the program. The SPD has hidden this figure behind the  resolutions of the European Parliament.    [Scharping] But the resolutions of the European Parliament  are clear. The 130-kmh limit will apply to some 90 percent of  all freeways. There is no question of concealment.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your financial spokesman Oskar Lafontaine  refuses point blank to tell motorists what kind of gasoline  price increase the SPD's tax reform calls for. Are you afraid  to tell the truth before the elections?    [Scharping] No, I am not, but the safeguarding of jobs by  means of environmentally friendly growth has priority. In the  previous presidential election campaign in 1990, the SPD  demanded that labor be made less cost-intensive and that the  consumption of energy and raw materials should not be  detrimental to the environment. At that time, we wanted a tax  allowance for using one's car for business purposes, and we  wanted car tax to be converted to a tax on gasoline. After  that, we thought to ourselves in 1990, the gasoline tax could be  gradually increased. But what happened? There is still no tax  allowance on the use of cars for business purposes, but there is  still a car tax. The Bonn coalition has raised the gasoline tax  by about 40 pfennigs, despite its promises and following a loud  spate of election propaganda against the SPD.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is that why the SPD has no courage to face the  truth?    [Scharping] On the contrary. The traffic sector must bear  the costs it incurs. Let me repeat that jobs and growth come  first. Therefore, we must put an end to new taxes and levies. I  want to have a modern country that helps citizens, not one that  keeps on imposing new taxes on them.    [DER SPIEGEL] We were talking about the future financial  burden on motorists.    [Scharping] Motorists are already burdened enough as it is.  Anyone who wants to see a gasoline price of DM5 per liter, like  the Greens do, goes against the spirit of the broad ecological  reform policy that we in the SPD would like to see.    [DER SPIEGEL] The voters expect anyone capable of predicting  the errors of others to give accurate information about his own  plans.    [Scharping] Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker from the Wuppertal  Environmental Institute supports a continuous increase in energy  prices. But even he says that to encourage environmentally  friendly development and increase purchasing power, there should  be no further financial burdens on the motoring sector.    [DER SPIEGEL] But how do you finance the development of a  car that consumes three liters of gas per 100 km if you do not  drastically raise gasoline prices?    [Scharping] That is a question of new technology in car  engines and materials. Automobile companies are reacting to  international competition and rising energy prices.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your program also says that carbon dioxide  emissions should be reduced by at least one-quarter by the year  2005. At the same time, you want to consume the same coal  levels as today. Experts say one cannot do both at the same  time.    [Scharping] We must improve the efficiency of fuel, like the  case of modern power stations -- for example, those in Saarland.  Preserving the coal mining industry and providing it with a  secure financial framework involves much more than just  safeguarding jobs. Apart from that, a modern energy policy is  impossible without solar energy.    [DER SPIEGEL] In his latest book, which he considers a kind  of pro-SPD election guide, Helmut Schmidt warns against further  subsidies for jobs that he considers eternally dependent on  budget support, mentioning the coal and steel industries and  agriculture as an example.    [Scharping] I am pleased about Helmut Schmidt's support.  However, that does not mean we think alike on every issue. He  has his own head, and I have mine.    [DER SPIEGEL] You have set your party a task very early.  Within the Union spectrum, the SPD could win 15 percent of the  votes; within the Greens spectrum, it might win 4 percent.    [Scharping] Not quite. I said that some 15 percent of the  electorate fluctuates between the CDU and SPD, and 4 percent  fluctuates between the SPD and Greens.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many have interpreted this as a call to  compete for the political center.    [Scharping] It is not a question of competition. The point  is that the SPD has returned to the center of social problems.  We are dealing here with a competition between the CDU and the  SPD concerning the political leadership in Germany.    [DER SPIEGEL] How seriously do you take the warning of  Reinhard Klimmt, SPD faction chief in the Saarland, one of your  closest aides, whereby the SPD would jeopardize its "political  efficiency" if it neglected the environmentally conscious part  of its electorate and the social movements? According to him,  one-third of SPD voters give second preference to the Greens,  and 80 percent of the Greens give second preference to the SPD.    [Scharping] It is our joint conviction that reform policy  geared to the year 2000 and beyond must combine an essential  economic growth with equally essential environmental progress.    [DER SPIEGEL] Then how do you explain the criticism of Green  spokesman Ludger Volmer, who feels nothing but malice vis-a-vis  the SPD program?    [Scharping] That man is waging an election struggle. The  Greens, however, enjoy no political monopoly. They have no  right to decide who or what is environmental, like some high  priest.    [DER SPIEGEL] Fewer and fewer Greens fancy sharing a  government with Scharping's SPD, and, five months before the  elections, the political distance from the Union is becoming  smaller and smaller.    [Scharping] The strongest party always finds a partner. In  the end, there will be more partners than necessary. That  increases the SPD's possibilities and makes it easier to  negotiate.    [DER SPIEGEL] You said that even if you lose the elections,  you will still go to Bonn to lead the opposition. Are you sure  your comrades would like to have you in this role?    [Scharping] I am going to Bonn, preferably as chancellor.  Can you imagine Germany enjoying a good future with another  four years of Kohl?    [DER SPIEGEL] Thank you for the interview, Herr Scharping.</p>

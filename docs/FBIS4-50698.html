			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China is implementing a  series of short-term measures to improve its intellectual  property protection, and the effort is concentrated on  legislation, Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said here today.    Xiao was speaking at the opening session of an international  symposium on intellectual property protection attended by 130  experts, lawyers and business people from China, Australia,  Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand  and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.    Also attending are representatives of the European and  German  patent offices.    According to the minister, legal regulations are being  prepared that aim at punishing proven copyright violations.    Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is to publish a decree on  border control of goods involving rights violations. "Customs  will be allowed a still bigger role in intellectual property  protection and in preventing the entrance and exit of such  goods," he said.    Xiao expected the decree to facilitate the implementation of  the "Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Intellectual  Property" and the "Berne Convention on Protection of Literary  and Artistic Works" to which China has acceded.    Law enforcement organs are being strengthened as part of an  effort to improve copyright protection. Such organs and the  departments of science, technology, and police as well as the  industry and commerce administration are to jointly investigate  major cases, he added. The supervision and review of law  enforcement by local governments and State Council departments  is also being improved. This will be carried out at irregular  intervals and will be concentrated on cases which are "important  and affecting many sides."    Professional societies and other non-governmental  organizations concerned with rights protection will be  encouraged and assisted by the state in offering consultancy and  other services.    "China attaches great importance to intellectual property  protection work, and is improving the legislation in this  regard," Xiao noted, citing the laws passed in recent years on  trademarks, patents, technical contracts and unfair competition.    China has acceded to a number of international conventions  on  intellectual property protection. "It is in the process of  making its own protection work meet international standards," he  said. "Law enforcement, on the whole, is good."    Meanwhile, the minister acknowledged the occurrence of  rights  violations and attributed this to a lack of understanding of the  importance of rights protection on the part of some government  departments and people.    "Intellectual property protection is an important part of  China's policy of reform and opening to the world," he said.  "It is vital for China to formulate laws to protect people's  creative work and ensure normal operation of the socialist  market economy."</p>

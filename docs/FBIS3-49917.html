The only multilateral  summit of the five delegations was a working lunch hosted by  Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's residence, where the five heads  of state all delivered addresses.    At the summit, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz called the  "Partnership for Peace" an initiative of great significance  which creates a realistic framework for Hungary and the region  to set out on the path towards full security policy integration.  Addressing Clinton, Goncz said, "your visit to Prague, our  bilateral talks in the morning and the present multilateral  meeting are important signals. They show that in this new era  of world history the United States continues to be committed to  Europe and to the new and restored Central European democracies  belonging to the Visegrad Group, which is very important for us."    The United States and NATO continue to consider their  mission  the full assertion of democracy, pluralism, human and minority  rights in all former communist countries, Goncz said.    He assured Clinton that Hungary will do its best to use the  opportunity offered by the partnership for peace programme.    Goncz said it is important that the programme should be open  to all the states which seek to enforce principles of democracy,  market economy and respect for human rights. "Nor should Russia,  Ukraine or any other state in the region be excluded from  European security," he stressed. Nevertheless, he admitted that  differences in the extent of the development and interests of  individual states have to be taken into consideration, though  not at the expense of the others.    Goncz said the future relationship between the Visegrad four  and NATO will be a special test of the new East-West partnership  and of the confidence between the United States, NATO, and  Russia.</p>

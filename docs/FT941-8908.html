			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Markets, yes cartels, no The European Commission's belated crackdown on the steel cartel is rather curious. The Commission, after all, has been a prime orchestrator of steel cartels in the past. Nevertheless, if the crackdown is a genuine sign that the cartel days are over, it is welcome. The fear, though, is that the Commission's real motive is to undermine the moral position of Europe's private steelmakers who have been highly critical of the Commission's role in sanctioning Ecu7bn in state aid to their inefficient public-sector rivals. Though the non-aided steel groups are not blameless, that does not alter in any way the unfairness of last December's subsidy package. Nor should it be used to blackmail the non-aided companies to take part in the Commission's overall plan for restructuring the industry. Under this, the Commission wants non-aided groups to cut 19m-25m tonnes of capacity to help bring demand and supply into balance. It is prepared to finance a quasi-cartel to achieve this. But the private steelmakers say they are not prepared to cut so much capacity, given that their aided rivals have cut only 5m tonnes. While they are right to feel aggrieved, it is pointless to labour the point. December's deal is done and cannot be unravelled. The practical question is whether the Commission is sensible to press ahead with its restructuring plan. The answer is probably no. Although the Commission cannot reasonably remove its offer to sanction a capacity-reducing cartel now it has been made, it should not be twisting arms to get companies to take part. The Commission would do better to leave restructuring to the market. Painful process Such a process would be painful. Without the prospect of orchestrated plant closures, prices would fall. Some companies would be driven into bankruptcy. Even that would not necessarily lead to capacity cuts in the short run as, in many cases, it would be more profitable to write down a company's debts and continue to operate its plants. This has already happened with Germany's Saarstahl and Klockner-Werke. One could hardly call such a process fair. Private investors would suffer because of hand-outs to state-owned groups. But it would have advantages. The rest of European industry would enjoy enhanced competitiveness from lower steel prices. Some jobs might be saved because lower prices could boost demand for steel. Moreover, when the time for closures came, there would be a reasonable prospect that the most inefficient plants would go first - maybe even those owned by state-aided companies. State aid Such a course of action could run into two dangers. First, steel companies might be so badly hurt that they would clamour for more state aid. If the companies that have already received subsidies from their governments - principally Italy's Ilva, Germany's Ekostahl and Spain's CSI - asked for more, the Commission's answer would be fairly clear: no second helpings. But if other groups managed to persuade their governments to subsidise them, the Commission would have a hard job saying no. After all, it would scarcely be fair to sanction subsidies to inefficient steelmakers and then deny them to more efficient rivals which were being driven out of business. The Commission would probably have to apply the same formula of aid for capacity cuts that it used last December. This prospect is not appealing. It only goes to show the mess created once precedents on state aid are set. The second danger is that market conditions could get so bad that the Commission felt forced to declare a 'manifest crisis' under the Treaty of Paris. German producers are already calling for this provision, under which companies would receive quotas for each market segment, to be invoked. The snag with such a cartel is not only that it would harm the rest of industry by pushing prices higher. The evidence of the 1980s, when a manifest crisis was last invoked, is that little restructuring would occur and trouble would be stored up for the future. Europe's steel industry is in such a mess that there are no easy solutions. But some are worse than others. The Commission should rely less on cartels and more on markets.</p>

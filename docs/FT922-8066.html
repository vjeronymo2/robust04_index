			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (2) - Famous son repays his home town / Columbus Exhibition, The attempt to cash in on Genoa's most celebrated mariner has been done with true Italian panache SOMEWHERE underneath the flyover, not far from the container lorries and next to the apparently interminable road works is the horseshoe-shaped piece of Genoa's old harbour housing the exhibition on Christopher Columbus, Ships and the Sea, the reason for the city's present jamboree. The attempt to cash in on the Columbus business has been done with true Italian panache, meaning constructive chaos. The paint may still be wet in patches, the mortar not quite set on every stone, but the exhibition should open on time. That in itself will be an achievement considering the landscape of cranes, pick-up trucks and pneumatic drills that dominated the scene until just a few weeks back. The project turned into a race against time after early construction work unearthed the remains of 12th and 14th Century port installations just where the aquarium was supposed to go. In came the archaeologists and out went the blueprints as the site had to be redrawn. In the end, the aquarium and other linked buildings were shifted 50 metres out to sea. 'We knew all along it wouldn't be ready on time,' says Mr Gianfranco Medri, the managing director for the L750bn Expo project. 'The experts said it would take five years to have the aquarium fully functioning. We've done it in less than three, even if all the tanks won't be full yet. But then, we started a bit late.' Europe's biggest aquarium, and the second largest in the world, is just one of the attractions which the Columbus '92 Exhibition hopes will pull in the crowds to its redeveloped 12-acre site, just minutes from the city centre. Looking out to sea, visitors will be struck by the restored old cotton warehouses, now converted into a congress centre and exhibition space, to their left. On the right, another long jetty shoots out to sea. It will incorporate the boat-shaped Italian pavilion and the aquarium behind it. Straight ahead is a huge spider-like structure, the Bigo, rising from the water, which has become one of the exhibition's symbols. Recalling a giant ship's crane, it is the brainchild of Genovese architect Renzo Piano, best known as one of the two partners behind the Pompidou Centre in Paris, who has had overall responsibility for the design of the exhibition site. Yet, in spite of all the money and effort behind it, the exhibition is still having difficulty getting noticed. Pipped at the post by Seville in Spain, which has used the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the New World to mount a vast international extravaganza, Genoa has had to look for niches to justify its belated attempt to honour its most famous son. The resulting event, which is not just about Columbus, but on the more general theme of 'ships and the sea', has turned out worthy, with a stress on scientific research and international conferences, but rather dull. 'Seville is a very different thing,' says Mr Merdi. 'Their intentions are completely different. The site alone is 10 times bigger than ours.' Wishful thinking? The existence of the much bigger Seville show, which also started earlier, and the blanket promotion lavished on it, has obliged the Genovese to think hard about what their Columbus celebration is all about. 'Ours is based on culture. It's designed to appeal to more thoughtful visitors who will appreciate the exhibits but be just as interested in the redevelopment of the old port,' he argues. Genoa, perhaps making virtue out of necessity, stresses its show is neither Eurodisney nor Seville. For sheer fun, better to head for the outskirts of Paris. And if the aim is to gawp at a huge international exposition of the old school, housed in mind-boggling buildings, Spain is the best destination. But for those who are content with a more limited, and rather more intellectual treat, Genoa could fit the bill. Of course, the exhibition is not without its popular attractions, notably the aquarium. Likewise the crane, which incorporates a 60-metre revolving glass lift to hoist visitors aloft to admire the harbour and city from the sort of perspective more familiar to a young midshipman up the mast of his vessel than a mariner of today. But the feature in Genoa is more the general redevelopment project and Renzo Piano's aim to 'open the waterfront again and reunite the city with the sea' than providing the fun of the fair. The unspoken rivalry with other big European attractions this year and Genoa's much more modest means and space are among the reasons why the project has already excited local tempers, especially over how many people will actually come. The debate has been fuelled by the city's local newspaper, Il Secolo XIX, whose family owners favoured a rival scheme to promote the project. The Expo's organisers are banking on between 3m and 3.5m visitors during the Expo's three-month run. Others are more sceptical. They question how many people, especially from outside the city, will be drawn to an event which, for all its merits, is short of really big attractions for the general public. And many claim the L25,000 entrance fee is steep for what is on offer. 'I'm not expecting a big rush from the start,' says Mr Medri. 'We haven't gone in for the sort of blanket promotion used by Seville and Eurodisney. I think that approach can be counter-productive as people tend to get fed up with being bombarded by promotional publicity.' He hopes interest in Genoa's show will grow steadily through word of mouth. 'Things will start moving after the first two weeks,' he says. But, in a familiar refrain, he admits that 'we set off late with the promotion'. The bulk of visitors will come from Genoa itself or the immediate region. Around two thirds will be Italians, the remainder foreigners, either from nearby France or others visiting the Riviera for their summer holidays. The projections recognise that few will be coming to see Genoa itself, in spite of all the city's efforts to smarten its appearance. Almost all the Italian visitors will be day-trippers, and the publicity has been specifically designed for them. Apart from the Genovese themselves, the organisers expect the exhibition to appeal to millions of Italians from big cities such as Milan and Turin, both less than two hours away by train or car. 'We certainly don't expect they will all sleep in hotels in the city,' notes Mr Medri. But once the holiday season starts, he hopes for a wider public as holidaymakers along the Riviera may be tempted to desert the beach and spend a day seeing the exhibition for themselves. But the debate about numbers is probably irrelevant when considered against the exhibition's wider aims. True, it should provide some entertainment for the Genovese and their neighbours for a few months this spring and summer. But more important is the event's role in promoting the rediscovery of a rundown part of the city, yet lying cheek by jowl with some of its finest houses and shops. Though not on a scale with harbourside redevelopments in cities such as Baltimore, where hundreds of acres have been revived and whole new entertainment zones created, the Genoa exhibition has also been planned with the future of the city in mind. More than 80 per cent of the site will remain untouched after the exhibition closes on August 15, compared with the large-scale demolition which usually follows a big international event of its kind. Once over, visitors will even be able to see archaeologists at work on the port installations: it was their discovery which delayed plans for the aquarium. But the main contribution of the exhibition will be to have made the Genovese themselves take their city more seriously. Irrespective of the attendance figures, the exhibition has triggered off an architectural revival, with restoration schemes going well beyond the old port itself. So, while Genoa may have served Columbus badly when it failed to finance his expedition across the Atlantic, its most famous son has repaid his former home handsomely today.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Semiconductor health probe THE HEALTH and Safety Executive will investigate the links between chemicals used in semiconductor manufacturing and miscarriages suffered by women working in the industry. The UK investigation follows a recent large-scale study in the US which found a miscarriage rate of 12 per cent to 14 per cent among women working in semiconductor manufacturing. This compared with 10 per cent for the population as a whole. Between 2,000 and 2,500 women are estimated to work in semiconductor manufacturing in the UK. The HSE said the chemicals involved were glycol ethers, adding that there was particular concern about the glycol ethers of lower molecular weight. There have already been moves by the industry to phase out the use of the most potentially hazardous glycol ethers, following an earlier small-scale US study of miscarriages among women exposed to the substances.</p>

This statement was made in an  interview with Interfax on Thursday [3 March] by the special  envoy of the Russian president, Vladimir Kazimirov, who leads  Russia's mediatory mission for a settlement in Karabakh. On  Wednesday he returned from a trip to Yerevan and Baku.    According to him, his trip was designed to implement a  protocol signed by the defence ministers of the conflicting  sides in Moscow on February 18th. The protocol provided for  ceasing fire, halting military actions and disengaging the  warring sides for some distance with a view to "consolidating an  end to the bloodshed". "The principal task was to secure a  ceasefire at midnight on March 1st. That task was accomplished,"  Kazimirov said.    According to him, the only guarantee for the ceasefire can  be  to disengage the two sides' armed units for a distance  insurmountable by artillery fire. "This means that each side  must retreat and withdraw its heavy weapons about 10 or 15  kilometers away from the front line. So far this condition has  not been met, and separate violations of the truce continue,"  Kazimirov said.    When the two sides withdraw their forces, 30 mobile groups  of  observers comprising Russian servicemen stationed in the area  will be deployed in "the disengagement strip". Representatives  of the warring sides will be included in these groups. "This is  the only way to determine objectively which side is responsible  for one violation or another, and raise the issue of calling to  account the direct violators, and possibly their military  commanders," Kazimirov pointed out.    Russia's latest actions in the area were "well coordinated"  with the efforts of the CSCE Minsk Group, he said. In the  course of his trip he conferred with the chairman of the Minsk  Group, Ian Elliason, and stressed "Russia's willingness to  cooperate".    However, the diplomat said, "Russian groups of observers  will act as pioneers after all." "We are prepared to keep  Russian groups locally for two days after the disengagement of  the warring sides. Unfortunately, the CSCE has no such  opportunity," Kazimirov said.</p>

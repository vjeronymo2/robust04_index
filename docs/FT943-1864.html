			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Stakes raised in milk dispute The Milk Marketing Board said yesterday it would call on the government to postpone the November deregulation of the milk market if the dairy trade won leave for a judicial review of the new arrangements. Its threat raised the stakes in the row over milk on the eve of today's High Court hearing of the Dairy Trade Federation's case. The federation is challenging the government's approval of deregulation on the grounds that the new system for selling milk to dairy companies will push costs up sharply and lead to a flood of imports. The board, due to be replaced on November 1 by Milk Marque, a dairy farmers' co-operative, accused the dairy trade of causing 'maximum uncertainty' by taking legal action so close to the planned liberalisation of the Pounds 3.3bn market. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, warned: 'If the court gives the Dairy Trade Federation leave to continue judicial review proceedings, it would not be responsible of us to allow the new arrangements to start while there was any conceivable doubt about their validity.' In the latest round of open hostility between the two sides of the industry, Mr Dare said he would have to ask Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to postpone introduction of the free market 'in order to protect producers against the potential consequences of the DTF's disruptive tactics'. The federation's case was totally unjustified, Mr Dare said. 'The scheme of reorganisation was submitted after years of planning and extensive discussions with the authorities and only approved after very detailed consultation with affected parties.' Mr John Price, director-general of the dairy federation, said the trade had delayed legal action until it was clear how Milk Marque's selling procedures would affect prices. Mr Waldegrave's refusal to refer the arrangements to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission had left judicial review as 'the only option open to us,' he said. He argued that there was no need to postpone deregulation. 'We're not complaining about the whole scheme, only the selling system, and changes to that could be made retrospectively.'</p>

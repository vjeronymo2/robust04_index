			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic devotes its  entire 3 June 15-page issue to the Israeli air raids against a  Hizballah training camp in Ba'labakk on 2 June.    On page 2, the paper publishes the names of 26 people killed  and 40 wounded in the raids.    On page 3, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 1,000-word  statement issued by Hizballah in the wake of the Israeli raids.  The statement says that "the Zionist enemy, backed militarily,  politically, and morally by global arrogance, is waging a  vicious war against our homeland, people, livelihood, and  waters." The statement adds that "the enemy has been using the  so-called peace negotiations as a way to undermine our society  and nation. While America, the archsatan and the Zionists'  principal ally, is demanding that in the name of negotiations  and peace the Arabs and Muslims give up their mainstays of power  and lay down their arms in return for eliminating the sources of  tension--as Washington puts it--America at the same time  declares its commitment to maintain the Zionist enemy's  superiority and defend its security. Washington's objective is  to destroy our nation and the Resistance and plunder our  resources."    On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately  400-word statement by head of the Hizballah Political Bureau  al-Hajj Husayn Khalil commenting on the Israeli raids. Khalil  says "the continuing Zionist attacks on our land, people,  plantations, and waters-- attacks culminating in the treacherous  aggression against Ba'labakk early today--are equivocal evidence  that the decision to participate in the peace negotiations was  wrong. Everyone realizes that Lebanon's participation in the  negotiations continues to give Israel pretexts and excuses to  pursue its policy of terrorism. Khalil goes on to say that "all  officials, regardless of their positions, are called upon to  take a responsible, firm stand toward the deep wound inflicted  by the Zionist aggression and to withdraw from the negotiations  indefintely."    On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately  450-word  eulogy delivered by Hizballah Secretary General Nasrallah.  After exalting the martyrs, Nasrallah says that "the bestial  Zionist aggression today will only increase our reliance on  Almighty God and will make us more determined to forge ahead  along the road of jihad regardless of sacrifices."    On page 4, AL-'AHD publishes the approximately 1,300-word  eulogy delivered by Ayatollah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in honor  of the souls of those who fell as a result of the Israeli raids  on Ba'labakk. Fadlallah says: "As Muslims, mujahidin, and  oppressed people, we decided there is no place for Israel among  us, and that global arrogance will no longer have influence on  our positions. Israel might win several rounds, and global  arrogance might win several positions, but it is justice that  will win in the end." Fadlallah continues that "the United  States is a wolf that devours man, peace, and life. We know  that every Israeli bullet is in fact an American bullet directed  at the chests of the oppressed and the entire people." He adds:  "We cannot accept the United States as a friend, no matter how  events might develop. The United States will never be a friend  of the Arabs and Muslims nor a friend of the oppressed."    On page 5, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 1,500-word  analysis by Ja'far Fadlallah on the Israeli aggression and the  options to confront it. The writer says that the Israeli enemy  "is pursuing a scorched earth policy to force the people to  emigrate after losing the sources of their livelihoods and to  spread an atmosphere of instability and tension that will create  a vacuum." The writer adds that the Israeli enemy "aims to put  the blame on the resistance and to instigate divisions and make  the people abandon the resistance. This is an old strategy that  the Zionist entity has been trying to implement by all means."  Fadlallah continues that "the Zionist escalation is aimed at  the Lebanese authorities, who would have quickly responded to  the contents and conditions of the Zionist message if it had  freedom of action. The substance of the message is that  reliance on Syrian support will not guarantee protection and  internal stability. This is obvious from the fact that the long  Zionist arm can penetrate any area in Lebanon."    On pages 10 to 13, the paper publishes an approximately  5,500-word selection of reactions by various organizations,  officials, and deputies to the Israeli raids on Ba'labakk. The  Islamic Revolutionary Army Organization for the Liberation of  Palestine [Munazzamat al-jaysh al-thawri al-islami li tahrir  Filastin] denounces the aggression and says that "it is  confirmation of the Zionist capitulationist negotiations with  traitors like 'Arafat and those panting for an illusionary peace  with the Zionist entity." The Popular Front for the Liberation  of Palestine-General Command says that "the new Zionist  aggression is a manifestation of the provisions of the  Oslo-Cairo Agreement and is aimed at the forces rejecting the  U.S.-Zionist designs of hegemony." The General Secretariat of  the Union Party "calls on the Lebanese Government to stop  negotiations in view of this continuous aggression."    On page 14, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 400-word  report on an interview given by Hizballah Deputy Secretary  General Shaykh Na'im Qasim to the BBC's "Other Opinions"  program. While denying that Hizballah is holding Israeli pilot  Ron Arad, Qasim says: "We have two Israeli soldiers; we do not  deny this. They were captured during an Israeli commando  operation in the south in 1986, and their names are known."</p>

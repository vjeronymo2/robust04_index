			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Xtra-Vision to sell Videosmith offshoot Xtra-Vision, the Dublin-based video cassette rental company, yesterday blamed a downturn in performance at Videosmith, its US offshoot, for the fall in full year profits, and said that it intended to sell its Boston-based subsidiary. With turnover marginally lower at IPounds 22.7m (IPounds 22.9m) pre-tax profits for the year ended January 31 declined from IPounds 1.68m to IPounds 1.01m, or Pounds 976,000 sterling. Arising from the sale decision, the group had provided IPounds 4.7m as an extraordinary item against the value of Videosmith. Discussions regarding the sale had taken place with interested parties but there was no deal imminent. As an interim measure, Xtra-Vision had disposed of four under-performing stores in New Hampshire. Videosmith continued to trade profitably and its performance so far this year was ahead of 1992. Extraordinary charges totalled Pounds 5.56m (Pounds 530,000) and earnings per share fell from 1.13p to 0.55p.</p>

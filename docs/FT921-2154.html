			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: ASC files against Compass management THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC), the corporate watchdog, yesterday launched a court action for damages against seven directors and three senior managers of Compass Airlines, which collapsed in December. In a suit filed in the federal court in Brisbane, where Compass was based, the ASC alleges that the 10 breached their duties under the corporation law by allowing Compass to trade whilst insolvent. The suit seeks unspecified damages which would be paid to Compass Airlines and Compass Holdings, its parent company, both of which are in provisional liquidation. The ASC said there was no suggestion that any of the respondents engaged in any dishonest conduct. The suit alleges the airline was kept flying after ceasing to be viable. The suit was heavily criticised by Mr Bryan Grey, the chief executive of Compass, who founded the airline after a change in federal aviation policy allowed new entrants to challenge government-owned Australian Airlines and Ansett Australia, jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation. 'At no time did Compass trade while it was insolvent. I am absolutely disgusted,' Mr Grey said. Mr Leigh Brown, a former Compass director, said he believed the case would fail. Compass ceased flying after a long struggle against the two leading carriers which sparked an escalating price war in which all three lost revenue. The airline's management claimed it had been the victim of predatory price-cutting. Mr Grey also said Australian Airlines had failed to provide ground facilities required by the government. Southern Cross Airlines, which hopes to begin services later this year, said the court action would not affect its plans for a merger with Compass, which is being worked out with Mr Ian Ferrier, the provisional liquidator.</p>

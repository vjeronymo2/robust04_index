			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency also considered the effectiveness of integrating safety belts into seats to provide the necessary comfort. During the research, the agency was able to gain access to only a single vehicle equipped with an integrated safety belt: The Mercedes Benz 500SL convertible. This particular system also included an upper adjustable anchorage on the seat. The survey of adult human subjects indicated the safety belt did fit the range of adult occupants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The vehicles with adjustable shoulder belts were also surveyed using live test subjects having the approximate physical dimensions of the six-year-old, 5th percentile female, 50th percentile male, and 95th percentile male dummies. The six-year-old human test subject reported a good fit 10.5 percent of the time, and the 50th percentile male test subject 95.7 percent of the time, while the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male test subjects reported a good fit 100 percent of the time. These results also support the agency's conclusion that adjustable shoulder belts can fit a wide range of adult occupants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the ANPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency received 33 comments in response to the ANPRM. In general, the commenting manufacturers did not support continuation of this rulemaking, while commenting consumer advocates believed that the agency should address the issue of belt fit. Commenters did not provide any information on potential benefits other than anecdotal information from consumer surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of questions were raised concerning the test procedure for Option B. Some commenters stated that it was not appropriate to test the six-year-old dummy in the driver's seat. Other commenters stated that the 95th percentile adult male dummy might not fit in some rear seats. A number of comments were also received concerning the positioning procedures for the dummies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also raised questions concerning the test zone described in the ANPRM. NHTSA reviewed the test zone as part of the research described above and found that the shoulder zone was redundant and the chest zone was mislocated on some dummies (e.g., the chest zone intersected the neck of the six-year-old dummy). Therefore, for the research, the sternum reference point and the width of the shoulder zone were modified for each dummy, using the sitting height listed in S7.1.3 of Standard No. 208 as a guide to adjust the measurement in reference to the 50th percentile male dummy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters expressed concern that attempts to improve seat belt fit through providing means of adjustability could lead to misadjustment of belts, which could, in turn, increase the potential for injury. The agency conducted dynamic sled tests simulating a 48.3 km/h barrier impact using adjustable shoulder belts that were improperly positioned. In some cases dummy measurements improved, while in other cases measurements were worse. However, it should be stressed that these results were based on an adjustable belt range of approximately 16 centimeters, which is much greater than the adjustment available in current vehicles or that is required by this proposal. At this time, the agency does not have any information on the effect of an adjustment in the 5 centimeter range on dummy measurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the comments and the research results, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that belts which provide better fit, would, in turn, promote increased belt usage. Accordingly, the agency is proposing to require Type 2 safety belts either to be integrated with the vehicle seat or provide a means of adjustability to improve the fit and increase the comfort of the belt for a variety of different sized occupants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has decided not to propose detailed requirements. First, the detailed test procedure in the ANPRM would not provide an adequate means of identifying improper fit on the wide variety of sizes and shapes of vehicle occupants. As discussed above, the agency research showed that the proposed test procedure, using test dummies, had a much different result than the comfort levels reported by human subjects during the research survey. The human adults were more comfortable with the safety belt fit than the dummy fit indicated. Conversely, the human child discomfort and misfit were much worse than the dummy fit indicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Next, the results of the agency's research lead to the conclusion that currently available non-adjustable belts fit small adults better than they fit large adults. This does not correlate well with the complaints received by the agency. For these reasons, the agency does not believe that the test procedure suggested in the ANPRM addresses the cause of real-world fit problems. In addition, comments to the ANPRM raised a number of unresolved questions concerning the test procedure. These include a potentially uncomfortable location of the test zone on human subjects, the need to develop positioning procedures for the various dummies, and the need to develop and add specifications for the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male dummies in 49 CFR Part 572.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

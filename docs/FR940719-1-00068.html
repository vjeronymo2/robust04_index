			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would require that the record be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. Comments are solicited on this approach and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in coordination with the states, books specific for the required records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Identical provisions to those proposed in paragraph (f) of &sect;75.360 for countersigning records and for keeping the records in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages appear in &sect;75.363(c) and &sect;75.364(h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.362&blank;On-shift Examination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA is proposing to redesignate existing (d)(1)(i) and (ii) as (d)(1)(ii) and (iii), revise paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1)(iii) and (d)(2), remove paragraph (a)(2), and add new paragraph (a)(2) and (d)(1)(i). MSHA also proposes to transfer the paragraphs (g) and (h) recordkeeping and retention requirements to &sect;75.363, Hazardous conditions, posting, correcting, and recording, and add a new paragraph (g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) would be modified in paragraph (a)(1) to require a certified person to conduct an on-shift examination of a section during any shift when anyone is assigned to work on the section and where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. The existing rule requires that an on-shift examination be performed only on sections where coal is produced and where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. The Agency agrees with comments received during informational meetings that many of the same hazards can exist for persons working on a section, regardless of whether coal is being produced. For example, many times miners are assigned to perform maintenance work on a section when no production is scheduled. This maintenance work can involve disabled equipment that cannot be moved from the face area or from an area near a pillar line. In these situations, hazards can be equivalent to those encountered by miners during normal coal-producing operations or similar operations on the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency proposes to revise paragraph (a) to incorporate the word ``on-shift'' in the first sentence of the paragraph. The word ``on-shift'' was inserted for clarification and consistency with other paragraphs of &sect;75.362. The Agency is also proposing to revise paragraph (a)(1) to clarify that sufficient on-shift examinations be conducted to assure safety. It was suggested to the Agency that MSHA should include language to require more than one examination if necessary for safety, as provided for in the previous standard. The Agency is adopting this approach and is proposing that at least once during each shift, or more often if necessary for safety, a certified person designated by the operator would be required to conduct an on-shift examination of each section where anyone is assigned to work during the shift and any area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed during the shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has become aware of an opinion of a segment of the mining community that language in paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(1) and (c)(2) requiring an on-shift examination of areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed was promulgated without the benefit of adequate comment. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of this standard was done appropriately, these paragraphs are being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. The word ``working'' is removed from (c)(1) to assure the application of the standard would extend to all sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has determined that a specific examination requirement should be added to assure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters designated in the mine ventilation plan. Assuring full compliance with these parameters is important in safeguarding the health of the miners. Agency experience shows that needed attention has not always been given to the required respirable dust control parameters. Citations issued by the Agency during a special spot inspection program, undertaken in 1991 at the request of MSHA's Coal Mine Respirable Dust Task Group, in which Agency inspectors conducted several checks of the dust control parameters during the course of each sampling shift, revealed that 21 percent of the 781 mining units sampled were not complying with one or more of the parameters. In its 1992 report, the Agency's Task Group recommended that MSHA ``*&blank;*&blank;* require coal mine operators to make periodic on-shift examinations to verify that the ventilation plan parameters are in place and functioning as intended'' (p. 47). The Agency agrees and considers on-shift examinations of dust control parameters an important part of reasonable and prudent dust control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus the proposal, in paragraph (a)(2), would add a new on-shift examination requirement to address respirable dust control. Under the proposal, at or near the beginning of any shift before coal production begins on a section, a certified person designated by the operator would conduct an examination for compliance with the dust control parameters established in the mine ventilation plan. Corrective actions to assure compliance would be required to begin immediately. The proposed examination would include measurements for compliance with required water pressures and flow rates, number and orientation of water sprays, air quantities and velocities, section ventilation setup and control device placement, and any other dust control parameter required in the ventilation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several methods of measuring water spray pressures would be acceptable. For example, water flow and pressure can be monitored through the installation of an in-line water meter and a pressure transducer. Water pressure can also be measured by permanently installing a pressure gauge on a machine. Operators would determine the working relationship between the pressure gauge reading and the actual operating pressure at the sprays. Once the working relationship has been established, the gauge pressure could be used to indicate the actual spray pressure specified in the ventilation plan for a given number of operating sprays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

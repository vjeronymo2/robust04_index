			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FED AND TIGHT MONEY: A MISGUIDED STRATEGY AT JUST THE WRONG TIME  </P> <P> Is the Federal Reserve Board about to sandbag the economy again?  </P> <P> On Tuesday Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan offered unusually candid congressional  testimony, saying that the Fed considers the U.S. inflation rate (about 4.5%)  unacceptably high, and that inflation "must be brought down."  </P> <P> That declaration gladdened hearts all along Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones  industrial average up 38 points. Greenspan's statement was widely interpreted  as a signal that the Federal Reserve would tighten its monetary policy, further  raising interest rates and slowing economic growth.  </P> <P> Since mid-1987 interest rates have already been nudged up about two full  points. The policy of tighter money is already reflected in higher interest  costs on home mortgages, auto loans and commercial credit. All this dampens  economic activity, which is the Fed's intention.  </P> <P> It is not at all clear, however, that this policy is warranted or wise. There  is good historical evidence that most of the economic recoveries of the postwar  period did not die a natural death of old age, but were strangled by tight  money when the Federal Reserve got prematurely nervous about inflation.  </P> <P> Inflation got genuinely out of hand on two occasions -- during the Vietnam War,  when Congress tried to have both guns and butter, and in the 1970s, thanks to  OPEC, food shortages and an entrenched spiral of escalating prices and wages.  </P> <P> But the economy of the 1980s is structurally less prone to inflation.  </P> <P> First, trade unions are far weaker than a decade ago. In most industries,  despite tight labor markets, collective bargaining is mainly about givebacks,  not about wage increases.  </P> <P> Second, new international competition makes it much harder for industry to  respond to tight capacity by raising prices. There really is no longer any such  thing as tight capacity in the traditional sense. If American autos, steel,  textiles or whatever are in short supply, there are plenty of imported  substitutes, and firms don't dare jack up prices lest they lose customers.  </P> <P> That is why we have been able to enjoy several years of relatively low  unemployment, moderate economic growth and low inflation, despite a high  federal deficit. Moreover, the willingness of foreigners to buy American debt  means that the old fear that public debt will "crowd out" private capital is  also less of a worry.  </P> <P> Inflation has crept up, from a low of about 2.5% to 4.5%, not mainly because of  rising labor costs or tight plant capacity but because of the cheap dollar.  With the economy more reliant on imports, those foreign goods become more  expensive for Americans to purchase as the dollar is devalued.  </P> <P> But the Fed's traditional remedy of tight money won't do anything to make  Volkswagens or Sonys cheaper to buy. It will only slow U.S. economic growth,  make houses more costly to finance and throw more Americans out of work. By  raising interest rates, it also transfers wealth from borrowers (most of us) to  creditors (who tend to be wealthy).  </P> <P> The current 5.3% unemployment rate is certainly better than the 11%  unemployment rate at the pit of the 1982-83 recession, but it is nowhere near  full employment. About 7 million Americans are still out of work. Despite  "tight labor markets" in some regions, millions of people are still working for  wages too low to maintain a decent standard of living.  </P> <P> The alternative to a tight-money policy is to recognize that today's mild  inflation has different structural causes, and to design appropriate remedies.  We should stop trying to become competitive by cheapening the value of the  dollar, which really is inflationary. Instead, we should begin to pursue more  aggressive industrial and trade strategies to expand export markets for  American goods.  </P> <P> Full employment need not be inflationary, so long as there is a kind of social  compact between industry and labor. Nations as diverse as Japan, West Germany  and Sweden have enjoyed long periods of low inflation and full employment by  making sure that wage increases do not exceed productivity improvements, by  using training programs to anticipate bottlenecks and by giving workers a  greater stake in the fruits of enterprise.  </P> <P> And we should reclaim the antitrust laws, which gathered dust during the Reagan  Administration, and use antitrust enforcement to make sure that companies do  not unfairly rig prices.  </P> <P> The prospect of a recession today is far riskier than usual, because of the  large federal deficit. With an already excessive deficit, fiscal stimulus is  not available as a tool to induce a recovery. Setting off a slump would widen  the deficit because tax receipts would drop, unemployment compensation pay-outs  would rise and, thanks to the tight-money policy, the government would have to  finance its deficit at higher interest rates.  </P> <P> It is never a good time to artificially induce a recession. But this is a  particularly bad time.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on conversation with Otto Schlecht, chairman of the </F> Ludwig Erhard Foundation, by Heinz Heck: "`The Economy Is  Waiting for Something Concrete'"]    [Text] Bonn--The SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  has stopped at the halfway point in its effort to free itself  from the stigma of the party of redistribution and to  demonstrate economic competence. These are comments by Otto  Schlecht, chairman of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation and long-time  undersecretary in the Ministry of Economics, on the SPD's latest  tax plans in a conversation with DIE WELT. Schlecht appeals to  the coalition and the opposition to improve the basic tax  provisions in the interest of international  competitiveness--thus to reduce the tax burden--and recommends  as a "second best solution." tax preferences for risk-intensive  tangible assets.    "Growth and jobs must come before redistribution and  increases in income. Businesses have to be confident that they  will not be burdened excessively," Schlecht suggests. For 1994  and 1995 the per capita tax load is moving toward 50 percent.  "That is statism. We have not only reached the end of the flag  pole; we have to go back to the 45 percent of 1989." We have to  make room for spending through energetic savings. In this  connection, he accused the government of "political inaction."    Both sides, the coalition and the SPD, have not yet detailed  their future tax policy. "But this is urgently necessary. The  economy is waiting for this." The government should stipulate a  time limit for the solidarity surcharge and not pass any new tax  increases.    Schlecht makes a fundamental distinction between the  coalition's solidarity surcharge and the SPD's special levy.  From the government's viewpoint, the solidarity surcharge of 7.5  percent of the tax liability is "a necessary evil, an emergency  measure for a few years." The SPD, however, wants the 10-percent  special levy to be "permanent" as a social instrument of  redistribution.    If 25 percent of the tax payers paid 70 percent of the wage  and personal income tax, there could be no talk of a "fairness  gap." To prevent any further transfer of jobs abroad, we have to  level the tax differences with respect to European and other  competitors by reducing the profits tax rates and eliminating  taxes unrelated to profits (industrial capital tax and  industrial property tax).    If this "best solution" does not meet with success owing to  a  lack of votes in the Bundesrat, Schlecht recommends as the  "second best solution" tax preferences for risk capital--not  only for corporate profits. "We have a lack of risk capital for  new investments." There should also be more and more examples of  employee participation in investments (participation wages).  Management and labor are chiefly to blame for the fact that this  "has never worked" in the past, he says. "We need a moderate  wage policy for years to come."</p>

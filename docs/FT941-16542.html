			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Nestle announces coffee price rise Nestle, the food company, yesterday announced the first rise in coffee prices since 1990. From today the company has added 19p to the cost of a 100g jar of Nescafe, which is expected to take the average supermarket price from Pounds 1.37 to Pounds 1.56 by the end of the month. Nestle said the rise was prompted by world coffee bean prices, which have increased by a third since a producers' agreement in June last year. Accumulated higher production costs since 1990 also played their part in the size of the increase, Nestle said. 'There is now a formal agreement among the major coffee-producing countries to hold back 20 per cent of their crop to keep the price up and provide a much-needed boost to their foreign currency earnings,' the company said.</p>

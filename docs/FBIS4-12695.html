			<p>BFN     [Text] The administrative detention of Kakh activist  Shmu'el Ben-Yishay will be shortened by a month for personal  reasons. He will be released within two weeks, the Supreme  Court decided today. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that  Ben-Yishay was issued an order confining him to the boundaries  of Qiryat Arba' and compelling him to report to the police every  day for two months. He also undertook not to give interviews to  the media, address public rallies, or engage in incitement.    The Jerusalem District Court gave Mendes Qeysar, an  inhabitant of Qiryat Arba', a 21-month suspended sentence  because he took part in a disturbance in the course of which he  attacked a policeman under aggravated circumstances. Qeysar was  fined 12,000 shekels for the attack on the policeman.    Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that  an Arab inhabitant of East Jerusalem was shot dead in a  disturbance near Hebron five months ago, but the shooter was not  caught.</p>

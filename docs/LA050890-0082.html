			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> WAILING TURBANS EXPLORE SEX, LOVE AT CAFE LARGO  </P> <P> With a presentation that's part vaudeville, part performance art and part rock  opera, Weba and the Wailing Turbans boldly went where no Caucasian trio dressed  in Moorish outfits have gone before, Thursday night at Cafe Largo. Entitled  "Adventure Amour," their zany new revue examining sex in the universe, the  meaning of love and an unrelenting Arab motif, tickled and teased, winning over  spectators gathered at the Hollywood cabaret.  </P> <P> The charismatic, central chanteuse -- Weba Garretson -- crooned out sexy lyrics  while striking an innumerable amount of titillating poses. Her two endearingly  dullard sidekicks -- Weba's brother, John Garretson, and new member Jeff Oetjen  -- mugged and strutted, lending support with monosyllabic grunts, purposely  banal choruses or an occasional strum or blat on a musical instrument or two.  </P> <P> It's difficult to be specific about why this balancing act of ultra-female and  ultra-male persona works as sophisticatedly well as it does. The formulaic rock  songs by Weba and composer Steve Stewart -- with titles such as "Creamy  Dressing Man" and "Love Pimple" -- hold little value out of context.  </P> <P> Yet the overall low-budget production by Garretson's real-life husband, Mark  Wheaton, makes intelligent use of props and a simple sound system with which  the ensemble sings to prerecorded music. Cartoonish, pseudo-Persian tapestries  by Sarah Todd Garretson (sister-in-law) fittingly serve as backdrops while a  slide show with similarly styled artwork and credits bring a  TV-situation-comedy flavor to the event.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    (Text] The PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] warehouse has no  more room to store drugs, and a special warehouse vault with an  incinerator needs to be built. PTJ Director Jaime Abad visited  the Presidency today concerning this matter. He met with  Presidency Minister Ivonne Young to request a special allocation  of 75,000 balboas to build the vault to store and destroy the  drug. Abad said a large amount of drugs, confiscated in  different operations, is being stored. [Begin recording]    Abad: We are close to three tons of cocaine, and  we are also storing marijuana.    Ortega: Is there no way of getting rid of it?    Abad: There is no way; there is no way. We have  no room for it. There is, honestly, no room for it in the PTJ  warehouse, which I insist is a warehouse and not a vault with  extractors of contaminating gases. Our personnel are breathing  those gases, contaminating themselves. They are showing  allergic symptoms. This is not the most scientific method. As  you may recall from the latest burnings, our detectives have to  spread the substances with their hands when we incinerate drugs.  We lack gloves and gas masks. Everything is done in a very  rudimentary and totally archaic manner. [end recording]    Compounding the matter, the incinerations done in the open  air cause major ecological damage, incinerations the PTJ  director described as a clear emergency. He added friendly  countries such as Germany and the United States have been asked  for assistance. Because there has been no response, an  allocation for $75,000 balboas to build the vault to store and  destroy the drugs will have to come from state funds. The  legislative assembly and the executive branch will have the  final word.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Nervous recovery as bourses anticipate Dow Senior bourses anticipated yesterday's recovery in the US bond and equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff. However, dealers were also conscious that this was reaction time after some heavy losses, and caution and a sense of nervousness also prevailed. FRANKFURT responded to US and domestic influences. At home, sentiment was improved by a cut of six basis points in the Bundesbank's repo rate, and speculation whether this pointed to a cut in rates at the Buba meeting today. The Dax index rose 16.27 to 2,235.15, improving on that in the post-bourse to an Ibis-indicated 2,241.34 by the end of the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM6bn to DM7.95bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, added that the broad equity market was lifted by first quarter results from Veba. The energy and chemicals group produced a 35 per cent rise in net profits, rose DM6.80 to DM527.30 and took the utilities sector up with it; the growth rate, said Ms Altmann, was 10 points stronger than expected. Degussa, the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and metals combine, put on DM12 or 2.3 per cent to DM526 on a 58 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits. In banks, waiting for Buba, Deutsche rose DM11.80 to DM793.50 and Dresdner DM8.50 to DM401.50. PARIS recovered all of Monday's losses and then moved into positive territory helped by Wall Street, European bond markets and hopes for German rates today. The CAC-40 index closed 25.56 or 1.2 per cent better at 2,164.98, not far short of the session high of 2,170. Turnover was estimated at FFr3bn, up from Monday's FFr2.4bn. BSN, the food manufacturer, was among the day's most active issues, adding FFr21 to FFr869 on a 7 per cent rise in first quarter sales, expectations of higher profits in 1994 and a change of name to Danone, currently the division of the group which markets yoghurt. The group's chairman, Mr Antoine Ribaud, also announced a series acquisitions as part of efforts to strengthen its international presence. LVMH, up FFr12 at FFr906, benefited from a number of buy recommendations, including one from Hoare Govett which noted that, in spite of a rise of more than 20 per cent in the shares since the beginning of the year, the group has in fact underperformed the CAC-40 by 5 per cent over the last two years. Euro Disney fell below the FFr30 level, and touched an all time low of FFr28.20 before closing down 75 centimes at FFr29.25; investors feared the effects of dilution following the company's capital increase. MILAN waited for the formation of the new government, but had to wait some more as the expected audience of the prime minister-designate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was delayed further until later yesterday. The Comit index rose 16.23, or 2 per cent to 817.17. Fiat rose L230 to L7,240, ahead of 1993 results which are expected tomorrow. Analysts were confident that the car maker would show a good recovery for 1994, helped by better-than-expected sales of its new Punto range, as well as a pick-up in overall Europan car volumes. Insurance stocks were again in focus with Generali up another L1,000 at L48,950. ZURICH, down 2.7 per cent on Monday, saw the SMI index recover 59.5, or 2.3 per cent to 2,629.8 with banks in the lead after their recent weakness. CS Holding bearers, the most active stock, rose SFr27, or 4.8 per cent to SFr585. SBC put on SFr14 to SFr372 and UBS SFr32 to SFr1,087. However, the market was less enthusiastic about Roche, the pharmaceutical group. Its certificates, under pressure since the apparently generous bid for Syntex of the US, recovered just SFr30 to SFr6,330. Roche said that consolidating Syntex will not dilute earnings, and that 1994 profits will be higher; but foreign selling continued. MADRID rallied in the wake of domestic bonds, the general index recovering 6.58, or 2.1 per cent to 320.99. Turnover rose from Pta15.1bn to just over Pta22bn. The recovery in the US equity market was mirrored by Telefonica, the most active stock of the day in volume of around 1.96m shares, and up Pta45 to Pta1,770. Acerinox, recently neglected but one of this year's favourites, rose Pta830, or 6.1 per cent to Pta14,400 on doubled pre-tax profits for the first quarter of the current year. AMSTERDAM was supported by the major internationals and the AEX index rose 3.96, or 1 per cent to 409.9. Royal Dutch was up Fl 2.20 at Fl 206.00 ahead of first quarter results due today. In a preview, James Capel, sticking to a hold recommendation, noted that the shares 'have had a tremendous run on the back of improving oil price sentiment, but are looking somewhat stretched on valuation grounds'. Hunter Douglas, up 60 cents at Fl 79.80, said that it was launching an ADR programme in New York. STOCKHOLM was generally stronger with the exception of Ericcson, whose B shares dipped SKr6 to SKr340, on disappointment that it had lost an important Saudi Arabian telecommunications contract, worth an estimated Dollars 4bn, to AT&amp;T of the US. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.10 to 1,499.70 in turnover of SKr1.7bn.

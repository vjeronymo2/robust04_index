			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Guizhou Province Introduces Two </F> Major Policies To Promote Stability in Rural Areas" -- ZHONGGUO  TONGXUN SHE headline]    [Text] Guiyang 2 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--To further  stabilize basic rural policy and the two-tier management  structure with the contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output, Guizhou Provincial  Government has recently presented two major policies which will  ease the peasants' minds for quite some time.    These two major policies are as follows: When a 15-year  contract for farmland responsibility has expired, the contract  can be renewed for another 30 years. Non-arable land, such as  waste hills and slopes can be renewed for 60 years or even  longer. Second, land-use rights can be inherited, transferred,  swapped, mortgaged, or converted into shares according to the  law. Land and waste slope use rights can be leased and  auctioned in an organized fashion. At the same time, it is made  explicit that, during the contracted period, the implementation  of the policy of making the area of contracted land constant  regardless of increase or decrease in the number of people in a  household will continue.    To augment leadership in agricultural and rural work,  Guizhou  has recently set up a leading group for rural work.</p>

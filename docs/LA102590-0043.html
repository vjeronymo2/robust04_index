			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FDIC FILES A $560-MILLION SUIT FILED IN S&amp;L FRAUD CASE  </P> <P> Federal bank regulators have filed a $560-million lawsuit against the former  owner of Western Savings Assn., contending that he defrauded the failed thrift  of at least that much money.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also accuses Jarrett E. Woods Jr. of  spending $7 million of depositors' money on himself during the thrift's final  months in 1986.  </P> <P> No criminal charges have been filed against Woods.  </P> <P> The lawsuit is one of the largest ever filed by the government against a  savings and loan owner. It was filed Friday in Dallas but not released until  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The suit accuses Woods and Western Capital, a corporation he controlled, of  engaging in fraud and violating contracts. The government alleges that in the  four years Woods controlled the thrift, he squandered its deposits on high-risk  and fraudulent investments and improper loans.  </P> <P> "The losses suffered by the institution appear to exceed $1 billion, at least  $560 million of which was the preventable result of the policies and practices  implemented at Western by Jarrett E. Woods Jr. and Western Capital Corp.," the  suit states.  </P> <P> Woods is accused of using thrift money to refinance his home, funneling  millions into his children's trust funds, paying off a personal loan and paying  himself an $800,000 bonus and a $41,667 monthly salary.  </P> <P> When federal regulators closed Western in September, 1986, examiners found  "deficient or non-existent appraisals, inadequate loan documentation,  inaccurate accounting and shoddy record-keeping," the lawsuit states.  </P> <P> Woods disagreed with the regulators' contentions. He claimed that the thrift  was not insolvent and that he had tried to find solutions to the examiners'  concerns.  </P> <P> Woods could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P></p>

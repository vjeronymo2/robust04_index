			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITISH BAND TO BE DEPORTED AFTER ARREST ON POT CHARGE  </P> <P> Five musicians and two technicians from the British pop band UB40, arrested on  suspicion of possessing marijuana, will be deported from the Seychelles, police  said today.  </P> <P> Deputy Police Commissioner Raymond Louise told reporters there was enough  evidence to charge the seven, but authorities had decided to deport them from  the islands in the Indian Ocean instead.  </P> <P> Conviction for possession of illegal drugs in the Seychelles carries a  mandatory three-year jail sentence.  </P> <P> Louise did not say when group members, who were taken into custody Monday after  police raided their hotel room, would have to leave.  </P> <P> UB40 gave a concert Saturday and their performance was described by the  islands' only newspaper, the Seychelles Nation, as a technical fiasco. An  organizer said a bottle of water accidentally fell in the music-mixing  equipment.  </P></p>

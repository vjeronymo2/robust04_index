			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FORCES INVADE PANAMA, OUST NORIEGA REGIME  </P> <P> Noriega's fall from grace was predictable. He knew where all our  Administration's skeletons were buried. The Panama invasion has to be seen in  the larger context of a grotesquely bizarre United States foreign policy toward  Central America in this century. These Latin nations are treated not as  sovereign states but as witless peasants. For a hundred years we have invaded  them at will, always under the pretext of saving them from themselves.  </P> <P> In fact, our attitude is racist at heart. We act this way in no other part of  the world. As Europe, Russia, and the rest of the civilized world move into an  era of enlightened and humane foreign policy this Christmas, our State  Department's vision in Central America continues to resemble a pact with the  devil.  </P> <P> RICHARD PEACOCK  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

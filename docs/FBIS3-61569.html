			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: ``Special-Purpose 1993-1995 Federal Program to </F> Prevent the Spread of AIDS in the Russian Federation (AIDS  Control)'']    [Text]  <H5>  Goals and Tasks </H5>   The main goal of this program is to prevent the spread of  AIDS in the Russian Federation, lower socioeconomic consequences  of AIDS by means of coordinated implementation of an aggregate  of organizational, scientific and practical measures.    These measures will be implemented in the following  directions: --prevention of sexual and blood transmission of  AIDS; --diagnosis, treatment and screening; --legal and social  safeguards; --refinement of epidemiological oversight system;  --research on the AIDS problem; --furnishing information and  personnel personnel.  <H5>  Prevention of Sexual Transmission of AIDS </H5>   For the next few years, sexual contact will remain as the  principal route for the spread of AIDS. For this reason, it is  imperative to establish a system of purposeful information of  the public about the AIDS problem and increasing danger of  acquiring this infection, and providing to the public available  means of preventing sexual transmission of this infection.    The information must be understandable for different age and  social groups. There are plans for: organization of topical  radio and television transmissions, 25 video clips, 5 cinevideo  and 5 video films, with organization of their screening in movie  houses, translation and demonstration via State, agency and  commercial radio and television channels; preparation and  large-volume publication, as well as dissemination of  educational materials (15 million flyers, 1 million posters and  5 million booklets per year), preparation of 5 general  educational programs for sex and moral education for different  age groups, their introduction in preschool institutions,  general, vocational, secondary specialized and higher  educational institutions; enlisting young people, religious and  social organizations, leaders and activities in high-risk groups  to participate in this work; expansion of the network of  anonymous screening and psychological support offices, and  organization of such offices in cities with a population of more  than 200,000; performance of systematic sociological studies of  the AIDS problem.    In order to provide a sufficient number of contraceptives at  an affordable price, it is planned to expand their manufacture  at Russian Federation enterprises and to issue them to specific  population groups among those with high risk of infection (drug  addicts, individuals living in dormitories, etc.).    It is assumed that the intensity of sexual transmission of  the virus of immune deficiency will be lowered by 25-30 percent  by 1996, as a result of implemented measures. Accordingly, there  will be a reduction in cost of treating AIDS patients (in 1989,  the cost per patient was 40,000 rubles, and in 1992 prices  500,000 rubles).    The principal executors of this section are: --Russian  Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary  and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian State Television and  Radio Broadcasting Company; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Education; --Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs;  --Russian Federation Ministry of Culture; --Russian Federation  Committee for Cinematography; --Russian Federation Ministry of  the Press and Information; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Justice; --Russian Federation Committee for the Chemical and  Petrochemical Industry; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian  Federation Committee for Tourism.  <H5>  Prevention of AIDS Transmission through Blood </H5>   The program provides for outfitting pertinent laboratories  with equipment and diagnostic test systems, on the basis of the  need to make 6 million tests per year, in order to upgrade the  system of supplying safe blood, other biological materials and  medical immunobiological preparations. In addition, it is  planned to exclude by 1995 placental and abortion-related blood  as raw material for the production of medical immunobiological  preparations and change to use solely of donor blood for this  purpose.    In view of the danger of potential intramural AIDS  infection,  there is a set of steps aimed at training medical personnel to  ensure sanitary and epidemic-control conditions, expand and  update the manufacture of syringes, needles, catheters and  blood-transfusion systems that could cause infection of the  blood via blood. Due consideration was also given to the fact  that supplying medical-preventive [medical and preventive care]  institutions with other types of disposable and reusable medical  instruments, that come in contact with blood is covered by the  State program of the Russian Federation for development of  modern medical equipment and increasing production thereof in  1992-1993, and for the period up to 1995, which was approved by  Decree No 77 of the government of the Russian Federation, dated  10 February 1992, ``On urgent steps to develop modern medical  equipment and increase its production in 1992-1995.'' The  program also includes matters of furnishing medical-preventive  institutions with sterilization equipment.    Fulfillment of the above volume of work would provide a  reliable level of safety of donor blood and blood preparations,  as well as medical procedures carried out at medical-preventive  institutions by 1996.    The principal executors of this section are: --Russian  Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary  and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Internal Affairs; --Russian Federation Committee for the  Chemical and Petrochemical Industry; --Russian Federation  Ministry of Finance; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics.  <H5>  Diagnosis, Treatment and Screening </H5>   AIDS detection in medical-preventive and  sanitary-epidemiological institutions will be carried out with  use of screening and corroborative diagnostic preparations,  equipment for enzyme immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction  (gene amplification method), at the rate of the need for 4  million tests per year when clinically indicated and for  screening high-risk groups.    It is planned to provide effective agents for the treatment  of patients with AIDS and opportunistic infections that are not  included in the list of vitally necessary drugs adopted by the  decree of the government of the Russian Federation dated 26  December 1991 ``On urgent measures to provide the public and  RSFSR health care institutions with drugs in 1992 and to develop  the pharmaceutical industry in 1992-1995.''    Treatment of AIDS patients will be administered at the  Russian Republic Center for AIDS Prevention and Control in the  city of Moscow, and at the clinical infectious-disease hospital  in St. Petersburg, where all types of specialized medical care  are rendered to them, as well as terminal patient care.  Treatment and screening of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS  patients will also be carried out by territorial centers for the  prevention and control of AIDS and medical-preventive  institutions in the area of their residence. Offices for  medicopsychological counseling are being organized in centers  for AIDS prevention for individuals with this pathology, their  families, as well as those in high-risk groups. Specialized  centers are being opened for children who are HIV-positive and  have AIDS.    It is also planned to set limits on State capital  investments  for construction and reconstruction of infectious-disease  hospitals, centers for AIDS prevention and control, laboratories  for AIDS detection and Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for  Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight] centers.    Implementation of these measures will have a social impact  by  1996 with respect to this category of individuals, by extending  the period of their ability to work and prolonging their lives  by 2-3 years.    The principal executors of this section are:--Russian  Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary  and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance.  <H5>  Legal and Social Safeguards </H5>   The program provides for preparation of a draft law of the  Russian Federation ``On AIDS Prevention,'' which will reflect  matters of legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS  patients, as well as matters of legal and social protection of  health care workers exposed to the risk of this infection.    There are plans for the following: --legislate steps  precluding discrimination against the sick and infected;  --payment of State benefits to individuals infected during  medical procedures; --free testing, treatment and upkeep of  HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients in health-care  institutions; --free travel of these individuals to and from  place of treatment; --priority provision of isolated housing for  individuals infectedduring medical manipulations, as well as  families with infected children up to 16 years old; --education  of children and adolescents undergoing hospital care.    There are also provisions for saving jobs for HIV-positive  individuals and AIDS patients for the duration of their testing  and treatment, with the exception of health-care workers  involved in their jobs in carrying out parenteral procedures.  Job placement is provided for this category of health-care  personnel.    As a result of implementing these measures, the legal  relationships will be regulated between the State, medical  institutions, HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, as  well as individual juridical entities, which will provide for  social and legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS  patients, as well as health-care workers and other categories of  the public.    The principal executors of this section are: --Russian  Federation Ministry of Social Protection of the Public --Russian  Federation Central Committee of the Health-Care Workers Trade  Union;--Russian Federation Ministry of Labor; --Russian  Federation Ministry of Justice; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Health; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological  Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; --Russian  Federation Ministry of Finance.  <H5>  Refinement of Epidemiological Oversight System </H5>   It is planned to elaborate a better system of  epidemiological  oversight for AIDS, including organization of monitoring of  HIV-positive and high-risk groups for this infection, laboratory  test findings and dates for such tests, reliable methods of  short- and long-term forecasts of development of an epidemic  process. There will be continued supply of computer hardware and  software to centers for AIDS prevention and centers of the State  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, as well as  telecommunication equipment, which will permit establishment of  a unified and integrated, automated information-analyzing system  on this problem, based on basic computer programs on the federal  and regional levels. There will be a revision and improvement of  the system of medical certification of the public, which calls  for the change from large-volume, epidemiologically and  economically unwarranted tests to testing samples of different  population categories and retention of the volume of tests for  individuals in high-risk and other groups.    By 1996, these measures will permit achieving higher  effectiveness in detecting sources of infection and pinpointing  sites of the disease, with concurrent reduction by 10-15 million  tests in volume of screening the public. With one test costing  50 rubles (in 1992 prices), these steps will save 500 million  rubles. Epidemiological and mathematical models will be  developed to provide high-level forecasting of epidemics and  related economic expenses.    The principal executors of this section are: --State  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight --Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences; --Russian Federation Ministry of  Health; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian  Federation Ministry of Economics.  <H5>  Research on the AIDS Problem </H5>   There is insufficient funding of research on the AIDS  problem. This program provides for carrying out research on  isolation and identification of viruses of human immune  deficiency, investigation of their biological properties,  mechanisms of interaction with cells in the body and onset of  immunodepression in HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients,  refinement and development of new diagnostic methods, optimum  treatment programs, search for new compounds and products with  specific activity, investigation of epidemiology of AIDS,  development of specific prophylactic agents, methods of  inactivating the virus in donor material and blood preparations,  methods of protecting health-care personnel, investigation of  distinctions of the epidemiological process with AIDS in  different territories, research aimed at further investigation  of symptomatology of HIV infection.    Research will be carried out within the framework of the  State research program of the Russian Federation, ``National  priorities in medicine and health care'' (Section 6 ``AIDS'').  Formulation of topics in this direction is done annually on the  basis of competition, with expert evaluation of submitted  projects.    The principal executors of this section are: --Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences; --State Committee for Sanitary and  Epidemiological Oversight;--Russian Federation Ministry of  Health; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian  Federation Ministry of Economics.  <H5>  Furnishing Information and Personnel Training </H5>   The social importance of the the AIDS problem makes it  necessary to have highly trained personnel to implement  organizational, therapeutic, prophylactic and epidemic-control  measures and to furnish them with information.    In this regard, there are plans to do the following: --add  matters of AIDS prevention to the syllabus of secondary general  educational, vocational, secondary specialized and higher  educational institutions; --train physicians and pedagogues at  institutes for advanced training and courses for advancement,  and specialists in sociopsychological counseling of HIV-positive  individuals and AIDS patients at the Republic Institute for  Advanced Training of Educators and its affiliates; --train  leaders for youth organizations and activists in high-risk  groups at territorial centers for AIDS prevention; --train  researchers and clinical health-care specialists in the leading  specialized research institutions of the Russian Federation (50  people per year) and abroad (5 per year).    It is also planned to publish relevant scientific and  educational literature (monographs, topical surveys,  collections, textbooks, guides, etc.) and to subscribe to the  principal international scientific periodicals dealing with AIDS.    These measures will make it possible to train highly  qualified personnel to administer specialized medical care and,  at the same time, improve efficiency of the entire system of  health care, education and information on this problem.    The principal executors of this section are: --State  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian  Federation Ministry of Health; --Russian Academy of Medical  Sciences; --Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and  Information --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics;  --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance.  <H5>  Management and Mechanism of Implementation of the Program </H5>   The effectiveness of implementation of this program will  depend largely on constant and integral evaluation of its  progress and subsequent correction (if necessary).    For this purpose, there are the following provisions, to:  --appoint program administrators and organize coordinating  councils on the federal and regional levels; --carry out  independent integral evaluation of research and measures, with  appropriate correction of the program.    The program will be implemented through the existing network  of AIDS-prevention institutions and the State Committee for  Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, on the basis of work  plans of executor organizations. There are also plans to develop  and implement regional programs with approval of their funding  in pertinent State agencies of republics of the Russian  Federation, autonomous oblasts, autonomous okrugs, krays,  oblasts, cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg.    It is planned to implement international collaboration with  the World Health Organization, within the framework of the  global program for AIDS control, and other international  organizations.    Funding of this program from the federal budget is provided  in an amount of 12.42 billion rubles and $20.85 million,  including 6.52 billion rubles and $8.25 million in 1993. Of  these amounts, limits of State centralized capital investments  funded by the federal budget and investment credit will  constitute 4.1 billion rubles for 1993.    According to estimates, 96.8 billion rubles, including 32.24  billion for 1993, will be needed to implement measures to  provide medical-preventive institutions of the Russian  Federation with medical instruments (reusable syringes and  needles, disposable catheters), sterilizers and laboratory  equipment, protective gear for medical personnel, social and  legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients.    The functions of State contractors are delegated to the  State  Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight and Russian  Federation Ministry of Health.</p>

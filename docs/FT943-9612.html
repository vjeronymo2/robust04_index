			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Observer: Ryrie rules So the City of London has a soul after all - though it is perhaps something of a pity that it takes a disaster of Rwandan proportions to stir it. An extremely pukka collection of financiers have appended their names to the City of London Emergency Rwanda Appeal (COLERA), launched yesterday and chaired by Sir William Ryrie, former boss of the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank. The target is to pull in Pounds 1m over the next fortnight. 'City people are not always what they seem,' says Ryrie, who has mostly found himself pushing on an open door. Fully alive to the criticisms of aid donations not reaching their targets, Ryrie has asked for progress reports from the charities concerned which, he adds, will be a 'good discipline' for them, too. Cheques, please, payable to COLERA (Rwanda)/DEC, and addressed to Disasters Emergency Committee, 17 Grove Lane, London SE5 8RD.</p>

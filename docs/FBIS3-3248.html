For the last  10 years, they have developed goods for civilian use,  transformed projects, and developed nearly 1,000 major import  substitutes by making use of techniques for the manufacture of  rocket engines. Twenty percent of their innovations were unique  in the country or filled in the gaps in the fields of science  and technology.    The research institute concentrated on developing the key  components, projects, and major equipment for the petrochemical,  metallurgical, light, and textile industries which China  previously had to import from abroad. It utilized technologies  for the manufacture of rocket engines, including vacuum [zhen  kong 4176 4500], automatic control, heat exchange, special  pumping [te zhong beng fa 3676 4429 3119 7042], and electronic  quantitative [dian zi ji liang 7193 1311 6060 6852]  technologies, and others. The safety valve needed for the  equipment imported by the petrochemical department had been seen  as an item that could not be manufactured in China, with the  result that the state had to spend millions of U.S. dollars in  importing the valve from abroad every year. During the "Seventh  Five-Year Plan," however, the research institute, with the  assistance of the China National Chemicals Import and Export  Corporation and of customers, developed 10,000 valves in 300  varieties, with 2,000 specifications. These valves were as good  as or even better than their imported counterparts in terms of  quality. The research institute is now the only unit in the  country that can manufacture high-speed pumps for civilian use.  Therefore, the institute was declared by the State Science and  Technology Commission as China's engineering development center  for special pump valves.    Earlier, the institute carried out reforms designed to  quickly transform science and technology into productive forces,  and to adapt its scientific and technological products to market  needs. Out of the nine research laboratories under the  institute, three were still responsible for developing "defense  products," and the remaining six were committed to developing  civilian items. About 500 science and technology workers were  sent to all quarters across the country to gather information  and seek out markets, and they obtained a steady flow of orders  for various civilian items. They now have set up close  partnership relations with enterprises -- large petrochemical  enterprises, in particular -- in more than 20 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions. Since 1990, the  institute's output value has grown by 20 percent annually.</p>

It  has also refused to allow electioneering in the state, and to  allow monitoring of the election process. The Bophuthatswana  government refused to cooperate with the IEC at a meeting  between the two parties at Mmabatho this morning.  Bophuthatswana said that the IEC request would amount to  acceptance of South Africa's nonrecognition of its sovereignty.    Meanwhile the streets of Mmabatho were the scene of further  unrest this morning as clashes between Bophuthatswana police and  striking public servants continued. Our reporter in Mmabatho  said the town had been calm until midmorning when a long  motorcade of protesters moved through the streets. Protesters  were joined by students when they passed the university. Police  in armored vehicles then moved in and fired tear gas.    In another incident South African Police stationed at the  embassy in the capital had to intervene when an explosive  situation developed between Bophuthatswana police and striking  teachers outside the embassy building. The Bophuthatswana  broadcasting center has been closed as a result of the strike by  broadcasting workers.</p>

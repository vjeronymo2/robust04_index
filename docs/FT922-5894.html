			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru makes start on mine privatisation programme PRIVATISATION OF the Peruvian mining sector got off to a steady but unspectacular start when the first wholly state-owned mine was sold by stock exchange auction in Lima. Condestable, a copper mine located some 70 miles south of the capital, fetched USDollars 1.29m, about two-thirds of its book value. The shares, belonging to MineroPeru, were sold as one lot and comprised around 80 per cent of the total. The remaining 20 per cent had been distributed to workers under long-standing statutory provisions. There had been wide initial interest in Tuesday's sale, with half a dozen potential purchasers, including Marc Rich and the Peruvian Hochschild group, which owns mines in the area. But only two bidders emerged on the day - one of them, according to stock market brokers, representing Chilean investors. The name of the eventual purchaser was not disclosed. Mining executives say Condestable went cheaply. Even last year, with an exceptionally unfavourable exchange rate and soaring local costs, it remained one of a handful of Peruvian mines - and the only one owned by the state - to notch up a small profit. Miners say its potential is excellent although new investment is required. The auction mechanism, however, was agreed to have been a success. Mr Jose Almenara, stock exchange general manager, said it had worked exactly as anticipated, ensuring the true market value of the company was reached. 'With all the problems surrounding investment in Peru at this particular moment, it was a reasonable price,' he said. MineroPeru has a list of other companies coming up for sale in the near future. Mr Raul Otero, who presides over its privatisation committee, said that debt-for-equity swaps would be an 'essential' mechanism for future privatisation. At the same time, in New York, Mines Minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, was telling businessmen and bankers at the Americas Society that 'all state companies will be privatised, whatever the price we obtain'.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Chance to break free of the hordes LUXURY TRAVEL is not for everyone, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. First-class tickets. Executive helicopters. Private islands. Toffs' safaris. Exotic playmates. If these things make you feel guilty or uncomfortable, then you are part of mass travel - the happy, cut-price hordes. But there are times of the year when even those of modest means and limited social achievement can discover whether they have any sort of talent for luxury travel. At present, anxious to drum up business, even the world's grandest hotels are launching seasonal offers to encourage business. A good example is Orient-Express Hotels, one of the world's best hotel companies, which has a dozen properties. At peak times these hotels are way beyond the reach of those of common purse. But from now until late autumn, all sorts of people are welcome to try them. Orient-Express recently produced its first-ever brochure of seasonal offers. Take the Hotel Cipriani in Venice, probably its most famous hotel, located on its own private island, Giudecca, a short cruise by private launch from St Mark's Square. I stayed there six years ago and was charged Pounds 19 for a cup of tea and sliver of fruit cake. The shock knocked me over. Between October 10 and November 7, however, the Cipriani is offering double-room accommodation and breakfast (Sunday to Thursday nights only) at Pounds 102 per person, a fraction of its normal charge. The Cipriani's food is outstanding, but unless you are extremely rich you will find it essential to do what I did: take the launch to St Mark's and eat in town. Other low-season deals at Orient-Express properties include: Mount Nelson Hotel, Cape Town, South Africa: six nights' double accommodation with breakfast, Pounds 307 per person, until October 31. Great views of Table Mountain. Excellent gardens and swimming pool. Reasonably eccentric (always a good sign). The Lodge at Vail, Colorado, US: three nights' double accommodation with breakfast, Pounds 161 per person, June 12-30 and September 1-October 3. I am not a skier. I find it rather common. But last June I stayed at The Lodge and enjoyed it considerably: no snow, perfect weather, tennis, horse-back riding, walking in the mountains. Observatory Hotel, Sydney, Australia, close to the harbour: three nights' double accommodation, Pounds 193 per person, until September 1. Welcome Hotel &amp; Golf Course, Stratford-on-Avon: double accommodation from Pounds 50 per person per night, including breakfast, various dates in August and winter. This is one of the nicest, best-located country-mansion hotels in England. It is a mile or so outside Stratford, on the road to Warwick, and is set in 157 acres of parkland, lakes and formal Italian gardens. Stay three nights and you get a free round of golf. Another upmarket company that is offering seasonal discounts is the much larger Inter-Continental Hotels, which recently unveiled savings of up to 60 per cent in 39 European properties. The programme runs from today until September 12, with rates starting at Pounds 65 at the Forum Hotel, Berlin, and Pounds 85 at the Castellana Inter-Continental, Madrid. The rate buys you a luxury double room any day of the week, breakfast for two and all taxes and service charges, payable in local currency. In Europe, participating hotels include the Amstel in Amsterdam, the Grand in Paris, the Churchill in London (Inter-Continental's most recent European acquisition; it has five in the UK all told), De La Ville in Rome, Carlton in Cannes, Ritz in Lisbon, Athenaeum in Athens and Forum in Budapest. Rates at the last-named are from Pounds 89 per night. Aside from Europe, discounts will be available this summer in virtually all Inter-Continental and Forum hotels in Asia and the Pacific, Latin and north America, and in parts of the Middle East and Africa. Orient-Express and Inter-Continental are only two of a number of upmarket hotel groups world-wide. The latest Relais &amp; Chateaux guide, for example, covers 411 independent hotels and restaurants in 40 countries.

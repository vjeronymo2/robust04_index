The current regulation requires that an attorney's certification be obtained for every long-term mortgage loan in order for that loan to qualify as collateral for FCS debt obligations. The regulation is being amended because title insurance has become the prevailing method used by the mortgage lending industry to ensure clear title. Additionally, the revised regulation permits FCS institutions greater flexibility in determining which method for validating first lien position (an attorney's certification or title insurance) provides the institution the most cost-effective and efficient protection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulation shall become effective upon expiration of 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  during which either or both Houses of Congress are in session.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.10(a)(2) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (Act), requires that long-term mortgage loans made by Farm Credit Banks (FCBs) under section 1.7 of the Act, or by associations under sections 1.7 and 7.6 of the Act, ``be secured by first liens on interests in real estate of such classes as may be prescribed by regulations of the Farm Credit Administration.'' At present, &sect;615.5060 requires that an attorney's certification be obtained for long-term mortgage loans if such loans are to qualify as collateral for FCS debt obligations. However, title insurance is the prevailing method for ensuring clear title in the mortgage lending industry and is becoming more commonplace in FCS lending. Title insurance can provide a lender with protection that is comparable to an attorney's certification and in some instances may be more timely and less expensive to obtain. Under the present &sect;615.5060, even if FCS lenders obtain title insurance they must also obtain an attorney's certification, thus incurring unnecessary expense without providing any substantial additional protection. FCA reconsidered this requirement, and published a proposed rule on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52701) to amend the regulation to permit institutions to obtain title insurance instead of an attorney's certificate to document the existence of a first lien, provided that the title insurance policy meets certain standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA recognizes that practices within the mortgage lending industry continually change and is amending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;615.5060 to give FCS institutions additional flexibility while maintaining protection for them as well as for FCS investors and borrower-stockholders. The revised regulation allows FCS institutions to determine which method for validating first lien position (an attorney's certification or title insurance) provides them the best protection for the amount expended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Synopsis of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period for the proposed amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;615.5060 closed November 12, 1993. FCA received four comment letters during the public comment period from: The Farm Credit Council (FCC), a Farm Credit Bank (FCB), an agricultural credit association (ACA), and a Texas law firm. In addition, an FCB and a Federal land credit association (FLCA) commented on this regulation as part of their responses to the FCA Board's Statement on Regulatory Burden, which appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003), seeking public comment on the appropriateness of regulatory requirements imposed on the FCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All commenters strongly supported the amendments to the proposed regulation. In general, commenters believe that the revision would provide additional flexibility and allow FCS institutions to evaluate present practices and determine the best course of action. Further, commenters indicated that since many FCS institutions already require title insurance on real estate loans the proposed regulation would greatly simplify the closing process and reduce costs. One commenter stated that the FCA's existing requirement for long-term real estate loans is both antiquated and unduly burdensome, and it therefore fully endorsed the intent of FCA's proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

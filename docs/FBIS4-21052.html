On 20 February, La Paz PRESENCIA, a Catholic  Church-owned center-left daily, published a special report  entitled "The Chiapas Syndrome, Vaccine Sought Urgently," which  reviewed the Indian uprising in Mexico and commented on the  possibility of it occurring in Bolivia. The report included  interviews with Bolivian Vice President Hugo Cardenas,  sociologist Javier Hurtado, and Free Bolivia Movement (MBL)  deputy Miguel Urioste. All three expressed sympathy for Indian  and peasant demands and urged that they be addressed through  democratic processes, not armed struggle. To this end they are  promoting the government's current reform programs.    In the PRESENCIA interview Vice President Hugo Cardenas,  Bolivia's first Indian official at that level, described the  recent events in Mexico as "worrisome" for Bolivia the "lack of  solidarity with the poor could pave the way for a Chiapas-style  guerrilla uprising." "We Indians have shed the most blood in the  struggle against injustice," he explained, "and we are fed up."  He also pointed out that "the arrival of an Indian to the vice  presidency doesn't mean that prejudice and injustice have ceased  to exist." Cardenas argued that the problems resulting from  "political and social exclusion"--lack of education and health  services, low salaries, unequal land distribution, migration to  the cities, and poverty in general--"should have been solved by  now" and that these topics "should be the most important issues  on the continent's political agenda." Instead, he noted, the  first steps are just being taken, after 169 years, to  incorporate the "approximately 42 percent of Bolivian society,"  previously excluded from the decisionmaking processes of the  state, into the political system. Cardenas expressed confidence  that the "mentality of commitment" now prevailing among the  power elites in Bolivia would lead the way for the  transformation of Bolivia from a "democracy of minorities" into  a "multiethnic and pluricultural democracy." These steps must be  taken, he insisted, "so that a Chiapas does not occur here."    Miguel Urioste, leader of Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) that  is  part of the government coalition, and director of TIERRA  (Workshop for Initiatives in Rural Research and Agrarian  Reform), agreed with Vice President Cardenas that Indians and  peasants in Chiapas and Bolivia experienced similar conditions.  However, Urioste told PRESENCIA that, although Bolivian Indian  and peasant groups are now "awakening," they are not opting for  radical or destructive measures but are increasingly proposing  "constructive solutions" to their problems. Urioste mentioned  that among the solutions sought by the government, the most  essential are a redistribution of public investment and a more  equitable reallocation of resources toward rural areas to give  the people more say in political and administrative decison  making. In addition, with the goal of eliminating unproductive  large estates (latifundios), his party has also been promoting a  second agrarian reform, more aggressive than that which was  carried out under the first Agrarian Reform Act of 1953. These  solutions are embodied in the draft Popular Participation Law, a  complex and controversial law which is part of President Sanchez  de Lozada's reform package. Urioste felt optimistic that the law  would "substantially modify society's representational  structures." For example, he explained, 300 rural municipalities  would be created, comprising 12,145 peasant and Indian  communities. "For the first time in Bolivia's history," these  communities would have legal jurisdiction and their elected  traditional authorities would also be legally recognized. The  newly created municipalities "would receive 19 percent of  Treasury tax revenues" to directly administer and manage the  communities' education and health centers, as well as the  irrigation systems, construction projects, and road networks. He  stressed that an important provision of the law would require  that resources be allocated to regions according to number of  inhabitants, thereby eliminating previous "imbalances." Urioste  said that "although centuries of poverty could not be eliminated  in one or four years," he was confident that "we are still in  time to correct the mistakes and prevent a rude awakening of  Bolivia's Indian people."    Bolivian sociologist Javier Hurtado, in his comments to  PRESENCIA, observed that in Bolivia despite the reforms brought  about by the 1952 Revolution, things have changed little for the  peasants. "The struggle for land remains a central theme," he  explained, and "racial discrimination is still strongly rooted."  He also believes that the present economic system has only  served to "accentuate the polarization of poverty versus  opulence" in the country, and that this could lead to a  Chiapas-like situation. "To alleviate this tension," he said,  Bolivians should "start thinking about repeating an April 1952  Revolution with significant reforms," as well as "correcting the  technical errors of the first Agrarian Reform of 1953."    Concern that the Chiapas uprising could be repeated in  Bolivia, especially in the Chapare region of Cochabamba  Department, was expressed in various issues of the Cochabamba  daily LOS TIEMPOS. The government there had been carrying out a  program of limited forced coca eradication in compliance with  "Law 1008," which requires the eradication of one hectare of  coca for every cocaine maceration pit found in the area. These  actions, opposed by coca growers, led to violence in early March  between the growers and special eradication forces. According to  the 3 March issue of LOS TIEMPOS, Evo Morales, leader of the  coca growers' confederation, issued an "official" statement on 2  March threatening violent resistance similar to the Chiapas  uprising if "the government does not cease its forced  eradication of these crops." The 9 March LOS TIEMPOS reported  that President Sanchez de Lozada admitted that the country was a  "time bomb," and, according to the same daily, the Bishop of La  Paz, Monsignor Luis Sainz, said that the Church sided with the  peasants in opposing the forced destruction of coca crops, and  that "before eradicating coca, the government should eradicate  poverty."    A 20 February commentary in LOS TIEMPOS by Jose Luis Roca,  entitled "Symptoms of Social Instability in the Chapare,"  observed that "in Bolivia, the Chapare area could become the  epicenter of serious social conflict." The Chapare, he  continued, "is like a boiling cauldron that hasn't yet exploded  only because of its pressure valves, which are the relative  freedom to grow and market coca leaf." The commentator noted  that the situation in the Chapare is potentially more volatile  than that in Mexico because in Chiapas, at least, "a trained  people's army conducts negotiations on an equal basis with its  government (which raises hope for a negotiated solution)." In  the Chapare, he continued, "there is the risk of collective  suicide because the peasants' reactions are totally irrational,  motivated only by desperation and hunger." The author feared  that drug traffickers could exploit any unrest to perpetrate  "horrible actions in our country," like the ones which "have  plunged Peru and Colombia into a bloodbath."    A 1 March editorial in LOS TIEMPOS entitled "Violence in the  Chapare" echoes previously expressed concerns and asserts that  "eradication of coca bushes is only carried out when it is  necessary to make a gesture to obtain economic aid from foreign  governments." The Chapare, noted the editorial, could become a  chronic area of conflict," as long as the government is  incapable of formulating a "general policy on coca and drug  trafficking that truly meets long-term national interests rather  than short-term party interests."    According to La Paz Television Nacional Network on 26 March,  an agreement was finally reached in which the government  promised to desist from any forced eradication. The coca growers  believe this agreement represents a victory for them, and the  government believes the agreement "will ensure peace and the  implementation of alternative development in the coca-producing  regions."</p>

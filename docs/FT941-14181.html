			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Arts: Brecht's fragmentary Fatzer Material - Theatre Fatzer, the hero of a play that Brecht neither published nor finished, is an innocent non-conformist. Not that he is eccentric. Simply, he insists, 'I can't go on doing what is fine for me and does harm to you'; and a choral commentator remarks that he is not a 'mind-of-the-masses man'. Yes, an archetypal Brecht hero; and his dissent links him to other such heroes of German drama as Woyzeck. All around him you see society at its most brutish. Evil flowers naturally; sex is an unfeeling and animal function; aggression is everywhere. After Brecht's death, the 'Fatzer' fragments were arranged into a montage by the German playwright Heiner Muller, and now the Gate Theatre is presenting them as translated and directed by Marc von Henning. The main impression this version leaves, however, is not of content but style. The play has seven performers. At any time in the action, two or three of them are standing at lecterns on the periphery of the stage. They don spectacles, and at regular intervals chant a kind of chorale that either tells us what will happen or comments on what did happen. Sometimes their text sounds Biblical, sometimes like a Greek chorus, sometimes in word-cycles almost worthy of Gertrude Stein. But they chant it like Daleks. Brechtian humanity is missing. Meanwhile the scenes that occur in the centre of the stage show us society reduced to its most empty. Men, when asked where they have come from, answer 'Wherever we've come from, think of it as Hell's backyard.' When one woman says to another 'Have you no shame?', the other replies 'How would I know? I haven't had it touched in years.' Everyone seems to be commenting on themselves even while they are in the middle of things. Brechtian irony is never absent. But the text keeps drawing attention to its own literary style  -'I am to them a foot, no more,/ That dangles from its ankle, dead . . .' - and the actors keep end-stopping in mid-sentence to show us how Brecht's language consists of lines. There are also expressionist effects that strike me as un-Brechtian. The set is composed of barren earth. Early on, the two women are seen lying, immobile and face down, on this earth; when they make efforts to rise, they promptly fall back splat to the ground. This obvious metaphor, straight out of the German movement theatre of such people as Pina Bausch - as are the heeled shoes the women wear - is too leaden to succeed in Brecht, as are several other heavy symbols. Should Brechtian theatre be alienating to this degree? And should alienation be this boring? For oh, this production keeps hitting you like a dull cosh - for 90 minutes, with no interval. The seven actors belong to Primitive Science, a company founded by von Henning last year and focusing on 20th-century European theatre. The production makes you feel less like a theatregoer than a student. At the Gate Theatre, W11. Ends February 5.</p>

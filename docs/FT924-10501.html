			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador maps out its future path - The government's moves to boost reserves and exports WITH AN aggressive agenda to revitalise Ecuador's oil industry, the new reform-minded government of president Sixto Duran Ballen is seeking to boost its petrol production and increase its oil reserves over the next few years. Also, with the aid of foreign investors, Ecuador is seeking to secure its status as an oil-exporting country into the next millennium. Behind Ecuador's recent announcement to abandon membership of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries by next year lies, above all, its intention to increase its petrol production beyond the current limit of 273,000 barrels imposed by Opec. Already Ecuador's daily production hovers around 320,000 barrels, of which about 200,000 barrels are destined for the export market. The country is seeking to increase its production to 470,000 b/d in 1993 and to 576,000 b/d by 1996. 'We have nothing against Opec, but we need more freedom in our production, at least for the next four years,' declared Mr Andres Barreiro, the minister of energy and mining. Pressure to increase oil production mounted steadily as the country's oil revenues threatened to fall short of the projections for this year. The 1992 fiscal budget was calculated at an estimated price of USDollars 17 a barrel for the national crude oil 'Oriente'. In fact, the price in the first eight months averaged USDollars 16.28 a barrel. With the already increased production, then, Petroecuador exported in the first six months of this year 32.3m barrels of crude oil, worth USDollars 527.8m. Petroecuador has long-term contracts for the sale of 210,000 b/d of crude. Also, it has two contracts to sell 12,000 barrels of petrol to Clarendon and Tricentrol, each lasting one year. In an effort to maintain the country's oil reserves, which currently amount to 1.46bn barrels, Ecuador is planning to explore new fields in its mineral-rich Amazon region. The reserves have not been augmented for many years. Mr Barreiro criticised the former government of not having secured 'one single contract for exploration, as a result of which the reserves did not increase, but actually were depleted year by year'. He added that if Ecuador did not increase its oil reserves now, the country would have to begin importing petrol in 10 to 12 years. The proposal to increase the country's production and oil reserves follows a study by the US government's General Accounting Office, which predicted a steady decline in crude oil production over the next years. The study also suggested an annual investment of USDollars 150m into the national petrol industry. For that reason the government is seeking to attract foreign investors. International bidding for contracts to explore oil fields, scheduled for next year, has already attracted the interest of companies from the UK, France, the US, Italy and Indonesia. Officials here anticipate that the areas offered to foreign companies for exploration, each covering about 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres), will be near the current oil wells of Lago Agrio, about 180 km (110 miles) north-east of Quito. Foreign and national capital are to be subject to the same regulations. Says Mr Barreiro: 'All companies that partake in the bidding will have the same rights. Nobody, including Petroecuador, will have advantages to certain areas'. He added that all companies showing interest were seeking to produce as well as explore. Ecuador's forward-looking oil policy may well be a result of lessons learnt from the experiences of its northern neighbour. As domestic demand for petrol in Colombia rose above its production capacity, the country ceased to be an oil exporter and became an importer. A series of investments and contracted aid reversed that trend and in 1986 Colombia once again began exporting oil. Ecuador's plan to abandon Opec membership and boost production has been greeted with considerable domestic scepticism, however. According to Mr Raul Jaramillo, former director of Cepe, the previously joint private-public oil corporation, Ecuador will not be able to double its production in three years. 'The country lacks sufficient investors to enable the necessary exploitation of the oil fields,' he commented. Mr Rene Ortiz, former secretary general of Opec, adds that the industry's infrastructure is insufficient for the planned increase in output. He points out that, in the middle and long term, production could be increased just enough to offset the decreasing output from the ageing oil wells currently being exploited. As a result, says Mr Ortiz, future production is likely to average about 300,000 b/d, plus or minus 10 per cent. In the past six years several foreign companies, including British Gas, Esso Hispanoil, Belco II, Texaco Pecten and Petrocanada have left Ecuador because they were unsuccessful in finding crude oil. Yet the present government is not only seeking to increase its oil reserves, but also to cut costs and make current production more efficient. According to Mr Barreira, the huge state-owned corporation Petroecuador has serious personnel and management problems. 'Ever since the consortium of Petroecuador and Texaco was fully turned over to the state, the situation has worsened - although the technicians remain the same,' the minister complained. He proposed to the president that Petroecuador be totally restructured.  ---------------------------------------- ECUADORIAN OIL PRODUCTION  ----------------------------------------         Barrels   Proportion of          a day     Opec output  ---------------------------------------- 1988    315,000      1.60% 1989    300,000      1.38% 1990    290,000      1.26% 1991    285,000      1.22% 1992*   293,000      1.26%  ---------------------------------------- *First quarter.  ---------------------------------------- Source: Kleinwort Benson Securities.  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Magdeburg -- According to the public prosecutor,  the attack by right-wing radicals on the Marietta bar in  Magdeburg on 12 May was planned. The personnel received a  corresponding hint before 12 May but did not inform the police,  Saxony-Anhalt Senior Public Prosecutor Juergen Hossfeld told  journalists in Magdeburg today. Five black Africans fled to the  bar after being brutally beaten and chased through the streets  by about 60 right-wing radicals.    One day before the riots, the Federal Office for the  Protection of the Constitution warned the police against attacks  by right-wing extremists. Interior and Justice Minister Walter  Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) stressed that there was no  reason to assume that the suspicions of the Federal Office for  the Protection of the Constitution would come true.</p>

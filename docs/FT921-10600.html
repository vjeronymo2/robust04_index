			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / FBI probes Citicorp bug claim THE FBI is examining tapes of conversations inside the executive offices of Citicorp's Manhattan headquarters recorded by an outside security consultant who claims he has evidence there was a bugging system in the building. Citicorp yesterday strongly denied there had been any eavesdropping system inside the bank, but confirmed that in mid-December of last year the recordings were brought to the attention of Mr Richard Braddock, Citicorp's president. The bank said yesterday that it was approached in December by the New York-based consultant, Mr Tony Gattilo, who said he had evidence of bugging. Mr Gattilo said yesterday that last autumn he began picking up radio transmissions of conversations at Citicorp concerning leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and real estate loans. Mr Gattilo said he was conducting a scan for another client for possible bugs at a building near Citicorp's Park Avenue headquarters. The incident highlights the security problems facing large corporate institutions in an era of sophisticated electronic monitoring devices. A former Citibank employee, acting as an intermediary for Mr Gattilo, brought the matter to Mr Braddock's attention on December 11. Two days later a meeting was arranged between Mr Gattilo and Mr John Cosenza, the head of Citicorp security. Mr Gattilo said that some of the transmissions came from a bug in the office of Mr William Comfort, a senior vice-president of the bank who is chairman of the Citicorp venture capital division. Other transmissions, concerning real estate and other subjects, came from the bank's adjacent Citicorp Center building on Lexington Avenue. Both Mr Gattilo and Citicorp agree that the transmissions from Mr Comfort's office ended just before the December 13 meeting. Citicorp said it had conducted an extensive investigation and had concluded there was no bugging system at the bank.</p>

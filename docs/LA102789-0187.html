			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LIN ENRICHES MERGER PLANS  </P> <P> LIN Broadcasting Corp. said today it has revised its plans to merge its  cellular telephone operations with BellSouth Corp. in a move evidently designed  to thwart a buyout bid by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.  </P> <P> The announcement provides another twist in what has already proven to be a  contorted series of moves begun last June when McCaw launched an unsolicited  takeover bid for LIN, a New York-based cellular telephone and television  company.  </P> <P> LIN offered no estimate of the value of its revised plan.  </P> <P> However, under the new proposal LIN said it intends to give its shareholders a  special cash dividend of $42 per share before the merger of cellular  operations, up from a $20 per share cash dividend under an earlier plan.  </P> <P> LIN said it was able to pay a higher dividend because BellSouth, the regional  telephone company based in Atlanta, agreed to contribute more assets to the  merger of cellular interests than originally envisioned.  </P></p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / EC funds may pave way for farm deal GERMANY has suggested chan-nelling European Community funds to French farmers to win France's support for an agreement cutting farm subsidies in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. The suggestion came ahead of today's resumption of the long dormant Uruguay Round talks in Geneva, at which negotiators from the Quad countries - the US, the EC, Japan and Canada - will brief trading partners on their tariff-cutting deal reached at last week's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said at the Tokyo meeting that financial concessions could play an important role in winning 'one European Community partner' for an agreement on agricultural trade. The German minister did not name France in his remarks to journalists. However, French objections are holding up an EC-US agreement on reducing subsidies in agricultural trade that could form the basis of further international negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Rexrodt said he considered that farm trade problems would prove to be the 'sticking point' in reaching a final pact on global trade liberalisation. He believed that problems of agricultural trade could be dealt with through a financial agreement that would enable 'an EC partner country' to overcome structural and regional problems more easily than at present. He admitted there would be less money available for other EC countries if Community funds were used to compensate farmers in one state for losses arising from a deal on farm trade. Mr Rexrodt stressed that he was close to the Gatt talks, partly because Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, had several times approached Germany to mediate in disputes between the US and France.

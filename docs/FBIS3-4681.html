Touching on the Japan-U.S.  economic friction at the news conference, Mr. Okamatsu said:  "For Japan, the biggest issue is to achieve the economic growth  driven by domestic demand." He also indicated that Japan needs  to adopt a new macro policy to cut its current account surplus  in addition to the four-point measure including deregulation  under consideration by the government to open the Japanese  market.    Referring to the automobile and auto parts sector on which  both Japan and the United States have negotiated under the  Japan-U.S. framework talks, the MITI deputy minister said: "The  time has come for Japanese enterprises to make their own  judgment to address trade imbalance between Japan and the United  States."

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC POLITICIANS ASSAIL CARDINAL'S ABORTION THREAT  </P> <P> Prominent Catholic politicians who support abortion rights have vowed to stand  firm on the issue despite an "intimidating" statement from Cardinal John J.  O'Connor that they could face excommunication.  </P> <P> "I think this type of language is intemperate, mean-spirited and in contempt of  Christian and Catholic belief," said Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), whose  invitation to speak at a Catholic high school commencement was recently  rescinded by the archdiocese because of his support for legal abortion.  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo termed O'Connor's warning "upsetting . . . disconcerting."  </P> <P> "The church leadership, led by the cardinal, the College of Cardinals and the  Pope -- we defer to them, respect them and let them speak for certain  authority," said Cuomo, who opposes abortion.  </P> <P> "But I'm a layman, and I speak for myself. It's about people having the choice  in our democracy and the freedom to have the choice. I have not changed my  mind, nor will I."  </P> <P> Cuomo's comments were made in response to O'Connor's warning, which appeared  Thursday in the weekly newspaper of the Archdiocese of New York.  </P> <P> "Where Catholics are perceived not only as treating church teaching on abortion  with contempt, but helping to multiply abortions by advocating legislation  supporting abortion, or by making public funds available for abortion, bishops  may decide that . . . such Catholics must be warned that they are at risk of  excommunication," O'Connor said.  </P> <P> Excommunication, the most powerful punishment that the church can impose, cuts  Catholics off from the sacraments, with the exception of penance.  </P></p>

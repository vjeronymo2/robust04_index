			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated US Treasuries slip on lack of support LONG-DATED US bond prices continued to decline as investors and dealers sold in reaction to news of improving economic growth. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 101 13/16 , yielding 6.112 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note rose 1/32 to 99 1/2 , yielding 4.123 per cent. After posting big declines earlier in the week on news of a strengthening economy, prices opened little changed but the absence of any buyers in early trading meant longer-dated prices soon slipped lower on lack of support. Traders said activity was light, with investors mostly on the sidelines until the Treasury announced the breakdown of its November refunding round. Trading was also hamstrung by the unwillingness of participants to get too involved ahead of the October jobs report, due tomorrow. In the event, the refunding announcement passed with little excitement, and longer-dated prices actually recovered slightly after the big three car makers announced weaker than expected sales figures. THE GERMAN bond market ended little changed, after the Bundesbank disappointed traders by reducing the minimum repo rate by just one basis point. German traders had been hoping for at least a three basis point cut. The lowest accepted rate for 13-day funds dropped to 6.39 per cent after last week's 6.40 per cent. 'The Bundesbank is not going to cut rates aggressively, and traders have to come to terms with that,' said one analyst. The market's uninspiring performance yesterday, following a rally in the last few days, gave other European markets a chance to regain some ground. ITALY was the day's star performer, with bond futures up a full point. Bond prices recovered some, but not all, of the ground they have lost in the last week. 'Short-term budget concerns are fading and long-term political concerns are on hold,' said Mr Kit Jukes, an international economist at SG Warburg, who added that political concerns are bound to resurface later. DANISH bond prices rose about  1/4 point, following a  1/4 point cut in the discount rate to 7 per cent. Dealers are expecting a repo rate cut to follow today. The rate cut helped renew hopes that further easing elsewhere in Europe is on the way. FRENCH bonds ended virtually unchanged, failing make up any ground against Germany, ahead of today's auction of the French Treasury's new benchmark 10-year bond. Dealers said the Danish rate cut had added to frustration over the French government's failure to cut rates. 'The franc is relatively strong,' said Ms Marie Owens-Thomsen, international strategist at Midland Global Markets. 'There is plenty of scope for the French authorities to move without even beginning to assert an independent policy (from the Germans).' She believes that there is 'a distinct possibility' of a rate cut next week, but warns that, while the short end of the market stands to benefit, long-dated bonds are not likely to gain much ground. 'People are starting to lock in profits (on the long end of the bond market), as we move into the end of year,' she said, causing the yield curve to steepen. SWEDISH bond yields fell 10 - 15 basis points yesterday, as traders welcomed the appointment of Mr Urban Baeckstroem as governor of the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank. Mr Baeckstroem, who takes office at the start of next year, is viewed as favouring faster interest rate reductions than the current central bank governor, Mr Bengt Dennis. Swedish money market rates also fell on the news. GILT prices ended more than  1/4 point higher yesterday, encouraged by the stronger US Treasuries market. Tuesday's Bank of England inflation report suggesting a potential rise in inflation beyond the government's targets had little impact on the market. Dealers said that the report did not rule out further easing of rates around the time of the Budget on November 30.</p>

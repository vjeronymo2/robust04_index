			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Lang quits as MP over poll expenses Mr Jack Lang, the flamboyant former French arts minister who was one of the most prominent figures in the previous socialist government, was yesterday forced to relinquish his parliamentary seat for spending too much on his campaign in the March legislative elections. The French constitutional council ordered Mr Lang, 54, a friend of President Francois Mitterrand to resign immediately his seat at Loir-et-Cher after finding he had exceeded by FFr90,000 (Pounds 10,285) the FFr500,000 maximum French MPs are allowed for campaign expenses. A by-election will be held within three months. Mr Lang, deputy prime minister and education minister in the previous socialist administration, vowed to return to politics as soon as possible. The constitutional council has banned him from standing for parliament for a year.</p>

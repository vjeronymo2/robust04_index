During his address, Paleokrassas, a Greek conservative  politician who was twice a minister in his country, outlined the  main aspects of the EU's new environmental policy. He said that  this seeks to banish the idea of industrial production based on  the depletion of natural resources and replace it with a  principle aimed at protecting and safeguarding this natural  heritage for future generations. He also stressed that  protection of the environment should not be just a policy in  itself but should be a precondition for industrial expansion.    ``The new course in environmental policy (the Commission's  white paper) is that economic and fiscal means should be used,  instead of having recourse to the old methods of legislation and  controls,'' among other reasons, ``because it has been seen that  this is not effective,'' Paleokrassas told this newspaper. To  this effect, the commissioner favored the view that products  should include the environmental cost stemming from the natural  resources which they deplete, the pollution which they produce,  or the waste which they create.    Within this same strategy, he supported the EU Commission's  decision to impose ecological taxes in order to increase the  cost of using energy sources which cause carbon dioxide  emissions, as a way to alleviate the greenhouse effect. He said  that unless this method is used, the volume of carbon dioxide  emissions would not be stabilized at the 1990 levels, which the  EU had set itself as an overall target. ``If the carbon dioxide  tax is not adopted, studies show us that it would exceed the  1990 levels by 3 percent in the year 2000,'' he warned.    To the same effect, he supported Jacques Delors' proposal  for  ``waging a crusade'' to extend this ecological tax to the whole  world. ``The greatest danger is of these emissions increasing  in the rest of the world, where there is no control,'' he added.    He refuted the idea that the economic crisis relegates  environmental concern in this way: ``In Europe, measures in the  environmental field will create at least 2.5 million jobs over  the next five years, and other studies show that this figure  could rise to 5 million,'' he stated.    Paleokrassas deemed generally ``insufficient'' the programs  drawn up by the various countries in order to fulfill the  commitments which they undertook at the Earth Summit (1992) in  signing the Climatic Change Treaty, and asserted that only  Europe has drawn up plans to combat the effects of a possible  climatic change.    On the implementation of Community directives, he said that  Spain in general carries out those concerning the protection of  birds, ``but the degree of fulfillment is not so satisfactory in  the case of public works and conducting environmental impact  studies. Spain is in an intermediate position; it is not among  the worst,'' he summed up.</p>

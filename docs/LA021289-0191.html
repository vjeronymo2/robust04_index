			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: OPPORTUNITY IS EVERYWHERE FOR SMART INVESTORS  </P> <P> Investors, as usual, read the headlines differently last week. And that's why  the stocks of strong, healthy savings and loan companies hit new highs after  President Bush unveiled a program for dealing with the industry's troubles.  </P> <P> Investors saw the doughnut, not the hole. Though Bush's plan levied higher  insurance charges on the savings and loan industry, the promise that sick  S&amp;Ls would be weeded out meant brighter prospects for the healthy. And so  the stocks of such firms as H. F. Ahmanson (Home Savings), CalFed, Golden West  Financial and Great Western Financial all went up.  </P> <P> Which confirmed the insight of two prominent mutual fund managers, Peter Lynch  of Fidelity Magellan Fund and John Neff of Vanguard Windsor fund. Both hold  S&amp;L stocks in their fund portfolios because, as they explained recently in  Barron's financial weekly, they see a healthy mortgage industry despite  problems at some S&amp;Ls. Mortgages are bigger, Lynch pointed out; the house  that once was bought with an $18,000 mortgage sells today at a price requiring  a $100,000 mortgage. As a result, business will grow for mortgage lenders, such  as the S&amp;Ls whose stock prices rose last week.  </P> <P> The point of that story is what it says not of S&amp;Ls but of investors like  Lynch and Neff. Though they're very big investors -- Lynch with $11 billion  invested in 1,300 stocks, Neff concentrating $5.6 billion in about 70 stocks --  their thinking is disarmingly simple and clear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plenty of Opportunity  </P> <P> In fact, it is the kind of thinking that any investor, amateur or professional,  is capable of, Lynch maintains. And that's the message of his forthcoming book,  "One Up on Wall Street": That the individual investor has a place in the stock  market.  </P> <P> Opportunity, says Lynch, is all around you. Investors in Southern California  could have seen long before professional Wall Streeters that Newhall Land &amp;  Farming was sitting on valuable properties. Newhall, the Valencia-based  developer, has been a stock market winner, rising from about $11 a share six  years ago to $51 today.  </P> <P> To be sure, you can do well in mutual funds: Magellan has posted average annual  gains of 18% over a long period. Neff's Windsor has a comparable long-term  record and was up 27% last year. But what has helped the funds do well are  their big gainers, such as Ford -- which was losing money and selling for $3.50  a share in 1981 but is highly profitable and selling for about $56 today -- a  16-fold rise in eight years.  </P> <P> Any investor could have made that winning investment in Ford, argues Lynch. It  took no great sophistication to notice years ago that the company was producing  more attractive cars. "This is not a complicated business," he says. "All it  takes is simple logic and fourth-grade arithmetic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ignore Gloomy Forecasts  </P> <P> Why is Lynch, who earns a reported $3 million a year at Fidelity, preaching to  the masses? Because he worries that individual investors are confusing gambling  with investing, playing options on General Motors -- in which they can be wiped  out in short-term fluctuations of the stock when they should be buying GM  shares and benefiting from long-term price appreciation and the growing  dividend.  </P> <P> And he thinks it's a mistake for investors to be put off by nervous economic  forecasts. Both Lynch and Neff think reports of debt-burdened American  consumers and corporations are overblown. Consumer interest payments, says  Lynch, are a lower percentage of family income now than they were in 1970. And  as for corporations, most of the major ones such as Digital Equipment, Boeing  and General Electric have more spare cash than debt. "They are banks unto  themselves," says Neff.  </P> <P> What does that mean? That the companies may have values and capacity to earn  income that remain to be fully recognized in higher stock prices. You can't  predict whether a company's stock will rise tomorrow, Lynch explains in his  book, but you can study its operations and draw conclusions.  </P> <P> "You've got to do the work, of course. Merely checking prices with a calculator  and the newspaper is not work," he says. "Pull out the annual report, read the  quarterlies and business news, keep abreast."  </P> <P> And have patience. "The big winners I've had have come in the third, fourth or  fifth years I've owned the stock," Lynch says. "I was underwater with Bank of  America for three years." He bought BankAmerica stock at $20 a share, and again  when it dropped to $15, because he could see that the company was cutting its  costs. But losses on bad loans kept increasing and the stock fell. Finally,  says Lynch, "it got to $8 or $9 a share and I bought 2% of the company."  </P> <P> Now BankAmerica has gone back to $21 a share, and Magellan Fund has a gain on  its investment. But what persuaded Lynch to stick with BankAmerica all the way  down? It was noticing, even when the news seemed to portend bankruptcy, that  loan losses were declining while cost reductions continued. "The fundamentals  of the investment hadn't changed," says Lynch calmly.  </P> <P> Clearly, investing takes nerve and isn't as easy as Lynch suggests. But  clearly, too, the amateur who does the work has a fair shot at the rewards.  </P></p>

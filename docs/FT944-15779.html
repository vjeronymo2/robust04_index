			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Musical chairs at Westpac Last week's changes at Westpac, the Australian bank, have increased options for succession to the managing director's chair, which will be occupied by expatriate American Robert Joss until early 1998, writes Bruce Jacques. Joss, who earned his reputation reorganising US bank Wells Fargo, has reassigned the jobs of the internal contenders and brought in former Citibank Australia chairman, Michael Cannon-Brookes. Cannon-Brookes, currently managing director of law firm Freehill Hollingdale and Page, has been appointed Westpac's group executive, operations. The new position confers stewardship of the bank's burgeoning support operations and reports directly to Joss. But the bank's internal changes, styled by Joss as a new focus on performance and growth following an era of internal repair, may hold more clues to the succession. They include moving the high profile former Treasury bureaucrat, David Morgan, from retail banking to head a new institutional and international banking division. Morgan's position at retail, which controls the bulk of the bank's assets, has been taken by former institutional banking head, Owen van der Wall. Biggest promotion in the shuffle has gone to Barry Robertson who is overseeing the bank's extensive problem asset sale programme as chief of property finance and asset management. He adds the commercial banking division to his duties. Speculation on the changes has centred around Morgan who was touted for the top post before Joss was appointed last year. Morgan's new assignment has perhaps unfairly been interpreted as a classic sideways move. But it would scarcely be out of character for Joss to play management musical chairs at least once more.</p>

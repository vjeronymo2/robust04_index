			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In his first assessment  of the agreement expected to be finally signed in Cairo 4 May,  Mamduh Nawfal, President 'Arafat's adviser on security affairs,  said that, in the main details, what was agreed represented the  maximum the PLO could get in the circumstances but did not  fulfill our aspirations and only met minimum Palestinian  demands. He added: But in essence, the agreement is considered  to be positive. For the first time since the signing of the  Washington agreement last September, a timetable has been agreed  for implementation. The agreement also allows the emergence of  limited authority in the Palestinian areas.    In a telephone interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from Tunis,  Nawfal summed up the points in the agreement as follows: "In  addition to the timetable, the most important achievement was  the participation of international forces from six states which  are providing aid, for the first time linking Gaza and Jericho  with Hebron. The agreement also met Israel's maximum security  demands and maximum Palestinian economic demands, in addition to  a reasonable level of national sovereignty symbols such as  travel documents, an international dialing code, and an  independent postal system and stamps."    Sources in Amman and Tunis say that the timetable for the  entry of the Palestinian police forces into the areas of limited  autonomy is as follows:    "An advance Palestinian exploration and initial arrangements  unit consisting of 22-28 Palestinian officers will set up a  liaison office with Israeli officers to make preparations to  receive the first police force units next Thursday or Friday.  It will be followed three days later by a force consisting of  100 officers and policemen. On 22 May, the date set for the  completion of the two-week Israeli withdrawal, a force  consisting of 6,000 policemen and their families will begin to  arrive in Gaza and Jericho, to be followed one week later by  1,000 policemen and their families in addition to 400  technicians and administrative officials to make the necessary  arrangements for receiving the Palestian leadership headed by  Yasir 'Arafat, who will return as PLO chairman and not in any  other capacity, according to the agreement."    As regards prisoners and detainees, the agreement stipulates  that "1,000 Palestinian detainees will be released the day the  agreement is signed, 4 May, and 500 detainees a day later.  After the completion of the withdrawal of the Israeli Army,  2,000 prisoners serving long sentences, from all Palestinian  organizations, will be released. More negotiations will begin  13 July for the gradual release of the remaining detainees,  starting with the release of 2,000 detainees. [no closing  quotation mark]    According to Palestinian sources, the agreement stipulates  that the detainees who belong to Palestinian opposition factions  should give a written undertaking not to carry out "military"  operations against the settlements or inside Israel, and to  support the new Palestinian authority and respect the laws  within its boundaries. On the economic front, the Palestinian  sources said that the most important Israeli concession was  exemption from tax and customs duties for the list of  commodities submitted by the Palestinians and linked to the  infrastructure. That list is subject to the requirements and  assessments of the Palestinian authority on a free import basis.  Another point is related to Palestinian employment and  regulations organizing that inside Israel. The agreement  stipulates that the Palestinian authority will supervise the  employment regulations in agreement with the Israeli Government.    Another point is the acceptance of the shekel as a main  currency, not the official currency, in circulation in the  autonomy area.    As regards the area identified as the gray area in the  agreement maps, namely the al-Mawasi agricultural area on the  Gaza coast, it has been reduced from the 57 square kilometers  requested by the Israelis to 36 square kilometers.    The two sides agreed on a compromise solution on the  question  of "judicial jurisdiction." It was agreed that Israelis and  foreign tourists who commit violations in the security area  adjacent to the Israeli settlements would be tried in Israeli  courts, and that the Palestinian judicial authorities would be  kept informed of the investigations; whereas Israelis and  tourists who commit violations in the autonomy region would be  tried by Palestinian courts.    As regards the disputed issues which have been referred to  the 4 May meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  and 'Arafat in Cairo, they are related to the Israeli crossing  points on the King Husayn Bridge, Palestinian currency, and  territorial waters. Negotiations between the two sides will  continue in Cairo until the day after tomorrow, when a  preparatory meeting will be held between Rabin and 'Arafat to  pave the way for the signing the following day, in the hope that  the obstacles and disputed details will have been resolved by  then.    The Palestinian sources added that the agreement, which runs  to 85 pages, also stipulates that the Palestine National Council  will hold an emergency meeting in the limited autonomy region in  which the Palestinian national charter will be openly revoked.</p>

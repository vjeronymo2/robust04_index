			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE derivatives sector had a volatile session as hopes of a cut in German interest rates initially faded and then disappointed the market when it eventually happened, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,911, but that early strength slowly ebbed away on profit-taking and a general feeling that there would be no cut in German interest rates. Speculation that the Bundesbank would cut rates after all surfaced over the lunch-time period and caused a squeeze in March, pulling the underlying cash market higher. March reached its all time peak of 2,918 at around 2.10pm, just before an announcement of the German rate cut. That, however, disappointed and sent the contract into retreat once again, a fall that was encouraged by early falls on Wall Street, and fell to a discount of about 3 to the underlying cash market. The March contract closed at 2,870, down 19 on its previous close and at a premium to cash of only 2 points. Turnover was 14,393 contracts. The volume in the traded options was also heavy reaching 43,734 lots by the close. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was particularly heavy reaching 17,669 contracts and that in the Euro FT-SE 100 Option reaching 1,350 lots. Among stock options, BP was the most active with 3,305 lots dealt.</p>

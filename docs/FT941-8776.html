			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / 'Clinton Lite' health plan gets a tasting: Slim-line alternative proposal draws criticism as well as praise President Bill Clinton's ambitious healthcare reform plan has suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks. While the Congressional Budget Office shed doubt on the medium-term financial consequences of the proposal, the Business Roundtable, an alliance of heavyweight corporate interests, disavowed the president's plan and threw its influence behind a rival approach promoted by Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee. Mr Cooper, a Democrat who is running in this year's race for the Senate seat once held by Vice-President Al Gore, has pitched his proposals firmly in the middle of the political spectrum. He likes to call his plan 'Clinton Lite', a slimline version of the president's package, stripped of some of the government involvement that Mr Clinton's Republican foes find so objectionable. The Cooper plan is, in fact, the only healthcare reform proposal before Congress to have picked up endorsements from both Republican and Democratic members. But the limelight has brought with it a new degree of scrutiny, and the details of Mr Cooper's proposals are coming in for searching criticism. 'I think that a more full exposition of Mr Cooper's bill is trouble for Mr Cooper, not the administration,' said Congressman John Dingell, who, as chairman of the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, holds sway over a large portion of any health reform legislation. The Cooper plan is aimed at introducing a form of the managed competition concept which has inspired many of the competing proposals. Insurance companies and healthcare providers would be strongly encouraged, by changes in the tax code, to form Accountable Health Plans. These plans must offer a standard package of health benefits, to be defined by an independent Health Care Standards Commission. Health plans would be required to enroll anyone who applied for coverage. They would be allowed to vary their premiums only by geographic location, and to a limited degree by the age of the policyholder; not on the basis of how sick people have been. Small businesses and individuals would be able to enroll in Health Plan Purchasing Co-operatives similar to the Clinton plan's Health Alliances, but with a lower cut-off point - only businesses with fewer than 100 employees would be able to join, whereas in the Clinton scheme all businesses with fewer than 5,000 employees would be obliged to join. Much of the support for Mr Cooper's ideas, however, stems from two central points in which his plan differs from the president's. Mr Cooper would merely ask businesses to offer health insurance to their employees, not require them to pay for it. Mr Clinton, by contrast, has sought to ensure universal coverage by obliging businesses to pay 80 per cent of the cost of health coverage for all their full-time employees, a mandate that has deterred many small companies that do not provide such cover, and even many larger businesses that do. A second difference is that both proposals claim they will bring market forces to bear in the healthcare system as their principal cost control mechanism. But while the Clinton plan would impose a cap on health insurance premiums if prices rise too fast, the Cooper plan relies on a tax mechanism. Health insurance benefits would be taxable if they exceeded the cost of the lowest approved health plan in the same geographical area. This would, Mr Cooper argues, encourage consumers to shop for the cheapest plan and discourage 'Rolls-Royce' policies. At the moment, health benefits may be fully deducted for the purposes of corporate income tax by the employer, and fully excluded from personal income tax by the employee. This loses the government about Dollars 65bn a year in tax revenue. For many of his fellow Democrats, the most damaging criticism now being levelled at Mr Cooper's plan is that it can claim to offer only universal access, not the universal coverage that Mr Clinton insists on and that most polls suggest is strongly favoured by public opinion. 'When I get my LL Bean catalogue every year I've got universal access to all kinds of warm clothes, but I don't have any coverage with those warm clothes until I whip out my credit card,' says Congressman Bill Ford, another influential House committee chairman. 'The thing that's missing from Cooper's plan is a credit card.' Mr Cooper offers government subsidies covering the entire cost of the premium, estimated to range from Dollars 2,100 a year for a single person to Dollars 5,565 for a two-parent family, for those with incomes below the official poverty line - now Dollars 11,866. The subsidy would diminish on a sliding scale to zero at twice the poverty line. But as Mr Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at Washington's Brookings Institution, pointed out in a recent critique, this would create a poverty trap by withdrawing benefits from those whose incomes rise above the poverty line - the equivalent of taxing income between Dollars 11,866 and Dollars 23,732 at an effective rate of 88 per cent. 'Although the Tennessee Democrat calls his plan 'Clinton Lite' it is not merely light but utterly empty on the central goal of the Clinton plan: universal coverage,' Mr Aaron wrote in the New York Times. Nonetheless, Mr Cooper and his backers seem likely to be an important voice as congressional committees get down to hammering out a legislative compromise.</p>

Some 49 percent of the share ownership of the  3.1-billion-yuan Jinan-Qingdao Expressway -- one of the  top-class expressways in China -- will be sold to investors from  both at home and abroad, sources at the ongoing `94 Qingdao  Trade Fair said today.    Meanwhile, a host of transportation development projects,  including construction of an expressway, four highways and a  river navigation lane, as well as a harbor, costing some 15  billion yuan, are also on offer for investment at the fair.    Officials of the provincial communications department noted  that the winning bidders will enjoy a series of preferential  policies granted by the government. For instance, they will be  given priority in developing real estate and other related  sectors.    Zhu Zhenchang, head of the department, told a press  conference that besides that batch of projects, a succession of  other transportation projects will be opened to outside  investors in the future.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban: Last weekend's vote in Switzerland could complicate the path to a wider Europe Switzerland yesterday came under blistering attack from European Union countries over its voters' decision to ban foreign trucks from travelling through the Swiss Alps. Italy and Germany, which depend heavily on the Gotthard Pass for the transport of goods, said they would seek talks within the EU to consider the implications. There were worries in Brussels yesterday that the Swiss vote in a referendum on Sunday could scupper chances of the EU reaching an agreement with Austria on lorry traffic through its Alpine passes. This has been an obstacle in the negotiations on Austrian entry to the EU, due to start their final stage today. Germany warned that closer ties between the EU and Switzerland would suffer because of the vote to ban foreign road transit within 10 years. The decision was supported by nearly 52 per cent of those who took part, in defiance of the Swiss government's campaign against a ban. Italy called for an urgent meeting of EU transport ministers, warning that the decision had set a dangerous precedent and could have a serious knock-on effect in other countries. France, Spain and the Netherlands also demanded a tough EU response. About 1,000 foreign trucks a day cut through Switzerland along the Gotthard Pass, which bisects the country north to south. The Swiss government had argued, in its campaign against the ban, that a 12-year accord with the EU restraining heavy traffic provided adequate protection. EU and Swiss negotiators recently agreed that Switzerland could maintain its 28 tonne limit and a ban on trucks using roads at night and weekends. This agreement may be undermined by the vote, provoking retaliatory measures. Yesterday, representatives of the Italian road hauliers' association said the annual cost of the Swiss ban would be L750bn (Pounds 300m) in extra mileage alone. They calculate journeys will be 400km longer on average. Mr Raffaele Costa, Italian transport minister, said yesterday: 'Even if the Swiss are talking of introducing these measures over a period of 10 years to allow plans for alternative transport, matters will not be easy if not impossible.' He also pointed out that environmental considerations already made transalpine traffic difficult. In Bonn, the transport ministry said: 'The acceptance of the Alp Initiative (campaign against transit traffic) makes the negotiations with the EU considerably more difficult.' The German association of long-haul carriers denounced the move as 'a further step for Switzerland on its way towards isolation in Europe'. The move would lead to traffic problems in France, Austria and in the southern German state of Baden-Wurttemberg. The association said it would lobby Brussels to threaten Switzerland with reciprocal measures for Swiss trucks, such as forcing them to use railways only. However, Germany's opposition Social Democrats welcomed the Swiss move as a victory for environmental policy, and Bund, the German association for the protection of nature, said the ban represented 'a milestone toward resolving the ecological problems of the Alps'. Austria believes the Swiss decision will strengthen its hand in negotiations for EU entry. Mr Viktor Klima, transport minister said Austrian voters would support entry only if a 12-year transit treaty with the EU, due to run until 2004, remained intact. The treaty restricts lorry traffic through Austria's passes on environmental grounds. This would have to be entirely renegotiated once Austria enters the EU, but the Twelve were poised to offer a three-year transition before replacing the agreement. EU diplomats now say that a Swiss ban would displace Alpine transit traffic to Austria. Many Austrians argue that they should not have to accept the EU's lower environmental standards as a condition of EU membership.</p>

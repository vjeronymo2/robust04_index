			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Clues in the Birt case point to wider auditing issues - Andrew Jack says the row over the BBC chief's tax affairs raises policy questions that demand attention AS BRITISH politicians and commentators have pondered the level of violence on television in the last few weeks, the British Broadcasting Corporation has been obliging by providing more blood-letting off-screen than on. The furore surrounding the tax affairs of Mr John Birt, its director general, may in part have been fuelled by jealousy from rivals and other journalists. But it has highlighted some policy questions that demand attention. Tax is not paramount among them. The degree to which the information in accounts is scrutinised most certainly is. Accountancy firms and the Inland Revenue alike have been inundated with probes from hacks on the story that will not die. Some of those fielding the inquiries have remarked that the questions smack as much of personal curiosity as they do of indignant inquisition. They ask 'How could I, er, someone arrange their affairs in this way?' almost as frequently as 'How did you slip up? What can be done about this scandal?' Some journalists, at least, should already know. In common with others in the entertainment industry, some journalists have long used companies as a method of tax planning, and for perfectly legitimate reasons. They may work part time for different organisations, or move between a succession of them on short-term contracts. They may have left old company structures in place even after they ceased to make much sense, because tax planning is not in their every waking thought. Part of the confusion has arisen because of a failure to distinguish 'self-employed' and 'self-incorporated'. The latter arrangement - that adopted by Mr Birt - does not exempt those on the payroll from National Insurance contributions. It does exclude them from such things as sickness and other benefits provided by the employer. It also requires them to pay for substantial accounting and auditing fees. It has, in short, drawbacks as well as benefits. There may be some concern about the level of discretion exercised by local tax inspectors in examining the filed returns; and equally calls for tightening by politicians of the rights of, and scope for, employees to be self-incorporated. But as one accountant said in astonishment last week: 'This is the most monstrous storm in a tea cup.' Another lamented that after years persuading clients that self-incorporation was a poor method of tax planning, there was now a fresh run of interest in the approach. However good a tax accountant Mr Michael Henshaw - Mr Birt's accountant - was, he clearly has his limitations as an auditor. He would have saved his client considerable embarrassment if he had taken advantage of the summary accounts regulations. This would have allowed him to file little more than the balance sheet on the public record. That way, nobody would have discovered that Mr Birt's company spent Pounds 3,666 on 'wardrobe' in the 1991 financial year, Pounds 340 on 'theatre visits &amp; research', and Pounds 2,366 on 'entertainment' (which the attached tax computation shows as having been added back, revealing Mr Birt did not claim any tax relief against this final item). Fuelled, it would appear, by suggestions that Mr Henshaw is not registered as an auditor, the Department of Trade and Industry admitted last week that it was 'looking into' the accounts. It might do well to concentrate on the violations of company legislation which they reveal. It is true that Mr Henshaw does not appear to be a member of any professional accountancy body. Nor is he or his firm, Henshaw &amp; Associates of Camden Town, London, registered as an auditor with any of the regulatory bodies. An unregistered practitioner who accepted appointment as an auditor after the new regulations came into force in October 1991 could face six months imprisonment and a Pounds 5,000 fine. If such a person put up a plaque outside his office claiming to be an auditor, he could be fined Pounds 5,000 for each day the sign was in place. Mr Henshaw might well have had a lucky escape: the 1991 directors' report shows him willing to stand for re-election in 1992. He was apparently appointed before October 1991, and is now unlikely to be auditing the 1992 accounts. But he has certainly breached a number of accounting and auditing regulations. 'The accounts are appallingly badly drawn up,' said one accountant who has examined them closely. 'It is a rank piece of bad accounting, especially on behalf of a client who is somebody in the public eye.' The auditor's report for John Birt Productions Limited for the year to August 31 1991 is unsigned and makes no reference to Mr Henshaw's qualifications as an accountant, so does not comply with auditing standards. The wording refers to 'the Companies Act 1948 to 1985', though all the laws before 1985 were repealed by the new act and are irrelevant. In the same vein, the directors' report says Henshaw will be proposed for re-election as auditor under the 1976 Companies Act. More importantly, the directors' report has not been approved or dated by the directors, as required by the 1989 Companies Act. The one aspect of compliance with the 1989 Companies Act is the relaxation which allows a single director - rather than a minimum of two - to approve and sign the accounts. But legislative requirements are quickly forgotten in the accounts themselves. The balance sheet is signed by the directors, but not dated as stipulated by SSAP 17, the accounting standard on post-balance sheet events introduced in 1980. The auditor's fee is not separately disclosed as a line item in the profit and loss account or its notes, a requirement at least since the 1948 Companies Act. There is simply a Pounds 3,100 'audit and accountancy' figure. If, as the Financial Times reported last week, the company employs Mr Birt's wife as a secretary, then the secretary's Pounds 15,000 salary should not be a separate line item as shown, but part of the Pounds 80,604 recorded for directors' emoluments. Finally, the figures for depreciation for the year do not tally with the rates shown. Mr Henshaw may have lost Mr Birt's contract. But as a director, Mr Birt will have to foot the bill if the DTI decides that he should have a second audit conducted on the company. One piece of good news to come out of this episode for Companies' House, the government's corporate information depository, will be the money it has made from requests for copies of the accounts. The bad news is that it failed to pick up these basic errors. The worse news is that it is under no obligation to identify most of them. It is only required to make a series of elementary checks - one of which is that the auditor's report should be signed. Mr David Durham, chief executive, says: 'I regret that there must have been an oversight. Normally my examiners are very good.' The agency is not required to pick up any of the remaining issues. Should blood always need to be spilt before problems with filed accounts are unearthed?</p>

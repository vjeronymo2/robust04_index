			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MALTA SUMMIT;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV FACES CRUCIAL YEAR AS ECONOMY WORSENS  </P> <P> Time is quickly running out for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and 1990  appears increasingly likely to be the year when his reforms will succeed or  fail.  </P> <P> The original economic crisis that forced the Soviet leadership to rethink 70  years of socialism has deepened. And as Gorbachev prepares for his  Mediterranean summit meeting with President Bush this weekend, the Soviet  Union's empty stores mock his promises of plenty with the reform of socialism.  </P> <P> The dramatic political changes of the last four years -- a free-wheeling  Parliament, open debate on the most sensitive issues, multi-candidate  elections, a virtually uncensored press -- have not yet developed the muscle  necessary to transform the whole Soviet system and resolve the country's acute  problems.  </P> <P> The restive non-Russian nations around the periphery of the Soviet Union are  now a ring of mounting unrest that runs from the Baltic republics of Estonia,  Latvia and Lithuania through Moldavia and the Ukraine down to Armenia,  Azerbaijan and Georgia and across Central Asia. Their push for independence is  spurred as much by despair of substantial changes in the Soviet system as by  their resurgent nationalism.  </P> <P> Social discontent is growing rapidly. As the lines for food and consumer goods  lengthen, tempers grow shorter and police report more and more street  disturbances. Serious crimes have increased more than 35% so far this year.  Strikes, rare a year ago, are becoming common, and worker slowdowns often  paralyze whole regions or industries.  </P> <P> More than 40 million people -- one in seven -- now live below the official  poverty line, subsisting on the equivalent of less than $80 a month. Inflation  is running at nearly 10% a year, according to official figures, and this has  more than eroded the pay gains of most of the middle class. Unemployment, once  virtually unknown, has become a serious problem in certain regions. Corruption  and black-market dealings have become the way of virtually everyone.  </P> <P> Amid all this, ordinary people are starting to demand to know when they will  see the better life Gorbachev promised when he assumed the Soviet leadership  five years ago.  </P> <P> Even his most dedicated supporters have developed an "eleventh-hour"  psychology, and some have begun suggesting that Gorbachev ought to assume  dictatorial powers to ensure the success of his program -- although at what  they concede would be the "temporary" cost of democracy.  </P> <P> "The future of our society will depend not only and not so much on the economy  as on whether we manage to avoid political blunders capable of provoking  citizens into taking anti-constitutional actions," Otto Latsis, the influential  deputy editor of the Communist Party journal Kommunist, said last week.  </P> <P> "The nation's leadership must advance a series of political initiatives to help  people regain their faith in reform and their faith in the strength of our  socialist system that has been in for much battering lately."  </P> <P> What has brought on such pessimism, skepticism, cynicism and fear is, most  observers agree, the destruction of the country's old political and economic  system without its replacement by the socialist millennium that Gorbachev had  suggested could come with perestroika, his program of economic and political  restructuring.  </P> <P> Only 23% See Gains  </P> <P> The scale of this crisis of confidence became apparent in a survey conducted  last month by the National Center for the Analysis of Public Opinion, which  found that only 23% of the people questioned felt that their lives had improved  for the better under perestroika and that 53% now seriously doubted whether the  reforms would ever improve anything.  </P> <P> And with this wave of pessimism is growing another crisis -- one of legitimacy  for the Communist Party and Gorbachev as its leader. By what right, people are  starting to ask, does the Communist Party continue to rule? What justifies its  offer to share power rather than compete for it with rival groups? Who has  ordained Gorbachev as the leader of reform and blessed his reform plans?  </P> <P> Gorbachev himself acknowledges that the coming year will be "decisive" for his  reforms.  </P> <P> "We are at the stage of a historic breakthrough," he told a recent meeting of  students here. "The fate of our society for many decades is being decided."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's multiple crises -- political, economic, ideological, ethnic  and social -- must be quickly resolved, his advisers say, if perestroika is to  retain its focus and regain its momentum in the months before the Communist  Party congress next October.  </P> <P> "If we are to prepare a program that will carry the nation forward toward the  21st Century, we must deal with these problems from yesterday," a policy  specialist from the party Central Committee said. "And then we will recover our  confidence and our will to forge ahead."  </P> <P> But Gorbachev admitted this month that the outcome, in fact, is very much in  doubt.  </P> <P> The changes now seen as necessary are far greater in dimension than first  imagined, the Soviet leader said, and they must be broadened and accelerated  further.  </P> <P> "At first glance, everything would seem to be quite simple -- we live in this  society, we know it, everything is clear," Gorbachev said. "Yet this turned out  to be the most difficult task. . . .  </P> <P> "We came to the concept of perestroika as a revolutionary renewal of socialism  and of our whole society. . . . We must now look boldly and openly into the  future."  </P> <P> The reforms proposed by Gorbachev are so fundamental, however, that they amount  to a redefinition of socialism, and Gorbachev sees this as one of the most  important aspects of perestroika.  </P> <P> The consequent break from the political and economic system developed here over  seven decades has met with substantial opposition from conservatives in the  Communist Party and the government bureaucracy and provoked a sharp debate over  the country's future.  </P> <P> Forced to Compromise  </P> <P> Radicals and conservatives have, as a result, been able to force Gorbachev into  frequent compromises that have both slowed the reforms and given them the  uncertain character that now compounds the sense of crisis here.  </P> <P> "We do not know really where he stands," Tatyana Koryagina, a prominent  economist, complained this month. "Everything depends on Gorbachev. If he is  not with the conservatives, then he ought to explain to the people openly why  he has been taking the conservatives' side."  </P> <P> The conservatives have the same complaint, however, and warn that Gorbachev's  reforms have cast Soviet society adrift. They, too, want a clear blueprint for  the future, one that lays out means and ends, one that defines the scope of the  reforms and sets clear limits for them.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, whose whole political style has been characterized as an "ability to  seize the moment" and then press ahead, continues to reject these demands for  the reform process, although the cost of the resulting uncertainty is high.  </P> <P> "This would mean only a futile attempt to drive this movement of life into some  office-bound scheme once again," he said this month.  </P> <P> "Specific decisions must be based on an analysis of the rapidly changing  situation and with due account, first of all, of the requirements and  aspirations of the broad masses of people."  </P> <P> To resolve the country's economic problems, Gorbachev has placed considerable  hope on a new, six-year transitional program that, step by step, will transform  the centrally planned and managed Soviet economy into one that operates on the  market principles of supply and demand and that will include privately owned  businesses and cooperatives competing with state enterprises.  </P> <P> In response to nationalist demands from the country's constituent republics for  greater autonomy and even independence, he is proposing far-reaching  negotiations to develop a new constitution with a decentralized, federal  system.  </P> <P> He sees the republican elections that begin next month and continue into March  as taking the political reforms down to the local level and breaking the party  bureaucracy's monopoly on power there as it has at the national level.  </P> <P> To ease the ideological qualms of conservatives, Gorbachev published on Sunday  a lengthy position paper, outlining his philosophy of political change and  reiterating the basic directions in which the country should head.  </P> <P> And he is now putting together a series of ad hoc measures, such as increased  imports of consumer goods, an anti-crime campaign and greater attention to  worker complaints, that he hopes will restore some of the lost confidence.  </P> <P> "Our forward movement may be too slow unless we manage drastically to improve  the psychological climate in the country," said Kommunist deputy editor Latsis,  who is a leading Soviet economist. "The people must fully understand the  complexity of the situation, and we must take a fresh look at things."  </P> <P> But Stanislav S. Shatalin, another leading economist, warned Monday that  reforms in the Soviet Union have tended to stall and then collapse -- a pattern  that may be repeated this year.  </P> <P> The country's continued economic decline -- growth might come to only 1% this  year -- will not be arrested easily, he said, and momentum must be regained.  </P> <P> "Economic reforms have a history of failure in our country," Shatalin said.  "All the reforms launched since 1965 have failed. This is because they have  been isolated from reform of the political system, but we have corrected this.  They had also failed to establish a new relationship between property and  ownership, and we are correcting this.  </P> <P> "But I do not know whether we have that critical mass of people ready and able  and wanting to put the reforms into effect. That is a major question and a key  to whether we succeed or fail."  </P></p>

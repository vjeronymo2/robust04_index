			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS OK RIGHT TO STRIKE BUT EXCLUDE KEY INDUSTRIES  </P> <P> For the first time since the earliest years of the Soviet state, the majority  of Soviet workers won the right to strike under legislation enacted Monday. But  the same law prohibits work stoppages in key industries.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet, the newly strengthened legislature, emphasized in a day of  heated debate that the basic thrust of the new law is to make clear the  workers' right to strike except where such action would endanger lives, health  or the national economy.  </P> <P> The Soviet lawmakers, in their first major legislation, outlined the steps --  conciliation, mediation and arbitration -- that workers must follow before they  can legally strike. And they made the courts, not the government's executive  branch, the referee if disputes arise over the right to strike.  </P> <P> The declared goal of the legislation, adopted by a vote of 373 to 12, with 10  abstentions, is ensuring workers' collective bargaining power as the Soviet  economy, now largely state-owned and centrally planned, begins to diversify and  to respond to market forces.  </P> <P> In immediate practice, however, the law recognizes the power that Soviet  workers won for themselves in a series of major strikes over the summer --  strikes that paralyzed most of the coal-mining industry for nearly a month and  threatened steel mills and railways -- and everything that depends on them.  </P> <P> "Strikes are now a reality," one prominent deputy, A. N. Kraiko, an aircraft  engineer and designer, argued. "We viewed this reality for a long time as  destructive, but world experience proves that strikes can have a constructive  role (in) regulating the relationship between workers and their employers."  </P> <P> Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet physicist and human rights activist who won the  Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, said a strike has often been the only way for  inmates of the country's labor camps to protect their meager rights and to win  any improvement in their living conditions.  </P> <P> The new law prohibits strikes in the transport, communications, power and  defense industries; at factories in continuous production, such as steel mills,  and against governmental bodies safeguarding national security and law and  order. It also bans strikes that "threaten the life or health of the people,"  but it leaves these to the courts to adjudicate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Strikes Banned  </P> <P> The legislation also outlaws most political strikes -- those "motivated by  demands for the violent overthrow or change of the state or social system or  demands leading to the violation of ethnic or racial equality."  </P> <P> These limitations as a whole were criticized, however, as undermining the basic  philosophy of the legislation and devaluing it through too many exceptions.  </P> <P> One radical deputy charged that the prohibitions effectively outlawed 70% of  strikes. But V. I. Samarin, the chairman of the committee that drafted the  legislation, said the law actually ensures the right to strike for 65% of the  country's industrial, commercial and government workers.  </P> <P> Even the prohibitions are not automatic, Samarin said, because workers can  appeal to the courts, and the burden of proof of the danger posed by the strike  would be on the employers.  </P> <P> Only the legislatures of the constituent republics or the Supreme Soviet itself  can intervene to postpone a legal strike, according to the law.  </P> <P> The government had called originally for a complete ban on all strikes until  1991, arguing that proposed political, economic and social reforms needed at  least 15 months of enforced tranquillity to take shape and be put into effect.  </P> <P> Deputies immediately rebelled, arguing that such a ban was far too sweeping,  that it extended emergency measures to regions that were quiet and that it  undermined the process of collective bargaining.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strike Funds OKd  </P> <P> The legislation adopted Monday authorizes the formation of strike committees,  which so far have proved to be more militant and effective than the official  trade union movement, and the establishment of strike funds, another first,  through levies on workers and donations.  </P> <P> When the Supreme Soviet's special commission on labor legislation began its  discussions last summer, the bill presented by the government did not even  refer to possible strikes, Samarin recalled, and strike committees were an  unknown concept.  </P> <P> "The deputies drafted this law themselves," he said, recounting the  reorientation of the bill and the many debates over its underlying philosophy.  "It is a first experiment at legislation in this country."  </P> <P> Sergei S. Alexeyev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's powerful committee for  legislation, said the law is an important step toward political pluralism and a  system in which differences are examined and a solution found on the basis of  compromise.  </P> <P> "Our work on this shows the emerging outlines of a mechanism of the Supreme  Soviet for discussing draft laws," Alexeyev said. "A lawmaking culture is  starting to take shape."  </P></p>

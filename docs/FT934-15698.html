			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Private View: A lifetime of learning in UN hotspots TO TRAVEL without a bodyguard is wonderful, said Margaret Anstee as she jetted off to her mud-brick house on the shores of Lake Titicaca. Why should a 67-year-old Englishwoman retire to live alone among the Aymara Indians 4,000 ft up in the Andes? It's a character out of Evelyn Waugh, I said. She laughed girlishly: 'Oh, please]', but added: 'Well, it is slightly mad.' The path to her Bolivian Shangri La has been extraordinary. It began in a village in Essex, traversed some of the world's worst trouble spots and disaster areas, and ascended almost to the summit of the United Nations. Her last assignment for the UN, which ended in June, was the globe's bloodiest conflict - Angola. This week she landed in Bolivia from Williamsburg, Virginia, where she was awarded the Reves Prize for her contribution to world peace. She moves in to the adobe house next week. At first she resisted when a friend suggested she build on the acre of land she had bought overlooking the lake and the peaks of the Cordillera Real. 'But it was a wonderful day,' she said, 'and the air is rather like champagne - what there is of it. So I thought OK, in for a penny, in for a pound. I also thought, I don't have any children and surely I can have a few little dreams in my life? And if it doesn't work out nobody suffers except me.' I asked: Can you manage on your own, fix things yourself? 'Oh, there are lots of people round about. The only problem is that the local community may regard me as a kind of billionairess and think I'm going to be able to do things for them which are rather beyond my means.' She has done, and will continue to do, things for them (there is a hospital named after her), has taken Bolivian citizenship, and will act as an unofficial adviser to the government in La Paz. 'After the traumatic experience of Angola it's going to be very nice trying to help people to live better rather than ineffectually trying to stop them killing one another.' There is nothing spinsterish about Miss Anstee. She bounced into the lobby of her London club wearing an outlandish trouser suit which showed off her long, slim legs. She is physically attractive and has a luminous smile. For 8am her make-up was a touch theatrical (she once wanted to be an actress and there was, after all, a camera to be faced). She is the only child of working class parents - her father was a print compositor - from Writtle, outside Chelmsford. They invested everything in her at a time when money was thought wasted on a girl. From the local girls' high school she won a place at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she took a First in modern and medieval languages. The British Foreign Office had just opened its doors to women and Anstee, to her surprise, passed through. There she met Ernie Bevin, the foreign secretary, and, more sensationally, the traitor Donald Maclean. 'I was the last person to see him the night he disappeared. Nobody ever questioned me about it. I had a very strange conversation with him when he said he wasn't going to be around the next day.' She switched to the UN and was rarely in England again but for a year as economics adviser to Harold Wilson at Number 10 under Lord Balogh. (She had taken an external degree in economics at London University, sitting the final exams in the British embassy in La Paz.) A round of increasingly senior postings took her through Latin America - she was in Chile during the Pinochet coup - and North Africa, whence she was detached to the relief operation following the Bangladesh flood of 1973. Later, from administrative posts in New York and Vienna she was flown out to co-ordinate aid after the Mexican earthquake, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the Kuwait oil-well fires. But Angola, she said, was the toughest job. With a limited mandate, small budget and inadequate manpower, the UN monitoring team she led was incapable of buttressing any accord reached by the government and the Unita rebels. Having chaired six weeks of negotiations and secured agreement on all but one of 38 points - the terms of Unita withdrawal - she was told there would be no UN troops available for at least six to nine months after a ceasefire. 'What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to say 'you are very good boys. Thankyou very much. Now be very good, stay where you are and if you really behave in nine months we will provide a nanny for you.'? 'A big danger is that rebels everywhere are looking at Bosnia and seeing what they can get away with.' Perhaps our hopes of the UN are much too ambitious, I said. 'No, I don't think they're too ambitious. It seems to me those hopes reflect what the UN ought to be doing. The problem is the hopes are not accompanied by a true political will to give the UN the wherewithal. 'Angola has some very important lessons for the UN. Member states in a way are half-hearted about peacekeeping. When it comes to the point they are not really ready to put up the mandate or the resources.' The UN secretariat was always under fire, she said. Seldom did critics remind themselves that it could do only what member states allowed it to. Margaret Anstee is the UN's first woman field officer, the first to become an under secretary-general and the first to head a peace-keeping mission. Her peripatetic career would have been impossible with husband and children. Was it a big sacrifice to make? 'I think in retrospect, yes. But you were not so conscious of it at the time.' You're going to live alone on Lake Titicaca, I said. Would it have been nice to have someone to take with you? 'Of course. But the person I would have liked to take is dead.' She paused. There were tears in her eyes. 'He died . . . in January, '91.' She was referring to Sir Robert Jackson, the Australian born UN under-secretary she met in the late 1960s and with whom she lived for 20 years. He was formerly married to the economist Barbara Ward. I apologised for upsetting her. 'That's alright,' she said. 'But let me add another thing. I have also had tremendous satisfactions. And I want to say this because everyone's hammering the UN. I don't regret it because I have met many marvellous people and I have had a very, very interesting life.' Can women bring something different to the job? 'Yes, I think they can. I'm all for women's advancement, but not in the sense of trying to ape the men and out-strip them at the their own game. Governments always had to have their arms twisted to accept me. But if you proved yourself afterwards, in some ways, it was easier for a woman.' Because men are putty in a woman's hands? She laughed. 'I wouldn't say that. Unita weren't exactly putty in my hands. Nor were the Angolan government, for that matter. But I think there is something in that. 'Savimbi always said to me 'We have a great respect for women and we regard you as the mother of this process.' Of course when I said things that did not please Unita, the wrath turned against the mother. 'Unita radio called me a prostitute, a smuggler of diamonds, a smuggler of mercury - I didn't know one could smuggle mercury - that I had arrived a poor woman and was leaving a rich one. And that a stray bullet would find me. 'Some on the government side said they were glad because a woman would show more sensitivity to the human suffering. 'These are simplistic views. There are many women who are completely impervious to human suffering just as there are many men who feel very strongly about it.' Margaret Anstee has faced death - her own as well as others. In Bolivia in 1964 her house came under fire because it was beside the city garrison. In Angola last October a nearby ammunition dump blew up and mortars rained on the UN compound. There was the death threat from Unita. 'Angola was a pretty awful experience. Chernobyl was awful too, in a different, very menacing way. To go into this place that was absolutely dead. It was frightening when you went into the reactor . . . ' Kuwait, she said, was 'like hell-fire, another dreadful demonstration of the awful things that human beings can do.' Chile was traumatic for the encounters with torture victims - and the torturers. 'In one week 1,000 people came in begging for UN protection. I had men on their knees throw their arms round my legs to say 'Don't put me out on the street.' Every day there were bodies in the river, and friends who disappeared. It was a terrible, terrible time. 'I think it was a watershed in my life. I had always thought of myself as an international civil servant, but then I realised there was a little bit of chauvinism inside me which said to me, when it was too awful to bear, 'Well, never mind dear, this couldn't possibly happen in England.' 'But Chile is one of the most cultivated places and the people have such a sense of humour. They can laugh at themselves, like us. When I saw what happened there I thought, my God, this could happen anywhere.' Did you start out a bright-eyed idealistic young woman? 'Very.' And how has the experience of these atrocities changed you? 'How can I sum it up? I have an awful feeling that we seem able to develop everything in life, particularly the technology and the weapons of destruction. The thing that just doesn't seem to develop is human nature. 'You ask me am I sorry I didn't have children. Yes, I am. But in some ways I'm sort of relieved . . . Yes, I was probably very foolishly idealistic and optimistic. I'm still optimistic because . . . ' One has no choice? 'One has no choice. Otherwise life just wouldn't be worth living. I don't want to give a message of despair because I think individual people can do so much.' It might have been her own citation.</p>

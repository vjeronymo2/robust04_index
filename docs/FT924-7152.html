			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Yellow Book of City rules revamped virtually a bible for corporate financiers - is being revamped to make it easier for users to find their way through its labyrinthine contents. Officially known as the London Stock Exchange's Admission of Securities to Listing (now rechristened The Listing Rules), this well-thumbed yellow binder has pride of place on bookshelves across the City. The rulebook, covering everything from applications for listings to directors' shareholdings, has been built up piecemeal, making it difficult to use. Many City customs and practices that have developed in recent years are not enshrined in it. The Stock Exchange yesterday published a draft of a new rulebook to general approval from corporate financiers. Included in the book for the first time is a clear statement of how the exchange plans to enforce its rules. This has traditionally been a difficult area, as its only formal sanction has been the draconian measure of suspending a company's listing. The exchange has now spelt out its intention to publicise what it considers breaches of the rules, and to censure company directors personally where they are at fault. Tucked away in the rewrite are at least two changes in practice. First, accountants and others who are not members of the Stock Exchange will be allowed for the first time to act as sponsors when companies issue shares. Second, listed companies will be allowed to send their shareholders summary versions of their listings particulars, saving on costs. 'They've done as well as they could be expected to do - it's not a major overhaul, but it's more logically set out,' said Mr Daniel Rosenberg, a corporate finance lawyer with City law firm Berwin Leighton. Copies of the draft have been sent to all listed companies, stockbrokers, merchant banks, accountancy and law firms. Further copies are available from Mr Patrick Morton at the Stock Exchange.</p>

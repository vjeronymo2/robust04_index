			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: GPA seeks to improve position in bank talks GPA GROUP is expected to outline its debt restructuring proposals at a meeting of its 73 banks on November 23. The world's biggest aircraft leasing company, with total debts of about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn), is talking to its banks as part of a complex series of discussions with creditors and suppliers to strengthen its financial position. Several of GPA's banks said yesterday that the successful resolution of negotiations with the suppliers, led by Boeing and Airbus Industrie, was essential if the company was to win support from bankers for rescheduling some of its debt payments. GPA, which is being advised by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, wants suppliers to defer delivering billions of dollars of aircraft the company has agreed to buy. In a separate development, GPA yesterday recovered 13 of its aircraft which were leased to VASP, Brazil's second leading airline after it failed to meet leasing payments of about Dollars 12m. When aircraft are seized in this way GPA has to find new leases before receiving revenue from the aircraft. One of GPA's principal bank lenders said yesterday the bank talks were triggered earlier this year after the company revised its revenue projections. A reduction in projected revenues led to a potential breach of its borrowing covenants. The banker said the potential breach postponed attempts by GPA to raise Dollars 752m from the sale of bonds backed by 18 aircraft leases, called ALPS 2. It helped scuttle an attempt to raise Dollars 350m from the sale of convertible preference shares before the end of the year. GPA said yesterday that if it succeeds in talks with banks and manufacturers an equity issue and the ALPS 2 would go ahead in the first quarter of 1993.</p>

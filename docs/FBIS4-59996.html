			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers held its regular meeting  this morning under the acting prime minister, Dr. Muhammad Sa'id  al-'Attar. The Council discussed issues on the agenda,  particularly reports presented to it on the military and  security situation and the economic, supply, and information  conditions under the current comprehensive national  confrontation of the plot of apostasy, rebellion, and secession,  which led the country to this situation with the aim of  realizing the secessionists' desire which is opposed to the  people and their unity and democracy, and undermining the  constitutional legitimacy.    After discussing the various reports, the Council expressed  its satisfaction with the great success of the brave Yemeni  Armed Forces who are defending unity and legitimacy in  confronting the forces of insurgency and secession. The Council  emphasized the tasks and duties which the various ministries and  departments of public utilities are expected to perform during  the present circumstances. Foremost of these tasks are tackling  and repairing the disorders which the insurgent secessionists  planned, and dealing with the living conditions and the economic  and supply situations in the country. This requires the  implementation of a speedy plan to make available all the  necessary needs of consumer goods in all the republic's  governorates.    The Council decided to continue its meetings. The next  session, which will be held tomorrow, will be devoted to  discussing the detailed work of the executive and administrative  sector and of each ministry. The Council agreed to the Civil  Service Ministry's proposals concerning the holidays for the two  great occasions, the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth  anniversary of the Yemeni Republic. The Council assigned each  minister the task of fixing these holidays in a manner that will  not affect the daily work in all ministries and public utilities  during the present circumstances.</p>

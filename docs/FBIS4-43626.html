			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] France has decided to intervene in Rwanda,  according to a joint communique issued by the President's Office  and the Prime Minister's Office.    France would like an international humanitarian operation to  be set up in Rwanda. Its aim would be to put an end to the  massacres and to save as many lives as possible.    According to the joint communique, France is establishing  all  the necessary diplomatic contacts. The French forces, together  with those of African and Western countries, which will join  them, will carry out their mission until the UNAMIR, the UN  Mission in Rwanda, is in a position to carry out the mandate  given by the Security Council. France has now decided to act  with the help of its natural allies. Ralph Pinto reports:    [Pinto] Paris does not want to be and cannot be on its own  as  far as this Rwandan crisis is concerned, given that the  agreement of the UN Security Council is necessary for  intervention. As early as Monday [20 June] or Tuesday a  resolution and a plan will be necessary: It is reported to be a  limited action of a humanitarian nature. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCC RETURNS INTERCEPTION 98 YARDS, WINS  </P> <P> It wasn't a record, but Lawrence Hatch's 98-yard interception return for a  touchdown changed the momentum in Orange Coast College's 24-19 victory over  Saddleback in a Mission Conference football game Saturday at OCC.  </P> <P> Hatch, a sophomore defensive back, was a yard short of the OCC record. Mike  Lacy (1973) and Bill Craft (1986) each returned interceptions 99 yards for  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Hatch's interception occurred with Orange Coast leading, 10-7, but Saddleback  was driving. On second and five at the OCC 16, Hatch stepped in front of a  Saddleback receiver and caught the ball. He started up the middle, then cut to  the left sideline and ran nearly untouched into the end zone.  </P> <P> Orange Coast scored later in the second quarter to take a 24-7 halftime lead.  Saddleback scored a touchdown in the each of the final two quarters, the last  with 52 seconds left.  </P> <P> Saddleback quarterback Jeff Bailey completed a 28-yard scoring pass to Terry  Isles, but the two-point conversion pass fell incomplete. Saddleback's onside  kick went out of bounds at the OCC 37, and the Pirates ran out the clock.  </P> <P> "Our defense made some big plays," OCC Coach Bill Workman said. "We stayed  conservative the second half and played the clock some. We won, and that's what  is important."  </P> <P> OCC (5-2, 4-2) was coming off a 43-15 loss to Rancho Santiago in which the  Pirates turned the ball over seven times. They turned the ball over only twice  against Saddleback, both on interceptions by Mike Miller.  </P> <P> Saddleback's four-game winning streak was stopped. Each team is 1-1 in Central  Division play.  </P> <P> OCC took the opening kickoff and drove to the Saddleback 16 but settled for a  31-yard field goal by Mike Wade.  </P> <P> Saddleback (4-3, 4-2) came back with a 14-play, 82-yard scoring drive that  ended on a two-yard dive by Matt Carvalho that made it 7-3.  </P> <P> OCC quarterback Greg Angelovic then led a 58-yard drive that he capped with a  four-yard run for a touchdown to give OCC a 10-7 lead with 12:10 left in the  half. Hatch's interception came at 10:47.  </P> <P> OCC scored its final touchdown on a one-yard run by Jim Warren with 3:49 left  to take a 24-7 lead. Angelovic was 11 for 16 for 173 yards, and his favorite  targets were tight ends Derek Whiddon and Mark Rapp. Whiddon had six catches  for 81 yards and Rapp had two for 53 yards.  </P> <P> Saddleback's Chi Chi Biehn scored on a one-yard run with 2:21 left in the third  quarter, but the extra-point attempt by Scott Hannah was wide and OCC led,  24-13.  </P> <P> Bailey was 18 for 31 for 210 yards, but three passes were intercepted.  </P></p>

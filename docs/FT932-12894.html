			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Insurance costs expected to rise CITY businesses could face big rises in insurance costs following Saturday's bomb attack, even though the government is expected to meet a large part of the bill. Increases are almost inevitable because the cost of the damage is likely to exceed Pounds 300m, exhausting available insurance funds of Pool Re, the specialist reinsurer set up by UK insurance companies earlier this year to cover terrorism risk. Insurers will provide some reinsurance for Pool Re, with the government guaranteeing all other claims. 'Unquestionably it looks like higher rates,' said Mr Alan Fleming, executive director of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), which represents more than 300 insurance buyers. Mr Tony Baker, public affairs manager for the Association of British Insurers (ABI), also suggested increases were likely, with City businesses bearing most of the burden. Mr Fleming suggested it might become necessary to make the purchase of terrorism insurance compulsory, possibly through the imposition of a standard levy on all commercial insurance policies. He said: 'The danger is that we will price some people out of the market. It has to be paid for one way or another. The only solution is to broaden it.' It also emerged that a number of insurance companies could be badly hit by claims on policies sold before terrorism was excluded from covers. Royal Insurance and others have reinsurance in place to protect these exposures. But it is understood that some other companies are unprotected. Business has had to pay more to protect itself from terrorist attack since insurers withdrew cover from standard commercial insurance policies last year after sustaining losses of more than Pounds 300m from last April's bomb attack in the City. Additional premiums for terrorist cover are collected by insurers and fed into Pool Re. Pool Re meets all claims until its funds - relying on total premiums of between Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m each year - are used up. Insurers then contribute an additional tranche of cover equal to 10 per cent of premiums collected by Pool Re. Beyond this level the government meets all claims, acting as a reinsurer of last resort. The DTI said yesterday the government would stand by these commitments even though Pool Re has still not been authorised. Funds paid to it are being held by insurers in specially earmarked accounts. Even under present arrangements cover is expensive, especially for companies in high-risk areas. The owners of a central London office block worth Pounds 100m in central London might expect to pay Pounds 50,000 for terrorism insurance, according to the ABI.</p>

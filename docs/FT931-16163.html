			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Letter: Education for mature students too, not just an elite of teenagers Sir, While agreeing with much of your editorial on higher education policy ('University challenge', January 5), some comments seem not to appreciate changes in the student population over the past decade. The view that higher education is 'giving teenagers a first chance to live away from home' ignores the fact that the majority of those enrolling on courses are now classified by the Department of Education as mature students, over the age of 21, most of whom will have contributed as taxpayers towards the cost of their maintenance. In addition, the decision to concentrate extra funding on 'further education for 16-19-year-olds' fails to note that although most full-time students in further education may be school-leavers, the majority of enrolments in most colleges are from adults following part-time opportunities. The establishment of a broader system of lifelong learning is envisaged in the National Education and Training Targets, devised by the Confederation of British Industry and endorsed by the TUC and government. Whether or not the FT subscribes to this solution, your readers are not well-served by an assessment of the problems facing further and higher education which sees post-compulsory education as a finishing school for an elite cohort of teenagers. Determining the relative contributions which individuals, employers and the state should make towards meeting the costs of learning is complex enough without concern about a 'right to study away from home', which is increasingly irrelevant to adult learners.

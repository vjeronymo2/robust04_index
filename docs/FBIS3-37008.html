The guest  on "Live Dialogue" today is Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov, the  first president of the Republic of Crimea. May I congratulate  you on your election and wish you all the best.    [Meshkov] Thank you, Andrey Georgiyevich.    [Skryabin] I would like to introduce my colleagues working  with me in the studio today. They are Lyudmila Olegovna Telen,  commentator for the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI newspaper, and Yuliy  Aleksandrovich Semenov, commentator for Mayak radio. I am  Andrey Skryabin, commentator for Ostankino television. [passage  omitted]    Your questions, please.    [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, you have become the first  president of the Republic of Crimea within the composition of  Ukraine. All the same, however, everyone knows that the  disputes surrounding Crimea's status have not yet abated. They  were especially acute during your electoral campaign. Every  candidate running for this top post had his own special view on  the status of Crimea. How do you see this status, and how do  you intend to act?    [Meshkov] The status is defined in the Constitution of the  Republic of Crimea--the Constitution that was adopted on 6 May  1992. Then, as you know, there were some changes in the contents  of the Constitution. There were some illegal changes, but the  genuine and first Constitution of the Republic of Crimea says  that mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine  are built on the basis of treaties and agreements. These are  reasonable, normal, and civilized relations between republics.    [Skryabin] Continuing from what you have just said, there is  persistent talk in the media--in Ukraine, in particular--about a  federal and territorial organization of Ukraine. How do you see  the possibility of such a federal organization of Ukraine and,  accordingly, of Crimea being part of the federation?    [Meshkov] Well, first of all, this is economically based,  and there is an economic need for the federalization of Ukraine.  Initially, the idea was rejected completely, but now it is  winning support in Ukraine. I expect the Kuchma-Grinev bloc  will use a similar proposal to reorganize the state. The bloc  is gathering strength, and obviously there will be a chance to  implement this proposed federal organization of Ukraine.    [Telen] Do you expect that, in that case, some sort of  federation treaty would be signed within a Ukrainian framework,  or would the relations between Kiev and the future territories  be built on the basis of some sort of bilateral relations?    [Meshkov] Well, that is the Ukrainian leadership's problem,  and the way the question is solved will depend on which forces  win at the elections for the Supreme Soviet and then for the  Ukrainian president.    [Semenov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, I would like to join my  question with a comment by viewer Mukhamed Minachev, a  Muscovite. [passage omitted]    He makes an interesting remark: It is one thing to be a  candidate and to make biting statements during an election  campaign, and another when you become an elected president who  has to make responsible decisions. People following events  closely have noted a certain change in the nuances of your  position. For instance, your electoral campaign focused on the  idea of Crimean independence. How do you think this idea looks  now, and how can it be implemented? [passage omitted]    [Meshkov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, the question already  contains  part of the answer: Naturally, I have a lesser degree of freedom  now. It is sad but true that an official has less opportunity  to make frank--or if you like, sharp--statements. They have to  correspond more to the real political situation, and they must  take into account anticipated changes in the situation. This  responsibility leaves less room for maneuver. That does not  mean, however, renouncing declared principles and aims. The  methods and forms of implementation may undergo certain changes,  but not the content. [passage omitted]    [Telen] All the same, let us come back to the referendum  question. What is your attitude toward this idea? How  realistic is its implementation? And, perhaps the most acute  question, what does Crimean independence mean if the question is  put to a referendum?    [Meshkov] It is as realistic as the implementation of a law  on a referendum is realistic. The question of independence is  not being posed at the level of independence as separation. It  is based on a directly opposite idea--the separation or tendency  toward separation of the Ukrainian economy from the Russian  economy. We stated quite emphatically right from the outset  that this would be ruinous for Ukraine. Reality has more than  confirmed even our most gloomy fears. What is now happening to  the Ukrainian economy is hard to bear for both the people of  Ukraine and the people of Crimea.    The question is formulated as follows, however: Are you in  favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in union with other  states? The main point in holding a referendum and implementing  its results lies precisely in the words at the end of the  question: in union with other states. That is to say, this is  our natural and understandable economically-based desire to be  united with the economic zone of Russia and the CIS countries  and Ukraine too, but on a fundamentally new basis, which takes  the interests of the Republic of Crimea into account to a  maximum degree.    [Skryabin] Thank you, and my colleagues -- and, Yuriy  Aleksandrovich, permit me to read out a number of questions,  which have come from television viewers and I have put together.    [Meshkov] Please do, I am ready.    [Skryabin] Georgiy Alekseyevich Tukhmanov from Moscow asks  whether you are not worried about finding yourself in the  situation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh  and that that is where it started too -- if Karabakh was given  to Azerbaijan in 1921 then the Crimea was given by Khrushchev in  1956. Please respond to this analogy put to you respectfully  from the Muscovite Tukhmanov -- this is his question.    [Meshkov] Dear Georgiy Alekseyevich, my reply to you will be  as follows: Unfortunately, you have been affected by a campaign  around Crimea that is on the conscience of certain people  working in the media, a campaign to compare the situation in  Crimea with the hot spots on the territory of the former USSR.    There are no grounds whatsoever for this. Thank God, there  are no preconditions whatsoever for even the possibility of such  a situation evolving in Crimea. I am sure now, especially now,  when the people of Crimea expressed their will unanimously --  you know the figures, of course, what powerful support the first  Crimean president and his program received -- this rules out any  precondition whatsoever for this inside Crimea.    As for outside, there is a danger of some forces outside  Crimea imposing some instability on us and making attempts to  organize confrontation. But these forces are so insignificant  and odious that one is not really seriously afraid of them.    So, Georgiy Alekseyevich, you can plan your next vacation in  Crimea. I invite you and your family to Crimea which is and  will be peaceful, completely peaceful.    [Skryabin] That is if you have enough money.    [Meshkov] Well, that is another matter.    [Skryabin] Yuriy Alekseyevich Tkachenko gives his phone  number: How will you form your team? I have experience of  high-level work in the state administration, I am a Crimean, I  am 42-years-old, and am ready to work with you. So how will  you form your team?    [Meshkov] I can tell Yuriy Alekseyevich and everyone else  that the main criterion of selection is professionalism. My  political opponents are stating that the Russia block that I  represented in the presidential elections does not have its own  team. Now it can be said completely calmly: There is a team.  Authoritative experts, well-known in Russia, have agreed to  take part in the program of emergence of the economy of the  Crimea. And of course, your proposal and the proposals of all  those who wish the Crimean Republic well, and who have the  forces and intention to carry out their potential in the Crimea,  are in the surprising and unique situation now when everyone can  give real help and support. We are ready to accept this help  and place it in any organization -- the government,  administration of the president -- wherever you can show  yourself to your maximum. And thank you for your offer.    [Telen] Could I continue a bit? You said that talks were  already being conducted with some people about joining your team  and you said these were well-known names. Could you name them?    [Meshkov] You know, I have an urge to present everything  literally and share my joy above all with my compatriots in the  Crimean Republic and with my compatriots in Russia. But allow  me nevertheless, to restrain myself a little. My Moscow program  is not yet exhausted and when it is entirely fulfilled I will be  able to answer that question.    [Simenov] I think our conversation started rather rosily. I  hear you saying that the Crimea is so quiet, come and visit us  and so on. But surely you have a crime problem that has in fact  grown into a problem of terrorism...    [Meshkov, interrupting] Politic...    [Simenov, continuing]...even political terrorism, and if you  will excuse me, even you were hunted by such terrorists. What  can you say about this and how do you intend to resolve this  problem?    [Meshkov] Yuliy Aleksandrovich, the fact is the hunters and  the prey have swapped places since 30 January. And there is  every reason, and I can with full responsibility assure all  Russians, that by the start of the spa season everything in this  sense will be quiet.    It was not a crime problem. It was not a political terrorism  problem. It was a problem of power -- fragile, helpless,  incapable of reacting to change in the surrounding situation.  They were people who were always placed in the hierarchical  pyramid of power where they were sheltered from above and  carried out everything from above, taking it down to the lower  strata of the pyramid, but who never took and could not take  responsibility upon themselves and could not react to change in  the surrounding situation. They could not do anything with that  avalanche of crime and outburst of political terrorism which  yes, unfortunately, did take place in the Crimea. All that will  be stopped by the toughest methods, well of course in the  framework of...    [Simenov, interrupting] They were professionals acting on  political orders?    [Meshkov] Yes.    [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, our paper wrote widely about  the murder of Andrey Lazebnikov, the Black Sea Fleet press  secretary. Naturally, MOSCOW NEWS readers are interested now in  how the investigation of this crime is progressing. It was  specifically this murder that was evidence of the terror that  existed, as you said, in the Crimea. Could you give a more  detailed account of it?    [Meshkov] It is premature to give the details because  I--restricted by my professional limitations, one could  say--cannot talk extensively about an investigation that has not  been concluded. This is the more so because the results of an  investigation are summed up by the court, as you know. I can  say, however, that there is no doubt that it was a political  act. There is no doubt that professionals were involved, and  attempts were made during the initial stages of the  investigation to prevent the officials of the Russian federal  services from investigating this case. I can assure you,  however, that the presidential administration, and now the state  bodies of the republic of Crimea, will give the maximum  necessary assistance in investigating, searching for, and  punishing the criminals that organized and carried out this act  of political terror.    [Skryabin] I see, Lyudmila, that you have a large set of  questions on the economy. Nonetheless, this set of questions  from our television viewers is, evidently, a considerably larger  one, as I can show you now. These are questions connected with  the problem of the Tatars, the Crimean Tatars. So I will take  the liberty of reading out several questions on behalf of the  television viewers that I will ask you to answer.    Idrisov, from the town of Yevpatoriya: Are you going to  apologize to the Crimean Tatars for the ethnic genocide carried  out by the hand of Moscow in May 1944, as Mr. Kohl has done to  the world concerning the Germans? Do you recognize the right of  the Crimean Tatars to self-determination? The Crimea is  multinational, like Moscow, Ufa, and Kazan, but each nation has  a state, a motherland. For the Crimean Tatars, it is the Crimea.    Arkadiy Nikolayevich Semenov asks what your attitude is  toward the slogans that can be seen in the Crimea, such as: No  to the totalization of the Crimea! Do you not think that this  is a fascist slogan?    Ernest Kudusov: Does Mr. Meshkov intend to strive to gain  the  acknowledgement and respect of the indigenous contingent of the  Crimean population? It voted against him. If that is his  intention, what steps is he going to take? What solution do you  envisage for the settlement of the Crimean Tatar problem?    Well, there are many other questions. Galina Romanovna  Batskevich: What does the Crimean president think about  relations with a small, indigenous Crimean people--the Crimean  Tatars?    Ismet Khalyukovich Sheykh-Zade asks how you envisage  relations with the indigenous people? Well, and so on. Is  there a program for the return of the Crimean Tatars? There are  many, many more questions.    [Meshkov] it is an extremely serious question because it  touches upon the most painful and sensitive--and widely  exploited-- ethnic feelings. I can say to Mr. Idrisov that  neither Moscow, nor I, as Crimean president, nor the citizens of  the Republic of Crimea have any reasons for apologizing for  those illegal measures in which he sees the hand of Moscow. It  was not the hand of Moscow, but an absolutely concrete policy of  the thing that we call a totalitarian regime. The situation has  no comparison with the situation of Mr. Kohl and the German  people.    The Republic of Crimea is a multinational republic. There is  no reason to single out or isolate any ethnic group on any  grounds. We would never have achieved peace and accord in the  Crimea. We have achieved these, and the president and the  state authorities will make every effort to preserve this  national peace. The basis for it is an equal attitude toward  all the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, without exceptions.  There can be no question of us singling out an ethnic group  and, moreover, giving it political powers on the grounds of its  ethnicity. I have not seen the slogan--No to the Tatarization  of the Crimea--in all the time that I have lived in the Crimea  on any wall or any poster, and I travel all the time. So let  Mr. Semenov have this slogan that he cited on his conscience.    As for the claim that the Crimean Tatars unanimously voted  against the Russia bloc representative and against me as a  candidate for the presidency of the Republic of Crimea, this is  an erroneous statement and does not correspond to the facts.  Moreover, I can say that numerous branches and groups within  the Crimean Tatars' national movement openly proclaimed their  support. They were openly saying that they supported my  candidacy. At some polling stations, thousands out of a  2,000-strong [figure as heard] electorate, thousands of Crimean  Tatars voted for me. This is a problem of relations between the  powers that have gone and the bosses of the Crimean national  movement and the leadership of the Majles. That is their  problem. It is not a problem of relations between the president  and the Crimean Tatars, citizens of the republic of Crimea.    This is because in the presidential administration--and I  can  say this--key posts are occupied by Professor Memetov, whom I  deeply respect and who is in charge of a very important part of  the administration. (Anife Situmer Kyzy Ilyasova) is in one of  the key posts. This is normal and should be so, and it is. As  to what future decision will be made and whether there is a  program, I, in particular, demanded that such a program should  be adopted. I demanded that the process of the return of the  Crimean Tatars should be based on an officially adopted program.  It was not adopted, and with the exception of sops that were  even insulting to some extent-- nothing was implemented.    I have said before and I can confirm now that the state  must compensate for damage it inflicted on its citizens and for  the damage it inflicted on the citizens of the Republic of  Crimea--on the Crimean Tatar nationality, in particular. This  is one of the topics at the talks I am having here in Moscow. I  do not know yet. I cannot tell you what the final result will  be. I have asked, however, for 50 billion rubles for this  program.    [Skryabin] Thank you.    [Semenov] Lets talk about the economy. One of your slogans  during the election campaign was the wish to set up direct  economic ties with Russia, to enrich them, and maybe even to  join the ruble zone. How do you envisage this? In particular,  do you see the ruble as a national monetary unit? And what  about the karbovanets? Do you understand what can happen to the  Crimean financial market if both currencies are used  simultaneously? And, in general, what is the general concept,  at least the main points?    [Meshkov] I understand, Yuliy Aleksandrovich. I gather from  your question that you are more concerned, not with what will  happen to the ruble, but with what will happen to the  karbovanets? That is nearer the truth. Well, so far they will  circulate simultaneously. The Kiev administration and a top  official have agreed to the circulation of the ruble in the  Crimea. We have drawn up and prepared all that is needed for  the implementation of the program for the ruble to be a means of  payment in the Crimea. So the preparations can proceed  smoothly, and I hope no political intrigues over the Crimea will  hinder the restoration of Crimea's economy and the presence of  the ruble in our republic. There is already a bank for this  presence....    [Semenov, interrupting] I just wanted to ask what are the  functions of the bank?    [Meshkov, continuing] ... with its definite functions, the  function of monitoring money circulation in the Crimea, the  function of permission, i.e. the registration of banks of other  republics on Crimean territory. With respect to the budget and  the taxes, all 100 percent will remain in the Republic of  Crimea. Only the joint programs of Ukraine and the Crimea will  be financed. Such will be the first steps.    [Semenov] That is a precedent.    [Meshkov] I hope that this will help to implement the  general  tendencies that unite the economic space. This will happen  inevitably. The Republic of Crimea is marching forward.    [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, excuse me, but I do not quite  understand the setup for Crimea's entry into the ruble zone,  because an accord with Kiev allowing the use of a parallel  currency is one thing, while agreement with Russia is something  else. After all, Russia is the center issuing the currency, and  apparently you are counting on receiving rubles from Russia.    [Meshkov] Well, naturally there is nowhere else to get them,  but we will not be obtaining them through any issues by the  Central Bank of Russia. We will be getting them as a result of  normal economic relations--by fulfilling orders, providing  services to the Navy, and marketing, say, those material values  that will be freed as a result of conversion. This will include  the supply of our own goods and our own agricultural produce and  also, I hope, a strong influx of tourists and what we call  holidaymakers, with their rubles, during the holiday period in  Crimea.    Indeed, everyone with cash rubles will feel very comfortable  since the exchange relationship of the ruble to the coupon is,  as you know, approximately at a ratio of one ruble to 30  coupons. That is to say, all of this will help us to tackle  this problem without holding out our hand and without  sacrificing Russia's good relationship toward Crimea to the need  for issuing currency and to a complication of the economic  situation in Russia. This is all a chain of actions steadily  bringing us back into a unified economic zone without any  complication of the situation in Russia and without any conflict  situations in Crimea.    [Skryabin] Following on from that question, what should come  via you?    [Meshkov] Since the fleet is situated on the territory of  the  Republic of Crimea, the financing of the fleet should naturally  be via the Republic of Crimea. [passage omitted]    I regard it as my primary duty to defend the legal rights  and  interests of the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, and what  strength I have will be put into carrying out that defense,  above all, in the economic sphere. [passage omitted]    [Telen] All the same, let me go back to the ruble zone. Have  any, at least preliminary, talks been held with the Russian  leadership, with the Russian Government, with the financial  circles and the Russian bank on the introduction of the ruble in  Crimea?    [Meshkov] This program has been talked about with  specialists  of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Crimea. The specialists  have reached agreement and have devised a unified and  streamlined program. It will be implemented with the help of  Ukrainian specialists and Ukrainian banks and by relying on the  Ukrainian economy. Of course, it will be done primarily by  relying on Russian banks--by that, I mean commercial banks--and  on relations with the Russian economy and Russian specialists.    [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, I am sorry to be so  persistent,  but are these specialists or officials?    [Meshkov] Lyudmila Olegovna. Until we have finally decided  the press release and the communique on the results of the  talks, I (?cannot) answer this question. I realize that it  worries and concerns you. It worries the citizens of Crimea  just as much; however, I can reassure them. The fact is that  results have been achieved that exceed the hopes with which I  went to Moscow. [passage omitted]    [Semenov] How do you see the future of the fleet? And, in  your idea of the structure of Crimea, do you think there is a  special role or special status for Sevastopol? [passage omitted]    [Meshkov] Regarding the problem of the fleet, I was  reproached for saying one thing before the election campaign and  subsequently making a completely contrary statement. My remarks  to the effect that the problem of the fleet had been resolved by  the presidents were cited. The problem of the fleet has indeed  been resolved by the presidents. I mean the Massandra  agreement. However, it has to be implemented. If the principle  of international law that treaties should be implemented exists  and is recognized by the Ukrainian leadership, then this treaty,  this agreement, should be implemented. It envisages a single  Russian Black Sea Fleet.    This fully reflects the interests of the Republic of Crimea.  Our naval seamen--we will not divide them--will have the  maximum protection that is provided for citizens of the Republic  of Crimea. Regarding the Sevastopol permit system, it is  unnatural, abnormal. We will, of course, be removing this  abnormality.    The issue of dual citizenship is urgent and will be resolved  by a law on dual citizenship. This, of course, requires  coordination with the Russian Federation. Russia put forward an  initiative long ago. The Ukrainian Government has a draft on  dual citizenship proposed by Russia, but it has been put on the  back burner and has not yet been examined. I think the Republic  of Ukraine could resolve the citizenship problem more quickly.  [passage omitted]    [Telen] Is the Crimean leadership willing to some extent to  share the burden of some of these problems with Russia? Does  Crimea have the financial resources?    [Meshkov] Regarding financial resources, let me say  straightaway that it does not. As for sharing the burden of  maintaining the Black Sea Fleet, yes, it will. Crimea is as  committed as possible to this because the presence of the Black  Sea Fleet in the Republic of Crimea is a guarantee, a long-term  guarantee, of stability and peace in Crimea. [passage omitted]    [Telen] Some of Russia's nationalistic organizations see  Crimea as a base for themselves and a chance to apply their  forces. How dangerous is Russian nationalism to Crimea?    [Meshkov] Fortunately--and thank God that I live in Crimea  and that the citizens of our republic also live in Crimea--a  thousand years of Crimean history prove that Crimea has never  had what is described as interethnic strife. All waves of  nationalism, irrespective of where they came from, subsided on  approach to Crimea. They found no support here. The  nationalistic forces can count on no support at all, or on the  support of 3 percent of the people at the most, if the  circumstances are extremely favorable. There is no nationalism  in Crimea, and there never will be, God forbid.    [Skryabin] Can I ask you the last question? It is not a very  serious question, but I think it might be of interest to many  people. During the August 1991 putsch, you were the first  person who tried to get into Gorbachev's dacha. As far as I  know, they simply did not let the future Crimean president in.    [Meshkov] They even arrested me.    [Skryabin] Yes, arrested you. What is happening now to  Gorbachev's dacha? Presidents seem to be superstitious, and  nobody wants to move in. Nonetheless, something is going to be  done with it, right?    [Meshkov] Nobody, including me, wants to live in Mikhail  Sergeyevich's dacha. I really tried to help him against the  will of our Supreme Soviet and its head. Moreover, I even  resorted to open insults. I told them: It is your general  secretary there, after all. Forget that you are officials and  act as communists at least. You must change the situation, and  you must help him. Mikhail Sergeyevich was probably aware who  did what--when and how. Yes, I was actually arrested during  that attempt, but everything turned out all right.    The interest in Gorbachev's dacha in Crimea is very great.  It should, of course, belong wholly to the Crimean Republic.  At present, it is not used for recreational purposes, and no  one wants to use it as a holiday place. As for us--I mean the  Crimean republic--we should do everything we can to turn it into  a site for the general public. Such interest and such attention  exist. After all, people should be allowed to see what they  want to see. Gorbachev's dacha should be opened to the public,  since it is no longer an individual's property but a symbol of  the entire period in our history. The Crimea is rich in symbols  and monuments, and this one should be added to them. [passage  omitted]    [Skryabin] A question from Anna Grigoryevna Kulakova. Do you  think that the same tactics are used both in Abkhazia and in  Crimea-- namely, first to cut off these territories and then  hand them over to Russia?    [Meshkov] I do not think so. This is not the expansionism  and imperial manner of the Russia of the past, but a natural  desire of the former regions and the present regions that are  detached from the single economic area. This is an economic  problem. If this problem is resolved, all political problems  will disappear. [passage omitted]    I would like to answer a question that you have given to me.  [reads questions] Who are you going to be with: Russia, or  Ukraine, or on your own? Give a detailed answer, please.    The independence of the Crimean republic is a guarantee that  we will resolve our economic problems.    [Skryabin] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, as we agreed with you, you  have one minute left until the end of the program to say what  you want.    [Meshkov] Esteemed Russians, dear citizens of the Crimean  republic. I would like to share with you the feeling of joy  that I have experienced during my stay here. I have been given  an extremely welcome reception here, and I have experienced an  extremely cordial attitude here. I would like to stress that  all this will soon be implemented in specific steps in the  sphere of culture and in the sphere of strengthening our  indissoluble ties. I thank everybody who has been watching the  program and also its participants. Thank you.    [Skryabin] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, thank you for making time  to  attend our program. I thank our viewers for their questions.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to answer all questions sent  to us, but I will hand them over to you, if you do not mind.  All the best.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> BUILDING BAN PROPOSED  </P> <P> Two councilmen, complaining of inadequate building codes, have proposed a  short-term moratorium on residential and commercial construction.  </P> <P> Councilmen James C. Hodge Jr. and Dick Richards last week brought up the  proposal, which may come to a vote Wednesday.  </P> <P> "What has become very apparent is that most city (building and planning) codes,  while they give a guideline, have been inadequate," Hodge said.  </P> <P> The idea of a temporary ban stems from a recent controversy about the  development of a two-story office building at the intersection of Fremont  Avenue and Huntington Drive, he said. The council earlier this month voted 4 to  1 to approve the project, with Richards dissenting. But Hodge said he "agreed  (with Richards that) it was a nightmarish process for the public, council and  developer as well."  </P> <P> The ban, to last at least 45 days, would give city officials time to come up  with code revisions concerning density, design, height, and size of residential  and commercial projects, the councilmen said. Hodge said he hopes the city will  also create a design review committee.  </P></p>

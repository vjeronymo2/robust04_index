			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cautionary tale for investors - Porton International's disappointing record Porton International, the biotechnology company with a disappointing record which provides a cautionary tale for potential investors in the sector, is close to a decision to put itself up for sale. The privately owned company has engaged merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson to examine whether other pharmaceutical businesses might be interested in buying it. A stock market flotation is another option likely to be considered. The aim of the initiative is to provide a possible escape route for institutional investors which put Pounds 76m into Porton during the 1980s on the basis of profits projections which the company has failed to deliver. In its last full year in 1992 Porton turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 49.1m. Several of the investors have expressed disappointment that the company failed to live up to early expectations. But following management changes at Porton the investors now say they are relatively confident about its immediate future. One investor said: 'There has been a sea change in the way the company is being run. There is a much greater willingness to tell shareholders what is happening and it's got much better credibility with customers.' Another investor said: 'There's no doubt that collectively a lot of institutions made a mistake in backing this company in the way we did but we are generally more hopeful now.' Porton was set up in 1982 by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie, its former chairman. He stepped down from executive responsibilities nearly two years ago after a series of discussions with shareholders and other executives. Mr Haydon-Baillie's replacement as chairman is Lord Chilver, who is chairman of English China Clays and is the former head of the Cranfield Institute of Technology. Mr Haydon-Baillie, who still owns about a third of the company, raised the finance for Porton from several big institutional investors including Legal and General, Sun Alliance, Lloyds Bank and the pension funds of British Telecom, Imperial Chemical Industries and the Post Office. He raised eyebrows by selling some of his shares in Porton to other investors in 1986 for Pounds 24m. In 1987 and 1988 he obtained dividend payments from the company totalling some Pounds 1.1m, in addition to drawing a salary of about Pounds 95,000 a year. Porton was considered unusual among biotechnology companies in the UK and US for the large amount of cash which it raised early in its life and the fact that the founder was able to make a lot of money out of the company before the company had proved itself. The company placed much store in its early financial projections on an anti-herpes medication which took longer than expected to develop and then four years ago failed to prove effective in clinical trials. Partly as a result of this setback, the company failed by a long chalk to achieve the profit of Pounds 140.6m in 1990 which investors had been told in a planning document issued in 1985 might be achievable. The company became a byword for spending large sums of money on its opulent office in Mayfair and also on salaries. Mr John Burke, the company's former chief executive who left last August, was paid Pounds 450,000 in 1989, putting him among the top 50 UK manufacturing executives that year in terms of salary. As part of his settlement with the company on his departure Mr Burke received a payment of Pounds 650,000 which will be charged to the accounts in the second half of last year. Mr Haydon-Baillie also caused a stir by employing a personal security adviser, a former member of the Special Air Service, to ward off inquiries from journalists. This dislike for publicity meant that several shareholders in the mid 1980s accused the company of excessive secrecy. They said this made it hard for them to find out details of the company's progress. Mr Tony Gover, a long-time business associate of Mr Haydon-Baillie who helped him set up Porton and is the company's vice chairman, says the company is trying to put such problems behind it and adopt a more conventional management style. 'We are in a different era now,' he says. Mr Alistair Stokes, brought in as chief operating officer in 1992 from Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, says: 'We may not have such a big future as we thought at one time, but it's still a bright future.' One of the changes is that the company has established quarterly meetings with its shareholders in London and Edinburgh to keep them informed. As for its products, rather than emphasising the development of new medicines, the company is concentrating on cranking up sales of its portfolio of drugs mainly aimed at hospital use for treating relatively rare conditions. These include Dysport, a medicine used to treat neuromuscular conditions, and Erwinase for leukaemia. The company also makes a range of vaccines, for use mainly in the defence industry for protection against certain kinds of chemical warfare agents, and has research agreements to exploit scientific advances at St George's Medical School in London and the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Kleinwort Benson is due to finish its review this spring. Among the options likely to be considered for Porton are a merger with another drugs group or a flotation on the stock exchange. One person close to the discussions said he would 'be surprised' if a bigger pharmaceutical company failed to express some interest in bidding for the group. A pharmaceuticals analyst said: 'As a small vertically integrated pharmaceuticals operation, with a range of facilities from research laboratories to tried and tested production plants, Porton has been quite successful. 'It's a different image to the one Porton was trying to project at one stage as a developer of world beating medicines, but it's probably more realistic.'</p>

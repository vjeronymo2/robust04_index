			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Brierley up 25% on the back of NZ subsidiaries BRIERLEY Investments yes-terday announced a 25 per cent lift in profits in the half year to NZDollars 112.7m (USDollars 59.6m), largely due to higher earnings from its New Zealand subsidiaries. The chairman, Mr Bob Matthew, said the group's biggest investment, the UK hotel group Mount Charlotte, in which Brierley Investments has a 70 per cent interest, recorded a modest profit of Pounds 2.1m (USDollars 3m) after a substantial loss in the previous year. UK earnings were NZDollars 5m compared with NZDollars 123m last year which included the subsequently-sold motor division Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn. Mr Matthew said while the earnings from Mount Charlotte were clearly an inadequate return on funds employed, the profit turnround came in the face of a Pounds 8.8m or 3.9 per cent reduction in turnover. He said the result reflected improving margins, static operating costs and significantly lower interest charges. Brierley Investments also had a profit turnround from its Australian investments, earning NZDollars 23m against a loss of NZDollars 15m in the comparable period of 1991. However, it incurred a loss of NZDollars 4m in the US, against a profit of NZDollars 19m in the previous period. Late last year the company announced its intention to withdraw from the US. Profits from its New Zealand operations were NZDollars 189m against NZDollars 190m. Mr Matthew said trading profits in New Zealand at NZDollars 124m were up NZDollars 18m.</p>

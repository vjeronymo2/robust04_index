			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin does not believe that the "irreconcilable opposition"  who hold rallies in Moscow streets is a real force. The true  opposition is being formed in the Russian State Duma,  presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told reporters on  Thursday.    "The irreconcilable opposition is very small and is of  marginal character. These forces are a byproduct of political  life, have no social support and resort to harsh language  because of that", Kostikov said, but added that this does not  mean that Yeltsin sees no danger of political extremism.    Yeltsin believes that "the true opposition is currently  being  formed in the State Duma which is a normal phenomenon",  according to Kostikov. The president is ready to hold  discussions with it, but if the Duma encroaches on his powers  the "attempts will be cut short", the spokesman warned.    Yeltsin believes that relations with Duma have a favourable  character in general, but regrets that the lower chamber has  spent much time discussing its privileges rather than lawbills.  There are "elements inherited from the tactics of the former  Supreme Soviet which consisted in unlimited expansion of  functions of deputies and of the legislative body", Kostikov  said and added that at present "the State Duma is cautiously  intervening into the powers of the executive authority". The  president has so far quietly reacted to that and sent a letter  to the Duma with his remarks.    Yeltsin believes that the situation has become more stable  in  the country after the signing of the civic accord treaty.  "Political forces which stand for accord are undoubtedly  dominating the forces of confrontation and political revenge",  Kostikov said.</p>

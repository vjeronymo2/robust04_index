			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Strike over job cut plans paralyses SEAT plants THOUSANDS of SEAT motor workers shut down assembly lines yesterday in their third strike in protest at job cuts at the company's Zona Franca plant, AP reports from Barcelona. Unions called the 24-hour strike in opposition to plans by Volkswagen, SEAT's owner, to stop producing vehicles at the Barcelona factory. Company officials confirmed that all their production facilities - in Zona Franca, Pamplona, Martorell and El Prat - were paralysed by the walkout. The unions also called on workers at SEAT dealers and suppliers to stop work, but it was not immediately known how widely that call had been heeded. VW purchased SEAT from the Spanish government in 1986, but has seen its subsidiary's sales decline sharply. Sales plunged 19 per cent in the first 10 months of this year. Losses are expected to reach Pta100bn (Dollars 763m) this year. The company has said it wants parts suppliers to convert the Zona Franca plant into an industrial park. It is not clear how many suppliers will accept that invitation nor how many jobs would be saved if they did.</p>

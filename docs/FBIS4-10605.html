			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) -- The General Labour Confederation  (CGT) and the Radical Party agreed yesterday [13 April] to push  reforms to the Labour bill promoted by the government and to  seek the support of the Church for this purpose.    Trade union leaders did not specify the points discussed but  said both sides had opposed the planned overhaul of the  union-run health insurance system.    ANSSAL [National Health Insurance Administration] national  health administration director Jose Luis Lingiero unveiled an  alternative union-backed health insurance scheme which advocates  a gradual deregulation of the current system. The proposal will  be presented to the government and businessmen.    The proposal came as a direct reply to Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo, who criticized the social welfare funds during  a visit to Mexico, branding the Argentine system as corrupt.    "The union medical plans are and always will be a guarantee  of health for workers, often replacing the inefficient public  health system," Cassia said in a communique aired after his  meeting with Alfonsin.    "One thing is to change for the better and another to  pretend  to overcome alleged shortcomings by handing health services over  to other sectors which privilege profits over workers' needs,"  he added.    Cassia also told reporters the Radical Party had agreed to  negotiate all future labour-related draft laws with CGT.    Also yesterday Alfonsin and the CGT chief ratified their  wish  to curtail the president's power to sign emergency decrees and  analyzed the make-up of the future Socio-Economic Council to be  set up after the reform of the Constitution.

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALENTI TELLS EUROPEANS TO CAN TV QUOTA LAW;  </P> <P> TRADE: MPAA CHAIRMAN CALLS THE BARRIERS "DANGEROUS" AND ISSUES A WARNING ON THE  LONG-TERM EFFECTS TO U.S. PRODUCERS.  </P> <P> Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, on Tuesday urged  the European Community to scrap a recently enacted law imposing non-binding  quotas on imported films and TV programs and called on Europeans to compete in  an open, global market.  </P> <P> "It sends a dark signal to those outside," Valenti said of the quota plan. "In  a world growing smaller each day . . . trade barriers are as old-fashioned and  as dangerous as armed conflict."  </P> <P> Last month, the foreign ministers of the community's 12 member states approved  a law limiting imported television programming to no more than 50% of all  transmissions "where practicable." News, sports, commercials and teletext  services were not included.  </P> <P> The quotas, part of a broader law establishing common television standards for  EC member states as they prepare to dismantle internal frontiers, have been  strenuously opposed by the U.S. government. The Bush Administration has pledged  to press its case that the quotas violate international trade agreements.  </P> <P> Valenti, in an interview after his speech, said he also plans to look into the  possibility that the EC legislation violates the free-speech provision of the  European Convention on Human Rights. Article 10 of the convention amounts to a  First Amendment for the member nations.  </P> <P> In his half-hour speech to a gathering of American and European business  executives here in the city that is home to the EC Executive Commission,  Valenti referred to the EC law on quotas as "baloney," "a needless crutch" and  "a terrorizing contradiction for a group of countries in the process of  eliminating internal trade restrictions."  </P> <P> "It's wrong," he said, "and every professional craftsman in the world knows  it's wrong."  </P> <P> The term where practicable was inserted in the law, following a prolonged  dispute, by member nations that advocate freer trade. France was the most  ardent supporter of a minority effort to enact tougher, binding quotas.  </P> <P> Any further watering down of the less stringent limits is regarded as highly  unlikely by political analysts here.  </P> <P> The looser wording, coupled with the fact that the programming being imported  into the EC countries is running well under the 50% limit, means that the new  law will have little immediate impact on the American film and television  industry. Valenti admitted this in a question-and-answer session.  </P> <P> Despite the sharp tenor of Valenti's remarks, EC officials said that other  executives in the American film industry were far less concerned about the  recent EC action.  </P> <P> Holde L'Hoest, who heads EC efforts to forge closer ties between film and  television industries of member states, quoted Michael Solomon, president of  Warner Bros. International Television Distribution; Bruce Gordon, president of  Paramount's international television division, and Patrick Cox, general manager  of NBC Europe, as indicating that the EC quotas were less serious than they  appear.  </P> <P> Valenti, however, said the provisions present a long-term danger.  </P> <P> "I worry about the future," he said. "When restrictions go on, they never come  off, and they are usually a floor, not a ceiling. Quotas are like a fungus.  They never go away. They grow, they slowly get worse, and some day they are  going to hurt."  </P> <P> There seems to be remarkably little enthusiasm for quotas among a broad  cross-section of European television executives and film artists, who note that  within the next five years they will be able to produce only a seventh of the  continent's estimated requirement of 16,000 hours of programming.  </P> <P> The quotas appear to have been pushed principally by governments eager to be  seen as protecting their cultural heritage.  </P> <P> Although European industry leaders express doubt about the cultural effect of  imported U.S. television, they tend to prefer efforts to foster closer internal  EC cooperation to improve their competitiveness internationally.  </P> <P> In his speech, Valenti applauded such moves.  </P> <P> "Develop the factors that will allow each producer to conquer the whole of the  European market," he said, "and then the rest of the cinema and TV world."  </P> <P> He urged Europeans to expand their film schools, to extend a $2.2-million EC  fund supporting scriptwriters and "build a new generation of film and TV stars,  actors, actresses, whose names and faces light up screens everywhere on this  earth."  </P> <P> Valenti said vibrant national and regional film industries have created a  public interest that benefits all film makers.  </P></p>

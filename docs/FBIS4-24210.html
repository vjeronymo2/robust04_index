			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Chris Simpson in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The United Nations special representative, Alioune  Blondin Beye, has been busy shuttling around southern Africa.  He has just returned to Luanda from South Africa where he had  talks with President Mandela. After consultations with  President dos Santos he is heading back to Lusaka. In spite of  the snail pace negotiations and the fierceness of the fighting,  Mr. Beye is apparently not a man to despair. From Luanda, Chris  Simpson reports.    Alioune Blondin Beye reiterated once again that he was still  optimistic about the prospects of peace in Angola and that the  Lusaka talks are still moving toward a settlement. He  acknowledged that Angolans in cities like Kuito and Malanje were  in a terrible predicament and that the current phase of fighting  was the worst for months, but he refused to succumb to  pessimism. Mr. Beye is meeting President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos this evening and confirmed he will be returning to Lusaka  tomorrow, which may rule out another meeting with UNITA leader  Jonas Savimbi in Huambo.    Mr. Beye stressed that it was a top priority to get UN aid  flights back on track, but so far, it has not been possible,  with UNITA yet to give its approval. The head of the UN World  Food Program in Angola, Philippe Borel, warned today that cities  like Malanje cut off for more than a month were likely to slide  back to the state they were in several months ago, with hundreds  of people dying. It is a tragedy, he said.    There is no hint of any let-up in the fighting inside  Angola,  with Angolan National Radio again reporting fierce clashes in  Kuito, with 30 deaths today.</p>

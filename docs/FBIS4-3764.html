			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 22 (CNA) -- A Taipei prosecutor on  Friday [22 April] indicted seven retired middle-ranking military  officers for either illegally obtaining or leaking top military  secrets to arms dealers, as the worst military scandal in  Taiwan's history continued to unravel.    The move brought to 11 the number of people charged for  their  complicity in the military scandal in which two officers each  were indicted in February and April. Three other officers and  four civilians also have been arrested for their roles in the  scandal, which started to unfold after the mysterious death of  Naval Capt. Yin Ching-feng in December.    Investigators say Yin was killed because he threatened to  expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired  military officers representing European companies paid  active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts.    The investigators have been helped in tracking down other  arms dealers and officers involved in the scandal by information  gleaned from classified Navy documents they uncovered during a  Christmas Eve raid on the home of Chang Chia-cheng, an arms  dealer and former Army colonel who has also been indicted.    The classified information, covering the six French-built  Lafayette frigates and the two Swordfish submarines the  Netherlands has constructed for Taiwan, was allegedly leaked by  active-duty officers. The two projects are part of the Navy's  military buildup.    In addition to Chang, who allegedly bribed officers to  obtain  the secrets, Liang Kang-hsien, who was suspected of leaking  military secrets before he retired as an Air Force major, and  Liu Shu, a retired Navy captain, have also been indicted. The  three could be sentenced to death if found guilty.    Four other people indicted by the prosecutor include Tien  Ching- wen and three arms dealers--Wu Yu-cheng, Li Hung-wei, and  Wu Pao- tai. They face a punishment of up to seven years in  jail if found guilty.</p>

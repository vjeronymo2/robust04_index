			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Oh dear. The heart sinks to find that even BBC2, last stronghold of non-mindless television, is succumbing. Today it begins a game show called Ps And Qs (8.30) in which teams containing people such as sitcom actresses and Rabbi Lionel Blue answer questions about etiquette. It is all very well for the BBC to argue it must serve up trivia to remain competitive, but if it fails to offer at the same time a refuge for the more demanding viewer, it may as well fold its tents and leave the world to Rupert Murdoch. Of course BBC2 still has some promising programmes. Business Matters (7.30) looks at the work of behavioural psychologist Peter Honey, a specialist in the way that people learn at work, asking whether learning is 'just common sense' or a skill which can be improved. In The Climbers (8.00), first of a series on the history of mountaineering, Chris Bonington re-creates the first ascent of the Grepon by Alfred Mummery. Talking Heads (9.35) is a repeat of Alan Bennett's play about an Equity extra, with Julie Walters as the actress. Early Travellers In North America (10.10) quotes Kipling on Chicago and Trollope on Washington.</p>

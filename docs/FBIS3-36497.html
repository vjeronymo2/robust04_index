Such a strike, in  his opinion, could be delivered only if Serbian troops engage  the peacekeepers. According to Grachev, Russia's position is  that a decision on a bombing raid should only be made by the UN  Security Council rather than by the peacekeeping forces' command.    He outlined this position at his meeting with his French  counterpart Francois Leotard in Moscow on Friday.    Commenting on the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Grachev  said  that to secure a cease-fire in Bosnia, Russia would press for  "equally restraining" not only the Bosnian Serbs but also the  Croatian and Moslem communities.    Explaining his government's position on a settlement in  Bosnia, Grachev urged the conflicting sides to call a  cease-fire, ensure the passage of humanitarian relief convoys,  and guarantee security in the region.</p>

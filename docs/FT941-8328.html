			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Roar of jets amplifies Nato threat In a huge hangar at Aviano, a northern Italian frontline air base for Nato operations over Bosnia, the defence ministers of France, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US yesterday approved final plans for attack missions over Sarajevo. The ministers met just hours before the UN and Nato commanders decided early today that air strikes were not necessary 'at this stage'. Throughout the day, the ministers spoke of 'comforting signs' of Serb compliance with the UN ultimatum. But they also made it clear their determination to use force if necessary. On the timing of any attack mission, the ministers have been cautious. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said verification on the ground was essential and it would not be possible to know if the Serbs had properly complied with the withdrawal requirements precisely at midnight. This suggested that commanders on the ground were being given discretion to check the positions of weapons and that any military action would be delayed for some hours - if not considerably longer. The threat to use force was emphasised by the thunderous roar of US F-16 and F-18 jets as they took off for reconnaissance missions over the war zone before and during the ministers' press conference yesterday afternoon. Mr Walter Perry, in his first important overseas mission since becoming US defence secretary, said he was fully satisfied by Nato's combat-readiness. He also said the rules of engagement had been agreed among the US allies. The US is supplying just over half the 226 combat and support aircraft involved in the Bosnian operations. However, he admitted that bad weather over Sarajevo was 'a significant handicap'. For the past month operations have been limited and some of the pilots here have said in private that with poor visibility, precision operations are difficult despite the technology available. Mr Perry himself said that even if weather was a limiting factor this would not stop Nato action. In a communique after their meeting, held with Nato commanders and a representative of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, the ministers stated their determination 'to support actions to end the slaughter of innocent civilians in Sarajevo and reinvigorate the peace negotiations'. The ministers refused to be drawn on whether the Serbs had abused the spirit of their agreement to withdraw by concentrating their heavy weapons in strategic sites or in areas which were heavily populated - thus complicating any combat mission by Nato. However, they said UN forces on the spot would be able to take control of those Serb weapons which were not in the designated places, and they would also have the authority to disable them. The operations are being co-ordinated by Admiral Michael Boorda, the commander of Nato's southern flank, from his headquarters outside Naples. The Italians as neighbours of former Yugoslavia have been excluded from any combat role, but yesterday Mr Fabbio Fabri, defence minister, said Italy would put all its resources at the disposal of Nato forces. He also played down the threat of an attack or terrorist operations by Serb extremists against Italy. The peculiar nature of the war on western Europe's doorstep was highlighted in Aviano by the big Sunday crowds which gathered to see the activity at the air base. Many families with children watched as US jets, fully loaded with bombs and missiles, took off and landed. These aircraft with the same ordnance could be in action within hours and were less than 30 minutes' flying time away from Sarajevo.</p>

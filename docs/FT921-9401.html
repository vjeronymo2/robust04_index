			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Russia tangled in politics of aid: The divisive symbolism of foreign bread and butter A CARTOON on a banner displayed at the communist demonstration in Moscow on Sunday showed a horse labelled 'The New Powers' munching at a pile of 'humanitarian aid'. Hungry citizens at the rear end of the horse received its droppings. For the growing numbers on the right and left who oppose the Russian government, aid is represented as a prop for those in power which gives the people nothing. The environment in which it is delivered encourages such a response. The current airlift of aid is given massive TV coverage - and Russians see it brought in by westerners who look rich, well fed and well dressed. The need to guard the supplies has led the European Community, the main aid provider, to bring over a group of servicemen, including no less than two generals - one German, one French. General Fritz von Steinseifer is deputy administrator of the task force overseeing the distribution of the EC aid - and as a German who fought on the Russian front as a young soldier he invites comment. He and his fellows stay at the Lufthansa-owned Olympic Penta, one of Moscow's few luxury hotels, which costs about Dollars 200 (Pounds 110) a night for a room - another cause for envy and derision since, on the current Rbs110-to-the-dollar exchange rate, that is more than most Russians earn in a year. In fact, the testimony of those distributing aid is that almost nothing has been lost to thieves - less because of Gen von Steinseifer, more because of Russian soldiers who guard the train convoys bringing the meat to the cities from St Petersburg or Kleipeda in Latvia. The focus of the media, western and Russian, on the criminality surrounding the operation is mistaken, say the organisers. Two senior officials concerned with the distribution of EC aid to Moscow and St Petersburg under a Ecu200m (Pounds 142.6m) programme, speaking on terms of anonymity, pointed to the downside. First, it undercuts the local supply system. The EC produce is set deliberately below the higher market prices to try to drag them down. Unfortunately, they say, it is not so much having this effect as deterring producers of food from selling to the Moscow and St Petersburg shops - pushing them to conclude long-term contracts with other republics, or organisations elsewhere in Russia. The producers are not, they say, profiteering: but their own costs, sharply up, rule out competition with the EC food. Once the EC aid runs out, in about two months, and the effects of the airlift are over in two to three weeks, the two largest Russian cities will have to go back to suppliers who may be unable or unwilling to sell to them. Mr Hansjorg Kretschmer, the deputy head of the EC mission to Moscow, said yesterday that there were 'indications, not yet proof' that the relatively low prices were deterring Moscow producers from selling - while there had as yet been few signs of a reduction in price. The EC now prices its butter at Rbs56 a kg, boned meat at Rbs50 a kg, boneless at Rbs75. The free prices of butter reach Rbs100 a kg or more, while meat of any quality sells at Rbs120 a kg, or more. Second, the aid may not be what is needed. In their studies of the food chain, the officials have concluded that quantities are adequate: the real problem is equipment at every stage. Many warehouses are inefficient or have no freezing facilities, transport is ageing, roads are deteriorating. In the food plants, production lines are subject to constant breakdown and the shops are often primitive. This is strongly supported by the experience of consultants from Arthur Andersen, now concluding a study of bread supply in Moscow. The team, led in Moscow by Mr Stephen Zatland, has concluded that the supply of grain and flour is sufficient (though increasingly the grain in the silos comes from abroad, bought by western credits): the real problem lies in the bread factories. Says Mr Zatland: 'The engineers in these factories are the heroes. It's incredible how they keep machines going which sometimes date from the 1920s. But if one of them broke down (there are 24 bread plants in Moscow, with an average of about 120 tonnes a day output), it would be hard to make up its supply to the shops it serves because everything is stretched so thin.' But the key recommendation in the Arthur Andersen report - besides the need to phase a move to market relations in the sector - is: put the bread in bags. Mr Zatland says: 'This one thing would greatly improve the situation. At present, a loaf's life is 16 hours. A plastic bag could prolong it to three days. It would mean the shops had constant supplies, the bread fresher, the queues shorter, the waste much less.' In this instance, investment in packaging (a tiny sector in the CIS states) would save millions and ensure adequate supply of the staple food. Said one of the aid officials: 'If I had one tenth of the money being spent on aid, I would know exactly how to spend it to make sure aid wasn't needed.'</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reinsurance underpins JIB A STRONG performance in the international reinsurance sector underpinned profits growth at JIB Group, the insurance broker floated in November by Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based trading company. JIB, the latest of a series of medium-sized brokers to obtain a stock market listing, reported a 33 per cent rise, from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 20.1m, in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 1991. The figures were flattered by a contribution of Pounds 2.61m from interest earned on a capital injection made by Jardine Matheson last June, but underlying profits increased by 13 per cent with earnings per share up to 13.6p (12p). The company declared a dividend of 5p. However, the performance failed to stir much enthusiasm among investors. JIB's share price fell back to 187p, 3p down on the day and 8p down on the 195p paid for shares at the flotation. Approximately one third of the company's shares were placed in an offer which was subscribed three times. The company's reinsurance division increased its contribution to profits from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 10.7m against an improvement in turnover to Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 20m). Growth in France, Australasia and Asia, where reinsurance operations have begun recently, was the main reason. Mr John Barton, chief executive, said that in London JIB's avoiding involvement in retrocession or spiral business had held the company in good stead following problems in that part of the market this year. JIB's US retail division, which generate 43 per cent of revenues, was held back by continuing softness in US insurance rates. Profits contributed fell from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 2.11m. JIB completed a review of its US operations during the year and opted to close 25 offices.</p>

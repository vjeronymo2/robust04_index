			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Long-term jobless at 4 1/2-year peak THE number of people out of work for more than a year rose by 50,000 in the three months to October to a 4 1/2 -year high of 956,000, the Department of Employment reported yesterday. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the increase was the smallest for a year and that the total was still 30 per cent below the peak in April 1986. But the latest total is the highest since April 1988 and is almost double the level when the upward trend began in October 1990. More than a third of those on the dole have been jobless for more than 12 months. The number of people out of work for more than six months stands at 1,521,000.</p>

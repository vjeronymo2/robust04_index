			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / From conflict to consensus: The differing styles of Brazil's old and new economy ministers, Zelia Cardoso and Marcilio Marques Moreira CREDIBILITY was the word on many lips throughout Brazil yesterday on hearing that Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, is to replace Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello as economy minister. A career diplomat and former banker, Mr Moreira, 59, commands respect internationally and from Brazil's private sector. His first task will be to escape from the current price freeze without an explosion of inflation. Inflation last month was 7 per cent but most industries claim their prices are now 40 per cent behind what they should be. 'He's a first world citizen with all the tools to build a good team and make a revolution in this country,' said Mr Igor Cornelson, Director of Chartered West LB in Brazil. Mr Moreira's appointment signifies a shift in style of government to a more consensual approach. Until now the government of President Fernando Collor has failed dismally in attempts to secure an essential social pact to support its radical anti-inflationary policies, mainly because of the aggressive style of Ms Cardoso. Ms Cardoso, 37, was one of the main architects of the Collor Plan, the package of radical stabilisation measures announced 14 months ago. The tight monetary policy, which included the freezing of 80 per cent of national assets and savings, was initially successful in bringing inflation down from 80 per cent a month to single figures. But by the start of this year it was back over 20 per cent a month. The announcement at the end of January of Collor Plan 2, which included a wage and price freeze, was widely seen as recognition that Latin America's most radical economic experiment had failed, and credibility dropped to rock bottom. Many in Brazil agreed with the direction of economic policy towards deregulation and liberalisation. The problem was always with management. Ms Cardoso and her team (known as the Campinas boys for their university backgrounds and youth) were academics without political or administrative experience. They tended to lecture people on economic theory rather than attempt to negotiate. Asked about the government's bitter rift with the powerful Sao Paulo business community in an interview with the FT last year, Ms Cardoso simply said: 'We're right. They're wrong. You'll see.' This attitude won her enemies at home and abroad. However no-one faced with the Herculean task of stabilising Brazil's inflation-ridden economy and ending years of protectionism was likely to win friends. One diplomat said: 'Zelia has been under tremendous attack precisely because she's been trying to do some of the things that needed to be done and that meant sacrifices all round.' But Ms Cardoso was unable to convince the population of the need for sacrifice, and her polices have produced poor results. Last year the economy contracted 4.6 per cent, industrial production fell 12 per cent and unemployment in Sao Paulo rose to more than 1m. President Collor was reluctant to lose his most loyal cabinet colleague. Ms Cardoso survived a scandal last September in which an indiscreet bolero, danced with the then justice minister at her birthday party, led to the revelation that the two were having an affair. She survived and even had her powers enhanced. In recent months she secured jobs for friends such as the infrastructure minister, which led people to dub her Brazil's prime minister. Her increased influence seemed to go to her head and conflicts with other government members became increasingly open in recent weeks. Mr Collor's brother, among others, began pressing him to dismiss her. A poll last week showing that a clear majority of the population was against the Collor government seems to have been the catalyst for her removal. Mr Moreira's appointment and his own reputation gives the government a new lease of life in terms of credibility, though this could be quickly lost if inflation is not soon brought under control. Mr Moreira is expected to accelerate the liberalisation process to force down prices, maintain tight monetary control to prevent consumption and devalue the cruzeiro to increase the competitiveness of Brazilian goods abroad. Mr Carlos Langoni, an economist and former head of the Central Bank, said: 'Externally he will speed up debt negotiations and is very aware of the need for Brazil to become competitive again but his great contribution domestically will be to come back to fundamentals. 'There will be no short cuts such as freezes or radical ideas. He is a negotiator.'</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: USX-US Steel unveils second quarter deficit USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel unit of USX, yesterday reported a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 5.66 cents a share. This included an after-tax charge of Dollars 403m related to anti-trust litigation against its former railroad subsidiary, the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad. A year earlier, the company had restated net income of Dollars 2m, or 3 cents a share. Stripping out the one-time charge, the company said operating income rose to Dollars 56m in the latest quarter from a restated Dollars 34m a year earlier. Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX Corporation, the consolidated parent company, attributed the improved performance of its steel group to firmer industry conditions. During the 1993 quarter, steel shipments were at their highest level since the 1990 fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter rose to Dollars 1.43bn from Dollars 1.27bn. For the six months, the steel group had a net loss of Dollars 320m, or Dollars 5.49, against a deficit of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 26.03. The 1992 figures have been restated to include the adoption of two new accounting standards. Sales rose to Dollars 2.64bn from Dollars 2.43bn. USX's Delhi Group, the company's gas business, turned in better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of Dollars 2.1m, or 15 cents, against Dollars 9m, or 5 cents, a year ago. USX-Marathon Group, the oil business, posted second-quarter net income of Dollars 21m, or 63 cents, down from Dollars 181m, or 63 cents, a year earlier.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Means exist to maintain discipline in the City Sir, Those who are calling for an alternative to massively expensive and in the final analysis often futile court cases concerning alleged wrong-doing in London's Square Mile should not overlook the potential of the existing disciplinary powers available under the Financial Services Act. Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) are empowered to carry out disciplinary actions against firms and/or individuals. Penalties that can be imposed on those found to be in breach of its rules include very substantial fines, compensation to clients, restrictions on individuals' activities in the future, the closing down of firms, and the prohibition of individuals from returning to the industry either for a period or perhaps for ever. The process used by SFA to decide on the culpability of an alleged offender is fair yet expeditious. Its tribunals are chaired by eminent lawyers with assistance from practitioners and independent members of SFA's board and others. Legal argument, and hence costs, are kept to a manageable level and there is no charge to the taxpayer as the cost of the process is met by those regulated. The level of proof is much less onerous than in a criminal trial and the standard by which the defendant is judged owes as much to the spirit of the intention of the rules as to the detail of the rules themselves. The overriding requirement of behaviour in accordance with best market practice and the placing of client interests first are examples of the key principles involved. Custodial sentences can certainly be justified in cases where there has been outright fraud or theft of client assets, but when the alleged offences are more akin to breaches of City codes of conduct, then the use of criminal prosecutions through the courts is inappropriate. Far better to use the alternative that is already available and has already proved itself, but whose process is blocked once criminal proceedings are begun.

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Blenheim falls after Pounds 75m issue BLENHEIM Group, the acquisitive exhibition organiser, yesterday launched a Pounds 75.8m convertible preference share issue and said the money raised would be used to finance acquisitions in the US and continental Europe. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said the issue would allow Blenheim to expand without interest cover falling below the company's self-imposed floor of seven times: 'America is coming out of recession and there are going to be opportunities to buy,' he said. But the issue was poorly received on the stock market, where Blenheim's shares fell 29p to 513p, a low for the year, after touching 493p on low volume. Following a switch in Blenheim's financial year end and other accounting changes, there is concern about the quality of the company's underlying earnings. Yesterday's issue and the planned expansion will further cloud analysts' forecasts. The share price fall also reflected an effective 1994 profits downgrade from Blenheim's house broker, BZW. The broker had forecast profits of Pounds 54m but reduced the estimate to Pounds 49m to reflect a slowdown in Europe. After yesterday's share issue, and an assumed return on the money raised, the forecast has been restored to Pounds 55m. Under the terms of the issue, Blenheim is issuing 75.8m, 6.4 per cent convertible cumulative preference shares with a conversion price of 610p. Shareholders can subscribe at the issue price of 100p on the basis of nine preference shares for every 11 ordinary shares held. Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Blenheim's largest shareholder with 14 per cent, will subscribe for half its entitlement while the company's directors, who hold 27 per cent, will not subscribe. Mr Buch said the issue was structured like this, rather than a conventional issue, to attract continental European investors. BZW, Robert Fleming and Credit Lyonnais underwrote the placing. Blenheim also said the board expects to announce dividends this year of no less than 10.25p, an increase of about 14 per cent. Blenheim has net borrowings of Pounds 58m, most in the form of 8.69 per cent senior notes due 1999. Money raised from the issue will be held on deposit until acquisitions are made.</p>

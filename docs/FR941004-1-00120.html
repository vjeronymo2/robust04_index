(This is the same Federal financial participation rate as title IV&hyph;B, subpart 1.) The Indian tribe's share must be at least 25 percent of the total or 33 percent of the Federal share. Federal funds, however, will not exceed the amount of the Indian tribe's allotment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Indian tribe's contribution may be in cash or donated funds. In addition, Indian tribes, by statute, may use the following three Federal sources of funds as matching funds: Indian Child Welfare Act funds, Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fiscal and administrative requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An Indian tribe must expend all funds by September 30 of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the funds were awarded. Other fiscal and administrative requirements will be found in the compilation of statutory assurances to be prepared by ACF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix to the NPRM: Revised reporting form_Annual Summary of Child and Family Services.

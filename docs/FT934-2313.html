			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Reformists pin hopes on Yeltsin's support Leaders of Russia's shaken pro-reform camp yesterday began consultations on a new government following the weekend's elections but said the survival of market reforms would depend mainly on President Boris Yeltsin's will to push them forward. The most popular reform party, Russia's Choice, became more confident that, in coalition with the three other main reformist parties, it could command more seats than the combined anti-reform forces of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, Communists, and Agrarians. But both Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko bloc, the second largest reformist party, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister and a founder of Russia's Choice, said it was up to the Russian president to throw sweeping new powers granted him by the constitution behind reform. 'The president must . . . clarify what policy he wants,' said Mr Yavlinsky. Mr Fyodorov added: 'I'm sure he won't compromise (over reform) but he has yet to speak openly.' The main pro-reform parties have precluded co-operation with Mr Zhirinovsky. 'It is clear that nobody wants to have anything to do with this maverick and moron,' said Mr Fyodorov. First results yesterday for the parliamentary seats filled on a first-past-the-post basis suggest reformists may perform more strongly in those than in earlier results for seats determined by proportional representation. Preliminary results for the seats decided by proportional representation gave Mr Zhirinovsky 24 per cent, followed by Russia's Choice with 15 per cent, the Communists with 11 per cent, and others, including Yabloko, with about 7 per cent. Mr Zhirinovsky, whose ultimate goal is the presidency, said he would join a coalition government only if his party could occupy the foreign, defence, security and interior ministries. However, trying to project a more moderate image than his ultra-nationalist and expansionist platform, he promised not to 'destabilise' the situation if he was left out of the government, indicating that he would use parliament to increase his popularity. Mr Yeltsin, who has said he would use his new powers to pursue democracy and reforms, has made no comment about Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral success.

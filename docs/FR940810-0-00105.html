			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA believes that these precautions are necessary to protect employees who remove roofing materials against elevated exposures in normal circumstances. The record shows, however, that elevated exposures may occur where damaged or friable roofing material is removed. [See SRI report, recommending the use of respirators where roofing material is ``uncharacterized and aged'' (Ex. 9&hyph;31A at 20)]. Under such circumstances, the competent person's determination must be that the normal precautions are not sufficient. Steven Phillips, counsel to the NCRA agreed: ``(w)hen you're working with uncharacterized and aged roofing materials, that is *&blank;*&blank;* where you have no idea what the exposures may be because you have no historical data; you haven't worked with that particular material; *&blank;*&blank;* (there are) the normal OSHA requirements of doing initial job site monitoring and having respirators until you have good, reliable, job site monitoring'' (Tr. 2463). In such atypical circumstances, additional precautions, including respirator use and more extensive wetting, will be necessary. NRCA's objection to the routine use of respirators on roofing jobs, as recommended by BCTD, was based on its view that respirator use on roofs often compromises worker safety, because respirators reduce ``downward visibility'' of the wearer (Tr. 2463). OSHA agrees that in some roofing conditions, limitations from wearing respirators might occur. When respirator use is necessary because of the condition of the roofing material, but respirators cannot be safely worn because of great heat, cold, or high winds, etc., such roofing jobs shall not be performed until they can be done safely. The Agency has concluded that ``routine'' respirator use is not required, because as discussed above the required work practices will keep exposures low in normal circumstances; but where historic data, experience of the crew, or the condition of the roof indicate the possibility of higher exposures, then respirator use is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various studies which were submitted support OSHA's classification of roofing removal as a Class II activity. They show that most measured exposures are lower than many studies showing removal of Class I materials; but still may be significant. In most cases levels below the new PELs can be routinely expected with minimum controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SRI evaluated air monitoring reports from 79 roofing removal operations, 560 personal and 353 area samples (Ex. 9&hyph;31). All samples, except 24 were well below the new PEL of 0.1 f/cc. Fourteen samples were collected for 30 minutes or less (and were below the excursion limit). When the remaining sample measurements were calculated as 8 hour time-weighted averages, they also did not exceed the PEL. The remaining samples did not exceed 0.1 f/cc. The contractors concluded, ``there appears to be no pressing need for air monitoring at the start of each job, negative pressure enclosures, or wetting. However the use of half-mask respirators is recommended until the source of the fibers in the few samples where concentrations were above 0.1 f/cc can be defined.'' They added that ``exposure to asbestos should be minimized until more (or better) information is available; the use of respirators seems a prudent compromise when working with uncharacterized and aged roofing materials.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submission of Preston Quirk of Gobbell Hays Partners, Inc. included a study entitled ``Airborne Levels During Non-Friable Asbestos-Containing Material (ACM) Removal'' which was presented at the 1990 meeting of the National Asbestos Council (Ex. 7&hyph;133a). One section of this study presented the sampling measurements taken during removal of asbestos-containing roofing felt and flashing using a wet prying and peeling technique with no enclosure. Five area samples averaged 0.007 f/cc by PCM and 0.008 s/cm3 by TEM. Five personal samples averaged 0.024 f/cc by PCM and 0.304 f/cc by TEM. It was reported that the personal TEM samples had 0.124 s/cm3 of structure greater than or equal to 5 &mu;m.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD submitted a study by D. Hogue and K. Rhodes entitled ``Evaluation of Asbestos Fiber Release from Built-up Roof Removal Projects'' (Ex. 34, VV) in which roofing operations were monitored using both PCM and TEM methods of measurement. The authors stressed the ``non-scientific'' nature of the study and noted that they had measured only a limited number of samples. They described a project involving removal of a 15% asbestos roof from a hospital in which a several control methods were used. Area samples were taken at ``high,'' ``medium,'' and ``low'' locations and most were measured using the PCM method. During mechanical removal, the arithmetic mean concentration was 0.16 f/cc (not time-weighted); and during manual removal the average was 0.1 f/cc (non-weighted). Personal samples were measured only by TEM and the 3 taken during manual removal averaged 0.11 f/cc (also not weighted). In another section of this report the authors describe a ``Controlled removal of asbestos containing built-up roofing materials without containment with engineering and work practice controls and extensive sampling and analysis by transmission electron microscopy,'' however, the specific engineering and work practice controls employed are not described. Nonetheless, the resulting measurements, both PCM and TEM, are well below the PEL except one sample in which the TEM concentration was 0.1 s/cc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

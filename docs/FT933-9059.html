			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Maxwell group pensioners earn Pounds 55m from share sale FORMER MAXWELL company pensioners have earned Dollars 83m (Pounds 55.7m) from the sale of shares in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Lehman Brothers, the US-based investment bank, said yesterday. The sale was part of a secondary offering in the US managed by Lehman. As part of the offering, the bank sold its stake in Teva Pharmaceutica, which it had acquired following the late Robert Maxwell's default on loans it had extended to his personal interests. The holdings of the liquidators to the Maxwell-owned fund management company Bishopsgate Investment Management and those of Lehman Brothers were sold in the form of 8m American depository receipts. The pensioners' shares are those that were returned last year by National Westminster Bank. NatWest had received them as collateral for a loan to Robert Maxwell's personal interests but they had been registered in the name of BIM. BIM managed pension assets exclusively. Liquidators to BIM had argued that NatWest should have known the shares were not Robert Maxwell's to pledge. Robson Rhodes, liquidators to BIM, is challenging Lehman's ownership of all or part of the shares. The offering, in the form of depositary receipts consisting of 10 Teva Pharmaceutica shares each, raised a total of Dollars 157m net of underwriting expenses. Robson Rhodes has relinquished any claim to ownership of the shares, allowing them to be sold to investors with a clean title. However Robson Rhodes said it will instead pursue Lehman Brothers and related entities for any claim it believes it may have. Lehman's holdings consisted of 2m shares registered in its own name and 2m registered in the name of Lehman Brothers Nominees, indicating that they belonged to some owner other than Lehman Brothers. A portion of the shares represents Dollars 35m overcollateralisation of the loan from Lehman Brothers to Robert Maxwell. That sum is being contested. In addition, some of the shares were obtained by Lehman Brothers through a stock-lending arrangement. The status of the arrangement is also being questioned by the liquidators. Lehman Brothers said that at present, there are no legal proceedings connected with the Teva shares.</p>

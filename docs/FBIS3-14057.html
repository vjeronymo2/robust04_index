The source said that Nabil Sha'th and Amnon Shahaq will  cochair the Palestinian-Israeli talks, which will focus on  Israel's reply to Palestinian demands that the Palestinians  believe should be met ahead of the resumption of the peace talks.    According to the source, the Palestinian requests are:    1. Protecting the settlements should be the responsibility  of the Israeli Government, not of individual settlers.    2. Israel should pledge to seek a solution to the tensions  associated with the settlements.    3. Palestinian-Israeli talks should be held to discuss the  form of transitional international presence in the occupied  territories.    4. A joint Palestinian-Israeli committee should be formed to  discuss the future of the settlements.    The Palestinian source said that the Israelis had given a  negative reply to these requests but that the intercession of  Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the Middle East peace process,  the two meetings he held with the Israeli delegation in Tunisia  yesterday, and his meeting with President Yasir 'Arafat, brought  the positions of the two sides closer. The source said that  Ross has put pressure on the Israelis, making them show a great  deal of flexibility.    The source stated that if the Israelis come with a positive  and acceptable reply, an important meeting may be held on  Thursday in Cairo between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin, and an official statement declaring the  resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations could be  issued. The source added that everything depends on the outcome  of the Palestinian-Israeli meeting in Cairo tomorrow.</p>

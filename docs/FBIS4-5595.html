			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  approved military personnel changes explained Tuesday by Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae, a government official said.    With the president's approval, the Defense Ministry is  scheduled to announce its regular personnel changes at the end  of this week or early next week.    The government plans to remove private organizations in the  military through the personnel changes this month, but no  details were available.    A senior government official said, "Defense Minister Yi  briefed President Kim on the changes, but I have no information  on personnel management concerning the generals and field grade  officers who were members of 'Hana-hoe.'"    Hana-hoe was a private Army organization that counted former  Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u among its members.    Another senior official said, "The overall feeling in the  Army is that the personnel changes involving the Hana-hoe  generals have not gone far enough. Most Army officers hope that  all the Hana-hoe generals will be discharged or relieved of  important posts."</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Boral drops Sagasco bid conditions BORAL, the Australian building products and energy group, yesterday waived some the technical conditions attached to its ADollars 760m (USDollars 502m) takeover bid for Sagasco Holdings, the Adelaide-based gas producer, but made no change to the ADollars 3.50-a-share offer price, writes Nikki Tait. The dropping of the conditions gives Boral additional flexibility in the latter stages of the bid contest, although the predator has maintained the key 50.1 per cent acceptance condition. Sagasco has already rejected Boral's bid as inadequate. Much now depends on what the South Australian government decides to do with its remaining 31.8 per cent interest in Sagasco. Boral already owns 19.9 per cent of Sagasco, bought from the state government, and purchase of the remaining interest would be sufficient to give Boral control of its target.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will summon additional  deliberations on how to curtail PLO efforts to create political  facts in Jerusalem. Today's meeting on the issue lasted two  hours and was attended by the prime minister, the foreign  minister, the police minister, the police chief, the attorney  general, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, and the Shin Bet  head. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that there  is no plan to initiate a comprehensive legislation on the issue,  but to deal with each case independently. Among steps  considered are moves to prevent problematic visits to Jerusalem.</p>

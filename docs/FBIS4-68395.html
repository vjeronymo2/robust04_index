			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Osipova and Natalya Orlova: "Ted Turner </F> Is Playing, TV-6 Is Showing"]    [Text] TV-6 Moscow is no longer content with the role  of a Moscow company. By expanding its air space and planning to  acquire the long-awaited status of a joint enterprise, TV-6,  together with the Turner International company, wants to make  itself known on the whole territory of Russia and in neighboring  countries. A discussion will be held today at the board of the  Council of Mayors of the Cities of Northwestern Russia on the  idea of establishing a regional television studio on the basis  of a TV-6 affiliate in Novgorod.    The condition of distressful expectation for TV-6 has been  going on for more than a year now. However, in the words of  Aleksandr Ponomarev, the general director of Moscow Independent  Broadcasting Corporation (MNVK), the prolonged process of  registering the Telecompany TV-6 joint enterprise can be  concluded this very month. According to the contract, MNVK and  Ted Turner Corporation (equal partners underscored by equal  shares) are the founding parties. The Americans retain  management, since they obviously have had more success in the  business sphere than the Russian businessmen. However, the  Russian side will establish program policy in that it is more  familiar with the predilections of the viewing audience.  Advertising policy remains as before; therefore, it is unlikely  that large commercial breaks will disappear from the air.    But there is also pleasant news--Eduard Sagalayev will head  the board of directors, and he will have the last word in all  debatable situations. Stuart Loory, now a CNN vice president,  will hold the post of general director. Mr. Ponomarev expressed  the Russian position: "We are creating a Russian  telecompany with the participation of Americans."    For a long time, TV-6's problem was the imperfection of its  technical equipment, as a result of which the reception of  programs on the channel was poor, even in Moscow. This question  finally will be resolved in the near future, inasmuch as,  starting on 1 April, TV-6 will lease a communications satellite  that will cover the entire territory of the former Soviet Union  ((FSU)). After being transformed in this way from a local  channel to an international one, TV-6 will spread out its  television network from Vilnius to Almaty (and by the end of the  year, to Vladivostok as well). For this, MNVK is concluding a  contract with regional nonstate companies concerning the  organization of ground-based receiving stations. (Already now a  three-hour bloc of the television channel is being received in  20 cities, and the satellite will help increase the number of  broadcasting hours up to 10.) A new transmitter of the platinum  series by the famous American company Harris Allied, which will  begin to operate on the Ostankino tower starting on 20 April,  will finally improve the reception of programs in Moscow and  nearby rayons.    The work is not limited to technical improvements. The  managers of TV-6 also promised that by this autumn viewers will  see several new Russian production programs on the air. Changes  are also expected in the showing of movies--not only American  films, but also European films should appear on TV-6.    But the best feature, documentary, and television films  produced by the leading American film companies will be shown on  the screens of Russian movie theaters a day before they are  shown on TV-6. At a news conference in the Cinema Center,  representatives of TV-6 Moscow told critics and journalists  about the first such project--the film series "History Through  Hollywood's Eyes." In the words of Michael Pippi, a member of  the board of directors of Turner International, famous American  films were used in the project that portray difficult times and  major battles--"Watch on the Rhine," "Mutiny on the Bounty"  (with young Marlon Brando), "Doctor Zhivago," and "Ben Hur." The  film series will be opened by the Moscow premiers of the  four-hour film "Gettysburg," adapted from the book of Pulitzer  Prize laureate Michael Shaar "Angels of Death." The premiers  will be held in the Motion Picture Center (30 April) and in the  Amerikom Theater (1 May). Ted Turner himself played in the  picture about the war between the North and the South: He  heroically perished on the screen for three minutes, and he did  this, in his own words, absolutely free of charge.    Fears were expressed at the news conference regarding the  rental fate "of the picture that is splendid both in content and  in performance," but "which will hardly do well in a videofilm  market that is filled with fair films." Mr. Pippi noted that the  American side sees this danger. However, Turner International  Corporation is not betting on commercial success in Russia, but  on the opportunity to "tell the Russians as much as possible  about the history of America and Americans."</p>

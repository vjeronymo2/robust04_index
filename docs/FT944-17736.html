			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Bonds: World Bank global well received The World Bank's DM2bn global offering enjoyed a generally warm reception yesterday in spite of difficult market conditions in Europe and the US. Lead managers Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley said the deal had been oversubscribed, and syndicate managers reported significant demand from a wide spectrum of quality investors including central banks and blue chip clients across the world. The offering of five-year bonds was launched on Tuesday and was priced yesterday at a coupon of 7.25 per cent and a reoffer price of 99.432. Traders said that many investors were attracted by what they considered a generous spread of 15 basis points over German government bonds. 'There was a lot of switch trade with investors moving out along the yield curve from the existing D-Mark bonds in the three- to four-year area, which are trading tight to bunds,' said one syndicate official. The success of the offering was also related to the strength of the D-Mark, dealers said. 'Some investors have taken a bullish stance on the currency and feel confident about holding D-Marks,' one dealer said. Elsewhere in the eurobond market, dealers reported that US hedge funds had sold a significant amount of long-dated bonds over the last few days as they switched to shorter-dated securities. Abbey National has filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US which will allow it to issue up to Dollars 3bn of medium-term notes. Mr Fernando Cossio, the Bolivian finance minister, said that Bolivia planned to return to the capital markets in 1995 with a medium-term bond which would probably be for Dollars 100m, Reuter reports from Madrid. He said that Bolivia might also seek a credit rating next year to improve Bolivian companies' access to international debt markets.</p>

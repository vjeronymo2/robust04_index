			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - C &amp; G's fixed-rate offer Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has long specialised in issuing fixed-rate mortgages which undercut the rest of the market. Its latest fixed-rate offering, launched on Friday, is probably the most attractively priced fixed rate mortgage product to appear on the market since 1988. Interest charged is 9.4 per cent (10.8 per cent APR) and the loans are available for interest-only or repayment or endowment mortgages. Loans on remortgages must be 90 per cent of valuation or below. An fee of Pounds 250 is payble on application and there is a six months gross interest penalty for early redemption within the five year period. There are no other strings attached.

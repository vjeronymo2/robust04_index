			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The multinational forces from the Western countries  and the United States, the last of whose soldiers left 25 March  as planned, first arrived in the Republic of Somalia on 9  September [as heard] 1992 to do something about the painful  situation then prevailing in the country, to which the  international community could not turn a blind eye. The varying  reception accorded these forces by the Somali leaders opened the  door to the arrival of many more troops, which at first greatly  feared [words indistinct] among the entire Somali people.    The first forces to come to our country sought to save the  [words indistinct] who were dying barely a mile away from our  country's main port, which was full of food [words indistinct]  looted by the bandits. These bandits ignored the starvation  killing their brothers. The foreign forces came to protect the  relief workers who were threatened by the bandits [words  indistinct] who only wanted to loot the food. This was a  difficult time for our country. It was surprising how quickly  the forces took the food wherever it was needed [words  indistinct].    These welcome first steps taken by the forces from the  developed world pleased the entire Somali people and revived  their hope in the future, which had been undermined by the  bandits throughout the country.    After these forces totally defeated the problems in the  country [words indistinct]. In addition to delivering aid, the  U.S. and allied forces [words indistinct] also did useful work  in destroying the technicals used in looting and patrolling  areas. They also helped advance peace in the country by  stabilizing its political system, settling differences,  organizing Somali aid and reconciliation conferences, resettling  and assisting displaced people, streamlining reconstruction in  the country, building welfare centers, creating a Somali police  force and courts, opening schools and hospitals, and much more.    They did all this in an energetic and tolerant spirit [words  indistinct]. While these forces were doing such good work, they  unfortunately encountered mistakes as a result of which they  suffered loss of life. The killing of the Good Samaritans who  had come to help us shocked the people of the donor countries to  the point they wanted to withdraw their troops, particularly  when their good work was being replaced by civil war.    The withdrawal of the troops was first announced by the U.S.  Government, to take effect within 16 months [as heard] and the  Western countries followed suit, fearing difficulties with the  Somalis. The United States left behind only 50 soldiers to  guard its embassy in Somalia. All the forces made it clear they  were sorry to leave at a time when there was not even a central  administration. [Word indistinct] their departure coincided  with a time when Somali leaders arrived at a peaceful agreement  in Nairobi, belying the claim that Somalis will return to  fighting.    The forces which left under the leadership of the United  States have truly done important and praiseworthy work for the  Somalis, who harbor affection for them and wish them peace and a  safe journey. The Somali people are urged to participate in the  reconstruction of the country.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] RIA was informed by the Moscow State Sanitary and  Epidemiological Inspectorate that the capital might be facing  the threat of a Tuberculosis epidemic in the near future. Last  year about 3,000 persons with Tuberculosis were registered in  the city. The medics are also worried by the fact that the  number of cases with complicated forms of Tuberculosis has  started to grow in Moscow.    The so-called high-risk groups consist first of all, of  tramps, drunkards, and refugees who live mostly in the central  part of the capital, at railway stations, in underground passes,  and in other crowded areas.

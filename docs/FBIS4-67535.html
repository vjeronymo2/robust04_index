			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xi Mi: "NEPA Struggles to Find Funds for </F> Environment"    [Text] To make sure that the sky is blue and  rivers are clean, China's investment-frustrated  environmentalists are trying hard to change the grim picture  painted by the State's protection plans.    The environmental situation in China is more serious than  most people might have realized, says Zhang Kunmin,  vice-director of the National Environmental Protection Agency  (NEPA).    Pollution is particularly severe in some  economically-developed and densely-populated regions; and city  pollution has been worsening and spreading to the rural areas.    The pollution caused by rural enterprises is also more  serious as indicated by a survey conducted by NEPA.    Environmental pollution and ecological damage have become a  barrier for economic development, social stability and reform  and opening to the outside world.    "Insufficient investment, outmoded production facilities,  and  lax law enforcement are responsible for the current  environmental problems," said Yang Zuojing, deputy director of  NEPA's pollution treatment department.    China spends 20 billion yuan ($2.30 billion) on environment  protection every year, which is 0.7 percent of its annual gross  national product.    Such a percentage is low. But in a time when the country is  thirsty for development funds, it is not easy for the government  to rapidly increase investment for protection.    How to protect environment effectively without much  financial  investment has been analyzed and reanalyzed.    Their are many options including the introduction of clean  production methods, better management of environmental  investment and stricter law enforcement. NEPA is considering  setting up a national environmental protection methods, better  management of environmental investment and stricter law  enforcement.    NEPA is considering setting up a national environmental  protection fund, combining government environmental spending,  overseas investment as well as enterprises' licence fees for  emitting pollutants.    Based on this fund, a national protection investment  corporation can be established to deal with transprovincial  environmental problems and help the central government implement  international treaties. This will make better use of investment.    An experiment in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, has  proven effective.    In 1988, with the support of the NEPA, the Shenyang  Environmental Protection Investment Corporation was founded to  oversee the design, bidding and management of environmental  projects.    Part of the local government's old allocation was  transformed  into the environmental fund, which the Corporation then gave out  as loans.    By the end of 1992, the corporation handled more than 162  million yuan ($18.6 million) of environmental loans. The sum of  environmental funds also tripled to 30 million yuan ($3.5  million).    With more money, problems are easier to solve.    The corporation is supposed to be responsible for its own  losses and gains, but it still retains some administrative power.    It receives guidance from the city's environmental  protection  bureau and its loans, to a certain extent, are still government  allocations.    If the receivers of the loans use them efficiently, they do  not return the principal; if not, they will have to repay part  of the investment and interest.    But the fund managers have their headaches. Because the  interest rate of the loans is much lower than that of the banks,  some enterprises would rather delay in repayment. This has  affected the flow and growth of the funds.    If a national investment corporation is to be founded, the  government's environmental allocation to enterprises should be  transformed into loans and the interest rate of the loans should  be raised, NEPA sources suggested, adding that the enterprises'  licence fees for emitting pollutants should not be used freely.    Besides a better management of the investment, the NEPA has  also tried to introduce clean production methods.    In clean production, manufacturers select the best treatment  programme after examining possible pollution sources in each  production procedure.    According to Yang, with the aid of the World Bank, NEPA  started clean production programmes in Beijing, Yantai, in  Shandong Province, and Shaoxing, in Zhejiang Province in 1993.    The programme aims to establish model clean production  bases,  introduce clean production technology and give technical  training classes.    Up to now, about 50 Chinese people have attended clean  production classes given by foreign experts.    With little investment, 51 pollution reduction packages have  been adopted in six enterprises in Beijing, altogether 203 tons  of COD were reduced and some 6.3 million yuan ($724,000) was  saved.    Yang has high hopes for the investment bank and clean  production programme, but he is less optimistic about the  prospects of law enforcement improvement.    The awareness of environmental laws is low. More often than  not laws are not strictly observed and enforcement is lax.    Some officials, especially the senior ones, let power and  opinion overrule laws, Yang said.    Many times the environmental protection agencies find  themselves lacking the authority to solve the problems facing  them.    "There is no clarified legal articles stipulating the kind  of  punishment for the law violators," Yang said.    Some environmental protection departments in enterprises and  local governments have been merged or cancelled. And some local  environment protection chiefs have been replaced when they try  to do their job.    Theoretically speaking, enterprises and projects seriously  breaking anti-pollution laws should be shut down. But it will be  a difficult decision to make because the State has to consider  the benefits of the unemployed workers--most of whom would from  State factories [as published].    Yang urged that relevant laws and regulations be amended.    Now some enterprises would rather pay fines for emitting  pollutants than treat pollution, which costs many times higher.    Statistics from GUANGMING DAILY indicated that the fines for  environmental pollution in 1992 and 1993 totalled 5.05 billion  yuan ($580 million), but during the same period, the money  invested to treat the pollution reached 5.57 billion yuan ($640  million).    To keep up with the new realities of the market economy, the  State plans to upgrade a series of environmental laws this year,  including those concerning the air and water protection.</p>

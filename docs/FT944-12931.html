			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Land of natural born censors - The postponement of Oliver Stone's controversial film, Natural Born Killers In a recent interview in the New Yorker film-maker Oliver Stone mused on the OJ Simpson murder case. 'The line between thinking murder and doing murder isn't that major,' he said. 'Isn't that the point of Natural Born Killers anyway?' Our censor certainly seems to think so. Using the excuse of caution in the run-up to next week's Criminal Justice Bill, he has put Stone's new movie - which was due to open in three weeks - on indefinite hold: presumably in the belief that showing it might help those with murder in their minds to get it out on to the streets. A story of two young killers on the rampage, Stone's film is already a cause celebre in its native US, where people refer to it familiarly as 'NBK' (from the director who brought you JFK). Several murders supposedly influenced by the film have been pinned to its charge sheet. Original screenwriter Quentin Tarantino disowned Stone's reworked script, saying it turned the spotlight away from the satirised media circus on to the luridly depicted couple themselves (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis). And Mario Vargas Llosa broke jury purdah at last month's Venice Film Festival to curse the movie publicly and to help ensure that it won the Special Jury Prize rather than the Golden Lion. Hardly a wooden spoon even so. Now NBK may become the first high-profile, prize-winning feature film to be banned outright in the UK. For a film journalist this has been a bizarre week. Two days after rumours broke last Sunday of censor James Ferman's move  -or rather decision not to move on the overdue certification - I rang the distributors Warner. Their press office said NBK would open as normal, on November 18, and that I must disregard all groundless reports. Two days after that, the rumours had several feet of concrete under them. And we who oppose censorship on a more or less across-the-board basis had another 10-ton controversy coming towards us. Natural Born Killers is not a masterpiece. In the US it was not even a popular masterpiece. After opening strongly it fizzled out, making about Dollars 47m (Pounds 29m). Any film-goer keen to be depraved or corrupted had to negotiate the alienating impact of Stone's style in the film. And yet that style - or cut-up multiplicity of styles, as if from the brain of an intellectual who has overdosed on MTV - gives the film its one claim to distinction. In a matter of seconds the same scene - even the same shot - is presented in colour/newsreel-style black-and-white/home-movie video/slow motion/fast motion. There are surreal back-projections; there are subtitles lantern-projected on to characters' bodies during a dialogue scene with Indians. Most bizarrely - and for me effectively - a flashbacked sequence of Lewis's abused childhood is presented as broad sitcom, complete with canned laughter and comedian Rodney Dangerfield as Dad. This not only debunks any hint of solemn special pleading on the character's behalf, it adds to the sense that Stone's film is less about the killers themselves than about the multitudinous ways we re-process - and trivialise  -true-life tragedies and horrors in the age of tabloids and wall-to-wall TV. The film has at least a glimmer of serious intentions. But that will not stop the usual baying for film- makers' blood of those who see movies as Incitement rather Insight in times of trouble and violence. For me, those in the UK who favour screen censorship - which has a stronger hold here than in almost any other western democracy - are in the same ideological cul-de-sac as those who favour state subsidy to our film-makers. They think that victory comes through lack of struggle: that moral arguments are won by never having them, just as prosperity is won by never having to earn it. Should children be protected from violent films? Probably they should. (Ergo: certificates). Should the mentally unstable be shielded from violent films? Of course they should. Should the adult, sound-minded population be held to ransom by these sectors of society, so that none of us can see and debate the controversial works? Of course it should not. But the UK is a tight little island with a siege mentality towards its culture and morals. We are natural born censors. This goes all the way from the protectionist nationalism of our attitude to our film industry  - we believe the world owes us a living - to the throttling of free and informed debate on movies like Natural Born Killers, by withholding the movie itself. We have had no full explanation from the censor on why he has singled out Stone's film. He himself has poured scepticism on the 'copycat' factor by referring to last year's Child's Play 3 false furore. The pointless martyrdom visited on Natural Born Killers, if delayed certification turns into a ban, may end up enhancing not diminishing the film's reputation.</p>

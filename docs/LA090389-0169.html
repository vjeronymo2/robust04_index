			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE KILLS 5 PALESTINIANS; INFILTRATOR SLAYS ISRAEL SOLDIER  </P> <P> Five Palestinians died amid mounting violence in the Israeli-occupied  territories Saturday, two of them in a shoot-out, and an Israeli soldier was  killed by an infiltrator from Jordan.  </P> <P> A terse army statement said soldiers killed two "terrorists" in a clash in the  early hours, wounding and arresting three others. Palestinians said all five  were wanted by security forces and some were armed. No soldiers were wounded.  </P> <P> Stone-throwing demonstrators in Nablus clashed with troops, and soldiers shot  dead a 14-year-old girl and wounded 10 protesters, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The army then placed the city of 120,000 under curfew.  </P> <P> In another aspect of the mounting violence, Palestinians said masked youths  shot dead a 30-year-old Arab in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. They had  initially reported he was killed by the army.  </P> <P> They said Abdullah Abu Shalouf was a drug dealer suspected of collaborating  with the Israeli security services. An army spokeswoman said Shalouf's killing  was a criminal matter being investigated by police.  </P> <P> Three other alleged collaborators were killed Friday, apparently by  Palestinians, pushing the number killed in inter-Arab violence to about 105.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem's Mokassed Hospital, Moustafa Hussein Dabah, 37, of Ramallah died  of head wounds sustained a week ago when his car was stoned. Palestinians said  Israeli settlers in the West Bank threw the rocks.  </P> <P> The Israeli army said the soldier was killed in a clash with a gunman who  infiltrated across Israel's northeastern border with Jordan.  </P> <P> It said the intruder, dressed in civilian clothes and armed with an AK-47 rifle  and a hand gun, was also killed in the morning clash at Kfar Ruppin, south of  the Sea of Galilee, an army spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Two other soldiers were wounded in the clash and one was reported shot in the  head and fighting for his life.  </P> <P> On two previous occasions this year, gunmen have crossed the border with Jordan  and carried out attacks inside Israel.  </P> <P> The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, told reporters at the scene that  the identity and motive of the assailant were unknown.  </P> <P> "Jordan must find a way to prevent shootings or infiltration from its border  and to maintain security along the border," he said.  </P></p>

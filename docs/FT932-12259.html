			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning of London bus plan 'chaos' TRANSPORT IN London could be thrown into chaos if the government presses ahead with its plans to deregulate the capital's bus services, MPs were told yesterday. The unanimous warning, delivered to the cross-party Commons transport committee, came from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils  - between them representing every local authority outside London. Mr Mark Dowd of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities said experience of bus deregulation in Britain's other big cities showed it would be 'a total and utter disaster' if extended to the capital. Mr Gordon Kingdon, representing the Association of District Councils, said: 'We cannot say anything other than that it's a risk too great to take in London.' Bus deregulation, introduced everywhere in Britain except London in 1986, means that any competent operator can run any service it likes. It has been accompanied by an increase in the number of buses in operation but a decrease in the overall number of passengers. The cabinet is today expected to agree that legislation to deregulate London's bus services should be introduced in the next parliamentary session and put into effect in 1995. The local authority associations said fares in metropolitan areas had risen by 30 per cent in real terms since dereg-ulation and the cost of travel-cards, where they still existed, had gone up by even more. Mr Peter Sephton, managing director of Sheffield's municipally owned South Yorkshire Transport, said de-regulation was 'one of the daftest policies that anyone can possibly imagine for public transport'. Mr Sephton described how bus drivers deliberately blocked the road with their vehicles when picking up passengers at stops to prevent competing buses over-taking. Operators also caused congestion by halting at busy stops for long periods to pick up as many passengers as they could before continuing with their journeys, he said, pre-dicting that extending deregulation to London would have similar effects in the capital.</p>

The letter dated February 12 says the participants in the  seminar confirmed the truth of the chuche idea that to firmly  build up the internal political forces and enhance their role is  the basic guarantee of the building of a new independent society  and called for keeping heightened vigilance against the  western-style "multi-party parliamentary democracy" aimed at  disintegrating the patriotic forces.    Noting that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the  homeland of the chuche idea and a model in the building of a new  independent society, the letter says the participants are  convinced that only when they regard independence as the life  and soul of the country and the nation and achieve unity of the  patriotic forces by rallying the popular masses around the  leader and the leading organization, as indicated by the chuche  idea, can they defend the sovereignty of the country and win  economic liberation.    The letter wishes President Kim Il-song good health and long  life.</p>

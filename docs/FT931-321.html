			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome sold again PHARMACEUTICAL issues were hit heavily yesterday, the slide accounting for more than 8 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. Wellcome was the principal casualty, tumbling 56p at one stage as it went ex a 4.8p dividend. A number of UK securities houses have been taking the view that the sector is poised to recover, but worries ahead of proposed reforms in the US drugs market and general concern that margins are being squeezed held sway again yesterday. Consequently, traders who had held long positions at Friday's close were caught out when prices fell again. Wellcome shares lost ground for the fourth trading day in succession and the decline increased in the afternoon as cautious US investors returned to the fray. By the close the stock was down 47 at 742p xd on turnover of 4.2m. Meanwhile, the fortunes of Glaxo suffered further, the shares losing 21 at 576p as the company confirmed a newspaper report that it is to write to doctors in the US to correct statements made about its best-selling Zantac ulcer drug. The US Food and Drug Administration criticised Glaxo earlier this year for promotional material which suggested Zantac was safer than a rival drug from SmithKline Beecham. Although SmithKline was not immune from the sector tension - the 'A' shares dropped 14 1/2 to 392 1/2 p and the Units lost 13 to 344p - some analysts feel that it will be the first of the three leading UK drugs stocks to recover.</p>

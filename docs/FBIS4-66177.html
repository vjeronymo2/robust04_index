			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A Bing (7093 0393): "Save the Abducted" -- </F> edited by He Yulin (0149 3768 7792)]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] One of the questions we should  think about is the criminal nature of the acts of abducting and  selling people on the one hand and buying abducted people on the  other. The reality is that different views exist on the  criminality of the buyers and sellers and on whether the offense  is a felony or a misdemeanor. In certain aspects, the difference  in opinion is rather wide. This is a question worth studying by  the judicial department. Meanwhile, investigations reveal that  the public security department can act strictly and promptly to  crack down on abductors, and once an abductor is caught, a case  is set up for open trial. Such action is to the immense  satisfaction of the public. As to those buying abducted people,  however, no prompt action is taken to put them on trial. Some  people even express sympathy with the buyers, thinking that  they, too, are victims, who were cheated by human mongers to buy  abducted people with their hard-earn money. In the opinion of  these people, when the public security department has rescued  the abducted people, the buyers have "lost both the people and  money," so they should be excused from legal liability if at all  possible. This kind of thinking has misled a number of people,  giving them the erroneous idea that because money is spent,  buying humans does not offend the law. Such a state of affairs  has fueled, to a certain extent, the rampancy of abduction. It  has convinced human mongers that if they can abduct people,  there is a big "market" to sell their preys. The writer deems it  necessary to strike hard at human mongers. This will give  everyone a lift of heart. At the same time, the writer also  holds that it is imperative to deal hard blows to human buyers,  punish them promptly, harshly, and strictly, and make them aware  that using money to buy humans is an offense against law.    Another question to think about is that the two "five-year  plans to spread legal knowledge," though both have its dead  angle, have produced remarkable results. This is a matter worthy  of deep thought. Since 1985, our country has formulated two  educational plans aimed at spreading legal knowledge among all  its people. In general, the plans have been well carried out  with remarkable results. The results are especially noticeable  in certain areas, big and medium cities in particular. This can  be seen from the fact that the masses in these areas are better  aware than before of the need to use law to protect themselves.  With regard to disgusting phenomena in society and relations  between people, they no longer have a simple idea and viewpoint,  but can deeply ponder over and analyze the questions. Moreover,  they have enhanced their consciousness of self-protection by  means of law. Some have imbued their minds with the idea that  "all men are equal before the law" and displayed the spirit of  equality contained in the "law" in dealing with everything. Now,  the fact is that there are far less instances of abduction in  cities than in the countryside, and the situation is better in  well-off rural areas than in remote villages and mountain areas.  In view of this, the writer believes that an important task to  radically eliminate abduction is to educate the citizens to  protect and guard themselves. All other measures can only solve  the symptoms on the surface. They can only reduce, to a certain  degree, the instances of abduction, but cannot thoroughly  eradicate the problem.    The third question is that provisions should be  established for the administration of both permanent residents  and floating population. The resident registration system formed  after the founding of the People's Republic has been improved  from time to time during the past decades. We should say that  resident registration has been normalized and widely accepted by  the broad masses as a common practice. However, with the  deepening of the reform and open drive, especially the  development of rural reform, a large number of surplus laborers  have emerged from the countryside and become jobless vagrants.  To earn a living, make a good income, and become better off at  an early date, these people have rushed to more economically  developed areas to do business, work as laborers, engage in  contract work, or conduct other economic activities. This has  increased remarkably the floating population in these areas.  Unfortunately, our population administration regulations and  procedures have not been revised in time to catch up with such a  situation. As a result, in some localities no control can be  exercised over the floating population. Taking advantage of this  loophole, lawless elements have come up to commit abduction and  selling of people. In view of this, it is necessary to  strengthen the administration of resident registration for  floating as well as permanent residents. Those who temporarily  reside in a locality should be required to register as temporary  residents. This way, we will be able to exercise unified  administration of floating residents and to prevent or alleviate  the problem of lack of macro-control over the population. In  this regard, some localities have made successful exploration  and trials. They require those who have come from outside to  register as temporary residents. Based on the information  provided, they check the newcomers' original places of domicile  and send out letters to the departments concerned to find out  the real situation, thus exercising effective macroeconomic  control over the floating population. In addition, some  localities have set up computerized floating-population files.  All related information is recorded in the computer and put into  a control network. This method has long been used in foreign  countries. In our country, however, its application is  relatively limited because computers have not been so widely  popularized. As far as the present situation is concerned,  establishing a normal, rational population-flow mechanism and  forming a floating-population administration system based on the  law should be one of the major tasks in building China's legal  system--a task we should carry out step by step and continue to  improve.</p>

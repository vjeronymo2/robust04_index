			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The government may  consider de-linking an inter-Korean envoy exchange with a third  round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington, a  senior official hinted Sunday.    Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, after attending a forum  of ruling and opposition party lawmakers held at Academy House  in Seoul, said it is worth studying a de-linking of the two  issues.    Hong's remarks drew notice because the government is set to  review its overall policy toward Pyongyang and decide on future  policy following the adoption of a U.N. Security Council  president's statement.    The government held a senior officials' meeting late last  week to discuss its strategy for inter-Korean talks and  resumption of "Team Spirit," the South Korean-U.S. annual joint  military exercise, and decided to make a final decision after  Foreign Minister Han returns Monday evening from trips to the  United States and Japan.    The government has thus far maintained that an inter-Korean  exchange of special envoys should be realized before the third  round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks is held.    Hong said, "We should study whether the government's linking  of the special envoy exchange to the third round of high-level  talks is helpful in solving the North Korean nuclear problem.    "But if we stopped linking the two issues, there might be a  problem of national sentiment that South Korea was being  excluded from the nuclear issue and that the government's  principles on the issue had changed." In spite of possible  problems, Hong personally preferred de-linking the envoy  exchange and the high-level talks.    If North Korea did not ensure transparency of its nuclear  program at talks with the United States despite South Korea  having withdrawn the precondition of a special envoy exchange,  the world would have a more solid foundation to impose sanctions  on Pyongyang, according to Hong. In addition, Seoul does not  have to link the two issues to improve inter-Korean relations,  he added.    If Washington and Pyongyang set up diplomatic ties, then  inter-Korean relations would naturally improve: Conversely, if  inter-Korean links improved, then Pyongyang-Washington relations  would also get better, he said. "It doesn't matter which of the  two comes first," he said.</p>

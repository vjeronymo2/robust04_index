			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- An extraordinary  party congress of the right-wing extremist National Democratic  Party of Germany [Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands]  (NPD) apparently is to be held in the town of Ehringshausen (in  Lahn-Dill rural district) in Hesse. This emerges from a letter  in DDP/ADN's possession from the NPD party executive to party  members dated 10 January. According to the letter, the congress  is to begin at 1000 in the Volkshalle in Ehringshausen.    The Lahn-Dill branch of the DGB [German Trade Union  Federation] has already announced a counterdemonstration and  rally, permits for which have already been applied for and  approved, according to a spokesman. The counterdemonstrators  intend to gather at 0900 at Ehringshausen station.    The police in Giessen also expect the party congress to go  ahead in Ehringhausen, but do not rule out that the meeting may  be held elsewhere. The NPD had named various places in  Thuringia and Hesse during the run-up to the congress,  apparently in order to confuse the counterdemonstrators.  Giessen police said they would be responding flexibly. [passage  omitted]</p>

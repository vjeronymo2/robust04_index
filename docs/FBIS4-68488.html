			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alla Barakhova: "There Are Four Contenders for </F> the Post of President. The Election Will Cost the Taxpayers  Three Billion Rubles"]    [Text] The last stage of the election campaign has begun in  the Republic of Komi. Several days ago the Central Electoral  Commission registered four candidates for the post of head of  government who have received the number of votes necessary for  registration. Aleksandr Gladkov, general director of the  Inta-Ugol Concern; Yuriy Spiridonov, chairman of the Republic of  Komi Supreme Soviet; Vyacheslav Khudyayev, chairman of the  Republic of Komi Council of Ministers; and Valeriy Markov,  chairman of the State Committee for Revival of the Komi People,  who came out in favor of the rights of the Komi people codified  in the law, became the contenders. All the candidates have yet  to release the final versions of their election platforms.    Recently Chairman of the Council of Ministers Vyacheslav  Khudyayev has been voicing in interviews and public  presentations the opinion that now is not the time for the  election; the situation in the economy is too difficult. The 3  billion needed to elect the head of the republic and the  deputies of local soviets will have to be taken away from  teachers, physicians, and other employees of the sector financed  from the budget. These statements are being received in various  ways. Khudyayev's supporters view them as showing concern for  the people, and his opponents--as indicating a desire to  frustrate the elections. Incidentally, according to a public  opinion poll, Khudyayev's rating is the lowest, with the current  head of parliament, Yuriy Spiridonov, ranking first.    Vigorous actions taken by Spiridonov to defend the interests  of the republic while serving as head of parliament are  contributing to his success.    Thus, at a press conference concerning the results of a  regular meeting of the Federation Council, Yuriy Spiridonov,  chairman of the Republic of Komi parliament, stated that the law  on guarantees and compensation for northern territories was not  taken into account in development of the 1994 federal budget of  the Russian Federation; the budgets of krays and republics are  expected to assume a proportion of federal spending. In this  case the entire burden of expenditures will devolve on  enterprises. In the opinion of Yuriy Spiridonov, only radical  changes in tax policy can improve the existing situation and  make the output of northern enterprises competitive. Referring  to the results of joint hearings on the north in the Federation  Council with the State Duma, Spiridonov stated that an agreement  among deputies from the northern regions exists under which the  deputies intend to block passage of the budget if the draft of  the document does not envision complying with the law on the  north. The decision of a session of the Republic of Komi  parliament on reducing tax transfers to the federal budget from  13 to 8 percent will take effect on 15 April.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Book Review: The wonder years HAROLD WILSON By Ben Pimlott HarperCollins, Pounds 20, 811 pages Harold Wilson has been lucky in the timing of this book, the nearest to an official biography published so far. His stock, as a prime minister due for revaluation, has been rising steadily in recent months. Ben Pimlott, the author, has been fortunate, too. Some of the similarities between parts of the Wilson period and the turmoils that John Major has been going through in the past few weeks are uncanny. Since the parallels may be temporary, and therefore superficial, the best thing to do is to read the book now while it is still hot. Red hot, or as Wilson himself might have put it, white hot. There are two factors which marred the Wilson administrations which are with us still. One was the weakness of the British economy, which had a corresponding effect on the exchange rate. The other was Europe: in or out or somewhere in between? For the historian, the question is whether Wilson did a reasonable job in the circumstances, or whether he could have done better. The case for the former has risen, as successive prime ministers have failed to come to terms with Europe and the economy. Wilson had a long experience of devaluation. As the youngest member of the cabinet since 1806, he lived through the agonies that led to the devaluation of 1949. Although it may have been necessary, it brought no immediate solution to the country's economic problems. For Wilson, Pimlott notes, it was an experience never to be repeated. That comment says a lot about Wilson's approach when he became prime minister in 1964. Hindsight has it that all might have been better if the new Labour government had devalued straightaway. In fact, the formal devaluation was staved off until late 1967, and even then it did not end the succession of sterling crises and the need to curb public expenditure. Some people who claim to have said that the case for a quick change in the exchange rate was obvious did not say so at the time. In all that, we may catch a foretaste of the present government grappling with sterling and the ERM this autumn. On Europe Wilson was initially an agnostic. Subsequently, when prime minister, he was a convert. When reverting to leader of the opposition, he was a waverer. Finally, when prime minister again, he became a believer in putting the choice to the people. He picked up the idea of a popular vote from Tony Benn, and for a while the referendum in 1975 seemed to have settled the issue once and for all. Wilson was criticised for those tergiversations, but at least he could claim that he held the party, and to some extent the country, together. In this respect, Pimlott is perceptive. He notes that the more Wilson seemed committed to Europe, the more sterling seemed suspect on the foreign exchange markets. The markets did not believe that Britain was ready to accept all the disciplines of even the early Community. There are, of course, differences between Wilson and his successors as prime minister. Only Wilson had to deal with the tantrums of George Brown, who, as deputy leader of the party, was a brilliant and popular man in his way, but erratic and desperately worried about losing his seat in the 1970 general election. Far more important was Vietnam. The Americans wanted British support for the war, which - to put it mildly - the Labour movement was reluctant to give. On the other hand, Britain wanted American help to prop up sterling. It was an uneasy compromise. Wilson fudged his way through, but there was a price. Vietnam as much as anything led to the development of a hard, and to some extent extra-parliamentary, left which was to plague the party for at least the next 15 years. Those around at the time can recall the enthusiasm which surrounded Wilson's first victory in 1964. He seemed the voice of the new Britain; classless, interested in technology, planning and economic growth. Pimlott explains this in terms of big ideas: the National Plan and the new Department of Economic Affairs. When economic growth proved a chimera, the plan collapsed and so did Wilsonism. Thereafter he became a prime minister under siege or, as Wilson later put it himself, someone primarily interested in keeping the ship afloat. Hindsight suggests that we should be more kind to him than were some of his contemporaries. Only Margaret Thatcher has subsequently done better, and even her achievements are subject to review. Pimlott's book is not perfect, partly because he has not finally formed his own judgment. He is sometimes too hostile to the ambitious young Wilson, then unduly sympathetic to the prime minister in his dog days. Yet without the ambition Wilson would never have arrived in the first place. The book is also uneasily poised between journalism and history: too much on scandals like Profumo, not enough detached assessment. Although 811 pages may seem long, too much is missed out: it is not a chronicle of the time. But it does contain new detail, like Wilson's alliance with Enoch Powell during the 1974 election. And it reminds us of some marvellous quotes, such as Wilson being asked what he would miss most on leaving 10 Downing Street in 1970: 'Mainly the job.'</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Companies face City crane trial TWO companies face a crown court trial over the collapse of a crane into the church of St James, Garlickhythe, in the City last year. The collapse caused damage estimated at more than Pounds 1m. It is alleged that steel erection company JN Rowen of Sutton in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, which designed the crane base, failed to ensure a temporary steel grillage that supported the crane and its fixings was safe. A John Laing Group company is accused of failing to ensure that the temporary support did not expose people to risk. An application by the companies to have the case heard by magistrates was rejected at City Magistrates' Court.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mondadori sale set to raise L990bn Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and media magnate, should raise L990bn (Dollars 611m) through the sale of a 53 per cent stake in Mondadori, the company which groups all his book and magazine publishing interests. The price of the international offering of 66m new Mondadori shares was yesterday set at L15,000 a share, at the top of the range established by Mr Berlusconi's banking advisers - Mediobanca and Banca Commerciale Italiana - in April. Mr Franco Tato, managing director of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest business empire and of Mondadori, returned from an international roadshow last week bullish about the prospects for the sale, which begins tomorrow. The offering will be watched carefully, not only by investors and bankers, but also by political opponents of Mr Berlusconi. This is the first attempt by the new prime minister to distance himself from his business interests, which range from television and football to financial services and retailing. Mr Berlusconi is under pressure to sell-off parts of this empire to cut debts at Fininvest and reduce the risk of a conflict of interest between his political and entrepreneurial ambitions. Observers are also eager to see if the decision of Mediobanca to work with Fininvest for the first time on this deal marks the beginning of a powerful alliance between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Enrico Cuccia, the merchant bank's 86-year-old honorary chairman. Less than 2 per cent of Mondadori - the full name of which is Arnoldo Mondadori Editore - is still quoted on the Milan stock exchange. But ahead of the offering, Mondadori merged with Silvio Berlusconi Editore, the private company which held many of the prime minister's publishing interests, to create one of the largest publishing companies in Europe. The combined group, in which Mr Berlusconi will have a 47 per cent stake, would have shown a gross operating profit of L252bn last year, on sales of L1,830bn. The net profit for the enlarged group would have been about L100bn in 1993. Mr Berlusconi last month appointed Mr Giovanni Spadolini - a former Italian prime minister and political opponent of Mr Berlusconi - to Mondadori's board, as a guarantee of the company's independence. Several political and business associates of Mr Berlusconi stepped down at the same time, but Mr Berlusconi also appointed his two grown-up children from his first marriage as directors, an indication that his family is unlikely ever to abandon ultimate control of Fininvest companies.</p>

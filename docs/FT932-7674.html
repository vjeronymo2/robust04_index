			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Most CIS states to get own currencies MOST OF the former states of the Soviet Union are expected to introduce their own currencies in the next year, as a result of the International Monetary Fund's stance on linking its support to the control of inflation. The IMF, now negotiating with Russia over a Pounds 1.5bn initial tranche of support, changed its position of encouraging the former Soviet states to remain in the rouble zone after it became clear that the Russian central bank's generous credits to industry and the budget would continue, and with it very high levels of inflation. The reversal will place some pressure on the other states to leave the rouble zone to benefit from Fund, World Bank and bilateral support for a reform programme. Its consequences have been highlighted this month by the introduction in Kyrgyzia, one of the smallest and poorest of the newly independent states, of its own currency, the som. The currency has Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) backing from the IMF, the World Bank and the Japanese government - a relatively large sum for a small and poor country - to support its pegged rate of four som to the dollar. Mr Tursunbek Chyngyshev, the Kyrgyz prime minister, said officials from other states had told him before the som was introduced that they supported his move and would all follow suit shortly. 'They all believe it is inevitable and that Russia itself will soon make the decision to create its own currency.' Russia is still the banker for most of the 15 former Soviet states - though it is increasingly limiting the credits paid out to them and in some cases, as with Ukraine, has stopped issuing credits entirely. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, this week welcomed Kyrgyzia's adoption of the som as an example for others. The rouble has been, since the beginning of this year, printed with 'Bank of Russia' rather than 'USSR'. However, it is still available to all states, in both cash notes and so-called 'cashless' credits through accounts between the central banks of the republics and of Russia. IMF officials are making it clear to the republics that a decision to remain in the rouble zone is their own to make, but if they decided to remain they would be treated as an economic extension of Russia. If an agreement was reached between the Fund and Russia, these states could also hope to conclude one; if none was, they would probably be unable to conclude their own. Besides the three Baltic states - which declared independence first and introduced currencies or coupons last year - only Ukraine has yet to conclude an agreement with the IMF, and its currency is closer to a coupon than to a fully-fledged money issue. Turkmenistan, another Central Asian state, has said it will create its own currency in the autumn. Its economy, based on huge reserves of natural gas, is much stronger than Kyrgyzia's. Kazakhstan has only a few days to prevent crops in the south of the country from being devastated by locusts, but a government official said yesterday he was confident the threat would be eliminated. Reuter reports from Moscow. Deputy agriculture minister Viktor Kosarev was quoted in the Kazakh capital Alma-Ata as saying more than half of the 300,000 hectares of pasture land infested with locust larvae had already been sprayed with chemicals in an operation using 14 aircraft and 200 tractors. The locusts would be destroyed this month.</p>

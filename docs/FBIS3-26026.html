Hard on their heels, however, is  a fast-growing army of counterfeiters who are pulling in  hundreds of millions of dollars while local officials look the  other way.    Take the case of Microsoft. In October 1991, the US software  manufacturer was shocked to discover counterfeit copies of its  hologram appearing up and down the American West Coast. Company  officials had thought the hologram -- a sophisticated reflective  sticker used to authenticate products -- was almost impossible  to duplicate.    After months of detective work, the fakes were traced to an  unexpected source: the Shenzhen Reflective Materials Institute  at Shenzhen University in southern China. The institute was  raided the following March by the Shenzhen Administration of  Industry and Commerce (AIC), which found contracts and materials  that suggested the institute had received an order for 3 million  holograms. Almost two years later, many questions remain. "The  AIC did a very good raid, it was excellent," Alix Parlour,  corporate attorney for Microsoft, said. "But it's been downhill  since then."    Despite numerous meetings with the Shenzhen branch of the  AIC, she said, the Chinese had failed to provide Microsoft with  information they have about a Taiwanese company involved in the  case. Microsoft still has no idea where the moulds used to make  the holograms are, or, more importantly, if they are still in  use.    Company officials are not sure why the Chinese are dragging  their feet, but Parlour offered the following speculation.  "There's always the dismal prospect that someone at the  university is well-connected and can protect the institute," she  said. Many counterfeiters are state enterprises, collectives,  or village or township enterprises. "Officials say, `Hey, these  are my factories, I'm not going to put these guys out of  business'," a Hong Kong-based trade official said.    One leading provincial official in the south of China told a  US trade official that he would only intervene on behalf of  foreign manufacturers producing in his province. Experts agree  that the State Administration for Industry and Commerce -- which  deals with trademark infringements -- is serious about cracking  down on pirates.    Unfortunately, the state organisation's local branches,  understaffed and lacking resources and political clout, often  prove unable or unwilling to take action. Local AIC branches  are particularly careful when dealing with big counterfeiters  with powerful connections. "Sometimes the AIC will carry out a  raid right away," Joseph Simone, a lawyer with Johnson Stokes  and Master who advises on intellectual property law, said. "But  often they will first do a political background check to see who  the counterfeiter is. Some people have gone to jail for going  after the wrong factory."    In some cases, money can move the AIC to action. Foreign  companies report being asked to "contribute" funds to set up  special teams to raid infringers. The head of one industry  association said his organisation was asked for US$250,000  (about HK$1.95m).    Patrick Wong, executive secretary of the Hong Kong office of  the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said  that while China had the capacity to turn out 62 million compact  discs a year, its actual consumption was 2-3 million. The rest,  says the former Hong Kong policeman, ended up in Hong Kong,  Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Canada and the US.    Although the organisation, which represents recording  artists  around the world, provided Chinese officials with the names and  locations of about a dozen factories that were illegally  reproducing CDs and handed over funds for a task force, when the  AIC finally carried out raids it was against shops in Shenzhen  and not the well connected factories manufacturing tens of  millions of CDs.    And getting the AIC to carry out a raid does not necessarily  end a company's problems. Although foreign companies are  generally permitted to send a representative along on raids, not  all AICs allow this. When the AIC raided three companies  pirating Walt Disney products in Guangdong province last year,  the American company was not allowed to participate in the raid,  raising doubts about what was actually seized and what has  happened to the factories. "We'll only believe it when we can  go on a raid and see (the offender) shut down and say `ouch',"  John Feenie, executive vice-president Asia Pacific for Walt  Disney, said.    Some foreigners also suspect that AIC officials tip off  violators before a raid can be organised. To prevent this,  Steven McVeigh, Hong Kong manager for Pinkerton Consulting and  Investigations Services, said the company sometimes stationed  employees outside factories even before it approached the AIC.    Simone estimates that some big companies should budget as  much as US$500,000 to cover the cost of private investigators,  lawyers and in-house staff. But, he added, few companies were  earning enough in China to justify such an expense. And even  when a company succeeds in uncovering an infringer, justice is  not always done.    Criminal punishments are rarely handed down and only in  trademark cases. It is difficult to get compensation and fines  are too low to be a deterrent. In the case of Microsoft, it  took the AIC two years to fine the offender and the fine was  HK$2,000.    Some frustrated companies have abandoned the legal road for  more direct methods. This often results in what Simone  described as "an unhealthy reliance" on establishing guanxi, or  connections. One foreign law firm that has handled  intellectual-property cases through its offices in China has  retired Chinese judges on its staff.</p>

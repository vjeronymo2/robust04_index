			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TEACHER SALARY DISPUTE  </P> <P> In response to Frank del Olmo's column "Who Gains if UTLA Alienates the  Parents?" (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 15), I say, what a shallow analysis, premised on a  false assumption!  </P> <P> The current labor dispute between United Teachers-Los Angeles and the Los  Angeles Unified School District isn't interfering with the education inner-city  parents want their children to get. Education is proceeding as if the teachers  had a contract.  </P> <P> So far only the families of teachers observing the boycott of certain  "non-academic" duties have suffered financially, because of docked paychecks.  </P> <P> I can't see how teachers can be painted as selfish and shortsighted when we put  our livelihood on the line every year to reach a fair settlement -- not just  for ourselves, but also for the students.  </P> <P> The public should keep in mind that poor working conditions for teachers mean  poor learning conditions for students, and that low pay equals low morale and  mediocre performance.  </P> <P> The battle for good education is led by the teachers. We pay the price every  year through stressful and bitter negotiations, only to have oversimplistic  analyses like Del Olmo's paint us as cynics.  </P> <P> When teachers across this country are paid their comparable worth, boycotting,  slow-downs and strikes will be a thing of the past.  </P> <P> If we treasure our kids, we should pay teachers commensurate to the social  value they represent. Short of that, I'll stand by the union.  </P> <P> STERLING DELONE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others; from the  "Diplomatic Panorama" feature]    [Text] Russia continues to actively cooperate with India's  National Space Agency and is prepared to supply it with seven  contracts, the Director General of Russia's Space Agency, Yuri  Koptev, told Interfax.    According to him, the $220 Mn contract signed with the  former  USSR remains virtually the same amount, even though Moscow had  to give up the supplies of booster technologies stipulated in  the contract.    According to Koptev, Russia agreed to shoulder some of the  commitments connected with India's space program. For instance,  it is prepared to supply cryogen boosters (i.e. the last stage  of the booster rocket) for India's Geostationary Satellite  Launch Vehicles.    In addition, Russia has signed a contract worth $28 Mn for  the production and supply of equipment to service cryogen  booster systems.</p>

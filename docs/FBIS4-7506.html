			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We dedicate the following minutes of the  broadcast to yesterday's [30 March] session of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent Assembly. Ivo Komsic, president,  and Luka Markesic, Petar (?Josolic), and Ivan Lovrenovic, all  members of the Croatian National Council, today held a press  conference at which they stated their position regarding the  role of this body in implementing the provisions of the  Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina adopted  yesterday. Mladen Bosnjak has the details.    [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] Ivo Komsic, president of the  Croatian National Council, assessed the session of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly -- which ended yesterday -- as being  a historic turning point for many reasons, and not only for our  state, but also for the Republic of Croatia. He assessed that  the newly adopted Constitution was proof of Bosnia-Herzegovina's  strength. The historic quality of the Constitution is evident  in the fact that its contents evolved from the utmost suffering  of our state and its citizens. Establishing the place and role  of the Croatian National Council, Ivo Komsic said that the  Congress of Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats had defined a project  around which it was possible to achieve complete accord, and  added:    [Komsic] Now that we have a Constitution, it is the Croatian  National Council's duty to invest all its strength and potential  into implementing this Constitution, to do [words indistinct],  and to fulfill its duty to the utmost, a duty for which this  body was formed in the first place. We shall, of course,  support this and do everything that will be required of us in  the course of implementing this Constitution -- both in the  political sense and on the ground, where very concrete tasks  will have to carried out ....    [Bosnjak] For Luka Markesic, Franciscan friar and believer,  the most important thing now was to restore the love and the  strength of spirit in the people, victims of war, so that they  can in peace bear and overcome their hatred and thoughts of  revenge. Petar (?Josolic) stressed that one of the roles of the  Croatian National Council would be [words indistinct] when the  Croats from Vares and the Muslims from Capljina return to their  homes -- they and all the others. [passage omitted]    [Bosnjak] After the introductory greetings -- of which you  have heard the most significant details -- correspondents' asked  two questions. Ivo Komsic answered both. First, about the  candidates for the highest offices in the Federation.    [Komsic] Between now and the next Assembly session, we shall  be coordinating our positions regarding [changes thought] and we  shall try to reach a consensus on this in the Croatian deputy  caucus -- which is now being formed from the rest of the  caucuses that are already in the parliament -- just as we  reached a consensus in political negotiations regarding this  project.    [Bosnjak] The other question pertained to the Croatian  National Council's position toward the possibility of a  confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia, after the  possible participation of the Bosnian Serbs in the Federation of  Bosnia- Herzegovina. Ivan Lovrenovic stressed that there were  no definite answers to this. Mr. Komsic stressed that the  Croatian National Council cannot support the possibility of any  kind of confederal arrangement between the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.    [Komsic] [Words indistinct] of confederal relations with  Croatia, why then should we not have a confederal relationship  with Serbia? The reason for not doing so is very simple; Serbia  has carried out aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina with the help  of the Serbian Democratic Party, which formed a para-state here.  There can be no political or moral justification for such an  act, and the world cannot support it. The aggressor must be  punished in some way. [end recording]</p>

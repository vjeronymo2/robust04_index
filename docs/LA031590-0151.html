			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR TRAFFIC ENGINEERS, A BALANCING ACT;  </P> <P> COMMUTING: THEY DEAL WITH THE LITTLE THINGS -- SIGNALS, SIGNS, TURN LANES --  THAT KEEP THE CITY MOVING.  </P> <P> Commuters inched forward, part of a mile-long backup. Several drivers  jerk-stopped their cars, too late to slip through the green light. One  frustrated motorist in a pickup truck cut off a car, and the two drivers  exchanged obscene gestures.  </P> <P> Nearby, a gas station operator grumbled that business was down. A traffic  officer proclaimed that ticket-writing was up.  </P> <P> Amid the commotion at the intersection of Victory and Sepulveda boulevards last  week, there stood soft-spoken Eleanor Pui Ng, stopwatch and clipboard in hand,  preparing to tinker once more with the commutes of the 65,666 motorists who  pass through the intersection each day.  </P> <P> At a time when horn-honking, fist-flailing traffic woes are a prime producer of  complaints all over Los Angeles, Pui Ng is a member of a little-known but  influential cadre of Los Angeles city traffic engineers who quietly spill onto  the roadways each workday on a sometimes futile, occasionally victorious,  mission to fix troubled streets.  </P> <P> "Maybe if I take two more seconds from Sepulveda it will help Victory," Pui Ng  said, eyeing the traffic-signal timer. "Maybe 2 1/2 seconds. You know,  sometimes this can be very delicate. A few seconds can screw everything up."  </P> <P> The traffic engineer's judgment can alter the length of the backup on major  avenues, the safety of an intersection and the profits of a business. Some  residents, desperate for traffic improvements, plead with engineers for relief  because their lifestyles, even their lives, are at stake.  </P> <P> "I take my life in my own hands when I make a turn," wrote one resident who  lives near Mulholland Drive. "We must have a left-turn arrow."  </P> <P> "Customers can't reach us because the alley is blocked off," said David Lynch,  operator of a drive-through hot dog stand, asking engineers to settle a dispute  between competing restaurants.  </P> <P> Hundreds of similar complaints create the traffic engineer's raison d'etre,  officials said. Although the complaint-line telephone number is not publicized  like a hot line, scores of residents have managed to find it, creating a  citywide backlog of about 16,000 complaints that would take more than a year to  work through, said Ed Rowe, general manager of the Department of  Transportation.  </P> <P> While high-level transportation officials handle decisions on mammoth traffic  improvement projects -- such as subway construction, selection of rail routes  and the installation of a multimillion-dollar traffic-signal synchronization  program -- traffic engineers most often deal in minutiae: stop signs, red curb  zones, left-turn arrows, median stripes and timing of traffic lights.  </P> <P> In their work, they have found that the popularity of the simple street sign  cannot be underestimated.  </P> <P> Last year, nearly 5,000 Los Angeles residents requested new street signs. About  5,700 more wanted some type of new pavement marking and about 2,000 residents  requested new traffic signals.  </P> <P> And they all seem to want their signs, markings and signals now.  </P> <P> "We carry the brunt of a lot of frustrations. Some people come to us truly  belligerent about things," said Thomas Jones, a senior transportation engineer.  "There is only so much we can do to make traffic flow better. I can't promise a  miracle, but we can do some good things."  </P> <P> What people have trouble understanding is that raising a street sign is a  complicated task. Switching on a five-second left-turn arrow can bring on a  mile-long backup. Car-count surveys, geometric designs, "pedestrian-seconds"  and signal cycles must be considered before any new street device is installed.  </P> <P> Few locales offer such a fine example of a traffic mess as the intersection of  Victory and Sepulveda boulevards in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> For months, residents in a four-block neighborhood southwest of the  intersection pleaded with the city to stop what many described as the selfish  practice of speeding commuters who turned right off of Victory to take a  shortcut through their streets.  </P> <P> "It was bedlam out there," said Orion Street resident Kathleen Freeman. "There  is no reason for a neighborhood to be destroyed so that someone can get to a  job 10 minutes faster."  </P> <P> The residents demanded that traffic engineers install a "No Right Turn" sign.  </P> <P> But first, the city had to investigate. Was there really bedlam on Orion  Street? A device was laid on the road to count the number of cars. The  calculator tabulated more than 800 vehicles an hour.  </P> <P> "That's pretty much," Pui Ng said.  </P> <P> Up went several "No Right Turn" signs to prevent motorists from turning before  the major intersection at Victory. A right-turn lane was added on Victory to  accommodate the 800 cars back on the boulevard each hour. A new right-turn  arrow was added to help the 800 cars make it around the corner.  </P> <P> The result?  </P> <P> Smiling residents. Scowling commuters. One grumbling gas station manager who  said business has dropped about 10% because customers can't turn right into his  station. And a six- to 13-minute delay eastbound on Victory Boulevard that on a  bad day creates a 1 1/2-mile backup.  </P> <P> Pui Ng figures that she can steal two, maybe 2 1/2 more seconds from Sepulveda  commuters so that two more cars on Victory can traverse the intersection each  cycle.  </P> <P> If she took half a second more, the average pedestrian, who walks four feet per  second, would not have enough time to cross Victory Boulevard.  </P> <P> "This intersection was like a suitcase that had been stuffed as tight as it  can," Pui Ng said. "Then someone wanted to put a pair of shoes in because it  would be nice. Now you see what's happening, the whole thing is bulging."  </P> <P> To prevent the suitcase from bursting open and spilling its contents back onto  Orion Street, Los Angeles police officers are ticketing "No Right Turn"  scofflaws.  </P> <P> To be sure, the intersection of Sepulveda and Victory is an exceptional case,  traffic engineer Gerald Tom explained as he drove to Pickford Street and  Spaulding Avenue in the Mid-City area to make a critical, though less complex,  decision.  </P> <P> "I just can't justify a stop sign at this intersection. There are no blind  spots and only light traffic," Tom said, reviewing a 40-signature petition from  nearby residents.  </P> <P> The residents wrote that they need a stop sign to "curb excessive speeds which  create lethal conditions." Tom plans to respond that a stop sign is not  warranted.  </P> <P> Tom's next stop was at the beleaguered intersection of Rodeo Road and La  Cienega Boulevard near Baldwin Hills. One nearby resident is fed up with the  time it takes to make a left turn onto La Cienega. He is demanding a green  left-turn arrow.  </P> <P> What the resident doesn't know is that a left-turn arrow would be likely to  anger 43,361 of his fellow commuters. They would be trapped in a "big mess"  because the little five-second green arrow means that every other car has to  wait longer for its turn, Tom said.  </P> <P> "There is no magic solution," Tom said. "An arrow would just jam everything  up."  </P> <P> On a quieter road, along the 12300 block of Laurel Terrace Drive in Studio  City, Myrtle Jones, 82, has detected a traffic dilemma from her bedroom window.  </P> <P> "It's just awful what I see," said Jones, who uses a wheelchair and passes much  of her time reading near her window. "I see (drivers) cross over that median  line every day. They have taken down the lamppost and the hydrant."  </P> <P> Traffic engineer Rolando Buensalida watched almost every motorist speed over  the double yellow line. He measured. He sketched out street stripes. He became  confused.  </P> <P> This was a case for the Geometric Design Team, Buensalida concluded. Traffic  experts on the team use mathematical formulas to determine the configuration of  yellow stripe lines.  </P> <P> At his West San Fernando Valley office, Transportation Engineer Raymond H.  Wellbaum grappled with what promises to be the next project of  Sepulveda-Victory magnitude.  </P> <P> He points to a stack of letters from Tarzana and Encino residents and repeats a  familiar lament: "They are unhappy because traffic is clogging their  neighborhood." Motorists are avoiding congested Sepulveda Pass on the San Diego  Freeway via hillside shortcuts.  </P> <P> As Wellbaum studied a map of Ventura Boulevard, the Valley's notoriously  congested thoroughfare, he began to mumble in traffic engineer-speak: road  capacity, peak-hour restrictions, signal cycles.  </P> <P> A traffic engineer "can only deal with what's physically there and operate the  best he can," Wellbaum said, walking away from the map of troubles.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Wellbaum said, he will attempt "to balance the needs of the  neighbors against the needs of commuters." His determination resembles the  spirit of the cartoon near his desk that reads, "Your traffic engineer is  always ready to get you out of a jam."  </P> <P> Never mind that the picture above the caption depicts a hopelessly gridlocked  intersection.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan  Government and Army today rejected the "ultimatum" given by the  Belizean authorities to 18 Guatemalan families who have been  ordered to withdraw from lands they are occupying.    According to the Belizean Embassy, the peasants, who have  established themselves in the "Chiquibul" national park, have  been given 15 days to clear the area with a deadline that  expires on 10 March.    Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz said Guatemala does  not acknowledge the Belizean Government's authority to give  alleged "ultimatums" to Guatemalan families living in border  areas.    Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez  asserted that the Army will not tolerate any "meddling" on  Belize's part in Guatemala's national sovereignty, much less the  "intimidation" of Guatemalan citizens.    Enriquez added that the Belizean authorities are "being  unreasonable" and that they cannot set deadlines for families to  abandon the area in question because Guatemala still disputes  ownership of that territory.    Belize gained its independence from Great Britain in  September 1981, and the administration of deposed Guatemalan  President Jorge Serrano (1991-1993) recognized it as a state.  However, Guatemala has maintained its claim on the region for  over a century and a half.    The defense minister said the Army is prepared to support  the  Guatemalan families living in the "Chiquibul" national park,  where they have built their homes. Enriquez dismissed the  possibility of clashes with Belizean soldiers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 8 May TASS -- The situation at the  Tajik-Afghan border was relatively calm over the past  twenty-four hours. However, the situation on the whole remains  utterly alarming, and the command of Russian border troops in  Tajikistan do not rule out the possibility of fresh large-scale  provocations at the border within the next few days.  Provocations may be engineered by Tajik opposition militants  who entrenched themselves in Afghanistan's northern provinces,  TASS learned from well-informed military sources on Sunday [8  May].    The same sources reported that Tajik militants continued  massing on Afghan territory in close proximity to the border  with Tajikistan, with an obvious aim to attempt a breakthrough  into the former Soviet Republic.    Similar attempts have already been thwarted at the Shurobad  and Pyandzh border segments on Friday and Saturday by means of  mass artillery and rocket fire, a spokesman for Russian border  troops in Tajikistan said. He stressed that the enemy should  know that such provocations would not go unpunished. Russian  border guards and Tajik national security forces have enough  weapons and ammunition to foil any attempts of aggression from  outside. This was announced unequivocally by the commander of  Russian border troops in Tajikistan, Lieutenant General Anatoliy  Chechulin, at a recent news conference for local and foreign  journalists, the spokesman recalled.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Payout order on friendly society Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance, a friendly society, has been ordered by the High Court to pay compensation to most of its policyholders as a result of investment irregularities. In a statement Mr James Ramsden, the society's chairman, said its actuary had estimated maximum liabilities of Pounds 8.3m. Earlier this year the society anticipated that it might be instructed to pay compensation and, in an unprecedented move by a friendly society, it raised Pounds 10.1m for a compensation fund by imposing a 12 per cent levy on its 67,000 policyholders. Surplus money from the compensation fund would be returned to members' funds, although in a letter to members Mr Ramsden warned that those who left the society in the meantime might not be eligible to receive the surplus. The society went to court for directions on how to deal with a series of fundamental errors which came to light last year. More than half of its policyholders have suffered as a result of a Pounds 4.3m property write-off on unauthorised investments in its Capital Secure fund. This was advertised as investing only in cash deposits and gilts but it was found to have also invested in property. A court decision on whether 7,000 policies that were funded by a lump sum are eligible for tax-exempt status has been postponed pending further talks between the society and the Inland Revenue. Mr Ramsden said that the future shape of the society would have to be decided over the next six months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japan's top economic  planning bureaucrat Friday [15 April] defended the government's  forecast of an economic recovery to 2.4 percent growth this  fiscal year.    Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the Economic Planning  Agency  (EPA), told a Tokyo audience he personally agrees with the  agency's forecast for the year that began this month.    But he said the EPA has not ruled that the economy has hit  bottom, which Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan  governor Yasushi Mieno indicated Thursday may be nearing.    Noting that the official forecast is more bullish than that  of most private economists, Tanaka suggested that they "tend to  underestimate the strength of business recovery" in reversing  from the nation's worst postwar slump.    He also noted that some economists have recently raised  their  forecasts to 1.4 percent growth for the fiscal year. They  previously had predicted about 0.5 percent growth on average.    "The overall economy is still sluggish," he said but added  that signs of "brightness" have recently spread beyond personal  consumption, the biggest single engine for economic growth that  has rebounded since late last year.    Households have nearly finished adjusting to "excessive"  purchasing of consumer durables in the late 1980s boom, and  consumer sentiment will continue to improve in coming months,  Tanaka said.    On another major component for recovery, Tanaka acknowledged  that the agency's forecast of roughly flat fiscal 1994 corporate  capital spending "contrasts very sharply with private  forecasts," which show a third straight year of decline.    Tanaka said there are "signs of bottoming out" in machinery  orders, which anticipate movements in capital spending. That  trend is not clear yet, he said, adding that a fixed investment  turnaround is necessary for economic recovery.    He cited concern over employment, but said the worst fears  for job security are over. Conditions will worsen a bit further  before recovering, he said, but predicted little chance of  another "major adjustment process."    Another area of uncertainty is foreign exchange, with  companies needing the yen to fall to around 117 to the dollar to  "feel comfortable" about their profits, Tanaka said. The dollar  closed Friday in Tokyo at 103.95 yen, up 0.95 yen from the  previous day.    If the yen stays high, boosting prices of Japanese exports  in  other currencies and crimping the yen value of repatriated  profits, "the impact of that on the economy will not be  negligible," Tanaka said.    But he played down concerns that the delays in passing the  fiscal 1994 budget, due to the nation's political turmoil, could  harm the economy.    Citing a backlog of investment to be executed from the  current provisional budget and the third supplementary budget  for fiscal 1993, he said, "There will be a smooth continuation  of the budget investment programs despite the fact that the  budget process is delayed."    Tanaka also predicted no significant inflationary impact  from  much-criticized hikes in public fees.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karim Subhi: "Saving People From Torture"] </F>   [Text] The question was: What are the real motives behind  establishing a medical center to rehabilitate those who escape  from torture? What is its goal?    Dr. Susan Fiyad, one of the center's founders and a  specialist in psychological and nervous disorders, says: "The  idea was formulated during my extended practice in several  government psychiatric hospitals. During that time I treated  many victims of torture whose missteps cost them a mixture of  torture, abuse of dignity, and psychological humiliation, from  which they emerged broken in body and spirit.    "One of the things that affected me strongly was that 80  percent of these people were basically honest citizens. They  were true victims. Therefore, I personally found that they had  lost much of their confidence, either in themselves or in  others. They came to us to receive the treatment they required  for any nervous disorder. As for psychiatric illnesses, which  are feelings of confusion, debility, low self esteem,  depression, and inability to fight or overcome the crisis, these  disorders continue to lurk and strongly impede their internal  equilibrium.    "One example that I was involved with, and that I'll never  forget, occurred when one of those patients who had been  tortured in a police station sensed an air of trust between me  and him, and began to tell me his bitter experiences.    "The young man had been working as a karate instructor. He  resigned from his job in a national organization and opened a  mechanic's shop. One day a dispute broke out between him and a  police officer. The latter induced some of his colleagues to  arrest the young man. He was tortured in a police station with  the most repugnant forms of degradation and attacks on his  dignity, in front of his wife and children. In only four hours,  the life of this young man collapsed completely and his  situation was completely reversed, especially when he was unable  to restore his honor and dignity by any legal means.    "He suffered from depression, dissociation, chronic pains,  sexual debility, feelings of guilt, and loss of confidence in  himself. He said: `I used to lump you together with those who  tortured me, but now I don't.' That case required three years of  medical and psychological treatment until I was able to  rehabilitate him."    Dr. Susan Fiyad continued:    "This is one example out of hundreds of shocking cases of  which we know little. They live among us like time bombs, and we  know nothing about them. They are cases of mental and nervous  disorders, to whom the general practitioner, or even the  experienced psychiatrist, is unable to offer real, effective  help.    "Moreover, they require very special methods of therapy,  over  the short- and long-term, by a specialized medical team that is  qualified to deal with these disorders. This is precisely what  cannot be provided in the government hospital.    "Therefore we as doctors are aware of the dire need for such  a specialized center to rehabilitate victims of violence and  torture without restriction or conditions as to the identity of  the victim, the reason for the attack, or its source."    I asked Dr. 'Abdallah Mansur, one of the center's founders:  Do you have statistics that indicate the number of torture  victims we have?    "No, they are not available, but it is certain that the  victims number in the thousands, because we don't mean just  torture victims in detention camps or police stations, but  rather those who are subjected to family torture and abusers,  including men, women, and children. However, at the present  time, the concentration is on shock cases [al-halat  al-sarikhah], in view of the project's newness. Dealing with  those types of victims began only six months ago. Despite the  newness of the specialty and the center, the number of patients  exceeds 50 cases. Most of these people were subjected to torture  in Egyptian police stations, or are Palestinian or Sudanese  detainees, who were released and who came to use of their own  accord or through Amnesty International."    What are the methods of treating torture victims?    Dr. Susan Fiyad replies: "The primary goal of the treatment  is to rebuild the personality, so that he can again become  responsible for his life. Therefore we keep the patient from  recalling his previous experiences as much as possible. The  therapy is both physical and mental at the same time. Natural  therapy also forms an important part of the physical treatment.  The patient's social situation is taken into account, as our  treatment also includes members of the victim's family to share  in getting through the crisis safely without complications.  Before the therapy starts, the patient is asked in for an  interview during which a general evaluation of the case is made.  We then acquaint him with the elements that will be included in  his treatment. At the same time, together with proceeding with  the evaluation, a three-part therapy program begins, comprised  of psychological and physical treatment and social guidance. We  have prepared a team of doctors to treat each of these phases.    "Meanwhile, the patient is treated with respect and caution.  The therapist must remember patient reactions in certain cases.  The therapist always obtains the complete background as to the  types of torture that the patient has endured."    Is the al-Nadim Torture Victim Rehabilitation Center under  any governmental agency or organization?    Susan Fiyad says: "The center cannot be subordinate to any  governmental or other agency, or its purpose would be lost. The  center was established on the basis of being a private,  civilian, nonprofit company. It was registered on this basis on  28 August 1993, under No. 2668/1993. The project comes within  the scope of welfare services, and a part of the project's  funding comes from Denmark through the Center for Research and  Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (RCT) in Copenhagen. This is a  center that was opened for the same purpose in 1982.    "The al-Nadim Center in Cairo is the first center of its  kind  in the Arab and African region. Therefore, we accept torture  victims through organizations concerned with this matter, either  from inside Egypt or elsewhere, in order to offer these unique  and modern services. We also exchange data through 60 similar  centers around the world that surpass us in experience."    Are there set fees for patient treatment?    "No material compensation is required for services offered,  testing, and rehabilitative therapy. The only stipulation is  having the total agreement of the victim of violence. The center  is obligated to maintain complete secrecy and total respect for  the patient's privacy.    "Moreover, the patient may also be referred to other  specialists if required, for examination and action as  determined for any accompanying physical disorder. This can be  arranged in accordance with the initial visit with the patient.  Accordingly, tests required to begin therapy and rehabilitation  are determined.    "The center also accepts those who come on their own accord  or who are sent by their family or friends, or by various  organizations and agencies that deal with violence victims. The  center also assists and supports tactical and practical efforts  expended by local and international organizations with the aim  of stopping violent practices and torture. The center offers  short- and long-term psychological rehabilitative therapy to  those who have been subjected to any form of physical or mental  violence.    "Through the therapy of those who were tortured, we are told  the facts of torture, beginning with the oppression of police  stations to the torture in Sudan and detention in Israel. Let us  begin with a case from the center and reports of the Public  Prosecutor's Office."     -  Mirfat 'Abd-al-Hamid, airline stewardess. She was tortured  in the Nasr City precinct by the chief of secret police and two  of his aides in order to force her to confess to theft, despite  the fact that the Public Prosecutor's Office acquitted her. This  led to her attempting suicide by jumping out of the window of  the secret police's room, especially after being threatened with  being stripped of her clothes. She suffered a concussion, and  broken teeth and collarbone.    -  Zakariyya al-Shami, professor in the Suez Canal University.  He  was punched and beaten in the face. He was transported in the  trunk of a police car to the Ismailia second precinct, where he  received additional abuse. The reason for this was that he  scraped a police officer's car.    -  Salim Ibrahim Salim, an accountant in a well-known bank. He  says: "I was subjected to savage torture by secret policemen,  though I had committed no offense. They only wanted to do a  favor for a friend of theirs who works for the same bank where I  work. They lured me to the Cairo security directorate on the  pretext of ending the dispute between me and their friend. From  there they took me to the Nasr City precinct and severely  tortured me. They hung me by my arms until they nearly snapped.  Their hands also touched sensitive places of my body. There are  medical reports regarding my case in the International Peace  Hospital. Their torture resulted in my permanent disability. The  Public Prosecutor's Office investigated but did not get  anywhere. The dossier is now in the prosecutor general's office."    -  We shall leave these files and move on to Palestine. One  Palestinian in the treatment center relates his story: "During  12 full years of detention, I was in most Zionist prisons and  detention camps. Naturally, I witnessed all shades of torture,  to such an extent that over the last five years I have had no  awareness of torture both physical and psychological, as if I  were a dead being or a living dead man. I am receiving treatment  from a team of doctors, including specialists in endemic  diseases, surgery, and physical therapy, in view of the fact  that 90 percent of my limbs are affected by fibrillation in the  joints and rheumatism, in addition to psychological treatment."    -  As soon as Mrs. Jamilah, one of the victims of torture in the  occupied Arab territories, was released and allowed to leave,  she was sent to one of the Cairo hospitals to obtain intensive  physical and psychological treatment, in view of her ill health.  She continued under medical supervision for more than a year  until her situation improved. However, what does she say about  her personal experiences in Zionist prison camps?     Jamilah says: "My detention was terrible and frightening.  How  could I forget or explain it? There are no words for what  did--and still does--go on in those slaughterhouses that they  call the abominable Zionist prison camps. Everything in them is  barbarous, brutal, and indescribable. The torturers are inhuman,  as if they have no religion or faith. I could describe them as  legions of bloodsuckers, killers, rapists, sadists, and deviates  who came from the Dark Ages. It began when I was arrested by an  official of the Civil Administration in Gaza. I was held in a  tent on the beach, Shaykh 'Ajlan Street, in the army camp, for  three hours. They tied my hands, feet, and head, and I received  more than 300 blows and kicks from their hands and feet on every  part of my body, thereby heedlessly violating my dignity and  honor. Later, I was taken to 'Asqalan Prison.    "In the cell with me were two criminal prisoners. They  crushed seeds and inhaled them up their nose. I was shocked that  they asked me for sex; they were dressed only in their  underwear. They were Jewesses of various nationality, who work  as prostitutes. They were in prison because of criminal cases.  The authorities put us with them to humiliate and debase us.    "I resisted and hit one of them in her face several times. I  was hit on the head from behind. Because of this, I became  unconscious. When I came to, I found that they had completely  stripped me of my clothes.    "I was unable to tell how long I had been in this condition.  My body was broken. After four months of brutalization and  torture of various kinds in the prison camp, violating my honor  in barbaric ways, I was left broken and in pain. I was in  agonizing pain, because of a lack of calcium, nutrition, and  sustenance. My sound teeth were extracted without drugs. I was  restrained in shackles. Three teeth fell out without anyone's  assistance. I felt extreme pain in my right foot and hand, and  pain in my head that is indescribable. I also suffer from lack  of control in the joints of my foot. I suffered a psychological  crisis and a nervous breakdown. As soon as I was released, after  a year, they allowed me to leave, and I came to Cairo for  physical and mental treatment."    It is difficult for one Sudanese journalist to remember  escaping from the grasp of the Islamic Front. She was subjected  to several medical examinations as a result of her enuresis,  bowel problems, and nightmares that haunt her as long as her  eyes are closed. "After two years in Sudanese prison camps that  we called ghost houses, I was able to flee and come to Cairo.    "For four months my eyes were bandaged, and I was stripped  of  my underclothes. My skin was .......... They dropped me down  into a deep well, filled with foul odors, almost like corpses,  either animals or human. They were not content with just  torturing me physically, but rather they made me watch others  being tortured to death.    "They sowed seeds of fear, terror, and anxiety in my soul. I  had not imagined such barbaric, merciless torture. I had never  imagined watching the torture of others, even more painful than  what I was subjected to. I wanted to die. They were intent on  stopping me from fainting so that the torture could continue.    "I asked myself: What did I do? What are the real reasons  for  this torture. Why didn't they kill me at once? I asked myself  that, until the day came when I was able to escape by a miracle.    "I responded to the treatment after more than five months in  Cairo."</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TEACHERS TAKE EXTRA DUTIES'  </P> <P> This morning, on one of my so-called vacation days, I went to my school to fill  out a stolen property report. My room had been broken into, again, and $1,100  worth of my own personal property was taken in addition to $2,200 worth of  school property.  </P> <P> In the 15 years that I have taught at Kennedy High School my room has been  broken into and/or vandalized five times, twice in the last two months. Last  year, while I stayed after school to help some students, my car was stolen by a  student. In past years I have suffered a fractured rib after having been  knocked down by an automobile in the student parking lot, and in a separate  incident I was bitten by a student. Although I am quite aware that there is a  large segment of our society that receives a lower annual salary than that of a  teacher, for some reason, at this particular moment, my present teacher's  salary just doesn't look all that great.  </P> <P> How many of your readers, other than policemen, can document job experiences  such as my own? My college education has done little to prepare me for the  realities of teaching (drug and alcohol abuse, pregnancy, broken homes, child  abuse, parents who don't care) that I have to deal with on a regular basis.  </P> <P> I would hope that all of this would not lead you to believe that all teachers  have the same job experiences as myself. Most teachers are able to teach their  whole careers without any outside problems, yet, I know for a fact that many  teachers have had to endure hardships far greater than my own.  </P> <P> CHUCK HALL  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

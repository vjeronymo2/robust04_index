			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Legal challenge to county council shake-up attacked District councils yesterday attacked the move by four county councils to seek judicial review of the Local Government Commission's plans to restructure them as a 'waste of time and taxpayers' money'. The Labour-led Association of District Councils said that the counties were 'wasting public money on a lost cause'. Ms Margaret Singh, who chairs the association, said: 'The commission's task is difficult enough without the process being thrown into jeopardy by county councils' delaying tactics, especially as they are squandering money which could be put to better use.' Cleveland and Somerset, which would both be abolished under the proposals, and Derbyshire, which would lose control of the city of Derby and north-east Derbyshire, have all announced plans to challenge the commission's plans in court. All three claim that the commission has not carried out its work correctly. Lancashire, for which proposals have not yet been announced, is also seeking a judicial review over the way the commission has interpreted its remit following a change in its official guidance from ministers in September. In Cleveland, where the county has estimated the cost of legal action at about Pounds 150,000, Mr Bob Gibson, leader of Stockton borough council, said he was satisfied that the commission's work had been carried out fairly. He described the legal move as a 'last desperate attempt at self-preservation'. Letters, Page 10</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: United as in Mexican Sir, As a writer for the Times of Finance in the United British Kingdom, Observer ('Dos mio', December 6,) should know that the official name of Mexico, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, is translated correctly as United Mexican States, not United States of Mexico. So, Mexicans have little reason to worry about confusion with the colossus to the north, except among English reporters who have trouble distinguishing adjectives from nouns. If you are trying to fathom Mexican feeling about the US, why don't you quote Porfirio Dias instead of the wimps who worry about what's in a name?

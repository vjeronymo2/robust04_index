What major reform movements are there  in the personnel system of enterprises and public undertakings?  When will the reform plan of the new wage system be put into  effect? How will reform of the social insurance system for  government organizations and public undertakings get started?  Can the flow of human resources be "released, but in good  order, and be full of vigor, but not chaotic"? How will  government personnel management move toward legalization?....    At the meeting of personnel department and bureau directors  held before the end of last year, Personnel Minister Song Defu  gave a LIAOWANG staff reporter a special interview on the above  issues of social concern.    Song Defu unfolded his talk on building a personnel  management system complementary to the system of a socialist  market economy; that is, a classified management personnel  system, a scientific and rational wage distribution system, a  multilevel social insurance system and macroeconomic personnel  management system, a human resources market system, and a  personnel rules and regulation system, which are new thoughts on  reform of state personnel work.  <H3>  I. 1994: To Create A Good Beginning for Carrying Out the  State Public Service System </H3>   Song Defu spoke about carrying out -- from making  experiments  to gradually spreading out -- the state public service system  against the particular background of government organizational  reform and personnel reduction. He did not conceal that  corresponding complementary regulations were still lacking, and  that the rate of progress varied. Moreover, the efforts made on  publicity were inadequate, which led to insufficient social  understanding. For example, some people equated carrying out  the public service system with wage reform.    To ensure bringing the public service system onto track and  putting it into operation, it is necessary to carry forward in  an overall manner and stress the main points in implementation  in 1994. Song Defu spoke about putting forward the following  different requirements according to the deployment by the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council:    On the basis of organizational reform, various departments  of  the State Council and most of the provincial level departments  and the municipal departments whose plans are listed separately,  have initially built up the state public service system, and  have completed the transition from existing personnel to public  servants. Moreover, some county and city governments have  acquired experimental experiences in building the public service  system.    Organizations that have not carried out organizational  reform, except positions set-up and nonleading posts arrangement  and other work, are required to implement the "Provisions  Regarding the State Public Servants" by merging with the  practical situation of personnel work, so as to lay a good  foundation for building the public service system.    Whether or not organizational reform has been carried out, a  mechanism of openness, equality, and encouragement of  competition should be built up gradually, and open examination  and strict check- ups should be carried out to select the best  for employing nonleading personnel below the position of section  chief.    The public service system being of immediate concern to the  broad masses of government personnel, Song Defu emphasized: "It  is necessary to do good work and take organization and  implementation seriously. How can we determine in advance the  scope of implementation? The implementation of the new wage  system appears to be most pressing. This involves whether an  organization is following the wage system of government  organizations or that of public undertakings. It is necessary  to take the functions of an organization as the basis, and  uphold separating the functions of government and enterprises,  and separating those of government and public undertakings. Due  to reasons of set-up and establishment, if it is difficult to  determine for the time being the nature of an organization, it  may be temporarily excluded from the scope of carrying out the  public service system."    Song Defu raised the point that in organizational reform,  personnel diversion should be combined with restructuring  government personnel, and that a rational proportion of various  levels of personnel should be maintained. If those diverted are  ordinary working staff or young personnel, and those who should  stay are leading members or elderly, then it would be very  difficult for the public service structure to be rational.    The job of improving the rules and regulations of the state  public service system is being done intensely. Song Defu  declared: "We will strive to promulgate as soon as possible  `Methods for Implementation of the Classification of Posts for  State Public Servants', `Temporary Regulations on the Employment  of State Public Servants', `Temporary Regulations on the  Assessment of State Public Servants', and grasp firmly the work  of investigation and study and drafting of temporary regulations  for awards, training, promotion and demolition, appointment and  dismissal, and retirement."  <H3>  II. Public Undertakings: "Separation, Classification,  Decentralization of Power, and Reinvigoration" Enterprises:  Gradually Build Up the Personnel System of Modern Enterprises </H3>   Speaking about the reform of the personnel system of public  undertakings, which are varied and complicated, Song Defu  clearly pointed out: "Public undertakings, as relatively  independent entities with corporate qualifications, require  corresponding personnel decisionmaking power. At present, major  reform moves of the personnel system of public undertakings  include:"    "Further reform the system of appointment and selection,  adopt multiple forms for selecting and appointing administrative  leading personnel of public undertakings, and experiments can be  made in organizations with conditions for selecting leading  members by public bidding."    "The clerk system will be gradually carried out for  managerial staff and a specialized technological post  appointment system will be gradually carried out for specialized  technological personnel."    To reduce the state's financial burdens, it is necessary to  reduce the number of public undertakings and people that eat  "the emperor's grain." For public undertakings that get  appropriations, it is necessary to introduce the mechanism of  competition, encouragement, and risks, and to transition to  revenue and expenditure by themselves. For public undertakings  that are fully responsible for expenses by themselves, it is  necessary to encourage them to carry out enterprise management,  and make experiments on linking work with efficiency.    For personnel of public undertakings that get full  appropriations, such as those engaged in basic theoretical  research, high-tech research, and secondary and primary schools,  experiments should be made to be responsible for gross wages  until the task is completed; that is, for over-strength, there  will be no increase in gross wages, and for vacancies, there  will be no decrease, so as to make the contingent capable and  highly efficient. It is necessary to create an environment  which enables outstanding talents to show themselves, and to  train and bring up a contingent of academic and technological  leaders that meet the needs of China's modernization program and  are capable of entering the world's scientific and technological  forward position.    The pace of reform of the enterprise personnel system is  being quickened to meet the requirements for building the system  of modern enterprises. Song Defu spoke about carrying out the  post appointment system for enterprises' managerial staff and  specialized technological personnel. Enterprises enjoy the  power of personnel management according to law, specialized  technological personnel and managerial staff enjoy the right to  choose their occupations according to law, and the rights and  obligations relations of both parties are established by  employment contract. Government personnel departments should  protect the legitimate rights and interests of both parties.    Moreover, it is also necessary to study how to abolish  gradually the bounds between cadres and workers within  enterprises, between cadres of different ownership, and between  different types (fixed, employed) of cadres, so as to build up a  personnel mechanism that enables cadres to be able to work at  higher as well as lower levels and to enter and leave government  organizations, and a mechanism that facilitates two-way  selection and rational flow, and to train and bring up a  contingent of high-quality and occupational entrepreneurs.    Song Defu indicated that we should lose no time in solving  the problem of separating the state-owned enterprise grades from  administrative grades according to the principle of separating  the functions of government and enterprises. In the future, no  administrative grades will be fixed for newly built enterprises  without exception, and the arrangement of their management  personnel will be rationally determined according to the  situation of the enterprises and their personnel conditions.  Enterprises that originally had administrative grades should be  separated from administrative grades, and no longer apply  mechanically the administrative grades of the party and  government organizations. Grades and treatments for various  types of enterprise personnel should no longer be fixed in the  light of the administrative grades of the party and government  organizations. We are now making the best use of time to work  out relevant methods for implementation and complementary  management methods on listening to reports, reading documents,  and taking part in meetings.    Song Defu recommended: "To coordinate with the building of a  modern enterprises system, it is necessary to study working out  the 'Provisions Regarding the Personnel Management of  State-Owned Enterprises' and 'Temporary Methods for the  Personnel Management of Joint Stock System Enterprises'."  <H3>  III. The New Wage System: Onto the Track and in Normal  Operation As Soon As Possible </H3>   After the reform plans and the three implementation methods  of the new wage system of state organs and public undertakings  have been transmitted to the lower levels, various localities  and departments are paying close attention to working out  specific suggestions for implementation. Song Defu said: "To  my knowledge, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council attach great importance to and are much  concerned about the current wage reform. In the present wage  system reform, the state has made great efforts for wage  increases under difficult financial situations. It has brought  the new wage system onto track and put it into operation by  taking into consideration the interest relations of various  aspects as best she can, and made gradual improvements. The  starting point of the current wage system reform is to build up  a corresponding wage system and a normal wage increase mechanism  according to the respective characteristics of government  organizations and public undertakings. The wages of public  servants are determined and readjusted by the state according to  the economic growth situation and referring to the average wage  level of enterprises, and a normal mechanism for promotion and  wages increase will be built up on that basis. Different  management methods, wage system, and methods of distribution  will be carried out for public undertakings according to the  difference in the source of appropriations and the  characteristics of trades.    How do we bring the wage system onto track and put it into  operation? Song Defu reiterated that personnel departments at  various levels should, according to the unified deployment by  the central authorities, "Be active and safe, be strict and  tight, and control total amounts." No locality or department  will go their own way and muddle things up. Various localities  and departments should strengthen ideological, political work,  and do good turns meticulously to help the broad masses of the  personnel of government organizations and public undertakings  understand that the current wages reform is mainly to build up a  new wage system, and to bring it onto track and put it into  operation, so as to lay a good foundation for the future. We  should understand that the state is very much concerned about  the life of the staff and workers under difficult financial  situation, and it is no easy job to take out so much money. We  should understand that the problems accumulated in wage  distribution are many, that it is impossible to have all of them  overcome by the present one reform, and that it requires a  process for gradual improvement.  <H3>  IV. Social Insurance System of Government Organizations and  Public Undertakings: The Easy Ones Come First and the Difficult  Ones Later, Getting in Position Gradually </H3>   Speaking about the present delay in reform of the social  insurance system of government organizations and public  undertakings, Song Defu declared: "The job of reform is very  difficult. Some localities and departments have not started  yet, and those places that have built up the insurance system  are confronted with many difficulties. The progress of reform  of the social insurance system of government organizations and  public undertakings is slow, and has become the "bottleneck"  constraining reform of the personnel system."    In carrying out the old-age and unemployment insurance  system  by overall social planning, Song Defu said: "Adhering to the  principle of easy ones first and difficult ones later, first  build up the old- age and unemployment insurance system for  contract-based workers of government organizations and public  undertakings, and build up the old-age funds overall planning  system. As for public undertakings, first start with those that  are responsible for revenue and expenditure by themselves, and  on the basis that the state continues to bear the expenses for  personnel who have retired, explore the methods under which  individuals are required to pay a part of the old-age pension to  build up a part of the funds accumulation. It is necessary to  study jointly with the financial departments about building a  social insurance system of government organizations, especially  that of state public servants." He stressed that the general  principle for the raising and using of funds should be: "The  rights, obligations, and compulsion are combined, and the state,  organizations, and individuals share burdens. The  administrative management of social insurance should be  separated from the funds operation of social insurance."    The current reform of the social insurance system of  government organizations and public undertakings adopts the  policy of "making experiments actively, easy ones come first and  difficult ones later, and get in position gradually." Song Defu  pointed out clearly: "On the basis of the general principle of  reform, it is allowed to take different methods for experiments,  and a certain difference is allowed among various localities. A  number of different types of organizations should be selected  for experiments in a planned way. In addition, make the best use  of time to study and work out regulations on old-age insurance.  <H3>  V. The Human Resources Market: Rational Flow, Rational  Disposition, and Rational Use of Various Types of Personnel Are  Allowed As Much As Possible </H3>   Against the background of increases in the demand for human  resources, the contradiction between shortage and idle human  resources has become increasingly acute. Talking about the  thoughts on building and improving the human resources market  system, Song Defu put forward "five changes": Change from human  resources lying idle and shortages to market flow, making up the  other's deficiency from one's own surplus, and rational  disposition; change from organization and department ownership  of human resources to social ownership, rational flow, and  helping supply each other's needs; change from one-way selection  to two-way selection of human resources flow; change from "fair  market" to "location market" of human resources flow; change  from the human resources disposition model of "overall  assignment and disposition" to the model of bringing into play  the basic role of human resources market in human resources  disposition under the state macroeconomic management.    Song Defu said that we should use human resources flow in  handling circulation. To provide an opportunity for two-way  selection we should minimize intermediate links as best we can.  Pay close attention to working out and improving relevant  policies and rules and regulations on the human resources  market, make the best use of time in 1994 to transmit to lower  levels the "Opinions on Speeding Up the Training and Development  of Human Resources Market," and promulgate the "Temporary  Regulations on Arbitration of Disputes Arising From Human  Resources Flow." Protect the legitimate rights and interests of  the employers' organizations and individuals so as to enable the  human resources market to operate in an orderly manner within  the scope of law. On the basis of human resources flow under  existing personnel departments, gradually build up a regular  human resources market and a nationwide human resources supply  and demand information network to provide more timely, speedy,  and richer information for organizations to select personnel and  for individuals to choose their occupations.    In policy guidance of human resources flow, Song Defu  emphasized guidance and preferential measures toward the needs  of the state's key projects and outlying and difficult districts  where conditions are hard. It is necessary to take feasible  measures to encourage human resources to stay in outlying and  difficult districts, and the state should render appropriate  support and protection in policy. It is necessary to explore  through concerted efforts a new way of encouraging human  resources to stay in outlying and difficult districts and of  importing them. And it is also necessary to strengthen  management and supervision over the human resources market.    Song Defu finally stressed: "All of the five major links for  building the basic framework of the system of a socialist market  economy put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Congress are directly related to personnel work. For example,  to build up a modern enterprises system, we are held responsible  for the reform of the enterprise personnel system. To build up  a unified and open market system, we are held responsible for  training, building, and improving the human resources market.  In transforming government functions, we have to study  organizational reform jointly with departments concerned, and  have the task of transforming functions. In wage distribution,  we undertake the task of reforming the wage system of government  organizations and public undertakings. To build up a social  insurance system, we are held responsible for the job of  building up a social insurance system of government  organizations and public undertakings. Personnel departments at  various levels should enhance their sense of responsibility and  continue studying the new situation with thoughts on reform, and  solving new problems by the methods of reform.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> N.Y. Post Buyouts: Noted sports columnist Peter Vecsey and 78 others will leave  the newspaper under a buyout plan that was part of a $19-million union  concession package designed to keep the paper alive.  </P> <P> Vecsey will write a column for USA Today. The Newspaper Guild resignations,  which were voluntary, mean the Post will lose close to 200 of its 960 workers.  Agreements last week called for 100 forced resignations from the 263-member  drivers union and five from the Post's 17 paper handlers. The Post said about  half the Guild resignations were from the newsroom, which translates to about a  third of the news staff.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Call for longer radio licences The Radio Authority has told the government it would like to see longer licences for commercial radio companies to give the industry greater stability. The body, which regulates commercial radio, believes that the present eight-year licences are too short to give an adequate return on investment. It also wants the government to look at anomalies in the way television and radio is treated in the 1990 Broadcasting Act. After six years ITV companies can apply to negotiate a licence extension which, if accepted, can then run for a further 14 years. National radio licences such as that held by Classic FM are simple one-off licences that have to be readvertised.</p>

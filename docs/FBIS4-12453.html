			<p>BFN     [Text] Tyre, April 6 (AFP)--Nine people were wounded, most  of them civilians, in rocket and artillery attacks on Israel's  "security zone" in south Lebanon on Wednesday [6 April],  security officials and an Israeli-backed militia said.    The radio of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia [Kafr  Killa  Voice of the South] said rockets crashed onto the villages of  Dibil and 'Ayn Ibil, on the border with Israel, wounding seven  civilians and setting fire to several houses.    Earlier, artillery battles between a radical Palestinian  faction and the Israeli army left a militiaman and an  anti-Israeli fighter wounded, security officials said.    The militiaman was wounded when fighters of the Popular  Front  for the Liberation of Palestine fired at an SLA position in Bayt  Lif, in the western sector of the security zone, they said.    The post was attacked by two Sagar shells, six anti-tank  rockets and automatic weapons fire.    The Israeli army retaliated, firing back 20 mortar shells  and  10 anti-tank shells, wounding one of the attackers who was  evacuated from the area, they added.    Three hours later six Katyusha rockets hit an SLA position  in  Marwahin, 300 metres (330 yards) from the border between Israel  and Lebanon, sources in the occupied border strip said.    The Israeli army retaliated by raining 30 mortar and tank  shells on five villages just outside the zone known to be  strongholds of Iranian-backed Hizballah fighters, police said.    There were no further reports of civilian casualties.</p>

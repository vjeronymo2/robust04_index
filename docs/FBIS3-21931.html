The U.S. Government has  accused Ramirez of conspiracy to introduce drugs into that  country.    "Our client is definitely innocent. He was manipulated by  U.S. undercover agents, and that will be corroborated in due  time by Ivan Fisher, the attorney who is handling the case in  the United States," Ramos has explained.    After stating Legislator Ramirez must not be stripped of his  parliamentary immunity, Ramos added there is absolutely no  documented evidence his client has committed an offense in our  country.    When questioned on the fact Ramirez is being investigated  both in the United States and in our country, Ramos said  Panamanian law mandates when it is presumed or feared an offense  has been committed in the country, the Attorney General's Office  must begin an investigation.    "Regarding this case in particular, in which a personality  of  the significance of Anel Ramirez is involved, it is first  necessary, however, for the Attorney General's Office to provide  sufficient evidence to initiate a case. And in this process, as  will be known later, there is really no merit. There is not  enough juridical grounds to begin a case, an investigation.  They have not even mentioned witnesses. Moreover, in this  process Anel Ramirez is the only detainee," Ramos has said.    After explaining her client, Anel Ramirez, did not deliver  drugs or money, Ramos said undercover agents did everything.  She stressed Legislator Ramirez' participation has not even  been determined.    Ramos has said there are not even alleged coconspirators, as  judges in the United States have determined. They have not been  arrested, nor has their situation been established.</p>

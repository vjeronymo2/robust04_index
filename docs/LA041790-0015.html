EARNINGS: LOSS OF $3.7-MILLION REPORTED FOR 1989 BY BRISTOL RESEARCH  </P> <P> Bristol Research Corp., a Costa Mesa-based computer products company, reported  a loss of $3.7 million for 1989, contrasted with a loss of about $500,000 in  1988. Sales dropped to $3 million from $7.4 million.  </P> <P> The company said the declines resulted from substantial price erosion on the  company's commercial IBM AT-compatible products, product returns caused by  defective components supplied by a third party, and the write-off of obsolete  inventory.  </P></p>

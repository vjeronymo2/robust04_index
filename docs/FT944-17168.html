			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not very synchronised Sir, I would like to congratulate Ian Davidson on his perceptive article, 'Vichy casts a shadow' (September 28), which traces France's inability to accept shared responsibility for its recent past, as mirrored in a recently published biography of Francois Mitterrand. As a Reuters correspondent in Paris from 1952-57, I witnessed similar psychological inability to accept events which were painful to the French psyche. For example, the fall of Dien Bien Phu in Indochina, and the surrender of the French army, were explained away by my French friends as the fault of the German members of the French Foreign Legion who were fighting there at the time. The French people are intensely individualistic, a quality which manifested itself in the political arena in the many different parties of the Fourth Republic in the 1950s, and which reveals itself today in the constant dissensions between party ranks. I suggest this passionate individualism makes it difficult for them to accept a shared responsibility for the past. Sanche de Gramont, in his book The French, Portrait of a People says: 'France is not a synchronised country. It is like an ungaited horse, each of whose legs is proceeding at a different cadence.' I quote this with affection for the days I spent in the country, and the friends I made there. David R Richards, 480 West Ash Street, Zionsvile, Indiana 46077, US</p>

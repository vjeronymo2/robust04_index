			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker sector upset SUGGESTIONS that Lloyd's brokers and underwriting agencies may be asked to contribute to Lloyd's Central Fund upset shares in the insurance broking sector. Lloyd's Central Fund was established to pay for claims in the event of underwriting syndicates being unable to meet their commitments. There were also hints that directors of some of the broking firms may have been selling blocks of shares in the sector. The rumours coincided with an announcement yesterday that Mr JP Marland, a director of Lloyd Thompson, the wholesale insurance and reinsurance broker, recently sold a block of 200,000 shares in Lloyd Thompson, reducing his stake to 3.63 per cent. Insurance broking analysts were sceptical of stories that the broking and underwriting firms may have to put up as much as Pounds 200m, with a figure of nearer Pounds 50m, split equally between the two groups, said to be more likely. 'It would mean that the big insurance brokers, such as Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, would need to put up between Pounds 1m to Pounds 5m, spread over three years, not really a major hit,' said one broking specialist. The sector was additionally unsettled by the recent weakness of the dollar. Lowndes Lambert, scheduled to report preliminary figures on June 30, was given a severe mauling, albeit in thin trading, and closed 19 lower at 263p, while Sedgwick dipped 7 to 193p and Willis lost 8 to 224p. Lloyd Thompson eased 5 to 210p, and Sturge, the underwriting agent, declined 4 to 91p. Glaxo tumbles Indications of increased competition for one of its prominent products from a rival drug already marketed for the past 50 years left Glaxo down 22 at 689p, its lowest level since last October. The pharmaceuticals arm of Sandoz said a study had concluded that an injection of its DHE-45 relieved headache pain in nearly half of migraine patients within 30 minutes, and in most patients within an hour. The drug has always been used in Europe but not in the US. However, the recent study, which will be released next week, involved 38 US clinics. The study is believed to show that the Sandoz drug has many similarities with Glaxo's potentially massive earner, Imigran, and because it is off patent it would be significantly cheaper. Carlton flourish Media group Carlton Communications entered the FT-SE Index of the 100 most highly valued companies with a flourish yesterday. It closed 5 up at 632p on above-average turnover of 3.7m. The shares reached the 650p level after the general election and have since held up well against a sliding market. Yesterday's closing price translates into a shareholder valuation for the company of Pounds 1.248bn, whereas Pounds 1bn tends to be the minimum capitalisation for Footsie qualification. Lasmo weakens Oil group Lasmo suffered from a bearish note by Strauss Turnbull. The stock was also undermined by stories circulating in the market that the proposed international public offer of shares in the US downstream interests it acquired with its takeover of Ultramar would be priced much lower than had been expected, in light of the failed GPA flotation. Lasmo lost 6 1/2 to 187p. Business services group Hays held up relatively well against the market after the company carried out a successful placing. The stock shed a modest 3 to 187p after Hays placed around 19m shares at 182p, through Schroder, and SG Warburg-owned broker Rowe and Pitman, with 50 institutions to raise Pounds 34.3m. The company is to use the funds to buy Groupe FRIL, a French specialist distribution business. Reuters Holdings failed to hold up in spite of news that it is this week extending its foreign exchange trade matching system, Dealing 2000-2, to banks in Germany and Switzerland. The shares were up 8 against the market on small turnover but crumbled in late trading to close 4 off on balance at 1105p. Dealers reacted to a press report on Wellcome, which said that the size of its imminent share flotation would be at the lower end of expectations. The stock fell 12 to 913p. Hints that the remnants of a large line of stock placed in the market last week was still overhanging trading kept British Gas under pressure and the shares closed 5 1/2 off at 243 1/2 p. BP dipped 6 to 245p ahead of expected news of substantial job cuts at its US operations. The proposed sale by Shell Oil of its coal assets, valued at around Dollars 1bn, failed to sustain Shell Transport shares, which closed 9 down at 495p. Splitting of the Electricity Package and reinvestment into some of the individual electricity stocks left the Package down 35 at Pounds 3100. Troubled jewellery chain Ratners remained active, on turnover of 3.1m, as the share price lost another penny to 9p. Storehouse and Sears were the subject of board changes, with the former easing 2 to 145p and Sears losing 3 to 88p. The recent departure of its finance director and last week's profits warning continued to pose problems for Amber Day, the shares dropping 8 to 48p. Switching between the big supermarket chains benefited Tesco, up a penny at 283p in an active market of 3.1m shares, as J. Sainsbury lost 6 to 462p on turnover of 2.4m. The brewing and drinks sector was depressed by fears that economic recovery had been put off again after some ambiguous UK trade figures. Bass slipped 11 to 602p, Whitbread 'A' 12 to 422p and Guinness 13 to 567p. A bright exception was Mansfield Brewery, up 15 at 710p, but traders pointed out that demand from one institution was tending to move an illiquid stock. Last week's institutional visit to Vosper Thornycroft continued to benefit the shares, which added 3 at 348p. 'A dead cat bounce' is how one market watcher described a rise in British Aerospace. The shares firmed 3 to 270p in light trade of 1.8m. Glynwed International fell 9 to 229p after a leading agency broker advised caution on the stock due to the continued recession. British Steel shed a penny to 70p as Smith New Court reiterated its sell recommendation. Trafalgar House weakened 7 to 107p after US investment house Lehman Brothers weighed in with a profits downgrading. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (18).

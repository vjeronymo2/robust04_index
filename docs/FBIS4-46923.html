			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with psychiatrist-narcologist L.V. Pushkareva by </F> Inessa Lasovskaya in Novosibirsk, under the rubric "Stay  Healthy!"; date not given: "Alas, Drug Addicts Learn Only From  Their Own Experience"]    [Text] The number of children and teenagers  registered by drug rehabilitation clinics because of a weakness  for alcohol, drugs, and toxic substances has increased by a  factor of more than two in our city.    The narcologists and the mayoralty committee for youth  affairs believe inviting both children and parents to a meeting  at the imeni October Revolution House of Culture at 1500 on 8  June to be one of the measures to hamper the spread of this  teenage "epidemic." They planned to show a very interesting film  which clarifies many points, and to comment on what the film  narrates and what happens to those who are brought up on the  street. Physician-narcologists will present answers that are  easy for children to understand to all the complex questions  that are asked from the floor.    As we announce this event and deeply appreciate the anxiety  of the public, we offer for your attention an interview with  psychiatrist-narcologist Larisa Vladimirovna Pushkareva, chief  of the adolescent ward of the municipal city drug rehabilitation  clinic.    [Lasovskaya] Larisa Vladimirovna, how does it still happen  that adults living side by side with a teenager do not notice  that they have a real drug addict in the family?    [Pushkareva] This happens when attention is paid to the  children only in a pro forma manner: They are fed and clothed.  Upbringing means work and responsibility. One cannot shift this  direct duty to others. Depraved inclinations develop out of a  lack of occupation; many cling to "their own" groups and packs  just because they have nothing to do. They go to "their own"  kind because of a lack of understanding from adults. Their  parents are seldom their friends and advisers; more frequently  they act as prosecutors. Meanwhile, adolescents have their own  problems. A girl fell in love, and the boy dumped her. This is a  tragedy for her. A girlfriend makes her an offer: "Here, take  this, you will feel better." Perhaps this girl, having gotten  used to the regular use of the "tranquilizer," will pity some  other person. You and I may not know how drugs are distributed,  but they know!    [Lasovskaya] One gets the impression that modern-day  children  have no notion of the danger in which they are putting their  lives. Among those whom you begin to treat, is there not a  single person who has discussed this topic with adults?    [Pushkareva] Why not? About 30 percent have been forced to  listen to admonitions from their mothers and fathers. However,  like fools, they learn from their own experience, although these  children are far from stupid, rather the other way around.    [Lasovskaya] It is clear as far as they are concerned, but  what about the parents? Why do they fail to see deviations in  the behavior of their children? Or are the signs of drug  addiction imperceptible?    [Pushkareva] It is precisely the point that they leap out at  you. The toxic substance addict altogether reeks of glue from  three kilometers away. Both drug addicts and nascent alcoholics  cannot conceal mounting aggression, nor do they want to conceal  it. Love in children alternates with hate. How is this normal?  And what about a puffy face? What about memory loss? What about  strange burns and skin lesions? They deliberately slit their  skin; for them, this is a technique for the infusion of  intoxicating preparations. They have bruises along their veins,  they behave as if they were drunk, but there is no smell. Is  this easy to overlook? However, many parents display unsoundness  even on learning of the disease. We are the ones trying to  convince them: It is not coming to us that is shameful, but  failing to have your child treated. Or else they bring their  children and sort of dump them on us: "Do what you want. Treat  them any way you know how, but we cannot do anything any more."    [Lasovskaya] In general, you are not discussing your work in  the mass media in vain. By all signs, your work has picked up in  response to the growth of adolescent drug addiction and the  crime it entails. We have an opportunity to give a telephone  number which people may call for your advice.    [Pushkareva] The telephone number is 23-48-14. Ask for me,  Larisa Vladimirovna. At the reception office of the clinic they  will immediately understand what will be discussed. Recently we  separated from the city adolescent narcological complex which  had an inpatient facility and a chain of outpatient facilities.    [Lasovskaya] Support from the public is needed for the  efforts of adolescent narcologists to rescue perishing children.  Do you encounter indifference most often nonetheless?    [Pushkareva] It is easier for me to answer by giving  favorable examples. We have invited parents, teachers,  guardians, adolescents, and members of commissions for minors'  affairs for a meeting on 8 June at a large auditorium (holding  500 people). So, Kalininskiy Rayon has even made arrangements  for its own bus to bring in all those who wish to come, and this  is characteristic of them! Central Rayon accommodates us in all  our endeavors; it is easy to work with any representative of the  rayon administration there. I hope that such examples will be  much more numerous.  <H5>  *** </H5>   Like all adolescent narcologists of the city, Larisa  Vladimirovna Pushkareva handles three times the regular  workload, and not just because this is virtually a new specialty  for physicians which has been occasioned by our new, utterly  debauched times. When there was strict morality there were  modest children and plain pediatricians. Then the immoral video  conditioning for depraved inclinations appeared, and the pattern  of assistance to children by physicians changed: Children are  now treated by venereal disease specialists and narcologists.  They are already taking up functions which are not properly  theirs: Distracted from the treatment process, they go to youth  audiences to meet potential patients and call things by their  proper names, or try to talk some sense into parents: Please  understand that the departure of a child from the family and  preoccupation with "grass" are paths toward tragedy. Adolescent  drug addiction (alcoholism, toxic substance addiction) is a new  mass disease which is transmitted through the social milieu,  through the communication of children. It should be perceived  precisely as a disease--that is, your own and other children  alike should be protected against it.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SEATTLE OWNER HELPS TEEN-AGER WITH CANCER  </P> <P> A co-owner of the Seattle Mariners flew an Indianapolis teen-ager to Seattle  for cancer treatment today.  </P> <P> Businessman Jeff Smulyan offered a ride in his Learjet to 16-year-old Shaun  O'Neal, his mother and his sister after learning Tuesday of the teen-ager's  need to travel to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.  </P> <P> O'Neal is to undergo a bone marrow transplant from his sister, Nicole, 21.  </P> <P> Smulyan, who owns the Indianapolis-based Emmis Broadcasting, has been traveling  to Seattle frequently since he and Indianapolis developer Michael Browning  became the majority owners of the American League team last summer.  </P> <P> "It was his idea," Robin Rene of Emmis said about her boss's offer. "He  commutes to Seattle quite a bit since he still lives in Indianapolis and  thought why not invite the O'Neals along.  </P> <P> "Robin called and said her boss had read about Shaun and would we be interested  in a ride," said Burma O'Neal, the boy's mother.  </P> <P> The teen-ager's condition was diagnosed as leukemia in September, 1987, and he  is about to have his second marrow transplant from his sister.  </P> <P> The process will begin within the next 30 days and the procedure takes between  four and six months, Burma O'Neal said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Chairman of the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) Bela Bugar  expressed today his party's maximum effort to run in elections  in a triple coalition with the Egyutteles movement and the  Hungarian Civic Party (MOS), two other parties of ethnic  Hungarians in Slovakia.    "We want no Hungarian vote to be lost and left-wing forces  to  win in Slovakia," Bugar said. He added that the "left wing"  means the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS,  led by ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar), not the coalition  Democratic Left Party (SDL).    The MKDH's partner -- the Egyutteles movement -- has not  approved as yet the extension of the ethnic Hungarian coalition  by the MOS, which, according to polls, is supported by less than  one percent of the voters. The MKDH-Egyutteles coalition can  rely on seven to nine percent of the voters.    Commenting on the alleged problem of one minister of the  present government coalition with the screening law, Bugar said  his MKDH would never support a government wanting to rescue its  positively screened member at any cost. "If the speculations  are confirmed, the minister must quit," Bugar emphasized.    The screening law, passed by the Czechoslovak parliament in  1991, bars people linked to the former communist-run StB secret  police, high Communist Party officials and members of the  People's Militia from high government and economic posts until  1996. The screening procedure is carried out by the Interior  Ministry which issues certificates on whether or not a person  was among those listed by the law. Speculations on the  screening purity of one of the cabinet members, allegedly  representative of the SDL, emerged in the press on Monday [2  May]. The Hungarian coalition is not directly represented in  the cabinet of Jozef Moravcik, but its support made possible  this government's birth.    Bugar also pointed to the destructive methods applied by the  ex-Prime Minister's HZDS in the parliament since the fall of the  Meciar's government. According to Bugar, Meciar himself has  called on his deputies to propose the dismissal of one cabinet  member at each parliamentary session. The HZDS will always  collect the 30 signatures necessary for opening discussion on  the issue in parliament. This method aims to discredit  parliament and "make the impression that it is unable to take  positive steps," Bugar stressed.    Bugar's MKDH has five deputies in the 150-seat Slovak  parliament.</p>

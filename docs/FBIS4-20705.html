			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Omar Berbiche: "Political Asylum in Germany: </F> 11,000 Applications From Algerian Citizens"--first two  paragraphs are EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] "Germany's position concerning the situation in  Algeria remains unchanged: our country supports neither the  fundamentalists nor the terrorists."    This was the reaction of a German official (who wishes to  remain anonymous) to the inspection of the weapons loaded on  board the Algerian ship El Djorf, a case whose ramifications are  said to reach all the way to Germany.    According to the communique issued by security departments,  FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders residing in Germany, in  particular Djamel Lounici who was named by the above-mentioned  sailor, are implicated in this arms deal. For the German  official, the existence of "the German connection" mentioned in  the Algerian press is a rumor without foundation. He sees it as  another manifestation of the will to damage Algerian-German  relations, which has become the special goal of some Algerian  newspapers.    The accusation is too serious to be ignored, our source  estimated. The German side already asked Algerian authorities to  provide details of the case, we learned from reliable sources,  to enable it to identify Germany's responsibilities and, if the  accusations are founded, to decide on the measures to be taken  under the law. "Let the Algerian Government give us names, with  evidence showing that Algerian citizens residing in Germany are  closely or remotely involved in gun running, and we shall make  it our own business," they said.    For this German official, it is clear that "my country will  tolerate no criminal act on its soil." The federal government's  position, he said, is clear: "no support for international  terrorism, no matter what its color is."    The same official estimates that, although his country's  position with respect to the events that trouble Algeria may  seem paradoxical, the explanation is quite simple: Algerian  official circles resent the German judiciary's refusal to  extradite Rabah Kebir.    This, he said, was a decision of the German judiciary, which  is sovereign, and it has nothing to do with the government's  position on fundamentalism which, he indicated, is totally  unambiguous.    The file submitted by the Algerian judiciary to the German  judiciary, he explained, did not contain any evidence warranting  Kebir's extradition. Even if such evidence existed, it is said,  Kebir could never be extradited to Algeria, but to another  country of his choice, because German law does not allow the  extradition of an individual sentenced to death in his own  country.    "I can understand that this position is not always as well  understood in Algeria as would be desirable, that it may have  serious political consequences, but there is nothing we can do  about it; that is the price we pay for the independence of our  judiciary," he observed. For him, the latest decision  prohibiting Rabah Kebir from engaging in political activities  while on German soil reflects the government's concern to see  Algeria return to peace and stability. Kebir's application for  political asylum is still under consideration.  <H5>  Eleven Thousand Applications From Algerian Citizens </H5>   Processing the file may take months, even years, we were  told. Kebir's is not an isolated case: last year, the German  departments in charge of asylum applications received some  11,000 applications from Algerian citizens claiming to be FIS  members and persecuted in Algeria. Nearly 10,000 applications  were processed last year, and only about 50 were approved, we  were told by a reliable source. In most cases, we were told, the  rejected applications come from individuals viewed as economic  refugees rather than individuals persecuted for their political  opinions. The applications are studied one by one. But it so  happens that most applicants who are denied asylum do not leave  German soil and simply vanish into the crowd where, as illegal  aliens, they evade any government control. Many of them soon  find a trick to legalize their situation: they marry, or they  provide a medical file.    Sometimes warm, sometimes troubled, relations between  Algeria  and Germany never managed to achieve the measure of stability  that both sides want but that events prevent. Nevertheless, we  were told, the federal government clearly supports Algeria's  efforts, as it just repeated at the opening of negotiations with  the IMF "to find an acceptable solution to the crisis."</p>

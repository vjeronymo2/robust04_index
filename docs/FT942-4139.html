			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Beijing defies west with N-test China yesterday conducted its second underground nuclear test in less than a year in defiance of a US-sponsored informal international moratorium. The White House said it 'deeply regrets' the test and urged China to refrain from future testing, while Japan called the test 'regrettable'. China's foreign ministry, anticipating international criticism, said Beijing fully supported a comprehensive nuclear test ban, but reserved the right to continue testing in the meantime. 'China has all along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests and the number . . . is extremely limited,' the statement said. The US conducted its last test in 1992. President Bill Clinton recently extended the US ban on testing until 1995. China's latest test is consistent with its desire to develop a defence capability commensurate with its growing economic and political importance. Yesterday's detonation was conducted at China's Lop Nor test site in remote Xinjiang province. Preparations, detected by Western 'spy' satellites, had been under way for weeks. China provided few details but in London the Verification Technology Information Centre said the test was estimated to be of medium yield at between 10 and 60 kilotons. The foreign ministry statement repeated China's call for 'nuclear weapons states to give up their policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves in explicit terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons'. China is among 38 nations involved in the Conference on Disarmament which began in January negotiating a comprehensive test ban treaty. China yesterday urged that the treaty be concluded by 1996. But Beijing has made no secret of its suspicion of the motives of the US and 'nuclear club' allies in seeking a moratorium on testing. China's arsenal of nuclear weapons is said to number between 250-300 warheads - the smallest among the five declared members of the nuclear club, including the US, Russia, Britain and France. Israel, India and Pakistan are also believed to possess a nuclear capability.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: NWA back in the black at Dollars 112.3m in third term NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, reported net profits of Dollars 112.3m for the third quarter, compared with net losses of Dollars 19.7m for the same quarter last year. The company said the results showed action taken to restructure the troubled airline over the last year had begun to take effect. Earlier this year, the heavily indebted company narrowly escaped filing for bankruptcy by securing wage and benefit concessions from labour unions and agreeing a restructuring of its bank loans. The company's shares are privately held following a 1989 leveraged buy-out led by Mr Alfred Checchi and Mr Gary Wilson, now joint chairmen. Mr John Dasburg, president and chief executive officer, said the third quarter was the strongest period of the year for airlines. Last year's figure had been unusually depressed by a fares war initiated by a competitor, so an improvement had been expected. However, Mr Dasburg said the substantial improvement demonstrated progress in positioning Northwest for long-term profitability. 'We still have much work ahead of us, but we are pleased with our results in the third quarter and grateful to the people of Northwest for their diligent efforts to restore Northwest to profitability,' he said. Traffic for the quarter decreased 9.1 per cent to 15.94bn passenger miles from 17.54bn the previous year, but profits improved because loss-making domestic routes were cut and costs came down. Mr Dasburg said the wage and benefit reductions agreed by employees had contributed Dollars 40m to third quarter profits. Turnover rose by 5.9 per cent to Dollars 2.393bn and operating profits rose to Dollars 270.1m from Dollars 61m. LTV, the third biggest US steel producer which in June emerged from seven years of bankruptcy protection, turned in third-quarter profit of Dollars 400,000, against Dollars 632.4m a year earlier, agencies report from New York. Revenues rose to Dollars 1.05bn from Dollars 944.2m. Net earnings for the nine months totalled Dollars 4.07bn, against Dollars 727m, with revenues rising to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.88bn.</p>

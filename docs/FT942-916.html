			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Ina The Italian treasury must be relieved to price Ina shares in the middle of the indicated range. Turbulent financial markets are uncomfortable for insurance companies, which are priced relative to net assets. In addition to the malaise afflicting international markets, Italian investors appear to be losing patience with the new government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. At a 13 per cent discount to stated net assets, Ina looks reasonable value against other European insurers. But it would be rash to expect a windfall profit, at least until financial markets recover some poise. The long term case for investing in Ina rests on the argument that Italy is underinsured by the standards of most industrialised countries. Despite the recent setback in the courts, reform of the generous state pensions system should open the way for private sector providers of savings. Liberalisation of the motor insurance market from July 1 - premiums have been set by government until now - should also bring opportunities. The question is whether Ina can capture its fair share of expanding markets without losing sight of the risks. Its market share in life insurance has fallen sharply in recent years, although a new bancassurance alliance with Banco di Roma should stop the rot. On the non-life side, Ina must resist the temptation of an unprofitable battle for supremacy with Generali. If the group can make the most of its powerful franchise, though, the offer price leaves room for the shares to outperform.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Capital the crucial element - Kieran Cooke finds starting a private business is still not easy Le Van Kiem sits at his desk in his office in Ho Chi Minh City, a large diamond ring glinting on his finger. 'I describe myself as a socialist capitalist,' says Mr Kiem with a smile. 'I believe the two are not necessarily contradictory. People sometimes say the rich do not work. Now I'm in charge of a big business and yes, I have money. But I have never worked harder in my life.' Mr Kiem is founder of Huy Hoang, one of Vietnam's largest private groups. The private sector has only emerged in Vietnam in the past few years with much of the activity centred on Ho Chi Minh City. In 1988 there were only 22 private sector enterprises in the city. Now there are more than 2,000. The Huy Hoang group employs more than 3,000 people, most of them at a garment factory on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City. It is also involved in the construction industry, real estate and tourism development. Founded in 1990, Huy Hoang's turnover has grown from Dollars 5m to more than Dollars 40m this year. When Vietnam's stock exchange gets off the ground - possibly next year in Ho Chi Minh City - Mr Kiem says a listing of at least part of the group is likely. 'We have ambitions of turning Huy Hoang into a company involved in most sectors of the economy,' says Mr Kiem. 'Vietnam needs companies like ours, to provide jobs and to develop skills. Perhaps our workers will one day start their own businesses.' Getting a private company started in Vietnam is not easy. While the country's leadership heartily endorses the concept of the market economy, lingering distrust within the bureaucracy of the entrepreneur and the capitalist often results in contradictory regulations and delays in winning project approvals. However, shortage of capital is the greatest handicap for the private sector. Most private businesses have a large quantity of foreign sourced capital behind them. Mr Kiem was able to start his company using savings he had made from a home-based paint business in the 1980s and money sent by relatives in the US. Bitis, another large Vietnamese company involved mainly in the shoe manufacturing business, is run by the family of Vuu Khai Thanh. Mr Thanh is a Chinese Vietnamese. Vietnam's Chinese community, numbering about 500,000 and mostly centred on Ho Chi Minh City, has the advantage of being able to call up capital from relatives in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur or Taiwan. Bitis, now in a joint venture with a Taiwanese group, makes about 12m pairs of low-cost sandals and shoes each year. At a factory on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City 1,800 workers earning about Dollars 40 per month glue shoe materials together. The smell is overpowering. About 80 per cent of materials are imported - mostly from Taiwan. A large slice of Bitis' production goes for export to Japan and China. However, the company is selling increasing amounts of its slippers, priced at about Dollars 2 a pair, on the home market. Mr Kiem of Huy Hoang admits that Vietnam's industrial sector is still undeveloped. About 80 per cent of the materials for Huy Hoang's garments have to be imported. Garment companies in Europe have signed long-term production contracts with Huy Hoang. They have also advanced the company capital for expansion. 'Raising the initial capital is the big problem for Vietnamese enterprises,' says Mr Kiem. 'I think the Vietnamese are skilful and have a talent for business. Some have capital, a lot of it hidden under the bed, but are frightened to take risks. I was one of the first. I'm sure others will follow.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF) rebels kept up the pressure on government forces in Kigali  overnight, with fierce mortar and cannon-fire exchanges aimed to  weaken the Army's resolve, a military spokesman said. "It's a  classic technique, to weaken the opponent psychologically and  physically, to keep him awake," he told AFP.    The spokesman was speaking at the Meridien Hotel in the  capital, situated on the front line in the northeast of the  capital, which is disputed by government and rebel forces.  Intermittent bursts of gunfire rang out during the night from  the surrounding hills. [passage omitted]    Rwandan state radio said late Sunday [17 April] that  government forces had responded to a set of RPF preconditions  for talks issued by the Tutsi-dominated movement on Saturday,  but failed to indicate the tenor of the response.    Abdul Kabia of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda told AFP  Sunday the Armed Forces had accepted a rebel demand for joint  patrols by security forces and its guerrillas to restore order.  They also agreed to the principle of a judicial inquiry into the  bloodshed in Kigali. But it was unclear how they had responded  to the rebels' insistence that the government and the  presidential guard -- accused of horrific atrocities -- be  disbanded.    Many of the RPF conditions are thought unacceptable to the  new Armed Forces Chief Augustin Bizimungu -- branded a "Hutu  hardliner" by the RPF -- appointed Saturday to replace General  Deogratias Nasabimana, killed with the president.</p>

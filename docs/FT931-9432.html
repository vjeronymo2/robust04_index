			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Welfare goes private - The government wants to spread the welfare bill. John Authers finds out what the private sector can offer GOVERNMENT hopes to contract out unemployment and other welfare benefits to the private sector, widely reported last weekend, look unlikely to meet with success. Private insurers are reluctant to pick up the opportunity. As commercial operations, they scarcely want to shoulder the risk of becoming unemployed when this risk is growing higher than ever. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers put it emphatically: 'It's a total non-starter.' However, the government's ideas, although they seem too crude at present, fit a worldwide trend. In its global review for 1993, Noble Lowndes, the actuary, comments on the 'privatisation of social security'. It said: 'Bastions of cradle-to-grave social security systems such as Italy and Sweden have started the process of cost containment and shifting of burdens. Reforms, the classic euphemism for cost cutting and redirecting responsibility, are being implemented everywhere.' The UK does have several routes by which the private sector adds to the welfare protection on offer from the state. Personal and company pensions, which top up the meagre allowance from the state pension, are the best known. Companies also offer insurance to restore your income both when you are off work sick, and when you are made redundant. These have the potential for growth. But the pressures on both forms of insurance show why the industry is unenthusiastic about the opportunity the government has thrown its way. Unemployment Insurance Standard unemployment benefit stands at Pounds 43.10 per week. Those with a dependent adult receive an extra Pounds 26.60. This is nowhere near enough to keep up the payments on an average mortgage. Most redundancy contracts on the market aim only to protect a flow of payments, either on mortgages or on a consumer loan. It is almost impossible to buy unemployment insurance on a 'stand-alone' basis as insurers cannot make a profit this way. Redundancy cover is also usually only sold in conjunction with accident and sickness insurance, with one premium for the whole package. Premiums are quoted for every Pounds 100 of monthly outgoings which the policy is to protect. National &amp; Provincial's accident sickness and unemployment policy, underwritten by Guardian Royal Exchange, charges Pounds 7.20 per Pounds 100 each month, and the benefit cover lasts for two years. You have to be in work for six months before starting the policy. Accident and sickness cover on their own cost Pounds 3.20 per month, suggesting that unemployment costs around Pounds 4 per Pounds 100. According to N &amp; P the premium for the whole package was less than Pounds 5 two years ago, this increase shows the effect of rising unemployment. Demand has grown. In the past two years, the proportion of N &amp; P new borrowers taking out the protection rose from 20 per cent to roughly 33 per cent. Citibank Mortgage has offered free redundancy insurance, underwritten at Lloyd's, for the last year, and plans to continue doing so. Abbey National also offers free payment protection, including accident and sickness, as an incentive to first-time buyers. For those who wish to pay for it, the premiums have recently been increased from Pounds 6 to Pounds 6.95 per Pounds 100 of monthly sum assured. The rising premiums give a clue to the industry's opposition to the government's plans. Paul Thompson, of Financial Insurance, one of the UK's biggest unemployment insurance companies, reports a significant worsening in claims experience. Claims on its payment protection package as a whole rose by 54 per cent in 1991, and by a further 40 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile the share of claims caused by unemployment, rather than disability, grew from 20 per cent to 55 per cent. The length of time for which people have claimed unemployment insurance has also increased, by around 60 per cent, and the company has evidence of increased 'moral hazard' or fraudulent claims. Another problem, pointed out by Gordon Mylchreest, marketing director of Consolidated Insurance Group, is 'anti-selection' - most of the people who take out the cover believe they are at risk of losing their job. Demand is increasing, and the premiums charged look very reasonable as unemployment approaches 3m, but the industry is unlikely to cover against this risk much more than it does at present. Permanent Health Insurance The level of statutory sick pay is enough to make many people feel ill. Those on between Pounds 54 and Pounds 189.99 per week receive Pounds 45.30 per week. Anyone with an income of Pounds 190 or more per week will receive Pounds 52.50. This is payable for 28 weeks, after which it could be necessary to apply for sickness or invalidity benefit. Permanent health insurance, to use the industry jargon for income replacement policies, offers to pay an income indefinitely if someone is too ill to work. The industry norm is not to pay out more than three quarters of the policyholder's previous salary minus the state single person's invalidity benefit, to give an incentive to go back to work. PHI is available both to individuals and through many company group schemes, with premiums varying according to how long the policyholder is prepared to wait after becoming unfit for work before receiving benefits. Again, demand is rising, partly because people have less faith in state benefits than they used to. But, like unemployment insurance, the number of claims and the time for which people claim are also increasing. This led Allied Dunbar, the market leader in PHI for individuals, to raise premiums. These come into force on Monday, and will vary according to age, sex, occupation, and the amount of time you are prepared to defer benefit. The increases are greater for older ages in higher-risk occupations. A 25-year-old man in a low-risk occupation deferring for six months faces an increase of only 7 per cent, a higher-risk man faces an increase of 29 per cent. The increases are greater for women. Premiums will rise 100 per cent for a 35-year-old woman in a high-risk occupation deferring for six months. This does not mean that the insurance is bad value - a 29-year-old man in a low-risk (white collar) job can insure a salary of Pounds 25,000 (allowing a PHI pay-out of Pounds 15,935) with premiums of Pounds 17.88. A woman of the same age would have to pay Pounds 33.98 for the same cover. Alan Tyler, health and group manager of Mercantile &amp; General, the UK's biggest reinsurer for individual PHI, believes Allied Dunbar's action is justified. He said: 'When PHI came on the market, the premium rates were just inspired guesswork.' Now that the industry has built up some claims experience, difficulties have emerged. According to M &amp; G, claims from people deferring the benefit for 13 or more weeks have been running 20 to 25 per cent higher than expected since 1985. Claims from those deferring for six months have 'deteriorated rapidly', and since 1985 have been 75 per cent above expectation. M &amp; G's suggestions for change in the market include limiting the benefit payable to two thirds of salary less full state invalidity benefit. The experience of Swiss Life, which offers a net group PHI scheme, paying an income to employees net of tax and state benefits, suggests that this could work. There is no incentive for employees to stay away from work longer than they have to, and Swiss Life has noticed no increase in claims over the last two years. Nick Anderton, an actuary with management consultants AKG, said PHI is 'the most undersold' product in the life insurance market. The problem for insurers, he said, is that claims depend on work availability. In times of unemployment this makes underwriting more difficult. One look at the state benefits shows that the industry has a product which many will want to pay for. But the way it has evolved also demonstrates that it would be difficult to withstand a total removal of the state benefits.</p>

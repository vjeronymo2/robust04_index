			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON PARK STUDENTS TAKE A WALK ON WILD SIDE  </P> <P> Noon is approaching, and it's getting hot at Point Mugu State Park in the Santa  Monica Mountains. But none of the teen-agers gathered around outdoors expert  Joe Drennan seem to mind.  </P> <P> "Now, let's see if we can locate the Deer family," Drennan suggests. He holds  up two fingers and draws two parallel marks in the ground alongside the trail  that he and the youngsters have been following.  </P> <P> "When you find two little marks like this, it means you're probably getting  close to Mrs. Deer," Drennan tells his listeners. "So you say, 'Hi, Mrs. Deer!  Hi, Doe!' "  </P> <P> Drennan, a staff member of the Headlands Institute, an organization devoted to  teaching respect for nature, simulates the tracks of Mr. Deer ("Hi, Buck!") and  Baby Deer ("Hi, Fawn!").  </P> <P> To some junior high school students, such talk might seem naive. But to the 14  youngsters who have traveled to the hills of Ventura County from Huntington  Park, near inner-city Los Angeles, it's fascinating.  </P> <P> The visitors, one of two groups that will camp overnight in the park's Sycamore  Canyon this week as part of the parks system's Environmental Education Pilot  Program, are science students at Nimitz Junior High, part of the Los Angeles  Unified School District.  </P> <P> Cynthia Acuna, 13, presses closer as Drennan scoops up a tiny, wormlike  creature. He explains that it's a grub or baby beetle -- hardly a candidate for  Cynthia's collection of rocks and seashells.  </P> <P> "I study them with a magnifying glass," she says. "Up here, I'm watching the  ground all the time, looking for things to add to my collection."  </P> <P> Claudia Acosta, 14, notes that it's nice to "just get away from the city for a  little while." In Huntington Park, she reports, "we have too many people, too  much pollution, too much crime. We don't have as many gangs as some other  places, but we do have them."  </P> <P> The group's youngest camper, Jerry Chacon, 12, concedes that his parents were  concerned about his safety during the trip. "But they just said to be careful,"  he says. He adds that he's anxious to learn all he can about science. His  ambition is to become an airline pilot or an astronaut.  </P> <P> "We're a year-round school, which means our students get two six-week breaks  but no summer vacation," said Nimitz science teacher Margaret Kroon.  </P> <P> "These trips are part of a pilot project being conducted by the school district  and the state Department of Parks and Recreation. The idea is to give the  children a chance to study and experience nature just as those who go camping  in the summer do."  </P> <P> Bill Chesney, a former Nimitz teacher who is helping to design the two-year  pilot program for the state, says he doesn't know whether students in Ventura  County -- where few schools are on year-round schedules -- will take part in  the program if it's adopted.  </P></p>

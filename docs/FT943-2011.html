			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Three top Micron executives quit The three top executives of Micron Technology, a US memory chip manufacturer, have resigned abruptly for 'personal reasons'. No further explanation for the unexpected resignations was offered. The sudden resignation of Mr Joseph Parkinson, chairman and chief executive and one of Micron's founders, Mr James Garrett, president and chief operating officer, and Mr Reid Langrill, chief financial officer, baffled analysts. A possible explanation for the management shake-up is a rift with the company's biggest shareholder, Mr John Simplot, chairman of J. R. Simplot, an agribusiness company, who controls 21.5 per cent of Micron's shares, analysts said. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is locked in competition with much larger Korean, Japanese and US memory chip producers but has been performing well as demand for memory chips outpaces supplies, boosting prices. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, ending June 2, Micron reported net income of Dollars 259m, or Dollars 2.47 a share, up sharply from the previous year when the first nine months net income was Dollars 41m, or 41 cents. Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 1994 totalled Dollars 1.1bn, compared with Dollars 522m for the nine months ended June 3 1993. Micron is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings statement this week, with analysts projecting strong earnings of about Dollars 1.12 a share.</p>

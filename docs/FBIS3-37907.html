			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The decision on the political amnesty of the SCSE  [State Committee for the State of Emergency] members and the  participants in the October events is completely in keeping with  the Constitution from a judicial point of view. This was stated  by Aleksandr Yakovlev, the official representative of the  Russian president at the Federal Assembly today. However, he  noted, the political and social aspects in this case are more  important than the judicial one. He thinks that an act on  amnesty may create a false illusion of hopes for civic peace.</p>

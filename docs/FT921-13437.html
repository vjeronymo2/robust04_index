			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lay-offs at GM Canada plant GENERAL Motors' Canadian subsidiary is indefinitely laying off 9 per cent of the workforce at an engine plant in St Catharines, Ontario, as a result of the continuing weakness in the North American car and truck market. A GM official said yesterday that the lay-offs, affecting 750 workers, are not directly related to the long-term belt-tightening programme announced by Mr Robert Stempel, GM chairman, last month. He said they reflected declining production volumes at the plant, which is located 50 miles south-west of Toronto. The St Catharines facility, which employs a total of 8,000 people, produces V6 and V8 engines as well as transmission components, castings and other parts. About 75 to 80 per cent of its production is exported to the US. As many as 1,700 workers at St Catharines have been affected by temporary lay-offs in recent weeks. The lay-offs will take effect on March 1. A GM assembly plant at Oshawa, east of Toronto, employing over 3,000 workers, is among those threatened with closure under the restructuring announced by Mr Stempel. A decision on the plant's fate is expected within the next month or two.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Insurers offer new pollution protection The launch last week of a new environmental insurance policy, which pays out when regulators order companies to clean up, signals that the UK insurance sector is beginning to respond to industry's growing concerns about the cost of pollution. The new policy by two US companies - ECS Underwriting and National Reliance  -requires policyholders to carry out environmental surveys and makes coverage dependent on the adoption of rigorous controls to reduce the likelihood of pollution. It remains to be seen, however, whether industry will respond any more enthusiastically to these products than to similar - but more restrictive - policies pioneered by a handful of UK companies. A raft of new national and European legislation is redefining the pollution liabilities of industry and its financial backers. Under legislation introduced in the past couple of years both the National Rivers Authority and local authorities have acquired considerable powers to order companies operating polluted sites to finance clean-ups. If site operators go into liquidation, their bankers or receivers could be asked to meet the costs. In addition, the introduction of a register of contaminated land is expected to increase the scope for litigation. The values of properties built on contaminated sites will probably fall. Site operators or owners, including thousands of householders, could face the extra costs of cleaning up contamination. Recently, for example, 671 householders at Armley, a suburb of Leeds, were presented by Leeds City Council with a Pounds 5m bill to clean up asbestos dust from their properties. The pollution occurred as a result of emissions from an asbestos factory situated in the area over a 30-year period until its closure in 1958. Potential European legislation, influenced by the legal concepts of strict liability (liability without proof of fault), is reinforcing this trend. A survey by the Sedgwick Group, insurance brokers and consultants, found that environmental concerns were top of the list of worries for risk and insurance managers of UK companies. More than 80 per cent of the boards of 100 British companies were more worried by pollution than any other risk. Yet the conventional insurance market has been of limited help. Traditionally, UK public liability insurance has provided industry with coverage where it is found liable for pollution damage to third parties. But in April 1991, British insurers restricted the scope of coverage to 'a sudden, identifiable, unintended and unexpected incident which takes place in its entirety at specific time and place during the period of insurance'. The ECS policy - along with similar coverage offered by the Chemical Industries Association, American International Group and Zurich Insurance - helps plug the gap. Known collectively as 'environmental impairment' or EIL policies, they cover against the risk that gradual or accidental pollution will cause damage to third parties. The ECS policy is more innovative in that it pays for the cost of cleaning up a contaminated site if action is ordered by regulators. All EIL policies are dependent, however, on the environmental surveys carried out at the policyholders' expense and rigorous controls of risk. The ECS policy is strictly underwritten to cover specific sites and coverage is on a 'claims made' basis, which means that in general claims must be made within the policy period, for example. At a time of recession the expense could prove off-putting. The survey alone - which provides no guarantee that insurance will be offered - could cost at least Pounds 10,000. Francis de Zulueta, chairman of a London insurance market group on environmental liability and financial institutions, says he believes it will be two years before the market takes off, with the recession and the limited character of cover depressing interest.</p>

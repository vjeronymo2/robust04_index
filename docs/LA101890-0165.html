			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK HIT WITH $81-MILLION LAWSUIT  </P> <P> The Western Standardbred Assn. has filed suit against Hollywood Park seeking  $81 million in damages for the race track's alleged attempt to kill harness  racing in the Southland.  </P> <P> The suit, which was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, said that  Hollywood Park Operating Company and Hollywood Park Realty "were engaged in a  wrongful plan and program to curtail the competitive opportunities for harness  racing in Southern California and eliminate harness racing in Southern  California."  </P> <P> The suit outlined eight major points that were said to expedite a decline in,  if not the elimination of harness racing. Hollywood Park is alleged to have:  </P> <P>  -- Forced harness racing out of Hollywood Park.  </P> <P>  -- Limited harness racing to Los Alamitos.  </P> <P>  -- Refused to operate harness racing at Los Alamitos for the full amount of  time allocated by the California Horse Racing Board.  </P> <P>  -- Refused to allow other operators to lease either of the tracks for harness  racing.  </P> <P>  -- Failed to operate meetings properly at Los Alamitos and failed to promote,  market or advertise harness racing in a reasonable fashion.  </P> <P>  -- Allowed Los Alamitos to fall into disrepair.  </P> <P>  -- Deliberately jeopardized the vitality and viability of Los Alamitos.  </P> <P>  -- Started night thoroughbred racing at Hollywood Park in direct competition  with Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Should the suit reach trial, Max Blecher, the attorney who represented the  Coliseum Commission and the Raiders against the National Football League, would  argue the case.  </P> <P> Irving Reifman, an attorney for Western Standardbred, said Wednesday: "One of  the main incidents was last year when Hollywood Park took away five weeks of  harness racing at Los Alamitos and, secretly, by contract, gave it to the  quarter horse industry."  </P> <P> Bob Forgnone, the main attorney for Hollywood Park, said he hadn't yet reviewed  the suit.  </P> <P> Reifman added: "This was filed on the 'fast track,' which means that the judge  could hear it within 12 to 24 months from now."  </P></p>

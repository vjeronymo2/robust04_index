			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miodrag Vukadinovic from Knin] </F>   [Text] [Begin recording] [Vukadinovic] The creation of a  unified Serbian country, based on the ideas of democracy and  social justice, is the basic program goal of the Serbian Party  of Socialists, it was stated at the first electoral conference  of this party, held in Knin. Party president Djordje Bjegovic  said in his introduction that the economic and cultural  reconstruction of the country parallel to the reduction of  political tensions is the principle upon which Serbian  Socialists will insist in their future political activities:    [Bjegovic] I believe that here I share the belief of all the  citizens of the world, namely, that peace is a prerequisite in  order to be able to live life. The Serbian Party of Socialists  believes that peace can only be created through negotiations,  cease-fire, agreements. Afterward, the issue of borders should  be resolved with economic programs [sentence as heard].    [Vukadinovic] Hailing the work of the electoral conference  in the name of a numerous delegation of the Socialist Party of  Serbia, Federal Human Rights Minister Margit Savovic said:    [Savovic] You all know very well that Serbia has done  everything that you could stress in the world as an equal in the  negotiations with Croatia, that it is supporting and aiding  these people here in all aspects, and above all wants you to  accomplish you desires and tendencies, wishes to accompany you  in it and work on it together with you. The entire struggle that  you are engaged in must result in life in one state.    [Vukadinovic] In the name of the SPS of the Serbian  Republic, all present were greeted by party president Dr.  Dragutin Ilic, who voiced the belief this party's program will  very quickly gain popularity in the Serbian Republic:    [Ilic] We favor a single, unified Serbian state, and not  little states or perhaps duchies, but a state that will have one  parliament, one government, one president.    [Vukadinovic] By forming the communal committee, the first  electoral conference of the Serbian Party of Socialists for the  Knin commune has ended its work. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (62): Cooling down the overheated dragon - China / Tony Walker on difficulties in the reform programme China's economy continues its roller coaster ride with the authorities grappling with unsustainable growth rates, inflation and the difficulties of managing a complex transformation from a centrally-planned to a market-oriented system. The announcement in late August that the government was re-introducing price controls to curb inflation and was also pumping additional funds into ailing state enterprises indicated increasing official nervousness over the possible social costs of its economic reforms. Since the unveiling of a 16-point stabilisation programme in July 1993, the government has sought to calm an overheating economy by resort to tight money policies. These measures helped restore a semblance of order to a chaotic economy by strengthening credit controls and bolstering central supervision over an errant financial sector. But the 'macroeconomic control measures' have been less successful than the government would have hoped in combating inflation which has now been singled out as the main threat to China's social and economic advancement. Indeed, the authorities have announced that reducing inflationary pressures will be the main task for the rest of the year. Official nervousness about a link between rising prices and possible social unrest was spurred by July urban cost-of-living figures which showed a jump of 24.2 per cent over the same period last year. This indicated that price rises were beginning to accelerate again after appearing to slow in recent months. The government has also been obliged to acknowledge that its attempts to reform state-owned enterprises are proving more difficult than anticipated in the light of social stresses caused by rising prices, and the dire situation of many of these companies According to the State Statistical Bureau some 50 per cent among 11,000 medium and large state enterprises were in the red in the first part of this year. One of the most serious problems facing the government is that of 'triangular debt' - the inability of virtually bankrupt state enterprises to pay each other for goods and services. In turn, the continuing voracious demands for subsidies of faltering state companies is threatening to undermine the government's tight money policies. State enterprise reform continues to be a significant challenge and burden. Inevitably, the government's announcement that it would reinstate price controls (it announced there would be no new increases for the rest of the year) and would also bail out failing enterprises, has raised questions about its commitment to continued economic liberalisation. But while western economists detect 'wavering' in the reform effort, they believe that in the longer term China has no choice. 'The government recognises that the reforms are essential, both to ensure balanced sustainable growth and to provide an effective set of market-based macroeconomic management tools,' said one. China's outlook for this year is for continued high growth rates in excess of the official 9 per cent real GDP target. Economists expect growth between 11-12 per cent compared with rates of more than 13 per cent in the past two years. Real GDP increased by 12.7 per cent in the first quarter and 10.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1994. The inflation bogey may have taken the gloss off the government's economic programme, but this is not to say China's economic managers are without some notable achievements. These include currency unification, stabilisation of the exchange rate, stronger growth in exports, a sharp improvement in foreign exchange reserves and the introduction of complex tax reforms aimed at improving central government revenues. The authorities also completed the successful sale of Yn100bn (USDollars 11.7bn) in state treasury bonds to finance the budget deficit. Public demand for the government paper was stronger than anticipated and sales targets were achieved ahead of schedule. Bank savings have also risen strongly following two rounds of interest rate increases (by a cumulative 4 per cent) last year. Urban and rural savings rose by 28 per cent in 1993 to Yn1476bn (equivalent to 47 per cent of GDP). Government attempts to slow capital spending as part of its anti-inflation strategy have met with mixed success. Total investment grew last year by more than 50 per cent compared with the previous year. It fell back to 25.5 per cent in the first half of this year; but a July surge in investment in state-owned fixed assets to 73 per cent compared with the same month last year proved alarming. The government had blamed a capital spending binge in 1993, much of it in speculative real estate, for the inflationary pressures which are still bedevilling the economy. China's central bank has indicated that it plans to tighten credit in the third quarter, and also to clamp down on the activities of non-bank financial institutions such as trust companies. These institutions have been singled out as the main culprits in unauthorised lending outside the credit plan. China's budgetary position continues to be difficult. China budgeted for a Yn66.9bn deficit for 1994-95, but this almost certainly understates the likely funding gap. While state revenues increased by 22.6 per cent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, the central government's financial position remained weak. The finance ministry blamed below target revenue growth, pressures on expenditure and tax evasion for a shortfall in revenues. Prospects for improvement in the second half of the year do not appear all that promising. In contrast, China's external situation has improved sharply. After recording a trade deficit of USDollars 12.2bn in 1993, China may be heading for a balanced trading account in 1994. Exports grew by 31.2 per cent in the first half of the year compared with import growth of 19 per cent, reversing last year's trend in which imports grew much faster than exports.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered Standard Chartered's Dollars 41m suit against Citibank in connection with its Indian troubles is a reminder that it has developed quite a penchant for litigation. It has already been awarded damages worth more than Pounds 250m this year in suits against Price Waterhouse, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the Australian company, GPI Leisure. Perhaps investors should start rating the bank on the basis of its ability to plead in court, rather than its record for getting into scrapes in the first place.</p>

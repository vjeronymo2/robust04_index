			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatively, EPA believes that the above approach is consistent with section 211 because EPA interprets section 211(e)(3) (A) and (B) in conjunction with section 211(e)(3)(C), which gives EPA authority to exempt any F/FA product from duplicative testing. Thus, even if one interprets the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which [is/is not] registered'' to mean either that an identical F/FA product must already have a registration, or to refer to a product-specific registration, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret section 211(e)(3)(C) to allow F/FAs that are similar in composition and usage to those already on the market to group with those similar F/FAs and complete the testing with the other F/FAs in their group. At the same time, EPA believes that for F/FAs that differ significantly in composition or usage from currently registered F/FAs, such testing would not be duplicative of testing of registered  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FAs;&blank;and therefore, EPA is authorized under section 211(e) to require this information prior to registration. Under either theory, EPA's authority to obtain information prior to registration is not limited to Tier 1 and Tier 2 data, because section 211(b)(2)(B) gives EPA authority to require for registration any information necessary to assess the effects of emissions on public health or welfare. Therefore, EPA interprets section 211 (e) and (b) to give it the authority to require any necessary health or welfare effects information for F/FAs that are significantly different in composition or usage from currently registered products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes to 40 CFR Part 79.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule includes revisions to the current 40 CFR part 79 registration regulations which are necessary to properly implement the new testing requirements in Subpart F. These consist of various conforming changes in registration procedures, requirements, and terminology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submission by which a manufacturer requests registration of a fuel or fuel additive product is now called an ``application'' rather than a ``notification,'' in order to better reflect the additional submissions and requirements upon which registration is now contingent, and to avoid confusion with the various notifications concerning testing requirements which will be transmitted to applicants and registrants by EPA. Conforming changes have been made in procedures for notifying an applicant that a submission does not comply with registration requirements and for granting registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in Section IV of this preamble, in order to determine in which of the F/FA group(s) established under the criteria set forth in this rule (see &sect;79.56) a particular fuel additive should be enrolled, and to administer applicable testing requirements separately for each such F/FA group, it is essential that fuel additives be deemed to be registered only for those specific types of fuel for which they will be sold and used. The Agency interprets and is already administering the existing part 79 in this manner. However, in the conforming changes included in this rule, part 79 has been clarified to confirm that registration of fuel additives is fuel specific, and that EPA considers sale or distribution of a fuel additive product for use in a fuel for which it is not registered to be unlawful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a manufacturer seeking to register a fuel product or a fuel additive product for use in vehicles manufactured after 1974 must demonstrate that it is ``substantially similar'' to fuels or additives utilized in the certification of vehicles for 1975 or subsequent model years, or that the manufacturer has obtained a waiver under CAA section 211(f)(4). This expressly codifies the manner in which EPA has administered the registration program since it adopted criteria implementing the statutory prohibition in CAA section 211(f)(1) on introduction into commerce of fuels and fuel additives which are not ``substantially similar.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Program Focus On Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CAA section 211 gives the Agency discretion to determine the focus of the F/FA testing program under CAA section 211(b). EPA is exercising its discretion by focusing this rule on the testing of emissions, because the main purpose of the testing program is to provide EPA with information that can be used in regulatory decision-making under CAA section 211(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 211(c) of the CAA gives EPA the authority to regulate F/FAs based on the impact of their emissions on public health or welfare. Specifically, it allows the Administrator to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission product(s) cause or contribute to harmful air pollution. The legislative history of the provision also supports a focus on emissions, since House and Senate Reports on the CAA Amendments of 1970 link the information to be obtained under CAA section 211(b) to EPA's authority to regulate emissions under CAA section 211(c). <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Thus in the NPRM, EPA proposed to focus this rule's requirements on the potential emissions-based effects of F/FAs rather than on the effects of the raw (i.e., uncombusted) F/FA product. Public comment received after publication of the NPRM generally supported the proposed emissions-based focus of the rule. Accordingly, EPA has retained this focus in today's action. The health effects testing requirements of this final rule specifically address the effects of inhalation exposure to F/FA combustion and evaporative emissions. The required testing focuses on the evaluation of health effects of the whole emissions of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture of interest and not on the toxicity of the individual emission products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> H.

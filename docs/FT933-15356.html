			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Walker gives up bankruptcy fight MR GEORGE WALKER, the former chairman of the Brent Walker group now facing criminal charges alleging he stole more than Pounds 12m from the company, yesterday gave up his fight against bankruptcy. He had been ordered to pay Pounds 18,000 into court as part security for costs should an appeal against bankruptcy fail. Mr Walker's solicitors said because he had been declared bankrupt he was unable to pay the Pounds 18,000 and therefore had to drop his appeal.</p>

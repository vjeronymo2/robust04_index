			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Kafka's 'The Trial' - Theatre This version of Kafka's classic novel is like a limp handshake. It doesn't grasp the novel, and it doesn't grip us. It whooshes its protagonist, K, through all the bewildering, bizarre and frustrating preliminaries of a trial whose purpose and nature neither he nor we ever understand, it speeds him along a gallery of unsettling characters  - but it is all just a grey precis. A pity, since it has much going for it. This adaptation was first made by Jan Grossman, the celebrated Czech director who died this February, in 1966. Its director here, Lida Engelova (also Czech), staged his version of The Trial in St Petersburg in (of all times) spring 1989. The present staging - which marks her British directorial debut - is fluent, imaginative, succinct; and it contains plenty of good acting. So why does it not enthral? Part of the problem is James Wilby as K. This actor has developed an interesting line in characters who are weak but intense, but his way of communicating intensity, with over-emphatic facial expressions and over-calculated gestures, fails to convince. And everything about him - the lazily clear vowels, the lordly and relaxed use of his hands, even the frequently puzzled look about the eyes - carries so hefty a whiff of the English class system that he cannot penetrate to the heart of Kafka's Mittel-Europa totalitarian state. But another part of the problem is that Engelova and Grossman do not catch the dark irony of Kafka's prose. Not at the Young Vic, at any rate. Oh, they are certainly aware of all the metaphysical, political, judicial and sexual aspects of K's story. But the deadly appearance of impassive detachment with which Kafka makes his every stroke all the more meaningful is missing. The mystery of the unseen 'They' never has terror for us here, and the anonymity of reducing the protagonist's name to a mere initial is lost. Kafka is most alive amid the roster of supporting roles, several of them halfway into Dickensian caricature. Peter Eyre is wonderfully lugubrious as the Advocate in Part Two, droning dolorously about the capriciousness of clerks, and the crucial importance of 'the highest grade of the lower orders'. Even in the small role of the Examining Magistrate in Part One, he has a deadpan solemnity that is utterly Kafkaesque. Estelle Kohler, as Lenka, is a slyly lascivious cat; Simon Dutton's painter Titorelli is an entirely plausible con-artist of the wheels of bureaucracy; and Jake Nightingale and David Barber make the two warders into bitterly funny and horrid portraits of petty crookedness. Guy Manning's priest, however, does not bring off his long tale. At the Young Vic, until May 22; sponsored by Lovell White Durant, an award winner under the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / As they say in Europe: The soft soap of capitalism THE OTHER day I went to a fascinating meeting (sorry about the oxymoron) which discussed the first half year of the 'Marshall Plan of the Mind.' The MPM was the idea of my ex-boss, John Tusa, and has been partly supported by an imaginative grant from the Foreign Office. It employs the talents of some of my colleagues who try to spread information about the free market, capitalism, business et al to Russia, warts and all. Theyt make programmes in Russian for Radio Russia. These include How Business Works, another In Business and a third is the Free Market Society. The fourth is a radio soap opera, House No 7. The audiences run into millions. House No 7 is a particular success but also produces cultural clashes for there is no tradition of radio soap in Russia. There is no tradition of discussing business problems: 'intellectuals' hate the very word 'business'. There is no tradition that deals with worldly matters, except socialist realism. Yet socialist realism had to be destroyed before House No 7 could be constructed - heroic tractor drivers' platitudes and stage villains are not the stuff of soap. So getting nine Russian scriptwriters to make the residents of House No 7 talk about trade has been a problem. They work under the direction of a young Englishwoman who once helped keep The Archers, Britain's most popular radio soap, down on the farm handing out information about how to grow things. The similarities between daily reality as portrayed in The Archers and that of House No 7 are limited. A profile of one of the characters runs: 'Dima's latest idea is to sell gas-guns . . . Dima has heard that some of the guns are defective and that users have been injured. He decides to monitor carefully who he is selling to. Dima is offered a consignment of ladies' underwear . . .' Thus we are introduced to a character my colleagues in business journalism would call a 'gas-gun-to-panties conglomerate'. Dima has been left facing the choice of whether to move into narcotics. This illuminates a solution to a basic problem that underlies the relationship between the British producer and the Russian actors and writers. The Russians have mastered the production requirements of radio soap, but they struggle to leave listeners on the edge of their seats. So not only has the producer to push her team into thinking about business, she also has to demand, when listening to a story outline, 'A potom?' ('And then?'). It is here one sees the clash of the pre-capitalist East and the post-modern West in microcosm. The problem is A potom?, what will happen next, but it is an Anglo-Saxon problem. In Russia everybody knows what will happen next. Disaster will strike. Oblomov will go back to sleep, Raskolnikov back to prison. And, where themes might peripherally concern business problems, they merely highlight the inevitable doom; the cherry orchard will not be cut down by its owners, the Ranyevsky family will be evicted as a result. The tension that exists in Russian culture focuses on when, not if, the hero-as-victim is next going to get it in the neck. This partly reflects the language - the construction of Russian verbs concentrates on the when and the how, rather than the what, of actions and events. When I returned to my office after the meeting I switched on the little television by the desk, zapped to the Russian first channel and there was an episode of the fabulously popular Mexican soap, The Rich Also Weep. One could see why the Russians like it: there were a lot of rich people getting it in the neck as their individual personalities led them to their preordained rendezvous with destiny. (Latin Americans and Russians have more in common than one might think.) The evocation of wealth was enchanting: huge chandeliers in dining rooms built to small studio scale, copious supplies of colourful tableware, deep nylon-tufted carpets, pink front doors and Louis XV telephones. House No 7 has been able to popularise the daunting reality of Russian everyday life without succumbing to the traditional sense of the futile. A virtue of all these programmes is that they provide a comprehensive manual of contemporary Russian life. As the British presenter of How Business Works remarks of the crazy diversification programme developed by one entrepreneur, 'Mr Aleshkin laughed in agreement when I said this was economic madness.' Chekhov is still writing the scripts. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

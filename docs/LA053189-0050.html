			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S WARNING TO THE ISRAELIS  </P> <P> Again, Israel comes to us and asks for $3 billion in yearly aid (Part I, May  13). Under the provisions of the so-called "Humphrey-Kennedy" amendment, the  U.S. government can suspend all military aid to a country guilty of human  rights violations. We have clear evidence of violations of human rights in the  occupied territories by the Israeli government. I believe that suspension of  military aid to Israel would result in a dramatic change in an otherwise  intransigent attitude of the Israeli government towards negotiations for a  peaceful settlement in the West Bank.  </P> <P> I am absolutely opposed to my tax dollars going for the support of a government  which flagrantly and willfully violates human rights.  </P> <P> It is now time for people of good conscience to make a clear statement to  Israeli government officials that they must try with every resource to work  towards a peaceful settlement of the dispute with the Palestinians on the West  Bank.  </P> <P> JOHN H. MILLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

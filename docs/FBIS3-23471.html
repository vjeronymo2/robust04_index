Demiral, together with Ankara Security Director Orhan  Tasanlar, showed to journalists, the room where six deputies,  who were arrested a day before, had stayed and the room in which  they were interrogated. [passage omitted]    Demiral said that the deputies were questioned on violating  Provision 125 of the Penal Code.    `Under Provision 125, crimes against the state do not  necessarily have to be armed attacks,' Demiral said. `The  illegal organization has a political flank and a military flank.'    Demiral refuted the claim of DEP defense attorneys that all  party telephones were tapped.    `This is not true,' he said. `Those that were tapped are the  ones that were used to communicate with PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] head Abdullah Ocalan and the organization's members.'</p>

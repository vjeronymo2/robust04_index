			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Troitskiy: "The Kremlin's Gift to </F> Chechnya"]    [Text] As soon as the leadership of the RF [Russian  Federation] expressed its readiness to regulate relations with  Chechnya, immediately the president of the insurgent republic,  instead of mutual compromises, burst out with a series of  extravagant accusations addressed at Russia. Aside from  imperialist ambitions, he also charged Moscow with being guilty  of "nuclear blackmail." The dialogue, without even having begun,  was disrupted. Why did Dudayev act in such an illogical manner?    Sudden interest in negotiations with Groznyy was sparked in  the Moscow upper echelons only after Ruslan Khasbulatov again  surfaced on the political scene. The federal bureaucrats were  thrown into such frenzy that they got tangled up in their own  strategy. There is an official plan for regulating relations  with Chechnya: Consultations with all the political forces in  the republic, holding elections of the bodies of power there  according to Russian laws, and then signing a treaty with the  publicly elected leaders. Such a position was announced in the  message of the RF President and in the decree of the State Duma.  It is adhered to by Sergey Shakhray, who was appointed head of  the Russian delegation at these negotiations. Another scenario  directly contradicts the official line, and it is being  supported by entirely official persons--Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and the president's chief of  administration, Sergey Filatov. They propose immediately opening  negotiations at the highest level--between Yeltsin and Dudayev,  and with no preliminary conditions.    The reason for such inconsistency by Moscow is simple: Those  surrounding Yeltsin have decided that the anti-Dudayev  opposition will be headed by Khasbulatov. Then he will become  head of the republic, and the treaty will have to be signed  specifically with him. In order to prevent such an  unpleasantness, the Kremlin is ready to agree to any concessions  to Dudayev.    But an embarrassing thing happened. Dudayev did not agree to  any concessions. He too, it is true, was also disturbed by  Khasbulatov's growing popularity, but the Chechen leader simply  declared--once again--Ruslan Imranovich as being an "enemy of  the people" and prohibited him from living in Chechnya. After  that, Filatov announced with puzzlement that he does not  understand why Dudayev is undermining the dialogue, and at the  same time expressed regret that they have still not been able to  exclude Shakhray from the negotiations. Since Dudayev had once  said that Shakhray also does not suit him, it turns out that the  Kremlin is ready to make further concessions to the Chechen  president in the hope that he will become more conciliatory.    The authorities of the "great power" are acting in a  surprisingly undignified manner. We get the impression that it  is Moscow which is begging for a union with Groznyy, while there  they are merely lazily waving away the annoying flirtations.  Then again, that is how it is. Dudayev did not demand either a  meeting with Yeltsin or a treaty with Moscow. He is entirely  satisfied with the existing state of affairs.    In the past three years, a "free economic zone" has  spontaneously been formed in the republic: First raw materials  and goods were freely moved to Chechnya, and then just as freely  went to the far abroad. In a parallel course, currency capital  comes and goes freely--with considerable profit for Groznyy and  without the slightest benefit to the Russian budget.    As long as the workers of the president's administration are  trying to persuade the Chechen general to engage in negotiations  and helping him to eliminate his competitors, Dudayev is  invulnerable. He can bargain forever, first breaking off and  then renewing the dialogue, and always imposing more and more  new conditions. Shakhray's plan of action presents a much  greater danger for the general: Dudayev will not win in a new  election, and Khasbulatov's chances are much more realistic. But  since it is specifically this circumstance which frightens  Moscow and introduces disorder into the ranks of the federal  bureaucrats, Shakhray's plan is unrealizable. Thus, Khasbulatov  has not yet returned to politics, while Dudayev has already  extracted maximum benefit for himself from this bugaboo.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / EC hints at shift in stance over Emu THE European Commission yesterday dropped hints that the deeper-than-expected recession in Europe may require a retreat from the strict economic performance targets required for European monetary union. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said cyclical economic factors and their impact on budget deficits may have to be considered in 1996 - the earliest date when a majority of EC states could vote to join Emu. He stressed the performance targets themselves could not be changed because they were in the Maastricht treaty. But he cited the example of a member state with a budget deficit of 3.5 per cent of national output, just above the 3 per cent target set down in the Maastricht treaty. If it could show its deficit was heading clearly downward to, say, 2.5 per cent of GDP, it would be well placed to qualify for Emu. Mr Christophersen's comments reflect a widely held view in Brussels that the poor prospects for growth make more likely a generous interpretation of the Emu 'convergence' criteria on inflation, budget deficits, and government debt. 'There is room for judgment,' he said, stressing that EC states at Maastricht rejected 'purely mechanistic' criteria for Emu. But in the same breath he said all countries that fulfilled the criteria in 1996 had not just 'a duty but an obligation' to apply for Emu. Under Maastricht, the Commission will present a report in 1996 on member states' economic performance in the run-up to Emu. But the final arbiters of who qualifies for the Emu club will be the member states themselves in the Council of Ministers.</p>

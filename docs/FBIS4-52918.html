			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter O Chung-sok from Moscow] </F>   [Text] North Korean loggers, who escaped from a timber  camp from Siberia, will likely arrive in Seoul in May.    A high-level Russian Government official said that "upon the  strong request from the ROK Government, relevant Russian  ministries have decided to allow five North Korean loggers who  currently hold legal residence certificates in Russia out of all  the loggers who have escaped from timber camps in Siberia, to  leave Russia for South Korea as soon as possible."    The official said that "because Russia has no legal basis to  prevent foreigners with residence certificates issued by the  Russian Government from traveling abroad, the Russian  Government's permission of their trip to South Korea is neither  a violation of domestic nor international law."    A relevant ROK Embassy official in Moscow said that "ROK and  Russian officials concerned are now discussing whether to allow  the five loggers to leave Moscow," and predicts that "they will  arrive in Seoul, though belatedly, later this month."</p>

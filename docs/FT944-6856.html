			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Tom Burns Few managers around the world have heard of Tom Burns, a former professor of sociology at Edinburgh University. Yet he created a string of concepts which have had an increasingly powerful international influence since he retired 13 years ago. They have improved western management practice immeasurably - and made millionaires of several famous American pundits who embroidered them. Burns, now 81, has written a new preface for The Management of Innovation, the pathfinding 1961 book which he wrote with GM Stalker, a psychologist. It has been reissued by Oxford University Press with a justifiably fulsome endorsement from Warren Bennis, one of America's best-known leadership experts. He describes it as 'a major classic' which was 'way ahead of its time' when published. Written in refreshingly plain English, it is a riveting read and brims with insight after insight. Yet it was based heavily on a relatively modest study of the human and organisational difficulties which established Scottish companies experienced when they tried to develop and make electronic products. The most significant breakthrough concept, much repeated since, was that machine bureaucracies of the type advocated by Max Weber (see last week's column) are far less effective at dealing with change and instability than what Burns and Stalker christened 'organic' forms of organisation. Closely allied new concepts, all of them far-sighted, were: That innovative organi- sations are 'networks', in which control, authority and communication flow not from the top, but to and from the greatest loci of expertise and knowledge within the organisation. That individual behaviour in an organic organisation is influenced more by a perceived community of interest with it than by any contractual relationship. In other words, to use today's jargon, 'shared vision and values' are vital. That lateral communication between people of different rank, resembling consultation more than command, is more important than communication up and down the hierarchy. That the most effective way of managing innovative projects is through multi-functional teams, led by the same manager from initial concept through to production and launch. That teams of different specialists - for instance from design, engineering and production - operate far more effectively if they 'live close together'  -or, to use modern jargon, are 'co-located'. As so often when breakthrough thinking originates in Europe, few American writers have given Burns and Stalker the enormous credit they deserve. Apart from Bennis, one of the exceptions is David Nadler, whose 1992 book Organisational Architecture has become one of the most influential analyses of all the interconnected complexities of how modern business organisations operate - or should do so. The reissued Burns and Stalker deserves to join Nadler on bookshelves on both sides of the Atlantic and further afield.</p>

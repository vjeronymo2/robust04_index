			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese adopt new rules on dividends JAPAN'S securities industry has adopted new dividend payment rules in an attempt to pull the stock market out of its continuing downturn, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. The Japan Securities Dealers' Association (JSDA) is to introduce rules forcing companies seeking to raise funds in the securities markets to make a three-year pledge to distribute at least 30 per cent of after-tax profit as dividend payments. The rules, which go into effect on April 1, are designed to make stock investment more attractive. The JSDA said companies currently distributed an average of 22 to 23 per cent of their after-tax profit as dividends. From April 1, a company which issues new stocks, convertible bonds or warrant bonds, must maintain its dividend-to-payout ratio at 30 per cent or more for three consecutive business years. Highly profitable and fast-growing companies, however, will be exempt from the new rules if their profit-to-capital ratio stands at 8 per cent or more and their dividend-to-capital ratio comes to 2.4 per cent or more. Currently, about half of companies listed on the stock exchange's first section meet the 30 per cent requirement. The names of companies that fail to honour their pledges would be made public, the JSDA said. New stock issuance has not occurred for nearly two years, amid the market's prolonged weakness, due to concern about the oversupply of stocks. Heavy equity-linked financing, conducted while neglecting the profits of share holders, has been criticised as one of factors behind the stock market slump. Investors, such as life insurance companies, have been urging a rise in dividends over the past year.</p>

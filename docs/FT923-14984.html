			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome doubts revived A SHARP bounce in the price of Wellcome was believed by some traders to reflect concern about the forthcoming share flotation. The shares jumped 21 yesterday to 877p, as some traders appeared to be covering positions in a hurry. One senior analyst commented that several marketmakers had left themselves short of Wellcome stock ahead of the proposed issue of between 25 per cent and 48.6 per cent of the Trust's shares. However, concern has grown that Wellcome Trust might decide that the current share price was too low and, therefore, might postpone the flotation. Such a decision would be likely to squeeze the share price up sharply, inflicting severe losses on dealers with uncovered positions. Some dealers perceived yesterday's buying as a rush to cover. However, a source close to the company said yesterday; 'With the book for share bids due to open on Monday it comes as no surprise to see the bears covering their positions.' Forte setback Hotels and leisure group Forte, already suffering from worries over the proposed sale of its contract catering arm, confirmed the market's fears after trading hours last night. The board announced that negotiations with Compass and ARA, prospective buyers for Gardner Merchant, the contract subsidiary, had been terminated. The shares closed a net 9 lower at 185p with 2.9m traded and traders predict a further heavy fall when dealing re-opens on Monday. A line of 1m shares is believed to be hanging over the market. Press reports, that the sale negotiations were about to collapse had already sent the shares into retreat early yesterday, making Forte the biggest loser in the FT-SE 100 index. Some analysts suggested that Forte had declined the Pounds 500m to Pounds 550m initially offered by Compass, hoping for a higher offer. Compass is believed to have tried to reduce its original offer because of the fall in the stock market. Also, it was expected to raise part of the funding for the deal by means of a share issue, which could have proved difficult in the current climate. Compass yesterday asked the Stock Exchange to lift the share suspension imposed at the end of May. Analysts were predicting a sharp decline for the shares on Monday. A holiday on Wall Street gave Glaxo Holdings a chance to pick itself up after a bad week and the stock was one of the most heavily traded in the London market yesterday. The shares were 17 down at 636p in early trading reflecting a sharp Thursday night fall in New York for the American Depositary Receipts. However, Wall Street was closed for a extended July 4 weekend yesterday and the disappearance of US sellers allowed the shares to rally in London and close 8 better at 661p on turnover of more than 8m. ICI recovered slightly after recent heavy falls, bouncing 4 to 1174p. Mention of ICI yesterday contained incorrect figures for the 1991 sales of ICI's headline drug, Tenormin. The correct figure was Pounds 660m with around Pounds 327m coming from the US. Banks made strong progress but gains owed more to marketmakers closing short positions than to genuine buying. Barclays put on 11 to 339p and NatWest 10 to 327p, closely followed by Abbey National which added 8 at 284p. The better showing by the equity market was behind the good performance of composite insurers where Commercial Union, said to have been recommended by Strauss Turnbull, the broking house, rose 8 to 476p. Royal Insurance rallied 3 to 214p and Sun Alliance put on 8 to 274p. British Gas retained its position as the most heavily traded stock in the energy sector, with the shares edging ahead 2 to 252p after exceptionally heavy turnover of 17m shares. The group issued an announcement to the market that it had told regulator Ofgas that it should earn a rate of return on its gas transmission business of 6.7 per cent and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Some specialists adopted the view that such a requirement would lead to a scrap with Ofgas which would ultmately mean the company being referred to the Monopolies Commission. Others in the market said that it was by no means certain that Gas would have any more to lose by seeking a MMC referral. British Petroleum, suffering the roughest of rides in the market since the resignation of former chief executive and chairman Mr Bob Horton two weeks ago, eased 2 to 210p with turnover reaching 12m shares. After the big slide in the BP share price many UK funds have been switching out of Shell and back into BP. Hints of a broker downgrade left Burmah Castrol 6 off at 583p. There was more big activity in Lasmo where the shares recently plummeted as the sale of its Californian downstream assets brought in less than had been expected before staging a strong rise on the back of takeover rumours. Suggestions in the market were that a bid had been lined up, but was pulled at the last moment. Lasmo shares were 7 firmer at 173p. Regional electicity stocks suffered profit taking, with the Electricity Package dipping to close 22 down at Pounds 3213. BT's elevation to the County 30 list of best buys and the passing of the deadline for the second payment on the partly-paid shares prompted a significant upturn in both classes of BT stock. The 'old' settled 9 higher at 343 1/2 p ans the 'new' 8 1/2 to 242 1/2 p. The building sectors included another major casualty in British Dredging where a profits warning led marketmakers to lower the shares by 38 to 80p. Heywood Williams, which earlier in the week shocked the market by issuing a similar warning, slipped 2 more to 269p. A profits downgrade by Kleinwort Benson is reported to have caused the decline in TI Group, which held a presentation at the securities house on Thursday. The shares fell 9 to 336p with a large line of stock said to be overhanging the shares. BAA added 10 to 670p following an analysts' presentation at Heathrow Airport yesterday. Shares in BM Group jumped 25 to 145p, after the company issued an upbeat trading statement and predicted an improved dividend. A change of view by one securities house gave a much needed fillip to Pearsons. The leisure and media conglomerate's shares, which have fallen more than 60p in the past two weeks rallied 15 to 375p. County NatWest reversed its short-term recommendation from sell to hold after deciding that the shares had run back too far. County believes the balance sheet is sound and there is positive news surrounding BSkyB in which Pearson has a significant stake. However, it is maintaining its recently reduced 1992 profit forecast of Pounds 181m, which is believed to be at the top of the range of estimates. Reed International also benefited from the improved sentiment surrounding Pearson. It firmed 8 to 523p. Carlton Communications fell 8 to 600p after the company's joint broker was said to have downgraded its profits forecast. Cazenove never comments on market talk but traders said it had trimmed its forecast for the current year's profit to Pounds 102m from Pounds 106m and for 1993 to Pounds 128m from Pounds 132m. One dealer said the cuts brought Cazenove into line with the rest of the market and the stock had been a very good performer over the past three months so a few people had taken profits.

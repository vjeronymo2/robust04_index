			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CINEPLEX ODEON PUTS OFF SHAREHOLDER MEETING TILL JUNE 6  </P> <P> Embattled Cineplex Odeon Corp. said today that it has postponed its annual  shareholders meeting until June 6, a delay of nearly a month.  </P> <P> The move from May 9 will give the company time to inform shareholders about  "certain events" that have happened since the original meeting circular was  mailed out, the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> Analysts believe that Cineplex Chairman Garth Drabinsky may be trying to raise  more than $664 million to buy outstanding shares and overall control of the  company.  </P> <P> Drabinsky last week called a truce in his bitter battle with Los Angeles-based  MCA Inc., a major shareholder, that was sparked by his attempt to buy a  controlling interest in Cineplex.  </P></p>

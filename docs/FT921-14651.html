			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Japanese derivatives to be reformed THE Tokyo Stock Exchange has announced that a task force will be established to 'reform' the country's stock derivatives markets, a move which could hurt foreign securities houses. TSE officials said they want to tighten control over stock index futures and options trading, which it claims are the source of violent price movements and enduring weakness in the cash market. Foreign securities houses have been particularly successful in these areas and lead their Japanese competitors in expertise. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, the TSE president and an increasingly strident critic of derivatives, said the futures market was designed for hedging purposes, but 'it has been used primarily for speculation' and has caused unnecessary disruption to the cash market. He said the taskforce, whose membership is yet to be decided, would be jointly established with the Osaka exchange (OSE), Japan's second largest, and is expected to recommend new controls and changes to format of the products. A UK broker welcomed the appointment of a taskforce in the belief that the TSE investigation will conclude that tighter controls are a mistake and that derivatives are not the cause of stock price weakness in Tokyo: 'It is better that they study the system than make rash changes.' Foreign brokers have already criticised Japanese exchanges' attempts to tighten control over stock index futures and options trading by increasing margin deposit requirements on three occasions last year. TSE officials had justified these moves by suggesting that the large trading volumes in these areas have 'confused' the cash market. Mr Nagaoka said the 'abnormal trading imbalance' was shown by the fact that daily average turnover for stock index futures on the TSE and OSE last year was Y2,300bn (Pounds 10bn), more than five times the amount of turnover on the Tokyo market's first section. He argues that the huge volume of arbitrage-related trading between futures and cash stocks is causing unnecessary price fluctuations, and that this volatility is discouraging participation by individual investors. The Tokyo market has been weak since the frenzied buying of late 1989, when the Nikkei stock average peaked at 38,915.87 and the collapse of Japan's financial 'bubble' is generally reckoned to have begun - the Nikkei average closed yesterday at 21,775.13. Investor confidence has been hurt in the past year by the spate of stock market scandals, by fears of a collapse in property prices, by concerns about the health of financial companies and, more recently, by a decline in business confidence that has accompanied the slowing of economic growth. The market downturn has badly bruised the leading Japanese brokers, which reported profit falls of 64 per cent and more for the first half to the end of September, but the Tokyo operations of some foreign houses have profited from their expertise in derivatives. Salomon Brothers, the US house, reported a 74 per cent increase in operating income for the first half. A heavy-handed attempt to control the derivative markets could become a source of trade friction between Tokyo and Washington, which has shown increasing anger at what it considers to be the unnecessarily slow pace of financial reform in Japan.</p>

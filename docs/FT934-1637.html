			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Farringford deficit lower Increased profits from the Farringford Hotel, its only active subsidiary, and lower head office overheads were behind the improvement at Farringford, the former soft drinks manufacturer, in the six months ended August 31 1993. The company reduced its trading loss from Pounds 151,000 to Pounds 51,000 on sales of Pounds 403,000 (Pounds 387,000). Operating profit of the hotel increased from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 103,000 and interest payable fell from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 39,000. Head office costs were shaved to Pounds 126,000, compared with Pounds 208,000. Losses per share came through lower at 0.21p (0.66p). Directors said that as the hotel's profitable period fell during the six months under review, they did not expect it to make a profit in the six months to February 28 1994.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Perstorp pays more as profits surge 45% PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, said yesterday that profits after financial items rose by 45 per cent to SKr330m (Dollars 41m) in the year to August 31, compared to SKr228m. The result includes devaluation gains of SKr66m, although this was partially offset by SKr40m in restructuring costs. The dividend is being increased to SKr4.80 per share from SKr4.55. The group said its North American units had a better year, thanks to a stronger US economy, but in Europe it had to continue rationalising as market conditions worsened. All six of the company's divisions achieved higher sales, helping group-wide sales to rise 17 per cent to SKr8.58bn. However, while the company's speciality chemicals, biotec, components, and Chemitec units all improved earnings, there were declines in plastic systems and surface materials. Plastics systems was hit by rationalisation costs, while surface materials suffered from the impact of a weak construction market. During the year, the group concentrated on strengthening its position in key markets, by acquisitions and by integrating recently-acquired companies in France and Germany. The company had lower financial expenses thanks to the drop in interest rates and currency-hedging measures.</p>

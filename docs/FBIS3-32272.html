			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 2 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria hailed the arrival of Rafael Caldera to  the Venezuelan presidency, and he urged him to continue the  binational integration process and overcome -- through frank  dialogue -- any obstacle.    Gaviria said in a message aired in Santa Fe de Bogota on  Wednesday on the occasion of Caldera's inauguration: "The  challenge of those who today received the Venezuelan nation's  helm, as well as of those who shall receive the leadership of  Colombia in seven months, shall be to preserve what has been  achieved and to attain what we still lack." The Colombian  president did not travel to Venezuela because President Caldera  did not invite any foreign presidents to his inauguration.    Gaviria noted that, now with Caldera as president,  "Venezuela  has a man of integrity, versed in public matters and with a  vision and leadership recognized throughout the continent, whose  serenity and experience will be the best guarantee that this new  administration will achieve significant accomplishments."    Upon insisting on the need to continue the two nations'  integration process, the Colombian president said, "the two  nations' futures are inexorably tied together. Never before has  the possibility been so close to make reality the dream of that  universal Venezuela that you and we respect so much -- Simon  Bolivar, the Liberator."    Gaviria acknowledged that the extensive shared border (2,000  km) creates frictions, "but what we must understand, Colombians,  as well as Venezuelans, is that the closer our ties and the more  extensive our cooperation, the greater shall be our  possibilities in successfully overcoming all obstacles."</p>

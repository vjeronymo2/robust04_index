			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta </F> remarks to journalists in Venice: "`Kidnapping Blue Helmets is  Serious; Nothing To Criticize in Russia's Behavior'"]    [Text] (ANSA) Venice, 14 April -- "This action against the  blue helmets, who are not part of the conflict, seems very  serious to me: I hope there is a change of heart."    That comment was made by Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino  Andreatta on being given the latest news from Bosnia concerning  action against the blue helmets. Answering journalists'  questions in Venice after the meeting of the CSCE troika,  Andreatta said that the fact that "the Pale government has  decided to break with the international organizations attempting  to separate the sides and, more especially, to deliver food and  supplies," is very serious. "Some 4 million Bosnians, Serbs,  Muslims, and Croats have benefited from food and supplies  throughout the winter," he added.    Andreatta went on to speak of Serbian threats against Italy,  pointing out that "the government has been instructed to reject  Belgrade's note protesting over the use of Italian bases by NATO  aircraft." "It is a well-known fact," Andreatta added, "that  making the bases available is part to our commitment to the  Atlantic alliance, and that the UN resolutions provide for the  use of force to defend UN troops deployed on the ground and in  the so-called safe areas."    "There is nothing to criticize in the Russian Government's  behavior" where Serbia is concerned, Andreatta said. "The  Moscow government," he stressed, "has hitherto acted in the  interests of peace, offering its services and putting pressure  on the Serbian Government to adopt a more prudent conduct."</p>

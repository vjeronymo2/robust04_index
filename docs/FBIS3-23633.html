This week  the newspaper KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI published a report from a  press conference held by Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General  Vitaliy Radetskyy: In this own words, Mr. Radetskiy wouldn't  want to have to liberate Crimea like the Americans did Kuwait.    This happened not long before the presidential elections in  Crimea. On the backdrop of the command-and-staff exercise held  by the Ukrainian Armed Forces from 24 to 27 January, the  general's uplifted spirits evoked a response from the Black Sea  Fleet press center. "The absence of such a desire on the part of  General V. Radetskyy (to transform Crimea into Kuwait.--Author)  inspires great hopes for maintaining peace and stability in  Crimea," read a statement by the Black Sea Fleet press center.  In this case "the Black Sea Fleet command doubts that the  general could become a Schwartzkopf, despite the fact that the  army has nurtured many handsome, young and promising generals.  Operation Desert Storm, which General Schwartzkopf led, occurred  in a totally different situation, and it had nothing in common  with the well publicized statement `Crimea will be Ukrainian or  a desert'." Moreover "the Desert Storm peacekeeping action was  carried out under a well-tuned command and control system using  common terminology, and it was supported by the  military-economic potential of 14 states. On the other  hand...the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have a unified command  and control system, and assimilation of military terminology is  one of the problems. The fact that participation of the  Ukrainian Armed Forces in the celebration of the 50th  anniversary of the liberation of Kiev was treated by the troops  as an exercise inspires confidence in their peaceful nature,"  the Black Sea Fleet press center subtly notes.    Another unique message came to Black Sea Fleet chief of  staff  Petr Svetashov in the form of a telegram from Ukrainian Navy  chief of staff Aleksiy Ryzhenko: "We will consider the Black Sea  Fleet marine brigade to be a FOREIGN FORMATION on Ukrainian  territory." "This `gift' is dedicated to the brigade's  exercises," explained acting chief of the Black Sea Fleet press  center Andrey Grachev to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. "It's as if we  don't have the right to conduct exercises without giving advance  notice to the Ukrainian side. But there isn't a single document  that foresees such a thing in relation to what is still the  Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet."    The Yalta agreement, which declared the Black Sea Fleet to  be  Russian-Ukrainian, and approved subordination of the fleet's  main command to two presidents, was and remains the sole legal  basis for actions of the Black Sea Fleet. To its deep misfortune  the staff of the Ukrainian Navy has no right to "consent to"  exercises or display any other such attention to units of the  Black Sea Fleet.    It is altogether difficult to count the number of "petty"  accusations that have been levied against the Black Sea Fleet by  Ukraine. Ask Black Sea Fleet commanders why they buy uniforms in  Russia, and watch their eyes pop out: "If Ukraine can't make  uniforms, are you saying we should go naked?' is the reply.  According to our unofficial data, by the way, General Radetskyy  himself bought eight pairs of uniform trousers for 8,000 rubles,  and is now going around in a Soviet officer's uniform.    By the way, the Black Sea Fleet itself gets little pleasure  from this "war." The Massandrovskiy Russian-Ukrainian Protocol  of 1993, which transfers the Black Sea Fleet to Russia in  exchange for cancellation of part of Ukraine's debts, has still  not been ratified. The Black Sea Fleet remains in limbo. Black  Sea Fleet servicemen are not protected by a single law, inasmuch  as "they don't belong" to either country, and Russian-Ukrainian  dual citizenship still doesn't exist. Despite all of this, 95  percent of the officers feel themselves to be Russian citizens.  Wages have not been paid to servicemen since December. But it  would be more than immodest to talk about the collapse of the  navy: The Black Sea Fleet took second place among all fleets of  the former Union on the basis of the year's results. Black Sea  Fleet ships proved their combat capability when they evacuated  60,000 refugees from Poti.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   At his first press conference Yuriy Meshkov, the newly  elected president of Crimea, announced that a referendum on  self-determination will be held in Crimea in March.    It became known to us from unofficial sources in Kiev that  in  response to such actions by the Crimean side, Ukraine will not  ratify the agreement to remove nuclear warheads from Ukrainian  territory.</p>

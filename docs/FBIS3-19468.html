			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault today invited the  German ambassador to Paris to attend the closing ceremony of the  event marking the 50th anniversary of the landing of the allied  forces in Normandy. At the same time, Girault confirmed the  wish for Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the celebration in  Caen on the evening of 6 June. He also informed State President  Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Girault  stated today after a meeting with Ambassador Juergen Sudhoff.    The German Embassy rejected reports by the French radio,  which claimed that Girault handed over an official invitation to  Kohl. "The mayor visited the German ambassador today and handed  him a personal invitation. There is no invitation for the  chancellor," Embassy Spokesman Andreas von Mettenheim pointed  out.    According to the French Ministry for War Veterans, which  organizes the ceremonies, a "final decision" concerning  Germany's possible participation has not yet been made. It must  be made at the highest government level, the organization  committee announced. The Elysee Palace and the Prime Minister's  Office have so far not commented on the issue.    Referring to his "demarche of conviction," the mayor of Caen  stressed the need to differentiate between the military events  in Normandy and the ceremony in Caen. "One cannot imagine  Helmut Kohl on Omaha Beach, but it would be quite natural for  him to shake hands during the ceremony at the peace monument in  Caen," Girault stated. [passage omitted]</p>

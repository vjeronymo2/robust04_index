			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: STILL HAUNTED BY HURRICANE FEARS  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My family is still suffering from the devastating effects of  the hurricane that destroyed our home this past year. I'm wondering how long it  will take to recover, if ever. My elderly father seemed to take it in stride,  but my two children (ages 5 and 7) still have nightmares. -- H.B.  </P> <P> DEAR H.B.: Studies indicate that most people recover emotionally in about a  year, although the trauma may last longer, especially for young children. Your  father's resilience is typical for people his age who seem to fare better after  natural disasters. Their wealth of experience and their attitudes toward death  and dying seem to give them some protection that younger people don't have.  </P> <P> Psychologist Bill Locke of Texas Tech University, who studied the aftereffects  of a Texas tornado, found that children were emotionally fragile. Even those as  old as 10 often regressed into clinging and infantile behavior, and there were  some residual effects that lasted into adolescence.  </P> <P> Survivors often suffer from headaches, stomach pains, bad dreams and flashbacks  of the incident. Fatigue is also common and this may last for many months as  families try to adjust to their losses. People get jumpy, tempers are more apt  to flare, and family violence increases. Disasters such as you've been through  remind us that we're not immortal and that compared with nature, humans are  very weak.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 10-year-old daughter is a real beauty and she knows it,  partly because people are always reminding her. I don't want her to be spoiled,  but it's hard to avoid it. Is there anything my wife and I can do to help her  develop into the well-rounded person we'd like to have as a daughter? -- M.A.  </P> <P> DEAR M.A.: Start now to provide some role models whose successes in life have  nothing to do with their appearances. Since she is beautiful, she has no need  to prove it or to use her beauty to compete. Avoid beauty contests and try to  encourage her to develop all of her talents. Build her confidence so that she's  willing to take intellectual risks.  </P> <P> One of the frequent problems that exceptionally beautiful people face is that  they realize at an early age that they don't need to develop their minds to get  along. Later in life the beauties often tend to feel inferior and to doubt  themselves. They begin to question whether people like them for themselves or  only as something to look at and display. If they feel they're only being asked  out as an object to impress others, they end up feeling cheated. Being  appreciated only as a lovely object is demeaning and destructive.  </P></p>

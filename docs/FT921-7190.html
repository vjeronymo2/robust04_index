			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Prudent innovator in third world development: Obituary - Eugene R. Black EUGENE R. Black, who died last week aged 93, will be remembered as a hard-boiled investment banker who used his talents to reduce economic misery in the third world. He served as president of the World Bank from 1949 to 1962 and is widely credited with having secured its place as the world's pre-eminent development institution. In 13 years he nearly doubled its membership from 48 to 80 nations, increased its capital base from Dollars 8bn to more than Dollars 20bn and made more than 300 loans to 60 countries. 'He played a central role in rebuilding Europe after World War Two', said Mr Lewis Preston, the current World Bank president. 'The prosperity of many nations is a result of work he did decades ago.' Mr Black used his skills as a bond salesman to secure the bank's access to capital markets. He also oversaw its transition from helping reconstruct war-damaged industrial countries to becoming a leading force for development in the third world. He expanded the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) by creating two new affiliates - the International Development Agency (IDA), which makes concessional loans to the poorest countries, and the Investment Finance Corporation (IFC) - the bank's arm for promoting the private sector. The tripartite structure has underpinned the World Bank's success for three decades. He established the bank as a leading provider of finance for specific investment projects in fields such as agriculture, industry and energy. The approach worked well in the bank's early years but was eventually criticised for failing to pay sufficient attention to the overall quality of a country's economic management. In the 1980s, Mr Black's successors thus complemented project loans with lending tied to broader structural economic reforms. Mr Black was born in Atlanta in 1898, the son of a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. He had a pronounced southern drawl and a reputation for bluntness and prudence. A graduate of the University of Georgia, he served in the US Navy in World War One before beginning a career in investment banking where he became known for his expertise in the bond market. In New York, he was a senior vice-president at Chase Manhattan bank before moving to the World Bank in 1947, initially as the US executive director. He remained active after retiring from the World Bank, serving as an emissary for President Lyndon Johnston in south-east Asia where he helped lay the ground for the creation of the Asian Development Bank. In the 1960s, he was a financial adviser to U. Thant, the United Nations secretary-general, and helped the UN collect Dollars 120m in unpaid subscriptions. He was also a chairman of the Brookings Institution, the liberal Washington think-tank, the author of 'The Diplomacy of Development' and a non-executive director of a sheaf of blue-chip companies.</p>

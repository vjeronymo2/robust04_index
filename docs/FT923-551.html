			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Political tensions mount in Caracas POLITICAL tensions have risen sharply in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, following an assassination attempt last Wednesday attributed to a radical group, the 'Bolivarian Liberation Forces'. The group has threatened to kill prominent figures, particularly politicians which they identify as 'corrupt'. The government of President Carlos Andres Perez has stepped up general security, and press reports say that a number of public figures have received telephoned death threats. The government also closed down two radio programmes, apparently for broadcasting opinions of callers who supported violent action against corrupt public figures. Through telephone calls and a communique to the media, the new radical group said it was responsible for the shooting on September 23 of Mr Antonio Rios, one of Venezuela's most important labour officials and a leading member of the ruling Democratic Action (AD) party. Mr Rios, who is also a member of the Chamber of Deputies, was jailed for nine days earlier this month on suspicion of influence peddling, but later released on his own recognizance. He is still under intensive care at a Caracas hospital. The president of AD, Mr Humerto Celli, at the weekend called for a strong government hand in repressing radical actions, and the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, which Mr Rio headed until recently, has threatened a violent reaction against its enemies. The confusion and alarm caused by the shooting come at a difficult time for the government, which faced five months of protests following an unsuccessful military uprising last February 4. University and secondary school students are expected to resume anti-government protests after classes fully resume this week.</p>

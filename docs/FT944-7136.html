			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Move to root out corruption in France Wide-ranging proposals aimed at stemming corruption in French political life were yesterday tabled by an all-party group of deputies in France's National Assembly. Among other things, the proposals would reduce the share of corporate cash in political party coffers, submit politicians to audits of their personal wealth and make it harder for them to hold national and local posts simultaneously, and increase transparency and controls on the awarding of public contracts. It is unlikely all 18 legislative proposals in the group's 650-page report would become law, even though representatives of almost all the assembly's 577 deputies sat in the group, chaired by Mr Philippe Seguin, assembly president. This fact did not commit parliamentary parties to backing the report, Mr Seguin said yesterday. The reforms could be debated by the assembly in mid-December, he declared. But the government is master of the parliament's agenda. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is reluctant to introduce new legislation on corruption, arguing the current investigations of senior politicians and company heads show existing anti-corruption laws are working. To avoid being accused in next spring's presidential election of being lax on the issue, Mr Balladur is likely to react to reforms which Mr Seguin said were aimed at 'helping dissolve suspicion of public officials and restoring confidence in democracy'. The premier has already given his backing to minor amendments to audit politicians' personal wealth and to reverse his own government's easing of the provisions of a 1993 law governing procedures on public contract awards. In one respect, yesterday's report goes less far than Mr Balladur, who said he was open to a total ban on corporate contributions to political parties for an experimental three years. The report suggests that the state could fund more political expenses and increase tax incentives for individuals to give more money to the party of their choice, so indirectly lessening the weight of corporate gifts. But one proposal would drastically change French politicians' careers by preventing them 'accumulating mandates'. At present, of the 577 deputies, 83 are also mayors of big cities, 22 preside over departmental councils and nine preside over regional councils. Under the proposed reform, they would have to choose either the national or local post.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Correction The owner of a second home in England or Scotland will be entitled to a 50 per cent discount from the council tax. Special rules applying in Wales mean that the district council can decide whether to apply a discount of 50 per cent, or 25 per cent, or none at all. An answer published last week about this issue was incorrect. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

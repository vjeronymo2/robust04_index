			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings on Indonesian oil - Industry executives are down in the mouth THE INDONESIAN oil sector is proving the adage that there are two sides to every story. Government officials are celebrating a record number of production sharing contracts signed with foreign oil companies. But at the same time the executives of the latter are looking increasingly down in the mouth about the industry's future in Indonesia. 'Something doesn't add up,' explained one company executive, head in hands. The figures compiled by government give the industry a rosy hue. Government officials say 22 production sharing contracts were signed last year, and a total of 61 in the last four years, more than during the most active periods of exploration in the 1960s and early 1980s. There have also been higher levels of seismic work: 84,000 sq km in 1990, more than double the average for the past 15 years. Such a level has not been reached since the initial broad seismic mapping of Indonesia between 1969-1972. With only 36 of Indonesia's 60 known basins so far explored, the country would appear to hold great potential. Talk to some of the oil companies, however, and a very different picture emerges. The last block to have reserves discovered in excess of 100m barrels was awarded in 1971, officials say. Production is dominated by seven large fields, some of which are reaching maturity. The majority of Indonesia's fields, however, are small and discoveries have not kept pace with demand. Oil executives say the level of drilling relative to the number of new contracts of work is low. In 1990 actual exploration and development expenditure of Dollars 1.26bn fell short of budgeted levels by Dollars 90m. The companies believe last year also saw an expenditure shortfall and that the government's target of 176 exploration wells a year, necessary for maintaining existing proven reserves, estimated at 10.9bn barrels, is not being met. Government officials say new technology may boost recoverable reserves and estimate that there are 20bn barrels with 'proven ultimate recovery'. However, neither enhanced recovery nor the assigning of new contract areas are expected to arrest a decline in output. The World Bank estimates current production (including condensate) at 1.6m b/d, but expects this to decline to 1.35m b/d by the turn of the century. With domestic consumption of about 520,000 b/d last year and increasing by at least 6 per cent a year, government officials concede that Indonesia will become a net importer of oil by 2005 and will have to leave the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Some industry officials believe the day of reckoning may be as early as 1997. Some of the problems facing the industry are intractable. The bulk of Indonesia's proven reserves lie in the western half of the archipelago where past exploration has been most intense. The future lies in the pioneer country of the Timor Gap and the seas and islands between Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. The geological structure of the area, however, is immensely complex - twisted rock formations crushed between two converging continental shelves. Potential fields are likely to be small and, even with three-dimensional seismic technology, the search for them will be a hit-and-miss affair. On the land mass of Irian Jaya, building pipelines from the interior to enable the export of production would be hugely expensive. Oil companies admit that tapping the oil fields of countries of the former Soviet Union is likely to divert funds from Indonesia for the immediate future. The problem is compounded, they say, by an industry wide shortage of funds. "Indonesia is getting a smaller share of a diminishing pool of finance,' one executive explained. The situation is worsened, he says, by contract terms which, particularly in relation to tax structure, are amongst the toughest in the world. Government officials discount many of the oil companies' complaints as simple posturing. They say conditions for deep water and pioneer areas have been relaxed and point to the high number of new contracts as evidence of the oil companies' commitment to Indonesia. The contracts, however, may be at the heart of the industry's problems. Whilst their conditions remain tough, the contracts have commited companies to relatively low levels of exploration; under the 45 contracts signed between 1987-1990, companies agreed to spend Dollars 2.8bn over a six to ten year period. The contracts have opened up new areas for exploration, but the financial commitments of the companies are unlikely to be adequate for the task. The contracts will prove difficult to renegotiate should the government wish to boost exploration and it may rue the decision to sign so many contracts so quickly. Company executives admit, however, that the government may yet get the last laugh. 'The oil companies have proven to be poor negotiators in the past. The Indonesians have tended to get the better of us,' one executive admitted. It need only take one big discovery to prove the government right.</p>

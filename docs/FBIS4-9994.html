			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Industry Minister Liliana Canale said Peru  will gradually resume its obligations with the Andean Pact. She  added that Peru has not returned to the subregional group, which  is also made up of Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador,  because Peru never left that organization.    She indicated that Peru is only resuming its obligations  with  the Andean Pact based on certain conditions. Among these, she  mentioned the fulfillment of the proposal made by Peru in the  meeting being held in Caracas. Our country requested the  elimination of any type of export subsidies as well as of the  distortions in external tariffs.</p>

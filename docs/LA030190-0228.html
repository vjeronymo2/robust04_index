			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CBS REINSTATES ANDY ROONEY; HE'S BACK ON TV SUNDAY NIGHT  </P> <P> CBS reinstated humorist Andy Rooney to its "60 Minutes" TV program today. He  said he'll be on Sunday's show with a commentary on the issues involved in his  Feb. 8 suspension.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased," said Rooney, whom CBS News President David Burke had  suspended without pay after a gay magazine quoted him as saying blacks had  "watered down their genes," a comment Rooney denies making. Originally, the  suspension was to be for three months, but the lifting of the suspension had  been widely expected in recent days.  </P> <P> Rooney said "I think it was a very difficult thing" for Burke to decide to  reinstate him early, and he praised the news division president. Burke never  specifically said why he suspended the 71-year-old commentator, and he did not  say today why the suspension was lifted.  </P> <P> Late last year, Rooney drew fire from gay and lesbian groups for saying in a  Dec. 28 CBS special that "homosexual unions" are among things that cause  "self-induced" deaths.  </P> <P> Since Rooney's suspension began, CBS has gotten more than 5,000 calls from  viewers, virtually all supporting him.  </P> <P> During his three weeks away from "60 Minutes," the program, while still  top-rated, has slipped in the ratings, dropping to 18th last Sunday when it was  beaten by a one-time rerun of ABC's hit "America's Funniest Home Videos."  </P></p>

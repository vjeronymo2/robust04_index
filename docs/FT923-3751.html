			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: GM enters US credit card market GENERAL MOTORS yesterday became the latest big industrial company to enter the US credit card market, with a competitively priced product christened the GM Card. The card, which GM says will offer rebates of up to Dollars 3,500 on the purchase of a GM car or truck, marks an unusual departure for the largest US motor vehicles group. Together with other new cards on offer from industrial companies, the GM plan could signal a competitive challenge for traditional bank issuers of credit cards. The GM card, issued in association with the Mastercard network, comes just a week after General Electric, the US conglomerate, unveiled plans to launch the GE Rewards MasterCard. Another company busy competing with bank issuers is American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), which offers the Universal Card. The GE card was criticised by some analysts last week because it carries a high interest rate of 18.4 per cent and an annual Dollars 25 fee. By contrast, GM offers a 16.4 per cent adjustable interest rate - current prime plus 10.4 per cent - and no fee. The average rate being charged to US credit card customers is 18 per cent. The GM card was described yesterday by Mr Michael Losh, GM vice-president in charge of North American vehicle sales and marketing, as 'a powerful and innovative marketing tool that can help GM and its products stand above the competition'. Mr Losh said GM would soon launch one of the biggest direct mail and advertising campaigns in its history, with more than 30m Americans receiving pre-approved GM card applications by post. Analysts reckon that GM, which lost Dollars 4.5bn last year and recently suffered a nine-day strike as it began seeking to pare its workforce, clearly needs new marketing tools. Using the GM card, consumers can earn a 5 per cent rebate, of up to Dollars 500 a year, accruable for seven years. This means that in seven years a GM cardholder could obtain a rebate of up to Dollars 3,500 on the purchase or lease of a GM vehicle. In addition, GM cardholders will be able to receive a 10 per cent rebate by using the card to buy goods or services from a group of GM corporate partners, such as MCI, the telephone system, Avis, the car hire company, and Marriott, the hotel chain. GE also offers rebates for customers who use the GE card for Sprint long-distance telephone calls or cable television services such as HBO and Cinemax.</p>

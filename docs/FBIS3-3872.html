The largest of the three is the Shenzhen International  Commercial Center, a cooperative venture between a Canadian  company and the bonded zone. It consists of two 48-story  buildings, one 20-story five-star hotel and a host of five-story  buildings, with a total floor space of some 180,000 sq km.    The other two projects are a Hong Kong-funded storage  building and the 30,000-sq-km Changbao Mansion.    According to official sources, the improvement in the  infrastructure of the bonded zone over the past three years has  drawn an increasing number of investors.    Statistics show that the 19 projects already started in the  zone involve a total of more than 5.5 billion Hong Kong dollars  in overseas investment.    Over 120 trading companies are ready to start business.    The head of the bonded zone said a series of  foreign-invested  projects are expected to be launched there this year.</p>

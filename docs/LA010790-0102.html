			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE / DON PENMAN;  </P> <P> BALDWIN PARK'S NEW MANAGER READY TO TACKLE BIG CHALLENGE  </P> <P> Not all of Don Penman's friends think coming to Baldwin Park is the best move  in the young administrator's career.  </P> <P> The previous city manager resigned under fire last May. In his wake, five other  top officials -- including the mayor, police chief and interim city manager --  have also departed.  </P> <P> Morale has been low. Money is short. And any hope of quick relief was squelched  in November when voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed increase in the  city's utility tax.  </P> <P> "Why would you want to go there?" they asked Penman, 38, husband, father of  two, Little League coach and Presbyterian church leader. "It's so unstable."  </P> <P> But after seven years as city administrator of San Fernando, where he is  credited with turning around a town that suffered many of the same problems  nagging Baldwin Park today, Penman is ready to scale new heights.  </P> <P> He is excited by the chance to manage a staff of 195 city employees, nearly  double that of San Fernando. There are 63,000 residents, more than triple San  Fernando's population. Yet there will be only $2.3 million in sales tax  revenues to work with, not even close to the $3.1 million generated by the tiny  community north of Pacoima.  </P> <P> "I would hate to go through life backing away from those challenges," Penman  said the other day in the trailer that has housed his office for the last two  months while San Fernando City Hall is being remodeled.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the four remaining members of the Baldwin Park City Council voted  unanimously to give him the chance after a sometimes frustrating seven-month  search, during which several interim candidates declined the job. Penman will  take over as city manager Jan. 29.  </P> <P> He will earn $86,500 a year, about $10,000 more than his current salary. He  will also receive a city-owned car, equipped with a cellular phone, to make the  40-plus-mile commute from his San Fernando Valley home.  </P> <P> "If he's the type of person who enjoys a challenge," said Mayor Pro Tem Bette  Lowes, "we can certainly provide it."  </P> <P> If he can do for Baldwin Park anything even close to what he's credited with  having accomplished in San Fernando, he'll be the town hero.  </P> <P> It's widely agreed that San Fernando was in a sorry state before Penman was  named administrator in 1982. The San Fernando Redevelopment Agency had just  lost $700,000 due to sloppy paper work, Penman recalled. And over the previous  three years, the city had been forced to use $1 million from its reserves to  balance the budget, leaving only $300,000 in emergency cash.  </P> <P> "He had his work cut out for him," said San Fernando Mayor Daniel Acuna. "There  was a total lack of leadership. City Hall was in such a sad state."  </P> <P> Penman, who graduated from USC in 1975 with a master's degree in public  administration and had served as deputy city manager in Simi Valley, set out to  clean house.  </P> <P> He got rid of several part-time department heads and replaced them with  permanent staff members. He bought new computers. And he tossed out the  antiquated telephones the city had been leasing and bought a modern system.  </P> <P> "A lot of that was just sound management," Penman said. "It didn't require a  lot of genius."  </P> <P> Then he launched the most ambitious redevelopment effort in the city's history.  Like Baldwin Park, San Fernando had grown into a predominantly Latino  community. Per capita income was falling. And the big stores that had been in  town for years started heading west toward more affluent suburbs.  </P> <P> Penman negotiated a deal that brought a Pace Membership warehouse and a Home  Depot to the site of the old San Fernando airport. A Jeep dealership came to  town. An industrial park opened. Plans for a new Tianguis store, part of the  Mexican supermarket chain owned by Vons, are now in the works.  </P> <P> With the sales tax revenues rolling in, a new senior center was built at one of  the city parks. A new police station was constructed. City Hall is being  renovated. And a new public library is slated to be built on the old police  station site.  </P> <P> "He was the first professional city administrator we had," said Councilman  James Hansen, who counts 41 separate projects completed or under way during  Penman's tenure. "If he had chosen the private sector, he would have been the  president of a company somewhere."  </P> <P> In fact, no one in city government seems to have a word to say against Penman,  a trim, athletic man with a hint of red in his hair inherited from his Scottish  grandparents.  </P> <P> Councilman Jess Margarito, who believes Penman has served the city well,  complains only that redevelopment sometimes came at the expense of human  services and housing.  </P> <P> "He's very fair and interacts well with people of all persuasions," Margarito  said. "But he's been a little slow to respond to quality-of-life-type issues.  He should have been a little more proactive in helping to envision answers for  some of our deteriorating neighborhoods."  </P> <P> Yet, as others in the community point out, there was such disarray when Penman  came on board that the basic building blocks of the city needed to be put in  place before other problems could be handled.  </P> <P> "He had to set the stage first," said Jose Hernandez, a city planning  commissioner and professor of urban studies at Cal State Northridge. "You have  to have a strong economic base before you can move into the area of social  needs."  </P> <P> Penman sees parallels between the San Fernando of the early 1980s and the  Baldwin Park of today. And for all the turmoil that has rocked his new city, he  is confident of being able to bring about some of the same changes.  </P> <P> "Despite all the uncertainty, I think the council really wants to put that  behind them and move ahead," he said. "I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm.  If that's what the council's looking for, that's what they're going to get."  </P></p>

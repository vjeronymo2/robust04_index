			<p>BFN     [Text] During the 81st International Labor Organization  (ILO) Assembly, which is being held in Genoa, Italy, leaders of  the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers (CGTP) yesterday  raised several charges against the Peruvian Government, among  which are the alleged curtailment of Peruvian workers' right to  join unions and a lack of measures to protect those who are  arbitrarily fired.    CGTP Secretary General Juan Luna Rojas was delegated to  speak  on behalf of the Peruvian unions' delegation before union and  government representatives from the entire world. Luna Rojas  reported that the government, businessmen, and the military have  in Peru established a kind of "political triumvirate" that seeks  to "make more flexible" labor legislation, "to the detriment of  workers."    Luna Rojas said: "We are obliged to condemn the main  guidelines of the antilabor policy currently being enforced by  the Peruvian Government against Peruvian workers."    After charging that the Peruvian Government is violating the  agreements signed with the ILO, Luna Rojas criticized Decree  Laws 25593 and 25921; legislative Decree No. 728; Law 26279; and  the enforcement of the Private Pension System and the Welfare  Regulation Office [Oficina de Normalizacion Previsional] (ONP),  which as of January 1995 will be in charge of paying retirement  pensions.    Regarding Decree Law 25593, Luna said that it encompasses  several measures that prevent workers from exercising their  union rights, such as requiring a high number of people for  establishing unions; the possibility of closing unions through  administrative procedures; preventing trainees from joining  unions; requiring a one-year seniority on the job in order to be  a union leader; and forbidding unions from meddling in political  affairs.    In addition, Luna said that for the first time in Peru, this  decree law establishes that collective bargaining agreements  expire after one year, which implies the elimination of all  rights established through labor agreements.    He stated: "In so doing, workers are compelled to negotiate  all benefits every year. Nevertheless, if workers choose to  strike, this law empowers the government to issue a resolution  cancelling the strike, ordering the workers to immediately  return to their jobs, and ordering the Labor Ministry to respond  to union demands."    Some of the regulations included in Decree Law No. 25921 and  questioned by CGTP Secretary General Luna Rojas encompass  employers' unrestricted power to change schedules, working  hours, and working days; to suspend or replace workers' loans;  to change working conditions; and finally to fire employees.    Luna Rojas said: "According to a regulation included in this  decree law, if within 15 days the Labor Ministry does not issue  a ruling on a request submitted by the employer, it is  automatically approved."    According to CGTP sources, more labor violation charges will  be raised in today's session, but this time they will center on  violation of ILO agreements by Peru.</p>

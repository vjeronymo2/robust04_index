			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Clinton seeks ways to boost economy and cut deficit GOVERNOR Bill Clinton yesterday set out to 'establish a good working relationship' with Congress in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill with leaders from both parties, focusing on health care and the best way of combining an economic stimulus with a reduction of the budget deficit. The US president-elect began with his own Democratic party leaders, in his second meeting with the majority leaders since the election. He then saw Sen Robert Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, and meetings were also scheduled with powerful individual congressmen such as Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who has dominated US tax policy for the past 12 years as chairman of the ways and means committee. Congress has in recent years developed a reputation as an institution hamstrung by autocratic committee chairmen, incapable of passing needed legislation, and prone to the perquisites of power. Mr Clinton's election may open the way to more effective action, but a new study published yesterday by two of Washington's most influential think tanks, the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution, suggests more reforms are needed to the way Congress does business. 'We think effective policy-making requires a strong president and a strong Congress,' said Mr Thomas Mann of Brookings. The problems of Congress reflected the weakness of party leaderships and their lack of control over the setting of a policy agenda as well as debating structures that 'put a premium on cheap shots,' he said. Mr Mann and Mr Norman Ornstein of AEI urged the party caucus meetings of the House of Representatives in December to give a mandate to each party's leaders, and especially to the Speaker, to set a policy agenda. Policy making in the early months of the administration will be crucial. Mr Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, has taken a four week leave of absence to join Mr Bill Clinton's economic transition team. The team, directed by Mr Robert Reich, a Harvard professor, plans to prepare a series of detailed economic position papers to give Mr Clinton the information he needs to make swift decisions when he assumes the presidency in January. Mr Summers, a leading candidate for chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, will work on macroeconomic and fiscal policy options. Others in this field include Mr Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, Mr Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs and Mr Roger Altman of the Blackstone investment bank. Other economists and associates have been assigned specific tasks during the transition. Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California, is overseeing technology policy and manufacturing industry. Most of Mr Clinton's economic appointments seem likely to be drawn from the team working on policy options. He may cast the net wider for top posts such as Treasury Secretary, for which Mr Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman, may still be in the running.</p>

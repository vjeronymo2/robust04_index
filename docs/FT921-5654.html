			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading still slow MONEY market rates remained little changed after a quiet day's trading caused by continuing political nervousness. There was, however, no repeat of the liquidity problems seen on Friday. While the overnight market had been uneasy at the outset, with early estimates putting the shortage for the day at Pounds 1bn, money soon cheapened as the market moved quickly to sell out the gap. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of around Pounds 900m, and took out much of this as it purchased bills worth Pounds 800m for resale to the market on March 23 at 10 7/16 per cent. At midday, the shortage was revised to around Pounds 1bn, and the Bank compensated by purchasing Pounds 130m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 70m of band 2 bills, both at 10 3/8 per cent. When the forecast was revised upwards again to Pounds 1.15bn, the Bank bought a further Pounds 120m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 10m of band 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of Pounds 60m. As a result, overnight rates, which had earlier topped 11 per cent, first eased to 10-9 3/4 per cent, and later dropped as far as 5 per cent late in the day, before lifting to close around 9-8 3/4 per cent. Period rates, meanwhile, showed little change is expected in the basic market situation before the Budget on March 10. Most traders had already decided there would be no base rate cut until then, and some now believe there may be no cut before the general election. The key three-month interbank rate was unchanged at 10 3/8 -10 1/4 per cent. The March short sterling contract dropped six points to 89.72. German call money rates remained at 9.55/65 per cent despite a sharp rise in reserves. Traders said the liquidity that had left the market on Wednesday for pension payments largely flowed back on Thursday, but the market was uncertain about the timing of employee wage payments. In the US, the Federal Reserve injected reserves into the system through overnight repurchase agreements. The federal funds rate came under pressure from the settlement of two- and five-year note auctions, with funds trading at 4 5/16 per cent at the Fed's operations time, above the presumed 4 per cent target.</p>

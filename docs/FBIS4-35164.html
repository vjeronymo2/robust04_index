			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish on 22 Jun,  pages B6-B7, carries a 1,200-word report by Paul Neil Herrera  Guerra on a workshop held by the Andean Parliament on 24-25 May  in La Paz, Bolivia, entitled "Framework Law for Money Laundering  and Legalizing Capital."    Among the experts of the region who addressed the event was  Luis Lamas Puccio, who spoke for Peru on the problem of money  laundering. The workshop recommended that the legalization of  capital should be classified as a crime. He said this move  should not be applied solely to drug trafficking money, but also  to money obtained from other crimes. A series of mechanisms to  identify this crime were made, as well as recommendations on  bank secrecy to prevent banks and financial institutions from  laundering ill-gotten money. It was also suggested that  institutions controlled by banking, insurance, credit, and  capital markets laws, together with enterprises engaged in  construction, real estate, the marketing of vehicles, precious  stones, and metals, and money exchange should help the  government to identify ill-gotten assets. Mechanisms to control  the marketing of real estate were also proposed.    As for money laundering, the workshop recommended the  drafting of a framework law based on OAS regulations regarding  this crime, leaving each country of the region free to classify  the crime and adopt punishments. Lastly, it was recommended  that this framework law should include mechanisms, compatible  with those of other countries, for the confiscation of assets  obtained through money laundering and the legalization of  capital, even at the request of another country.</p>

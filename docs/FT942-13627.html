			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Time to think of England Today is St George's Day, when English patriots wear red roses in their buttonholes and those who relish free food, and fungi in particular, scour grassy verges, pastures and bosky borders in search of Tricholoma gambosum. Known commonly as mousseron in France, and St George's mushroom in England, this pale fungus with its strong, mealy smell and taste is supposed to be available by now - although sometimes you have to wait another week or two to bank on finding it. When you get your pickings home, saute them in butter, season them with lemon and black pepper and bathe them in reduced cream. Serve them on fluted rounds of toast, spoon them over oeufs en cocotte, or use them as a rich sauce (more vegetable than condiment) for pasta or to partner grilled chicken. With any luck, this weekend could also see the first of the season's really tasty, outdoor-grown Jersey Royal potatoes (rather than those grown under glass, highly-priced and low on flavour). Today, if I can get them, I shall simply rub the Jersey Royals clean, boil or steam them, and serve them with a celebratory rack or two of succulent Kentish lamb or hot boiled ham cooked on the bone. It must be proper, meaty ham, of course, with a decent covering of fat into which a smear of mustard and toasted breadcrumbs can be pressed after cooking. A creamily-delicate parsley sauce (laced with a few capers, perhaps) would go well with the ham. With the lamb, I might offer red currant jelly warmed enough to melt it, with a spoonful or two of chopped fresh mint stirred in and left to set again. Tomorrow, the cold cuts could be served with one of my favourite potato salads. Slice a bulb of Florentine fennel wafer thinly and steep the raw slivers in lemon juice and olive oil. Just before serving, add plenty of hot, freshly-boiled and thickly-sliced salad potatoes (Jersey Royal, La Ratte, Charlotte, BF 15 or Pink Fir Apple, according to season), some whole black olives, and a green snowstorm of snipped chives. Toss gently to mix and serve while the potatoes are still warm. After the Jerseys, it will not be long before delicious, home-grown fresh asparagus comes on stream. Fat bunches - served with unstinting quantities of melted butter and a sprinkling of Parmegiano-Reggiano, or olive oil and lemon, or Hollandaise sauce - make a luxurious and ultra-simple first course. More affordable, and still celebratory, is the lesser-known trick of teaming English asparagus with Jersey Royals to make a gratin. ASPARAGUS AND POTATO GRATIN This can make a lunch dish for three people, a first course for four or an accompaniment to lamb, veal, chicken or poached salmon, when it will serve up to six. The asparagus can be increased to 1lb and the potatoes reduced to  1/2 lb. Ingredients:  3/4 lb fresh asparagus;  3/4 lb Jersey Royal potatoes; 1/2 oz butter plus extra to grease the dish; 1 x 200 g (7 fl oz) tub of creme fraiche; 1 egg yolk;  1/2 oz freshly grated Parmegiano-Reggiano; 1/2 tsp each sugar and paprika; generous 1 1/2 oz ciabatta breadcrumbs. Wash and trim the asparagus, scraping the stalks if tough-skinned. Save the woody bases for the stock pot. Cut the rest of the asparagus obliquely into 1 1/2 in lengths and reserve the tender tips separately from the stalks. Rinse and rub the potatoes clean with your fingers but do not peel them. Cut them into chunks, slice very thickly or leave whole, depending on size. Drop the potatoes into a pan of fast-boiling salted water and cook for about 10 minutes. Steam the asparagus over the potatoes - about eight minutes for the stalks and four for the tender tips should cook them through, yet retain a hint of crunch. Allow longer, or less, for very well-cooked or crisp results. While the vegetables are cooking, melt the butter in a small frying pan. Add the crumbs and stir continuously over low heat until coloured and crisp. Beat the egg yolk with the sugar, paprika and a good seasoning of salt and black pepper. Mix in the creme fraiche and about two-thirds of the crumbs. Butter a gratin dish generously. Spread about half the cooked and mixed vegetables across the base of the dish and spoon half the sauce over them. Cover with the remaining vegetables, then the rest of the sauce. Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan, then the reserved crumbs. Cover the dish with a dome of foil, and heat through on a pre-heated baking sheet at 425'F/220'C (gas mark 7) for 10-12 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for two-three minutes more to crisp the top.</p>

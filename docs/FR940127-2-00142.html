			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. Applicants also request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d), of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares, and waive the CDSC in certain instances. The amount of the CDSC charged will vary, depending on the length of time shares have been held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. The CDSC typically will range from 4% to 6% (but can be higher or lower) on shares redeemed in the first year of purchase and will be reduced, typically at a rate of 1% per year over the applicable CDSC period, so that redemptions of shares held after that period will not be subject to a CDSC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares purchased in connection with the reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount which represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, a redemption will be made first of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions, second of shares purchased prior to the CDSC period, and third of shares purchased during the CDSC period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. The Portfolios will waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) following a shareholder's death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, (b) in connection with distributions from an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan following death, total or permanent disability, or reaching retirement age, and (c) in whole or in part in connection with shares sold to: (i) Customers of Mellon Bank Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliates (``Mellon Bank Corp.''), and The Boston Company, its subsidiaries (including The Boston Company Advisors, Inc.) and affiliates (``The Boston Company''), (ii) directors and officers of the Funds, and (iii) employees and retirees of Mellon Bank Corp., The Boston Company, the Distributors, and FRIMCo, as disclosed in the registration statement for the class.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants seek an exemptive order to the extent that the Multi-Class System might be deemed to (a) result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (b) violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 18 is intended to prevent investment companies from issuing excessive amounts of senior securities and thereby increasing unduly the speculative character of their junior securities, or from operating without adequate assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Portfolios' existing assets or reserves. Nor will the proposed arrangement increase the speculative character of the shares of a Portfolio since all shares will participate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all of a Portfolio's income and expenses, with the exception of Plan Payments and Class Expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and will not discriminate against any group of shareholders. Further, since all shares of a Portfolio will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference or priority in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences will respect to particular assets, and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC is fair, consistent with the policy and provisions of the Act, and in the best interest of those shareholders on whom it is imposed. Shares sold subject to a CDSC will be designed to permit the investor to purchase shares without the assessment of a front-end sales load, and at the same time permit the Distributors to pay securities dealers selling shares of a class a commission on the sale of those shares. Proceeds from the CDSC will be used in whole or in part to defray the expenses of the Distributors and of the selling broker-dealers relating to providing distribution-related services to the investor choosing those classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the requested order is granted, applicants agree to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

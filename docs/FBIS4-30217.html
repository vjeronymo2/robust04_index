			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A blue-ribbon government  panel issued a final report on revision of the insurance law  Friday [24 June], easing the way to settlement of the  controversial "third- sector" issue in Japan-U.S. trade talks.    The Finance Ministry "should take measures in line with the  report" submitted in June 1992 that called for special treatment  on the timing for lifting the ban on the sector so as to protect  foreign-affiliated and smaller insurance firms, the insurance  council said in the final report.    Japan currently allows only foreign-affiliated insurers to  sell so-called "third-sector" policies covering casualty,  diseases and nursing, that combine the benefits of both life and  nonlife insurance policies.    With the 1992 report allowing both Japanese life and nonlife  insurers to enter the new sector, U.S. negotiators have demanded  a five-year postponement at ongoing resumed bilateral  "framework" talks on the insurance business.    The final report gives Japanese negotiators the flexibility  to decide on specific dates as the ministry moves to submit  bills next year which would otherwise lead to the implementation  of revised laws in the fall of 1997.    The third sector "can become a panel issue which the  administrative side alone can't judge," Hiromi Tokuda, chairman  of the advisory forum to the finance minister, told reporters.    But uncertainties remain over an agreement in the trade  talks  as a ministry official, requesting anonymity, said Japan is  insisting on lifting the ban in two years and the issue is  expected to remain on the table "until the last moment" while an  overall agreement on the insurance field is pursued.    The advisory panel has been working on concrete steps based  on the earlier report to revise insurance-related laws for the  first time in five decades.    As with the third-sector issue, "staged" implementation is  the main feature of the final report's 10-point proposals to  spur competition through deregulation while taking measures to  protect policyholders.    The panel called on the ministry to first liberalize the  insurance system, including mutual entry by life and casualty  firms into each other's business fields "through subsidiaries,"  along with "quick legislation" of such measures as "solvency  margins" and new management-checking systems to secure  "soundness."    The solvency margin is a barometer of assets and risks  similar to the capital-adequacy ratio for banks.    As the next stage, the forum wants the government to allow  insurance firms to enter banking and other business areas  through subsidiaries, after "ascertaining" the effects of the  initial stage.    The ministry will submit bills only for the first stage next  year, while reserving the second stage, a ministry official said.    As for other issues such as allowing banks to sell insurance  policies, the panel decided to continue its discussions.    Other proposed new measures to check management include  obliging disclosure under a set law, giving a right even to one  policyholder to take representative action at mutual companies,  and adopting a "fire wall" between parent firms and subsidiaries.    Japan's life insurers are all mutual companies which  policyholders serve as stockholders. But the report paved the  way for conversion to joint-stock companies, and also for mutual  life insurers to issue bonds to procure funds.    As the mainstay to protect investors, the panel proposed  establishing a nonprofit industry company similar to the banking  industry's deposit insurance company to aid financially troubled  insurance firms.    On deregulation, the forum recommended partial freeing in  setting policy premiums and allowing insurance brokering.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: UBS acts to curb Ebner's voting power Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, is proposing to convert all its registered shares into bearer shares in a thinly disguised attack on Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group. BK Vision, an investment company controlled by BZ, is UBS's largest shareholder, and has built up an 18 per cent stake in the registered shares worth about SFr1.2bn (Dollars 930m). The UBS move will considerably dilute the voting power of this class of shares. The registered shares have a par value of SFr20, thus giving an investment in them five times the voting power of the same investment in the SFr100 bearer shares. The bank said its move was to prevent single holders of registered shares, representing a minority of the share capital, from getting 'excessive influence'. UBS is proposing to reduce both classes of shares to a common SFr10 par value, thereby equalising their voting power, and to eliminate restrictions on foreigners voting. The bank said the registered shares were created in 1975 to prevent foreign control of the bank. It said the spread between the recent prices of the registered shares and bearer shares had 'resulted in complaints by large private and institutional investors'. Mr Ebner said yesterday that the UBS move to dilute registered shareholders' voting rights appeared to be a serious attack on Swiss securities law. He was confident it would not succeed. At yesterday's closing prices, the registered were at a 34 per cent premium to the bearers. BK Vision has had several skirmishes with UBS. Last week, the Zurich commercial court ruled in favour of BK's claim that UBS had illegally violated shareholder rights by creating pools of capital that could be used at the board's discretion for acquisitions or convertible bond issues.</p>

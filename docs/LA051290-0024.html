			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 118: CHAOS IN SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> * DEEPLY FLAWED REAPPORTIONMENT INITIATIVE NO ANSWER TO GERRYMANDER  </P> <P> Most self-appointed reformers who would change the way the state Legislature  redraws its district boundaries -- and those of U.S. House seats -- seek to  remove the reapportionment function from the Legislature altogether. Usually,  they try to create a supposedly nonpartisan commission to do the job. Wary as  voters may be of the lawmakers revising their own district lines after each  census, they also have been dubious about the commission idea.  </P> <P> Proposition 118, an initiative measure on the June 5 ballot, would attempt to  reform the system while keeping reapportionment with the Legislature itself.  But that does not mean it would overcome the Legislature's built-in tendency to  draw safe new districts that tend to perpetuate members in office. Proposition  118 is deeply flawed for many reasons and should be rejected by the voters.  </P> <P> The major feature of 118 is to require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for  the approval of any redistricting plan. Presumably this would produce fairness  by preventing the majority Democrats from drawing lines at will, subject only  to a governor's veto threat. Proponents argue that Proposition 118 would  require the Democrats to draw a plan that is fair to Republicans so that it  could get the GOP votes needed to pass.  </P> <P> But Proposition 118 would not necessarily prevent a gerrymander. One possible  outcome could be that Republicans will unite to kill any Democratic  redistricting plan. Or more likely, Democrats will draw enough safe Republican  districts -- eight or so would do the trick -- that they would attract the GOP  votes needed to achieve the two-thirds majority. This could create a  gerrymander as distorted as any drawn under the present system.  </P> <P> Other features of Proposition 118 make it even more cumbersome and likely to  lead to legislative paralysis. The initiative would give the governor an  absolute veto, with no opportunity by the Legislature to override. And even if  a plan got by the governor, it would automatically be submitted to the voters  at a referendum in the next statewide election. If the referendum failed, the  whole issue would be thrown into the courts.  </P> <P> The process established by Proposition 118 would almost guarantee constant  legal uncertainty about the composition of the Legislature. As much as some  critics attack the record of achievement -- or lack of achievement -- of the  Legislature under current conditions, the chaotic situation created by  Proposition 118 might well assure a legislative body virtually incapable of  legislating.  </P></p>

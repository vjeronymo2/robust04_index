			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome tension increases UNCERTAINTY continued over the price likely to be set for the issue of 330m Wellcome shares by Wellcome Trust, the medical charity which holds 73.5 per cent of the equity. There is a growing feeling in the market that the issue price will be around 850p when the tendering for shares ends on July 24. Observers said bear raiders have brought the share price down to a level regarded as more appropriate by the market and institutions. Yesterday, the stock eased a penny to 877p and traders expect the shares to remain in a tight trading range during this account. Institutional investors are said to be bidding for the issue at a 2 to 3 per cent discount to the market price. Some said the discount could be as high as 5 per cent, implying a strike price around 835p. A strike price of 850p would allow the stags to buy the issue, so as to sell again when trading starts. This prospect would disappoint Wellcome, which had hoped that using a tender process rather than the traditional discounted price method would allow a fair market value to be established. However, the company is believed to be satisfied with the level of interest in the UK. Properties bounce The bounce in the stock market was mirrored in the maligned property sector, which has hit a 30-year relative low, according to securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. On this evidence, selected stocks seemed to find a floor yesterday as UBS, among others, advised clients to buy. British Land put on 8 to 183p, MEPC 3 to 261p and Slough Estates 11 to 136p in busy turnover in the normally neglected sector. Property issues have underperformed the market by 25 per cent this year alone, with falling asset and land values, together with declining rental returns, and well-publicised crashes, all adding to investor unease. The sector relative now stands at 49.9, the first time it has gone below 50 since the FT-Actuaries Indices were first published just over 30 years ago. Fresh evidence of the hill that share prices have to climb also emerged yesterday, the Richard Ellis Monthly Index showing a near-16 per cent fall in rental values to June 1992, including the biggest monthly fall recorded - 2.4 per cent - in June alone. Reuters strong News and information organisation Reuters climbed 28 to 1169p as buyers moved in ahead of half-year results due next Tuesday. US investment bank Goldman Sachs was said to be buying heavily. Upgrading the group, Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite forecast profits of around Pounds 190m, against Pounds 170m previously, and said the company's cash holdings are likely to have grown to around Pounds 650m from Pounds 500m. He also forecast dividend growth of about 15 per cent. He added: 'The two new trading products, Dealing 2000-2 and Globex, are technical successes. Around 83 per cent of Reuters' revenue is outside the UK, so it is relatively unaffected by national recessionary worries. The stock feels very firm and it could easily return to the 1200p level.' L &amp; G upset Disappointing new business figures for the first half of the year from Legal &amp; General, the UK's third largest life assurance group by market capitalisation, saw the shares slide in an otherwise firm life sector. The stock has underperformed the life sector in recent weeks as the market anticipated poor new business numbers and some analysts cast doubts on hopes of an increase in the dividend this year. There is also concern in the market about continuing problems in the mortgage indemnity business, which left L &amp; G with a Pounds 121m underwriting loss in 1991. The shares slipped 8 to 346p in 2.2m turnover. British Petroleum was in the vanguard of the market's rally. The shares at first fell below the 200p mark, and then stabilised before driving ahead in the wake of determined US buying interest. Aiding the recovery was a positive note by County NatWest. The broker said that much of the bad news has now occurred, with oil prices down and analysts' profits estimates sharply reduced. The broker also noted that the market had probably factored in a 50 per cent cut in the dividend, and it anticipated a 40 per cent reduction. County said that for once Shell Transport 'looks more vulnerable than BP in the short term'. BP shares regained 6 1/2 to 207 1/2 p on good turnover of 8.5m, while Shell eased 2 to 480p. Standard Chartered added 7 at 425p amid relief that the Isosceles refinancing had been completed. TSB dipped 4 to 144p as profit-takers moved in after recent bid speculation. There was no knock-on effect in life assurers after the slide in Legal &amp; General. Lloyds Abbey moved up 11 to 387p, Refuge, reporting new business figures on July 22, rose 7 to 683p, while Prudential, announcing similar data a day earlier, edged up 3 to 252p. A gloomy annual meeting statement from Courtaulds and continuing profit forecast cuts from analysts hit the shares, but they picked up later to close only 4 off at 498p. Hints that Cadbury- Schweppes had been hosting bullish presentations in Europe added to the glow surrounding the stock this week. The shares gained 7 to 481p. Argyll remained firm ahead of today's agm, rising 4 to 359p. J. Sainsbury was also resilient; Hoare Govett reported positive noises from the company on current trading and upgraded its current-year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 735m. Hotel group Forte found little early support as a large seller in the market, adverse press comment and a BZW downgrade all helped the shares crumble 8 to 162p. They later recovered to close 2 off at 168p in hefty turnover of 5.1m. Talk of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into compact disc prices undermined Thorn EMI, which tumbled but climbed back to end 4 off at 799p. Turnover in business services group BET rose to 7.2m after the company announced a Pounds 200.7m rights issue to be used to redeem USDollars 380m of BET's USDollars 500m Auction Market Preference Shares. The shares lost 4 to 129p, but sentiment was helped by a BZW recommendation. Johnson Matthey was wanted ahead of today's annual meeting, firming 4 to 415p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (14).

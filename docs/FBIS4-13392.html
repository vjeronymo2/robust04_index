			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--A vessel carrying Canadian newsprint and  unprocessed sanitary paper for the Jordanian market Monday  became the 13th ship denied entry to al-'Aqabah this year by the  U.S.-led naval force patrolling the Red Sea, shipping officials  said.    The interception comes amid stepped-up contacts by Jordan to  put an end to the damaging inspection of all al-'Aqabah-bound  vessels as part of enforcing the 45-month-old international  sanctions against Iraq.    Jordan, which is staying away from formal participation in  the U.S.-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations until the  blockade of al-'Aqabah is lifted, is exerting efforts with  France, Britain and other countries in an effort to prevent  further economic losses caused by the costly delays resulting  from the Red Sea inspections.    It is estimated that Jordan lost $1.2 billion in extra  charges levied by shipowners on freight to Aqaba because of the  uncertainties over the fate of Jordan-bound cargo at the mercy  of the inspectors backed by the U.S. navy.    Beyond the economic losses, Jordan has said, that the  inspections and delays are deliberate harassment aimed at  pressuring the Kingdom to make sweeping illogical concessions to  Israel in the peace talks.    His Majesty King Husayn reaffirmed this week Jordan's stand  that the Kingdom's participation in the peace porcess was  contingent on an end to the siege of Aqaba. He said that while  Jordan remained committed to a negotiated peace in the Middle  East, the Kingdom refused to be targetted for pressure and  mistrust and "humiliated as a people" and still be expected to  play a positive role in the peace process.    The King also said there were "positive" signs that the  problem was being addressed. Diplomats here believe that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is reportedly  expected in the Middle East in the last week of April, might  bring with him an American answer to a proposal to replace the  sea-based inspections with on- shore checks at al-'Aqabah by a  neutral, international agency such as Lloyds Register of London.    Reporting on the latest interception, shipping officials  said  Monday that the Ikan-Seleyang [name as published], which is  carrying 4,000 tonnes of paper cargo for Jordan, was intercepted  Sunday evening by the naval force patrolling the Red Sea.    The vessel was boarded and inspected after an overnight wait  at the Tiran Straits at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and the  inspectors ruled that they did not have accessibility to inspect  not only the Jordan-bound cargo but also others stowed in the  ship's holds, the officials said.    The Ikan Selayang was waiting at the straits as of Monday  evening while the ship's agents and other concerned parties were  in touch with the Bahrain headquarters of the U.S. Central  Command, which is directly in charge of inspecting all  al-'Aqabah-bound vessels, they said.    If the efforts did not succeed to have the ship proceed to  al-'Aqabah, then it would head for Dubai, where the Jordan bound  cargo would be unloaded, they said. This would mean another  ship picking up the cargo from Dubai and ferrying it to  al-'Aqabah, leading to a full sea-freight to be paid by the  importers.    In turn, the importers will reflect their extra cost on the  actual market prices of the product, and the consumer will end  up paying the price for the inspection, the shipping officials  noted.    The Ikan Selayang was the 13th ship to be blocked by the  U.S.-led inspectors this year, compared with a total of 20  during 1993. More than 1,700 ships were closely inspected among  20,000 hailed over the radio and over 8,500 actually boarded,  but until now no vessel was found to be carrying any  "contraband" cargo headed for al-'Aqabah in violation of the  sanctions against Iraq.    A ship carrying bagged detergents for Jordan was turned away  on April 8 by the inspectors. The vessel had to proceed to  another Red Sea port to rearrange cargo for inspections. It was  allowed to proceed, and it docked at al-'Aqabah on Sunday, a  10-day delay resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in losses.    "The situation is getting out of hand," said Sufyan  Muhaysin,  manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents Association. "Don't think  the country can take it anymore. The losses are mounting and  importers are turning away from using al-'Aqabah as much as  possible in order to avoid the high freight costs."    Shipowners apply extra charges of $1,000 per 40-ft.  container  and $500 per 20-ft. container and $15 to 20 per tonne of loose  cargo bound for al-'Aqabah to offset their losses resulting from  the delays and diversions to other ports. The cost of  transshipment has to be borne by the importer if the ship was  forced to offload Jordan-bound cargo at other ports.    Mr. Muhaysin said: "We hope Secretary Christopher would  bring with him a solution to the problem. Otherwise, the  situation is going to be worse."    Following King Husayn's March 28 notice to the five  permanent  members of the U.N. Security Council that Jordan was suspending  participation in the peace process, the various U.S. departments  involved in policy-making and enforcement were to have met on  the proposal to move the inpections to the port of al-'Aqabah  and to authorise Lloyds Register to conduct the inspections.    No details have emerged on how Washington was responding to  the proposal.</p>

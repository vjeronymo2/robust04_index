			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Philips, KPN join Graff in pay-TV venture Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and KPN, the Netherlands' recently-privatised telecommunications operator, are to enter the European pay-television market in a joint venture with Graff Pay-Per-View, a US company. The three companies plan to start services in pay-per-view television to European cable operators in September. Pay-per-view, which allows viewers to choose programmes and pay only for what they see, is seen as the next advance for Europe's cable operators, and for telecommunications operators seeking a move into entertainment. All the main operators are conducting trials, aiming to offer a full video-on-demand service. Analysts said the Philips-led joint venture would have more impact on the Dutch market with its 95 per cent cable penetration. But this is mostly narrow-band capacity without advanced inter-active services. In the other main European markets, the venture faces strong competition from established operators and programming providers. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Graff, one of the largest US providers, appeared to have failed to establish itself as a prime pay-per-view provider in the UK, where satellite and cable operators are expected to contract directly with programming providers. Philips, eager to bolster its 'new media' presence, will own 45 per cent of the venture, with KPN holding 35 per cent and Graff the remaining 20 per cent. The companies declined to give financial details, but KPN said its share would run into tens of millions of guilders. Graff, which operates 11 channels of pay-per-view television in the US and delivers programmes to cable operators with a combined audience of more than 10m subscribers, said: 'We are confident the new company represents the perfect alliance to respond to the needs of European consumers for new media services.' Graff will bring to the venture its experience in buying and licensing programming from Hollywood and the rest of the US entertainment industry. Philips owns stakes in the infrastructure of cable television networks in the Netherlands, Austria, France and Belgium. The three companies said that a number of European cable operators had already expressed interest in working with the joint venture. KPN, which was partially floated on the Amsterdam bourse in June, has a 76 per cent stake in Casema, a Dutch cable operator with 1.2m subscribers. Casema is planning to start pay-TV and pay-per-view in and around The Hague and Utrecht in early 1995, as part of a partnership with the new joint venture. The potential 400,000 subscribers in these two Dutch cities would be offered several pay-per-view channels, with viewers paying per film or per event, as well as several pay-TV channels in return for a monthly subscription charge.</p>

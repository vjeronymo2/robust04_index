			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> GIRLS' DIVISION I;  </P> <P> LESLIE SHAKES OFF ILLNESS, BERKELEY  </P> <P> Senior center Lisa Leslie shook off the effects of an undetermined illness  Saturday night to lead Inglewood Morningside High School to its second  consecutive State Division I girls basketball championship.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-5 Leslie, who was taken to a hospital after the game as a  precautionary measure, had 35 points, 12 rebounds and seven blocked shots as  Morningside held off Berkeley, 67-56, at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </P> <P> "She was feeling bad enough where we thought about not letting her play,"  Morningside Coach Frank Scott said. "I kind of left it up to her. She wanted to  do well in her last game."  </P> <P> Leslie, who said she felt weak, nevertheless was at her best late in the game  after Berkeley cut a 17-point, third-quarter deficit to 52-49 on a three-point  shot by guard Vikki Horne with 4:45 left.  </P> <P> Leslie responded with four consecutive baskets to build Morningside's lead to  60-51 with 1:45 left. She scored 13 of the Lady Monarchs' final 15 points,  mostly from close range against the Yellowjackets' smaller front line.  </P> <P> Morningside (32-3) was the only Southern California team to win one of the five  girls state finals.  </P> <P> Tanda Rucker scored 25 points for Berkeley (31-2). Janet Davis added 14 points  for Morningside.  </P></p>

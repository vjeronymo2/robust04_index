			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Brooke says Ulster talks may start soon MINISTERS and Northern Ireland's main political leaders yesterday said round-table talks could start soon but were unable to set a firm date. The outcome of talks between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and the party leaders in Belfast undermined hopes that anything other than a symbolic first meeting could start before the election. Mr Brooke expressed optimism that talks could start 'as soon as possible'. However, in spite of the optimism created by the unexpected deal between Unionist and nationalist leaders late last week on resuming talks, it appears significant details have still to be worked out. Mr Brooke will meet Irish ministers on Friday when he will set out the Northern Ireland parties' positions and test whether any fresh conditions they may have proposed for talks are acceptable to the Dublin government. The local leaders also want written assurances from Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, that talks will continue on the same basis whatever the general election result. A starting date of next Monday for talks seems improbable. The talks, which collapsed in July, are unlikely to restart in earnest until after the election, which is expected to be called by the end of next week. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland clergymen who met Loyalist paramilitary leaders last month said they would be prepared to meet representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, in the interests of peace. Separately, Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, said on BBC Radio that he would not be surprised if individual priests were meeting the IRA 'because of the tremendous desire for peace there is in all sections of the community.' However, he stressed that the church would not act as political intermediaries.</p>

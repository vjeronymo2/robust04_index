			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Innocenzo Cipolletta, director general of </F> the General Confederation of Italian Industry, by Vittoria Siva  in Rome; date not given: "We are Asking the Government To Free  Up the Market"]    [Text] Rome -- The government is in the fullness of its  powers: the new labor minister has already begun a dialogue  with employers and trade unions. And immediately the debate on  social problems -- formulas for creating new jobs, systems for  making both hiring and firing more flexible, suggestions for  reintroducing and increasing the wage limits, which disappeared  25 years ago -- has been rekindled. "We will judge the  government on the facts," Confindustria [General Confederation  of Italian Industry] and the trade unions have repeated so far.  Now that the scenarios are becoming clear, we will attempt to  analyze them with Confindustria Director General Innocenzo  Cipolletta.    [Siva] With regard to the Berlusconi government,  Confindustria has moved from a position that was so independent  as to be interpreted as diffident to "confident expectation."  Have you changed ideas?    [Cipolletta] No. We remain convinced that we made the right  choice in insisting on the association's independence. But I am  not slow to admit that we have had certain difficulties in  communicating effectively the meaning of this line. The country  has a history of collateralism which has given us the habit of  interpreting every taking of a position as a tactic. Moreover,  in a substantially bipolar political situation, a Confindustria  which is independent from the majority line-up has automatically  been seen as tipping in favor of the opposition line-up.    [Siva] Hence the story of an old grudge between  [Confindustria] Chairman Abete and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi  is not true?    [Cipolletta] No grudge. Even if a few years ago, when  Confindustria sounded the alarm on the perverse effects of the  escalator clause, Berlusconi took a different position,  considering as negative any measure which could depress  consumption. But today I am convinced that our independence is  an advantage which also strengthens the government's  independence vis-a-vis Confindustria.    [Siva] Will it be easier or more difficult to hold a  dialogue  with new Labor Minister Mastella and new Industry Minister  Gnutti?    [Cipolletta] It is a positive fact that they belong to a  line-up which has based its program on principles inspired by  liberalism: fewer shackles on corporations' activities in the  labor market; less state presence in the economy. This is a  philosophy which we share. And we believe that from now on there  will be no alibis for not applying any of the liberal choices  for which the electorate voted in the present majority.    [Siva] What do you think of the scant enthusiasm with which  various government exponents judge the past cooperation between  trade unions and enterprises?    [Cipolletta] The cooperation policy since the second half of  the 1970's was essential in providing weak governments with a  sufficiently broad basis of consensus in Parliament. Today,  with the new parliamentary system, the government is not forced  to share its choices. This means that the method of cooperation  with the social partners will have to be based essentially on  mutual information: The government will consult us and will  then have to make its own decisions.    [Siva] When disputes come to a head, however, recourse to  the  government makes it easy for you and the trade unions. Perhaps  in order to obtain an avalanche of early retirements.    [Cipolletta] I do not deny that it has made it easy for  everyone. However, I would say that today many company crises  have been resolved or are in the process of being solved, and  that the social partners are more mature. If I could give a  word of advice to the government, it would be to send out a  message of confidence specifically on the maturity of companies  and trade unions, beginning by saying that they need to resolve  the problems on their own. If any of us thinks that they can  always count on an understanding government, no one will devise  solutions.    [Siva] Renewal of public and private contracts, the labor  and  job markets, privatizations. Which of these problems needs to  be solved most urgently?    [Cipolletta] Privatizations. In recent months this process  has been held up by obstacles of an ideological nature, either  in the name of the defense of national interests, or in the name  of industrial democracy, which in fact reveal the rejection of  market rules. As to the renewal of labor contracts, the most  difficult are those in the public sector, which are a true test  of the government's desire for innovation. I would hope that  the trade unions realize, after 40 years of protectionism, that  if public workers are given increases, the administration will  have to fire people. If then the trade unions decide to go into  battle, with agitation in the public services, the risk for the  country is high.    [Siva] And the renewal of private sector contracts?    [Cipolletta] In many sectors where exports are doing well,  there will be room for a salaries policy.    [Siva] Do you believe that increasing the number of jobs by  1  million in a couple of years is credible?    [Cipolletta] According to Confindustria's estimates, a 1.6  percent increase in GDP in 1994, 2.8 percent in 1995, and 3.4  percent in 1996 could create around 700,000 new jobs. But the  forecasts can also be higher, within a short time period, if,  alongside the recovery of the economy, rules are enacted which  make the labor market more flexible. If companies can hire  people without the requirement to hold labor in any event, even  when faced with a hole in the market, their readiness to  increase employment will be even greater.</p>

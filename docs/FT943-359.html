			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Arco joins Venezuela in oil development scheme Arco International Oil and Gas has signed a letter of intent with Corpoven, a subsidiary of PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, covering the development of a heavy oil project requiring total investments of Dollars 3.5bn. The plan is to produce and upgrade heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt for export, reaching shipments of 200,000 barrels a day by 2004. The Orinoco Belt, located north of the Orinoco River, holds the world's largest known reserves of heavy oils and bitumen. PDVSA, which estimates reserves in the belt at 1,200bn barrels, has assigned strategic importance to developing this heavy oil potential. Arco, a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield of the US, and Corpoven plan to upgrade heavy crude oil through a new industrial process to a lighter, more valuable oil, and later blend the product with other Venezuelan crudes. Exports are to be aimed mainly at US markets.</p>

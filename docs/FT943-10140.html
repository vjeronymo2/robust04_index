			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Negative equity worries Hopes of negative equity - when the value of a mortgage is greater than that of the property - conveniently becoming a thing of the past were unsettled this week with the publication of a new report which found that house prices may need to rise by as much as 15 per cent to eliminate it. The report, issued by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, was based on interviews with home owners in Bristol, Luton and Glasgow. It found a quarter of those with negative equity owed more than Pounds 10,000 above the value of their homes. Although negative equity has been associated with first-time buyers, the report found that more than a third of those surveyed were buying their second or subsequent homes. Most were aged under 40, and many were in professional or managerial occupations. A big factor in the creation of negative equity has been mortgage equity withdrawal, where borrowers raise cash by securing it against the value of their home. As house prices increased strongly in the 1980s, many homeowners increased mortgages to finance home improvements, buy furniture, or even holidays, believing that the capital value of their home had risen sufficiently for them to be able to afford it. Negative equity is not a problem for everyone. Those who are happy with where they live need not be concerned about notional values, so long as they maintain mortgage payments. It only becomes a problem for those who want to move. Your lender If you do not have enough capital to move, the first step is to talk to your lender. Some banks and building societies have structured schemes but since individual circumstances vary greatly, it is worth approaching your lender even if the scheme does not appear to match your needs exactly. All lenders stress that only those with a good payments record are considered. Most schemes are in the form of a loan larger than the value of the property to be bought. Abbey National, Halifax and Nationwide will all lend 125 per cent of the value of the new home. The maximum negative equity portion is Pounds 25,000; Halifax says that the average negative equity among its borrowers is Pounds 6,000-Pounds 7,000. Abbey National says that, in some circumstances, it is prepared to allow borrowers to rent out their existing homes for short periods - usually six months - in the hope that house prices will have risen by enough to reduce or eliminate the negative equity. It usually charges a 2 percentage point premium on the second mortgage but this is waived for those with negative equity. Anyone considering this, should seek professional advice about the tax implications. Other lenders Few lenders are prepared to help borrowers other than their own. Those that do include Centrebank, the direct banking arm of Bank of Scotland, and Household Mortgage Corporation. Centrebank offers a combination of a 100 per cent mortgage on the value of a new property, supplemented by a loan. The mortgage is charged at the Bank's standard variable rate, currently 7.64 per cent. The interest rate on the loan is two percentage points above the bank's standard variable rate to a maximum of Pounds 30,000 or 20 per cent of the value of the mortgage, whichever is lower. The maximum combined mortgage and loan is Pounds 300,000 and there is a Pounds 200 fee, which can be added to the borrowing. The scheme is only available to those earning a minimum income of Pounds 25,000 a year or to a working couple earning Pounds 20,000 each. Centrebank says the scheme is not confined to those with negative equity but is also open to anyone wanting to make a purchase but lacking the cash for home improvements. The structure of the HMC scheme is similar but the interest rate on the loan element is higher than Centrebank's. The 100 per cent mortgage is at the lender's standard variable rate (currently 7.69 per cent) or at fixed rates of 4.99 until January 1996 and 7.69 until mid-1996. The loan portion, which is for a maximum of Pounds 7,000 or 10 per cent of the mortgage, is charged at a variable interest rate, currently at an annual percentage rate of 24.7. It is payable over 10 years or over the life of the mortgage but it can be converted into a further advance after five years and charged at the mortgage rate. The fee for the scheme is Pounds 200 and it is open to those earning Pounds 10,000 a year. The maximum mortgage is Pounds 150,000. Other measures If you do not need to move immediately and can afford to pay more than your monthly payments, one way of protecting against negative equity is to pay off the mortgage more rapidly. The least efficient way of doing so is by paying extra every month. Instead, tell your lender you want to make lump capital repayments, so that the lender reduces the capital sum sooner rather than later. Home Owners in Negative Equity.

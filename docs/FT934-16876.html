			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swiss Re lifts earnings to SFr281m SWISS Reinsurance has reported a 5.6 per cent rise in net earnings to SFr281m (Dollars 197m) for 1992 and has proposed a share split and rights issue to raise SFr575m. The group, the world's second largest reinsurer after Munich Reinsurance, said gross premiums rose by 25.6 per cent last year to SFr21.9bn. However, about half of the growth in gross premiums came from changes in the scope of consolidation, mainly from including Elvia's figures for the first time. Net premiums rose 27 per cent to SFr20.7bn. The underwriting loss in non-life business soared by 43 per cent to SFr1.12bn, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Andrew and a generally 'unfavourable experience' in the insurance business. Hurricane Andrew cost the group SFr500m. On the other hand, the underwriting income in life insurance jumped 38 per cent. Financial income was 11.9 per cent up to SFr2.06bn. The management board has proposed splitting the company's SFr100 nominal registered and bearer shares at the rate of five for every one share held, and also converting the SFr20 nominal non-voting participation certificates into registered shares. These moves are similar to those made by other quoted Swiss companies following a change in company law last year. Swiss Re said the changes would promote liquidity of its share trading. The board is also proposing opening its share register to foreigners, but limiting all shareholders to a maximum of 3 per cent of the registered share capital. This too follows a trend aimed at overcoming the unhappiness of foreigners with being disenfranchised, while preventing hostile takeover bids. The rights issue will be on the basis of one new bearer or registered share, following the splits, for every 10 shares or participation certificates held. The price, expected to be about SFr475 a share, will be set on November 24. Swiss Re said that the funds would be used 'to support the growth in business anticipated for 1993 and subsequent years'. In August, the group joined with John Head &amp; Partners, a New York merchant bank, to create a new company, Partner Reinsurance, to specialise in natural catastrophe insurance. Swiss Re will contribute Dollars 100m to the Bermuda-based venture.</p>

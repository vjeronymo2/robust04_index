These amendments are necessary because the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Code on which many of these regulations are based has been amended. This proposal would make the changes necessary to align these regulations with the IMO Code and to clarify certain provisions in the existing regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before August 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council, (G&hyph;LRA/3406) (CGD 82&hyph;058), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

Coast Guard regulations based on this code were put into effect May 3, 1979 (44 25986), Since 1975, the Gas Carrier Code has been amended four times: April 19, 1978 (see Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) XXXVIII/22), May 8, 1979 (see MSC XL/26), May 20, 1980 (see MSC/Cir. 284), and June 14, 1983 (see MSC/Cir. 356).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IMO's amendments to the Gas Carrier Code include corrections and clarifications, incorporation of standards for new or novel containment systems, improvement of the carriage requirements for several of the more hazardous cargoes, expansion of the list of chemicals to which the code applies, and revisions to align the Gas Carrier Code with the ``International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC) and the ``International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefield Gases in Bulk'' (IGC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These amendments were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Bulk Chemicals, the body responsible for maintenance of the Code. The Coast Guard actively participated in the development of these changes to the Gas Carrier Code by submitting position papers when the amendments were proposed. This rulemaking would revise the Coast Guard regulations in 46 CFR part 154 to reflect these amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the most notable revisions would be the inclusion of standards for internal insulation tanks in new &sect;&sect;154.454 through 154.458, as well as in several existing sections. These standards would be included in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 154 would be revised to include carriage requirements for seven cargoes previously regulated only under 46 CFR part 153. The cargoes are diethly ether, a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide containing not more than 30% ethylene oxide, isoprene, isopropylamine, monoethyamine, propylene oxide, vinyl ethyl ether, and vinylidene chloride. These cargoes are being added in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Far-right arrests in Italy ITALIAN police yesterday arrested Mr Franco Freda, a well known right-wing extremist, on charges of organising a neo-Nazi party and of racism. At least six other people were detained in different parts of the country. Organising a neo-Nazi or fascist party has been a crime since 1952, but it is the first time legislation, approved last month, to clamp down on racism has been used. The arrests suggest the authorities are taking seriously the threat of organised attacks against immigrants and incitement to racism, especially in the light of developments in Germany. In the past year some 300 actions by right-wing extremists have been reported. Mr Freda recently founded the National Front, which magistrates believe is run from Verona. He was acquitted in 1985 of involvement in one of Italy's main unresolved terrorist incidents, the bombing of Milan's Piazza Fontana in 1969 when 17 people were killed and hundreds wounded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Addressing a recent provincial auditing work  conference, both Governor Fu Xishou and Vice Governor Wang Yang  stressed the following: Developing a socialist market economy  requires enhancing the supervision of auditing; auditing organs  should devote attention to doing a good auditing job at  financial, monetary, and government departments, at key  enterprises, and in the areas of fixed assets investment and  funds for agricultural investment, so as to ensure a sustained,  fast, and healthy development of the national economy.    Wang Yang noted that last year various levels of auditing  organs stepped up effective auditing of financial and taxation  departments; key enterprises; grain enterprises; overall  investment funds for agriculture; new basic construction  projects; and grain procurement funds; they thus made a positive  contribution to accelerating Anhui's economic development and  won the praise of the provincial CPC committee and provincial  government.    Wang Yang pointed out: This year marks the most intensive  introduction of new reform measures in 14 years of implementing  the policy of reform and opening up. Therefore, when arranging  this year's auditing tasks, auditing organs must perform their  auditing tasks from the perspective of helping to establish a  socialist market economic system. The main auditing targets for  this year include auditing financial and monetary departments;  key enterprises; auditing of fixed assets investments;  agricultural funds; foreign investment funds; and government  departments.    Wang Yang pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously  promote the establishment of auditor offices to meet the  requirements for establishing a socialist market economy.  Auditors offices can fulfill a useful function by helping to  transform enterprises, checking enterprises' finances and  inventories, determining property rights, sorting out debts,  assessing property, and verifying corporate shares. Auditor  offices can also fulfill a great function by helping to  understand problems at Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative  enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, an can  improve enterprises' management, raise efficiency, and protect  their legitimate rights. Therefore, all levels of auditing  organs are required to support auditor offices and step up  supervising, providing guidance, and managing auditors offices.    To do an efficient job, Wang Yang said auditing departments  must study well, do a good job in reforming their departments,  explore new auditing methods, and understand the important  points of the economic structural reform.    Lastly, Governor Fu Xishou raised three requirements. First,  he said developing a socialist market economy requires  strengthening supervision through auditing. Supervision  through auditing is an indispensable part in our efforts to  build a socialist legal system. The establishment and  improvement of a socialist market economic system needs to be  standardized and protected by a sound legal system and,  therefore, requires us to enhance and improve the administration  of justice and the enforcement of administrative and other laws.  It is very important to exercise supervision over the  enforcement of auditing laws. Second, the governments at all  levels should further enhance their leadership over auditing  work, support auditing organs to independently exercise the  right of supervision over auditing work according to the law,  support subordinate auditing organs in reporting their work to  superior auditing organs, support auditing organs in solving  problems, and proceeding from the requirements for ensuring the  healthy development of the economy, provide guidance to auditing  organs to carry out major auditing work. Third, it is necessary  to step up the building of the contingent of auditing workers,  to further raise the auditing quality; to maintain and encourage  honesty, fairness, strictness, and the spirit of dedication, to  firmly foster a consciousness of subordinating themselves to and  serving the central task of economic construction, to further  improve their work style, and to enhance their dedication and  sense of responsibility so as to fulfill their tasks splendidly  and ingeniously.</p>

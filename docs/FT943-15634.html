			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Bingham urges civil case changes Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, yesterday called for judges to be given greater control over the management of cases to cut costs and delays which dog the English civil-justice system, Robert Rice writes. Lord Woolf, the law lord who is conducting a review of the civil-justice system, has suggested the creation of 'procedural judges' to control the conduct of cases up to trial. But Sir Thomas, England's most senior civil-court judge, said pre-trial control should be by the trial judge. It was important for the same judge to be in charge throughout. Giving the 1994 Justice Lecture in London, Sir Thomas said passing responsibility for case management to the courts would result in a need for more judges. The cost of this should be offset by time savings if trials became shorter and simpler. It would also result in a diminution in the role of the final trial, which would become something closer to the low-key affair common in Europe. If that could be achieved the savings in costs would be enormous, he said. The suggestion of making judges responsible for case management came under attack yesterday in the Law Society's Gazette. Mr Rowland Williams, a solicitor, said that with 30,000 new seriously disputed cases filed in the Queen's Bench each year, effective court monitoring of cases was 'light years beyond the state's resources'. Mr Williams also noted that if the cost of litigation could be reduced in this way to levels acceptable to the public, the state could never hope to handle the explosion in litigation which would follow.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / US military team speeds Somalia aid A US military team arrived in Kenya yesterday to prepare for a big airlift of food into famine-plagued Somalia, as a top United Nations official appealed to the Somali people to help resolve security problems impeding the international relief effort. The 33-member team from the US defence department arrived at the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa in a C-141 transport aircraft. In the next couple of days it will set up a base for shifting 145,000 tonnes of food in Somalia, where an estimated 1.5m people are at risk of starvation. Aid officials have expressed surprise at the sudden speed with which the Bush administration has reacted, stung by criticism of inadequate relief efforts so far. The details of the airlift are still to be fleshed out, although at least 10 military transport aircraft will fly food to Wajir, in northern Kenya, and to unnamed destinations inside Somalia. The US has no relief personnel in Somalia to help ensure effective food distribution. But Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's special envoy in Somalia, paid tribute to the US effort.</p>

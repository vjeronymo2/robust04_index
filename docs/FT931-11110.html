			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet groups sidestep publicity MR JOHN MAJOR met senior colleagues yesterday for his first full discussion of the pit closures since his return from India and the Gulf. The small group of ministers most involved, however, is not in Downing Street's updated list of cabinet committees, since it is counted as an ad hoc group rather than a formal committee. The same is true for the group under Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, which has been set up to look specifically at unemployment and possible employment measures. Instead, the only two new committees listed are EDX, the public expenditure committee, which is chaired by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, and the group on refugees from the former Yugoslavia, which is chaired by the home secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke. EDX comprises Mr Lamont, Mr Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary; Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords; Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons; Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister; and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary. The refugees group comprises Mr Clarke; Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary; Mr Newton; Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary; Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary; Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary; Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary; Mr John Patten, the education secretary; Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary; Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary; Mr Portillo; Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general; Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister; and Mr Charles Wardle, a junior home office minister.</p>

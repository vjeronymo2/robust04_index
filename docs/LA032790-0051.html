			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL'S HOUSE FIRE WAS SET, INVESTIGATORS TESTIFY  </P> <P> The trial of an Antelope Valley water board member accused of setting afire his  Lancaster home began Monday with arson investigators testifying that the fire  at the trash-strewn home appeared to have been set intentionally.  </P> <P> Glenn Martin, 67, a 14-year elected member of the Antelope Valley-East Kern  Water Agency was charged with a single count of arson in the fire last July.  </P> <P> Over the past 14 years, the former World War II fighter pilot has had several  of run-ins with Lancaster officials over junk accumulating on his property, for  which he has been convicted twice under the city's nuisance law.  </P> <P> Martin, who is acting as his own lawyer in the non-jury trial before Lancaster  Superior Court Judge Margaret Grignon, said in an interview Monday that the  arson charge is false and politically motivated. He limited his opening  argument in court to a single sentence: "With my God as my witness, I did not  torch my house."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon said Martin's allegations that the charge stems  from a conspiracy by political rivals are "nonsense."  </P> <P> Three witnesses testified that evidence indicated the fire started in a  different part of Martin's living room from the sofa he said was the point of  origin.  </P> <P> The intensity and nature of the fire damage conflicted with Martin's account of  an accidental sofa fire, which Martin said he noticed from another room about  15 minutes after he had been seated on the sofa eating lunch, witnesses  testified.  </P> <P> "The fire was set by human hands applying an open flame to combustibles such as  trash or newspapers," testified Los Angeles County Sheriff's Arson Investigator  Terry Danielson. He disputed Martin's version that the fire had been caused by  smoking material or an electrical short, saying the damage pattern did not fit  either cause.  </P> <P> A gasoline can was found in the debris, the investigators testified. said.  Danielson and other witnesses testified Martin told them he was using it as a  doorstop.  </P> <P> Martin said in an interview that he had no reason to burn his own house, which  contained what he called cherished World War II memorabilia, including photos  and a uniform. He brought some of the memorabilia to court as evidence.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that he had an $83,000 insurance policy on the home, but said  an insurance company investigator will testify that there were no signs of  arson.  </P></p>

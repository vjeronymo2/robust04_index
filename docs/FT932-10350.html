			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y in office tower bankruptcy agreement THE US arm of Canadian property group Olympia &amp; York yesterday made a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for its 55 Water Street office tower in Manhattan, the world's largest privately-owned office building. The filing follows an agreement between O&amp;Y and the holders of Dollars 525m in 55 Water St bonds last autumn in which the huge office building was handed over to the bondholders in exchange for the cancellation of the debt. Under the reorganisation plan bondholders may accept 28 cents in the dollar for their bonds or exchange them for common stock in the corporation that will own 55 Water St. If they accept the cash, bondholders will receive a total of Dollars 149m. The Retirement Systems of Alabama, the Dollars 12bn state pension fund and biggest bondholder, meanwhile, has agreed to buy any shares that are not taken. O&amp;Y said the filing would not affect its negotiations with creditors to restructure the company's debt in the US. The troubled property group was forced to relinquish ownership of 55 Water St last year when it became clear that cash flow from the building was not enough to pay the annual interest payments of Dollars 36m on the bonds.</p>

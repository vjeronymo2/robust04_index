			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Travel: Self-catering in stately style - Practical Traveller It was a cold and windy night as we drove along the country lanes around Bath, looking for our medieval moat house. And there it was, grey and stately, a fire blazing in the oak-panelled sitting room, grand piano in the hall, four-poster in the bedroom with a decanter of sherry and chocolates on a small table by the fireplace. The en suite panelled bathroom had a free-standing bath and sociable chairs. This was our self-catering home for the weekend, the house once host to William III. It is now managed by Rural Retreats (tel: 0386-701177), a small company offering 'roses-round-the-door' cottages to medieval mansions. Visitors are able to arrive and leave any day of the week, with a minimum two-night stay for most properties - a rare facility in self-catering, where Saturday-to-Saturday bookings are usually required. The standard of self-catering accommodation in Britain has shot up over the past few years. It might still be a question of changing one kitchen sink for another, but there are microwaves, fridge/freezers, washing machines and driers in well-equipped kitchens to soften the chores. Several companies provide baskets of groceries, a bottle of wine and pre-cooked meals: Rural Retreats sends menus in advance to choose from. In his English Country Cottages brochure (tel: 0328-851155), Rowland Hardwick certainly offers the stuff of railway enthusiasts' dreams. The company's properties, which are also in Scotland and Wales, include a former railway carriage (Pounds 160 for three nights) and a parcels office (Pounds 136 for three nights) both with living/dining room, bathroom, double bedroom and kitchen, at Horsebridge Station in Hampshire. If you fancy an inshore lighthouse, Gothic temple, Victorian water tower, royal palace or converted pigsty, try the Landmark Trust (tel: 0628-825925), a charity set up in 1965 to rescue small historic buildings and open them to the public for short holidays. In turn, 45 of the 200 National Trust self-catering properties (tel: 0225-791199) are in, or close to, trust houses, and visitors are free to wander round their sumptuous gardens when day visitors have gone. Some companies stick to specific areas they can keep an eye on: Helpful Holidays (tel: 0647-433593) covers the west country, and its 400 properties include a thatched hexagonal gingerbread house, a former gamekeeper's home for six, a Napoleonic Fort for 20, with an 80ft living room and an almost-private beach. Quality Cottages (tel: 0348-837873) covers the Welsh coast from Pembrokeshire to Anglesey and offers discounts for couples and families up to four. Americans specify castles rather than big houses, according to Melody Macdonald, who runs Castles and Country Estates (tel: 071-373-1451). The English, she says, are more concerned with swimming pools, tennis courts and being within easy reach of somewhere else. Her brochure is awash with castles packed with portraits and heirlooms. One, on a 500-acre estate with staff included, sleeps 25. She has properties in London, too. If you want the freedom of self-catering without too much of the catering, try Budock Vean Country House Hotel near Falmouth (tel: 0326-250288) or Hell Bay Hotel, Isles of Scilly (tel: 0720-22947). Longlands, at Cartmel in Cumbria (tel: 05395-36475) won the 1993 'Self-catering holiday of the year' category in the England for Excellence awards for its pretty courtyard cottages - the owners offer home-cooked meals, and free use of a nearby heated pool and spa bath. In London, the newly-opened Orion London Apartment Hotel (tel: 071-566-8000), opposite the Barbican Centre, has studios for two and apartments for up to four. If you want to see before you choose, contact Brights of Nettlebed (tel: 0803-215595), which, to help you decide, sends a video of its three and four-bedroom houses with gardens and views in Torquay.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ria Taitt] </F>   [Text]Nation Security Minister Russell Huggins has  estimated the annual value of the illegal drug trade at "well  over one billion dollars."    Huggins was speaking at a news conference in the Parliament  Committee Room yesterday just prior to yesterday's sitting of  the Senate. The media conference was called to answer  journalists' queries arising from the Bill to amend the  Dangerous Drugs Act.    Huggins said the proposed amendments would allow Trinidad  and  Tobago to ratify the Vienna Convention. This, he added, would  give this country greater access to funding for the fight  against the drug trade from donor countries such as the United  States, the Netherlands, Germany and France.    He said the passage of this legislation signals to the  international community that "we are serious."    Huggins said one of the more important features of the Bill  was its provisions relating to money-laundering, which, he said,  could destroy the financial system of a country.    "One has to understand dealings in drugs take place in cash.  So you have a lot of cash to clean. Cash can be cleaned by  buying a boat from someone for $90,000. You pay in cash and then  you sell it back for $80,000. You are prepared to take the  $10,000 loss because you now have $80,000 certified (clean)  money."    He cited the U.S. as an example of a case where there has  been a proliferation of jewelry stores and "when you go down  inside them they don't have a piece of jewelry; they are simply  being used as fronts."    He said that in Trinidad and Tobago drug lords had used the  importation of potatoes as a laundering device.    He said laundering could occur in any establishment: "Where  you had the import of used cars, that is another method of doing  it.    You bring down cars and you pay more for them and sell them  for less. That is one of the ways in which it is done. Another  way is to buy up postal orders every month."    Huggins said one of the biggest busts in the U.S., "US $6  billion in cash," had been organised in this way. "A massive  laundering operation which took four years to bust and with all  the resources they have.    I mention this simply to let you know that you shouldn't  look for miracles from our people. We are trying to put a unit  together and are having some hiccups with the Organised Crime  and Narcotics Unit."    But he stressed that there were dedicated people working on  it, adding that it took time to really bust a drug operation.  "Time and a lot of ground work. A drug lord does not bring you  into his trust overnight," he said.    "He said between November 1993 and this year, the Trinidad  and Tobago authorities had participated in the seizure of 200  kilos of cocaine shipped from Trinidad. The intelligence given  for its seizure came from here," he said.    Stressing that in order to hurt the drug-trafficker one had  to deal with money-laundering, Huggins pointed to some of the  shortcomings of the original legislation, which, he said, did  not go far enough.    Before now, he said, it was not an offence for a  drug-trafficker to launder his own proceeds, though it was an  offence for someone to help him.    Huggins said the proposed legislation, apart from addressing  this, would also limit the number of places where the  drug-trafficker could hide his assets because the Bill allowed  for the recognition and enforcement.    The Bill was passed unanimously at 9:45 p.m.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: Happy campers on the Euro trail - Alastair Macaulay eavesdrops on an imaginary conversation after the show The scene: Joe Allen's restaurant near Covent Garden, London, or any place where theatricals hang out after shows. An obscure and no-longer-young thespian rushes up to hail the star of the West End's latest opening. Thespian: Darling] I hear your new show's a wow] And the first night had a really amazing audience] Anita Dobson (for it is she): Why, yes] Edwina Currie and Julian Clary, Alan Whicker and Mike Nolan, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, Paul Nicholas and Victor Spinetti, Esther Rantzen and Ronnie Corbett . . . Thesp (green with envy, interrupting): Fabulous] Is yours a big role? Anita (modestly): Well, I'm the star . . . Thesp (now pea-green): Really? So who do you play? Anita: Well, I'm an Italian has-been who comperes the EuroVision Song Contest, and who becomes psychically possessed by the Spirit of Europe, and I play agony-aunt to two English queens, who are pursued by the ghosts of the Emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous . . . Thesp (who has changed hue to red): Now, when you say queens . . . Anita: Yes, the show's all about gay men and coming out. Two of the international singers have an affair, too: the Spanish singer and the Greek. Thesp: So it's a really bold show like Bent? Anita: No, it's more fun . . . Thesp: What - like Torch Song Trilogy? Anita: No, no, lighter and happier than that. And I help the gays to love each other properly. Thesp: And do you have a love-affair too? Anita: No, I just play their fairy godmother. Thesp: And there are songs? Anita: Oh yes, I sing 'Edelweiss' in my Italian accent - 'E-dalla-weiss'. The rest are funny EuroVision-type songs, written by Jason Carr - who's a little love. At the end, the Greek singer wins the Contest with 'Bim-Bam-Bom]' On the first night the audience all clapped in time; and they were all given CDs of the song with their free programme, wasn't that a marvellous idea? Thesp: Mmmm. So it's a musical? Anita: Not really. The two English queens - that's James Dreyfus, who's tremendous as Gary, you can't believe how camp he is, and Charles Edwards as Kevin - don't sing, and neither do Hadrian and his boyfriend. Thesp: I don't understand this thing about being psychically possessed . . . Anita: Well, you know how Hadrian is a great gay hero, because he had more works of art made in honour of Antinous than have ever been made of anyone else in history. So he and Antinous inspire people even now. But, because not enough gay men love each other properly, the Spirit of Europe suddenly starts to haunt me, and makes me make them love more. Thesp (feebly): . . . The Spirit of Europe? Anita: Yes, this being Maastricht year and all that . . . Thesp (stunned): But you don't mean that Maastricht will mean more gay love, do you? Anita: Absolutely not. In fact, I tell the English boys that they're lucky not to be Italian. Italian men are too caught up on being macho to know about love. Thesp: But the show treats Europe seriously? Anita: Oooh, no. The Greeks and Spaniards and Italians in it are just jokes. Thesp: And it's produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Really Useful Company? Anita: Yes] And Tim Luscombe not only wrote it all, he directs too. What a clever sweetheart he is] The beginning's a bit leaden, but it warms up when I come on. Thesp: What's your funniest line? Anita (in low, creamy, Euro-compere voice): 'Grazie, Macedonia.' Thesp (hopefully): So it's utterly camp? Anita: Er . . . Yes. Thesp (with relief): Darling, I can't wait to see it. 'EuroVision' is at the Vaudeville Theatre, WC2, 071-836-9987</p>

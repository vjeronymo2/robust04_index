			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: What can I pass on? I AM 77 and a widow. I have some questions on inheritance tax. Am I right in assuming that Pounds 3,000 can be distributed every year and if not taken up one year can be carried forward to the next year making Pounds 6,000 for distribution by one person? Some people have told me, however, that it is Pounds 5,000 which can be distributed each year and not out of capital. I understand that Pounds 250 can be gifted to any one person in a year but not from capital. I also understand that at the moment Pounds 147,000 of an estate is free from inheritance tax. Is it possible for gifts of cars, maintenance at university etc, to be excluded from inheritance tax and given freely from capital? If trusts are set up for grandchildren, allowing interest on demand but capital to be passed over at an agreed age, obviously the services of a solicitor as trustee is very necessary. What are the fees and how do they vary? You are correct in assuming that you have an annual exemption of Pounds 3,000 and that if you do not make use of the Pounds 3,000 exemption in one year, you can carry that forward to the following year, so that a total of Pounds 6,000 can be gifted free of inheritance tax. I believe that the Pounds 5,000 exemption you refer to is a gift by a parent to a child in consideration of marriage. An exempt gift of up to Pounds 2,500 can be made to a grandchild in consideration of marriage. In addition to the annual exemptions, you can make a gift of Pounds 250 to any one person free of inheritance tax and this can come from your capital. You could therefore make eight individual gifts of Pounds 250, (a total of Pounds 2,000) and this would not erode your Pounds 3,000 annual exemption. The inheritance tax nil rate band has been increased to Pounds 150,000 for the current tax year. The gift of a car would be treated as a capital item and would need to come out of the above exemptions. If a regular sum from income is paid to maintain a person at university, then this could be deemed to be a gift out of income rather than capital. This would apply if the gift is of a regular nature, for example it is to be for a three or four year period during their university education, and if your income after tax and your normal expenditure is greater than the maintenance payment. The trust you are referring to appears to be a life interest trust so that the income will be payable to the grandchildren and the capital would only be payable at an agreed age. The solicitors' fee will depend upon the time involvement but I would expect it to be in the region of Pounds 500. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountants Stoy Hayward.

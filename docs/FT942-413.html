			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Observer: Lawson's niggle Indeed, Lord Lawson must be rather envious of his rival for the OECD job. It sounds like more than half the OECD members now support Canada's Don Johnston. Even if he falls at the last hurdle, the word is that he may well pick up the consolation prize of being Canada's next high commissioner in London. The incumbent, Fredrik Eaton, a wealthy scion of the Eaton department store empire, returns home in mid-July after three years in London. If Lawson doesn't get the OECD job there is little else on offer, now that he seems to have turned his back on merchant banking. Maybe the editorship of The Independent beckons?</p>

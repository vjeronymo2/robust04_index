			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: CP Forest loss rises to CDollars 60m in quarter CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products, one of Canada's largest pulp and paper groups, blamed weak pulp, newsprint and fine paper markets for continued heavy losses in the second quarter. The second-quarter loss deepened to CDollars 59.5m (USDollars 50.42m), or CDollars 1.13 a share, against a loss of CDollars 56.4m, or CDollars 1.28, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 462m, against CDollars 502m. A lower Canadian dollar and severe pruning of costs were not enough to offset depressed product prices, the company said. The half-year loss was CDollars 130.6m, or CDollars 2.59 a share, compared with CDollars 106.5m, or CDollars 2.42, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 892m, against CDollars 991m.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Mixed results at South African Breweries units THE three retail and manufacturing subsidiaries in the South African Breweries (SAB) group reported mixed results for the year to March, with useful performances from Edgars and Lion Match counterbalanced by a R45m (USDollars 14.3m) loss at OK Bazaars. All three companies suffered from weak consumer spending. Tight financial management helped Edgars and Lion Match overcome the difficult trading environment, but OK Bazaars was held in check by radical restructuring. Apart from the restructuring, which forced OK Bazaars to record a R40m extraordinary loss, over and above the R45m trading loss, the group has appointed a new managing director, Mr Mervyn Serebro. Management said it was in the process of repositioning the group, but expected further losses this year. A priority will be to improve OK Bazaars' operating margin, which dropped to under 1 per cent last year with operating profit slipping to R49.9m on a turnover of R5.3bn. Edgars, the clothing, footwear and textiles group lifted attributable earnings by 18 per cent to R186m (R157.5m). Edgars is the main non-beer contributor to SAB's profits. The results testify to aggressive marketing during the second half. First-half sales rose 9 per cent: they were 16 per cent higher for the 53-week reporting period - at R3.2bn. Margins were maintained, and with interest charges dipping, pre-tax profits increased by 20 per cent to R361m. On a divisional basis, R145m of the R185m attributable profit came from Edgars stores and R52m from Sales House while Jet made a R2m loss. Both Sales House and Jet improved their performance by over 70 per cent compared with 1992. Mr George Beeton, managing director, predicted satisfactory growth in earnings for the year ahead. The overall dividend for 1992-93 was 140 cents a share, against 119 cents. Attributable earnings at Lion Match (shaving equipment and packaging as well as matches) increased by 22 per cent to R15.4m. The improvement reflected significantly lower financing costs.</p>

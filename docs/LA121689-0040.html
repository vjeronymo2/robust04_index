			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GEORGIA;  </P> <P> 'NORMAL' FLU SEASON MAY PEAK IN JANUARY  </P> <P> This year's flu season may peak in January, earlier than it did last year, but  there is no evidence that it will be abnormally bad, an influenza specialist at  the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said. "From the evidence we  have, it's a normal flu. What many people don't realize is that normal flu  kills," said Dr. Lawrence Schonberger. He said the Type A, or Shanghai, flu had  been expected, and it has been showing up across the country. Schonberger said  flu shots should have been received in November but that they still can be  effective now. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the treatment to  reach its fullest effect.  </P></p>

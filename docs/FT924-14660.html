			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (10): Scandal's solace - Wine climbs slowly back to respectability MENTION Austrian wine, and the first thing people think of is the scandal that broke out in 1985, when it was discovered that unscrupulous traders were lacing their products with diethylene glycol, better known as antifreeze. Besides being the source of many sour jokes, this scandal - which came to light when a dealer tried to claim for the chemical in his tax return - had a devastating effect on exports of Austrian wine. From 478,000 hectolitres in 1984, the volume tumbled to a low 36,000 hl in 1988. Value dropped from ASch440m to ASch90m over the same period. Curiously, the scandal had virtually no impact on domestic consumption, which helped cushion the blow, since more than 90 per cent of output is consumed internally. The industry is still not even close to recovering its pre-scandal export volume, but today Austrian wine producers and merchants are inclined to be grateful that it all happened. 'Looking back, we can be very happy that it was so severe,' says Mr Fritz Ascher, export marketing manager of the country's wine industry promotion agency. 'We would not have been able to push through new quality control laws if this had not happened.' The promotion agency has even taken to using the scandal as a marketing tool. Until two years ago, it tried to downplay it, referring to it in official documents only in euphemistic terms. But a new brochure featuring the 2,700 year history of Austrian viticulture highlights the scandal as one of the great milestones of the industry's development, alongside Charlemagne laying down viticultural guidelines around the year 800, and the introduction of the Riesling grape in 1301. Austria is not a traditional wine exporter. Although wines have been made in the country for nearly 3,000 years, it has been mainly for the modest home market. Even today, Austrian annual production of some 2.8m hectolitres ranks it 18th in the world, far behind the Italian and French giants, each with 60m hl a year. Even when exporting began in earnest in the 1970s, Austria became known as a supplier of cheap and cheerful sweetened white wines, mainly to Germany. But after the scandal that niche was effectively closed. The only possible salvation was to emphasise quality rather than quantity, and to certify it. Today, Austrian wine bottles of Gruner Veltliner and Blaufrankisch are a bit like aero-engine components - each one is individually labelled and numbered so that its origin can be traced precisely. Still, the climb back to respectability has not been easy. Producers have deliberately advanced slowly, trying first to establish credibility in speciality shops and good restaurants. Progress shows in a steadily rising volume since 1988 to 220,000 hl last year. Average export prices have more than doubled since before the scandal, from ASch10.5 per litre in 1984 to ASch26 last year, reflecting the gradual shedding of the scandal stigma. Last year, for the first time since the scandal, Austrian producers began selling to supermarkets, notably Tesco and J Sainsbury in the UK. 'Only since 1991 can we say that there is a good distribution of Austrian wines again in foreign countries,' Mr Ascher says. So far this year, the progress is continuing, with a handsome 30 per cent rise in volume (21 per cent in value) in the first half. The industry's objective is to maintain its export growth rate of about 25 per cent a year until volume is back again to the 400,000 hl a year level. Because there is still a lot of education to do, it is concentrating only on a few large markets.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EC NEGOTIATORS ACCEPT 2 1/2-YEAR PACT ON STEEL  </P> <P> European Community negotiators have agreed to a compromise with the United  States over limits on community steel exports, an EC spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The EC initially opposed Washington's demand to extend a so-called voluntary  restraint agreement (VRA) that expired at the end of September, arguing that it  is time the United States did its bit to liberalize steel trade.  </P> <P> But it opted for a pragmatic approach, capitalizing on a new willingness to  defuse potential rows in Washington.  </P> <P> "We never wanted the deal, but if we were going to have to have one, a 2  1/2-year deal is a credible step to liberalizing the steel market," the  spokesman told reporters.  </P> <P> The United States had originally wanted a five-year pact to shield its aging  steel producers and give them more time to adjust to foreign competition.  </P> <P> Under the new deal, the community gets a small boost in its market share, 7%  instead of the 6.68% in the previous accord.  </P> <P> The accord also spells out that any disputes have to be settled by mutual  consent, not by unilateral action from Washington.  </P> <P> Washington imposed VRAs to cut the market share of imports from 30% five years  ago to 20.2%.  </P></p>

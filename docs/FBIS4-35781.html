			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army command has declared a state of alert among  all its units in Lebanon to confront any possibility of an  Israeli escalation.    This Army step comes in response to an Israeli military  source's statement that the occupation forces have been placed  on a maximum state of alert along the borders with Lebanon as a  precaution against any fierce reprisals by Hizballah.</p>

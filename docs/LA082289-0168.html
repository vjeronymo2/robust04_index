			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> OFFICIAL SAYS HE FEARED ASSAULT IN DRUG TESTING OF CANADIAN ATHLETES  </P> <P> The man in charge of making sure Canadian athletes were not taking steroids  feared that he would be physically assaulted by certain top track officials if  he carried out surprise drug testing, a federal inquiry was told today.  </P> <P> "It was my responsibility, but I was not about to get into a physical  confrontation with guys who were bigger than I am," Tom MacWilliam told the  inquiry into the use of drugs in amateur sport.  </P> <P> MacWilliam, an anti-doping consultant for the federal government and the  Canadian Track and Field Assn., was referring to a random drug test of the  country's national sprint team scheduled in 1985. He said the test was strongly  opposed by Coach Charlie Francis and Gerard Mach, both paid employees of the  track association.  </P> <P> He agreed with inquiry lawyer Robert Armstrong that coaches and athletes on  Canada's national track team were opposed to surprise, out-of-competition drug  testing, even though it was the stated policy of the association, track's  national governing body.  </P></p>

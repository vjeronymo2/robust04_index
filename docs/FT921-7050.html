			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: RJR buys in Dollars 1bn worth of debentures THE RELENTLESS refinancing at RJR Nabsico, the US tobacco and food group which was the subject of a record Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, continued yesterday when the company bought in Dollars 1bn worth of debenture stock, writes Nikki Tait in New York. Funds to finance the purchase of the debenture stock came from RJR's newly-negotiated bank facilities. Essentially, the company is replacing the high-cost debenture debt with cheaper bank loans. Last year, the company shed its 'highly leveraged transaction' status. This is a technical banking definition, but by moving out of this category, RJR was able to win access to more attractive bank funds. The purchase of debenture stock covers Dollars 750m principal of subordinated discount debentures due 2001, Dollars 165m principal of 15 per cent payment-in-kind subordinated debentures due 2001, and Dollars 85m principal of 13.5 per cent subordinated debentures due 2001.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Chen Shao-chiang (7115 </F> 1421 1730): "Wu Yi on Most-Favored-Nation Status, Says the  United States Should Not Wield the Big Stick"]    [Text] Beijing, 10 Mar (HSIN WAN PAO) -- Wu Yi, minister  of foreign trade and economic cooperation, said today: "The  Americans should not wield the big stick when they come to  China. If they do so, they should not have come." Wu's remarks  are aimed at U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who is  scheduled to arrive in China soon.    Wu Yi participated in the opening session of the National  People's Congress [NPC] this morning as a visitor. Wu was met  by reporters when she arrived at the meeting hall.    Wu Yi said that most-favored-nation [MFN] status is purely a  trade matter, which should not be linked to politics.  Therefore, we simply cannot accept the human rights question  being raised by him (Christopher). This attitude of the Chinese  Government is well known to the outside world."    Wu continued: "The MFN issue is absolutely a trade matter,  which should be resolved by trade methods. They (United States)  want to link it to politics. This is totally unacceptable to  us."    Christopher will arrive in Beijing tomorrow.</p>

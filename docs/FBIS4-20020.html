			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Van Rooy: `Be Careful With Defensive </F> Trade Rules'"]    [Text] "When implementing the GATT/Uruguay Round, we must  take care not to liberalize trade on the one hand, while on the  other hand nullifying this effect by enacting new defensive  trade rules in the area of antidumping and introducing  protective measures." This warning was made by Economic Affairs  State Secretary Van Rooy at the ABN/AMRO conference, "Why  America Now," held in Amsterdam on 7 April.    Van Rooy talked about 20 countries which are busy with  similar plans, and she pointed in particular to the United  States: "As regards the implementation of the GATT/Uruguay  Round agreements, the Netherlands will very carefully supervise  the adaptation of U.S. antidumping legislation. The current  practice is that complaints by U.S. companies are honored in  almost all cases by the Department of Commerce.    That gives some food for thought. The United States is  calling for free trade, but there are clear indications that it  is protecting its own market for certain sensitive products by  means of antidumping and antisubsidy legislation." According to  Van Rooy, the United States, as well as the European Union, must  not give the wrong impression, since that could end up having a  boomerang effect on their own exports if other countries react  with their own antidumping rules.  <H5>  Increasingly Better </H5>   According to Van Rooy, Netherlands companies are doing  increasingly better on the North American market. Netherlands  exports in 1992 totalled 11.5 billion guilders: Around 10  billion guilders went to the United States; around 900 million  to Canada; and around 565 million to Mexico. Exports to Mexico,  in particular, rose sharply and, according to the most recent  CPB [Central Planning Bureau] estimate, Netherlands exports to  the United States rose by 25 percent (in value) in 1993.    The state secretary expects that Netherlands exports will be  able to grow further with the implementation of the NAFTA free  trade agreement and the GATT agreement.    Here, she sees opportunities in particular for products such  as steel, paper, medical equipment, chemicals, pharmaceutical  products, foodstuffs, (agricultural) machinery, and supply  industries.</p>

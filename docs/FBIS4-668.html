			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Liberal Party; place and date not </F> given]    [Text] Due to the current crisis in our country, caused by  elements who are opposed to the Arusha peace agreement, the  Liberal Party [PL] is saddened by the death of President  Habyarimana and the death of the president of Burundi, Cyprien  Ntaryamira, who died on 5 April 1994. The Liberal Party  denounces the massacres in Kigali and the rest of the country.  The massacres perpetuated by Presidential Guards, MRND  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development]  youthwingers and some elements of the Army. The killings  targeted members of the opposition and people of Tutsi origin.  They killed the prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana,  cabinet ministers, and opposition leaders. It is clear that the  massacres had been planned earlier on.    The PL denounces the so-called government that has been  announced in Kigali, a government that is founded on the  massacre of more than 20,000 people in Kigali alone. A  government that was formed in disregard of the national  Constitution. The PL denounces the murdering of Landouald  Ndasingwa, formerly the first vice president of the Liberal  Party and the other members of the Liberal Party who have been  murdered. The PL denounces Mr. Justin Mugenzi and his clique  who are trying to hijack the Liberal Party and join the  illegitimate government that has been announced in Rwanda.    The current crisis in Rwanda is the implementation of a plan  that has been hatched for some time. The plan is now  implemented by murderers who have killed opposition leaders and  people of Tutsi origin. This trend of killing has continued  since the war started. These killers should be made to answer  for their crimes.    The PL requests all the opposition parties in Rwanda, the  international community, and all peace-loving people to join  hands and fight the enemies of peace and democracy in Rwanda.    Signed by Kayiranga Esdras, Higiro Prosper, Musengimana  Joseph. These are some of the surviving leaders of the Liberal  Party.</p>

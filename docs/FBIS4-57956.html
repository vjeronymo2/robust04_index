			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 26 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Costa Rican President  Jose Maria Figueres today said he will review a U.S. proposal  presented to Central American nations concerning Haitian  refugees. Under the plan, the Central American nations would  receive Haitian refugees "temporarily" while a solution is  sought to the current crisis in that Caribbean nation.    Figueres told ACAN-EFE that Washington is working with the  UN  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in an attempt to "assist  those Haitian citizens who feel politically threatened."    Figueres added: "The idea is for these people to stay here  on  a temporary basis, until they can be returned to Haiti."    Although Figueres stressed that "all of us are concerned"  about the situation in Haiti, "so far, we have yet to make a  decision." He added, "We will be evaluating the request within  the next few days."    Meanwhile, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo  confirmed Washington had indeed presented the request to Costa  Rica, but he explained that it would affect only political  refugees, not economic refugees. He added that the issue would  be studied jointly by the United States and Costa Rica.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EPA DEMANDS SEWER UPGRADE BY END OF '99;  </P> <P> SEWAGE: THE FEDERAL AGENCY'S TIMETABLE IS NEARLY EIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF WHAT THE  CITY OF SAN DIEGO SAYS IS POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> The EPA is demanding that San Diego complete a $2.8-billion upgrading of its  sewage-treatment system by December, 1999, nearly eight years earlier than the  city claims is technically possible, according to documents filed Monday in  connection with the agency's federal lawsuit against the city.  </P> <P> According to the documents, which publicly disclose for the first time the  positions of the two sides in the legal battle, city experts predict that they  can overhaul the system by August, 2007, when conversion of the city's Point  Loma treatment plant to so-called "secondary" standards would be completed.  </P> <P> Settlement negotiations in the case are occurring from time to time, but the  Environmental Protection Agency, represented by the U.S. Department of Justice,  and the city have spent recent weeks feverishly preparing for trial by taking  depositions from witnesses and preparing the arguments outlined in the  memoranda filed Monday. The state of California also is a plaintiff in the  action against the city because the federal Clean Water Act also requires that  the city comply with state sewage-treatment regulations.  </P> <P> Monday, U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster delayed the trial date from Dec. 5 to  Jan. 9, which provides more time for a negotiated settlement. But city  officials did not have encouraging words.  </P> <P> "We looked at 2007, and there's not a lot of give in that number," said  Councilman Ron Roberts, a main supporter of the city's plan to build a  treatment system that also would reclaim as much as 133 million gallons of  water daily for use in irrigation.  </P> <P> "I am convinced in my own mind that, short of the federal government coming in  with a program that would mirror the effort to put a man on the moon, you  physically could not do it" by 1999, Roberts said.  </P> <P> He also said that sewage-system users could not afford the sizable fee  increases necessary to complete the upgrading by 1999.  </P> <P> But Gerald George, senior counsel for the Justice Department, said the city's  timetable includes social and political factors that should not be included in  Brewster's determination of how quickly the city can assemble a new treatment  system.  </P> <P> "They're not saying they couldn't. They're saying they don't want to," George  said Monday.  </P> <P> If the two sides cannot settle before Jan. 9, Brewster will decide the  construction timetable in the first, or "remedy," phase of the trial. At a  subsequent trial, he would determine whether the city should be penalized for  violations dating back to 1983, and how large those fines might be.  </P> <P> The EPA and the state sued the city last year for missing a July, 1988,  deadline for compliance with the Clean Water Act and spilling untreated sewage  into local waterways. The federal law required that all cities upgrade their  sewage treatment systems to secondary standards, under which 85% to 90% of  solids are removed from effluent before it is dumped in the ocean. The city's  current "advanced primary" treatment system removes 75% to 80% of the solids.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also seeks potentially millions of dollars in fines for past sewage  spills.  </P> <P> City planners and consulting engineers have drawn up plans for a $2.6- to  $2.8-billion renovation of the sewage treatment system that would be the  largest public-works project ever undertaken by the city. In addition to  upgrading the Point Loma plant, the system would add a secondary-treatment  plant in the South Bay, a South Bay ocean outfall that may be several miles  long and six water reclamation plants around the county.  </P> <P> Although some information on the city's proposed construction timetable has  appeared in news reports, it generally was secret until outlined in the memo  submitted Monday by city attorneys.  </P> <P> In its list of milestones, the city proposes to continue planning and financing  the system from now until 1997. Design would begin near the end of 1991 and  continue until mid-1999. The first phase of construction would begin in  mid-1994 and last until early 2002. Final construction on the Point Loma plant  would start in late 2001 and continue until August, 2007.  </P> <P> According to the city's documents, it would take two to three years just to  reorganize the Metropolitan Sewerage System, which now includes 1.7 million  people in 16 cities and sewage districts, to better facilitate the sale of  bonds that will finance construction of the sewer project.  </P> <P> The city also argues that, "in all, well over 20 major projects will be  required in the initial phases of this program, with several of the projects  individually being more costly and complex than the recently completed San  Diego Convention Center. It is critical that the milestones are selected in  recognition of the enormous size and complexity of the project."  </P> <P> Obtaining approvals from other jurisdictions within the sewage system will also  be time-consuming, according to the city's memorandum.  </P> <P> Chief Deputy City Atty. Ted Bromfield said Monday that, although EPA officials  orally support the city's water-reclamation efforts, the 1999 deadline does not  allow time for construction of the additional facilities necessary to exceed  secondary standards and make sewage reusable on golf courses, crops and highway  medians.  </P> <P> "They say they like reclamation . . . and their schedule is based on a  secondary program. We don't think it's appropriate," Bromfield said.  </P> <P> But the EPA, which is demanding several injunctions against the city, claims  that, "to comply with the intent of Congress, the city must be ordered to  comply with the secondary-treatment requirements of the Clean Water Act through  construction of secondary-treatment facilities in accordance with the tightest,  technically justified construction schedule."  </P> <P> Besides the December, 1999, deadline, the federal agency is demanding an  injunction that would require the city to maintain a capital-improvement  program that would prevent further sewage spills from antiquated pipelines, and  another injunction that would require enforcement of penalties against  companies and others who dump waste into the sewer system without  "pre-treatment" to take out heavy metals and other waste that could harm the  ocean environment.  </P> <P> The EPA also wants Brewster to ensure that the city maintains adequate budget  and staff to comply with the Clean Water Act, limit sewage flows so that the  system does not overflow its existing capacity of 190 million gallons daily,  and regularly monitor pump stations.  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Trelleborg buys US tyre unit TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial conglomerate, has acquired the tyre division of Monarch, the North American rubber manufacturer owned by the Teledyne group, for an undisclosed price. As a result Trelleborg claims it is the world's biggest maker of solid industrial tyres. The company estimates that its sales of industrial solid tyres will reach Dollars 60m, 20 per cent of the world market, as a result of the acquisition. Monarch is one of North America's leading solid industrial tyre makers with annual net sales of around Dollars 30m. Mr Sven-Gunnar Schough, president of Trelleborg Tyres, said yesterday that the purchase of Monarch would strengthen the company's position in that market which accounts for about 30 per cent of the industrial tyre industry. The new purchase, which covers Monarch's production facilities at Hartville, Ohio, will be added to the company's existing industrial tyre plants in Belgium, through its subsidiary Bergougnan, and in Sri Lanka. Mr Schough stressed yesterday that Monarch, like Bergougnan, would be able to act independently in the market and continue to have its own marketing operation. He believed there would be synergy effects in certain areas of product development and co-ordination.</p>

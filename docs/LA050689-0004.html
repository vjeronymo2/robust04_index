			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IRWINDALE FILES NEW LAWSUIT AGAINST EX-CITY CONSULTANT  </P> <P> Despite some conciliatory talk by city officials last week, the city of  Irwindale has filed another lawsuit against Fred Lyte, its former redevelopment  consultant.  </P> <P> In papers filed in Pomona Superior Court, the city contends that Lyte  "fraudulently (concealed) material facts about a development project . . .  which otherwise would have been rejected" in order to collect an extra fee  under his contract.  </P> <P> The suit also charged Lyte with trying to disrupt the city's negotiations with  the Los Angeles Raiders to build a $150-million football stadium in Irwindale  by spreading rumors and making false charges.  </P> <P> Lyte, part of the negotiating team that produced the initial accord with the  Raiders, characterized the suit this week as "pure baloney, tailored to harass  me."  </P> <P> Since the City Council dismissed the consultant last December, the city has  widely accused him of creating discord in Irwindale and blocked payment of more  than $1 million in bills he has submitted to the city. Irwindale has also filed  a lawsuit seeking more than $2 million in damages, claiming that Lyte had  violated a provision in his contract forbidding him to recommend to the city  projects in which he had a financial interest.  </P> <P> In a bitter exchange with Irwindale officials last month, Lyte charged that the  first suit "will be laughed out of court" because he was never a city employee.  The laws that define conflict of interest may not apply to him, he suggested.  </P> <P> The new legal action centers on the creation of a strip mall two years ago at  the intersection of Irwindale Avenue and Arrow Highway, a block from City Hall.  </P> <P> According to the complaint against Lyte, the Hopkins Development Co. had agreed  to build a shopping center on a two-acre lot on Arrow, but only if an adjacent  7,000-square-foot lot at the southeast corner of the busy intersection could be  included in the package.  </P> <P> The smaller lot, with a 50-foot frontage on Irwindale Avenue, is owned by  Irwindale Mayor Patricio Miranda.  </P> <P> According to the complaint against Lyte, Miranda had refused to lease the  property to Hopkins because his constituents would perceive such an arrangement  by a city official as a conflict of interest. Following the advice of Martin,  Miranda "would not lease or sell his land to any party who would be involved in  the shopping center development," the complaint says.  </P> <P> But principals of Hopkins, the development company, three years ago formed a  general partnership and negotiated a lease with Miranda. The complaint says  Miranda did not know that he was dealing with a Hopkins subsidiary, and Lyte  withheld that information in order to collect a 3% fee for bringing a new  development to the city.  </P> <P> Miranda's property, once the site of Miranda's taco stand, now holds a  Jack-in-the-Box outlet that shares a parking lot with a 10-store strip mall.  </P> <P> "The city did not discover the true facts relating to Lyte's fraudulent  concealment of information or breach of fiduciary duty until April, 1989," the  complaint says.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ken Reich contributed to this story.  </P></p>

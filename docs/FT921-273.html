			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Trend reversed in share index THE SECOND full week of the election campaign showed a reversal of the trend for the FT Election Share Index, with stocks that might benefit from a Conservative victory doing better than those that might benefit from a Labour win. The index, published daily during the campaign, consists of 10 stocks which might outperform in the event of a Labour victory and 10 which could benefit from a Conservative win. Its performance last week differed in one other important respect from the first week of the campaign - the difference between 'Conservative gainers' and 'Labour gainers' was very slight. The big loser of the week in the Labour index was APV, down 4.35 per cent on the week and down 1.71 per cent since the election campaign started. Its slide this week reflected the market's unhappiness at the company's poor results. Stocks with a stronger political wind behind them were Thames Water (a 'Conservative gainer' because of Labour's plans for tighter regulation), up 1.47 per cent on the week but down 15 per cent since March 11; and National Power, another privatisation stock, up 3.16 per cent on the week but down 9.7 per cent during the campaign as a whole. The moves must have reflected a belief that the political threat to both companies had been overdone. Since the election was called all but one of the Conservative gainers - mostly companies that stand to lose in easily identifiable ways if the Labour party comes to power - have fallen in price. The Labour gainers list also shows more losers than winners - seven down since the campaign started, three up. This probably reflects the fact that the potential benefits to this category of shares are more nebulous than the potential losses to those in the other list. The base for the index is closing prices on the day the election was announced, Wednesday March 11. Both sections of the index are set to 100 at that date. The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index - which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT ELECTION SHARE INDEX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Labour win/Tory defeat stocks (% change since March 11)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

After the Security Council meeting he  held a brief news conference, where he stated, in particular:  "The Georgian side came to the Security Council session with  good ideas. It was very important for us to know to what degree  the point of view of the Georgian leadership on the conflict in  Abkhazia coincides with that held by the Security Council  members. I would like to note with satisfaction that our views  and those of the Security Council members coincide on most of  the fundamental issues; our views coincide on issues relating to  Georgia's territorial integrity and the creation of safe  conditions for the return of refugees and for the stationing of  peacekeeping forces in the region."    Touching on further UN measures regarding the Abkhazian  conflict, Shevardnadze said: "After studying the situation the  UN secretary general will deliver a report to the Security  Council; this will take place on 21 March. On the basis of this  report the Security Council will adopt a decision on sending  peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia."    Shevardnadze reported that in the course of the  Georgian-Abkhazian talks held at the UN headquarters work on  documents has not been yet concluded. "Work on them will be  continued in Geneva later," he said. He stated that the Geneva  talks should be resumed before 20 March.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent asked whether a plan for  stationing peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia was discussed at his  meeting with President Clinton. "The issue relating to the need  to send peacekeeping forces was discussed with President Clinton  in principle, and in this respect we reached good  understanding," E. Shevardnadze answered.    Asked whether it would suit Georgia if Russian troops were  part of the peacemaking forces, E. Shevardnadze said:  "Absolutely, with the participation of Russian troops and those  of other countries. As to what other countries will be taking  part, it is not of any fundamental importance to us." On the  issue of the proportion of Russia's participation in operations,  he stressed: "Everything will be decided at the Security Council  sitting. It is not a very significant issue for us. What is  important for us is that this operation is taking place under  the aegis of the United Nations."</p>

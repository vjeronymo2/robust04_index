			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Significant chapter ends, but more follow: Andrew Jack on BCCI convictions in probably the largest bank fraud In September 1991 more than 30 senior employees of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in Abu Dhabi were summoned to what they were told was a 'management meeting'. To their surprise, on the agenda was their detention on the grounds of alleged involvement in the frauds at BCCI that had led two months previously to the closure of the bank by regulators around the world. The announcement yesterday of the conviction of 12 of them marks the conclusion of a significant chapter in efforts by prosecutors around the world to bring to justice a large number of the perpetrators of probably the largest banking fraud ever. It leaves the question of punishment for the most senior executives of BCCI, and does little for hundreds of thousands of depositors, employees and creditors seeking compensation. Of those rounded up in Abu Dhabi nearly three years ago, several were released quickly and others followed after an initial report by the public prosecutor. That left 14 who were formally charged in July last year. Arguably the most significant of the accused, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the founder and president of BCCI, who was sentenced to eight years, was tried in his absence. He has lived in ailing health in Pakistan for several years. All efforts to extradite him have proved fruitless - by Abu Dhabi and by the US authorities, where he was indicted last July for fraud, bribery, conspiracy, larceny and racketeering. Mr Abedi's assistant, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, who was BCCI's chief executive and wrote a series of confessions to Abu Dhabi implicating himself and Mr Abedi in 1990, was sentenced to 14 years. Mr Naqvi was sent under an agreement with the Abu Dhabi authorities to the US in May, where he is due to stand trial on three sets of federal charges and one set brought in New York state. Under the agreement, the US authorities may agree to return him to Abu Dhabi once he has served out any criminal sentences in the US. But they also reserve the right to hand him over to other governments first. A third BCCI executive convicted for three years yesterday was Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar, former head of the bank's treasury, who was last September sentenced to six years imprisonment in the UK after pleading guilty to 16 charges of false accounting involving more than Dollars 745m. Of the remaining 11, Mr Arjmand Naqvi has since died. Mr Iqbal Rizvi, who had been released on bail, was acquitted yesterday on charges of assisting other executives in the forgery and concealment of loans. The remaining nine have been held in detention at the Police Officers' Club in Abu Dhabi since their arrest, and taken periodically to court appearances since last October, when their trial began. Three were sentenced yesterday to six years each: Mr Zafar Iqbal, head of BCCI's Emirates branch, Mr Hassan Kazmi, primarily responsible for managing money stolen from the Abu Dhabi royal family, and Mr Abdul Hafeez, company secretary. The rest received three years each: Mr Fakhir Hussain, an account officer in Abu Dhabi, Mr Mohammed Azmatullah, who was one of Mr Naqvi's top assistants in London, Mr Ameer Siddiqi and Mr Imtiaz Ahmad, who both sat on BCCI's loan authorisation committee, Mr Naseem Sheikh, who worked in the treasury department, and Mr Bashir Tahir. All of those found guilty are also required in the judgment to meet civil claims brought against them by the Abu Dhabi for Dollars 9bn in compensation for money allegedly stolen from the royal family and government bodies. A number of details remain to be answered over the sentencing, including how much more time they will spend in prison if unable to pay off the Dollars 9bn claim and whether they or the prosecution will appeal their sentences in the next two weeks. In August last year a US jury acquitted Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer accused of profiting from loans given by BCCI to enable him to buy shares in First American, the bank of which he was president. After the collapse of this and other cases, the authorities are keen to see Mr Naqvi prosecuted. In the UK, two others connected with BCCI have been prosecuted. Last month Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former head of Control Securities, was jailed for 2 1/2 years for fraud relating to his business dealings with BCCI. Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil, was convicted in February of conspiring fraudulently to inflate BCCI's profits and fined Pounds 120,000 plus costs. The trial is continuing of Mr Imran Imam, a former BCCI official who denies six charges including conspiring to conceal documents, falsify records and furnish false information.</p>

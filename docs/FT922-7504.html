			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Status of training doubted A SURVEY of more than 100 leading companies has cast doubt on the belief that employers are becoming more rigorous in their training activities and integrating training with normal business activities. The survey, by the Employee Development Bulletin, found that only a quarter of employers always set overall targets for their training and only a fifth conduct training-needs analyses of their workforce. The survey also found that training is not yet seen as an investment that, like other investment decisions, is costed and evaluated. Meanwhile, a new approach to the government's Employment Training scheme for unemployed adults is to be launched this week by Norfolk and Waveney Training and Enterprise Council. According to the latest issue of Personnel Today, the East Anglian Tec is to establish shorter courses and provide better careers guidance, linked to the needs of local employers. The Institute of Personnel Management has appointed Mr Geoff Armstrong, 45, as director-general. A director of Standard Chartered with personnel responsibilities, he will take up the post from July. Mr Michael Bett, 57, executive deputy chairman of BT, is to join as president-elect. Training Evaluation. IRS, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5.</p>

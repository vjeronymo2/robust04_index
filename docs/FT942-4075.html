			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cola warriors identify new enemy  -PepsiCo is being hit by an own-label maker The expression 'cola wars' has passed into common use to describe the perennial spats between the world's two leading cola brands, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. However, the phrase took on new meaning on Thursday when PepsiCo, US manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola, delivered a profits warning to Wall Street. Second-quarter earnings would be virtually flat, the company said, and one reason for that was a fall in prices in the US cola market. But it was not the traditional enemy, Coca-Cola, that was doing the damage. It was own-label cola supplied by Cott, the Canadian maker of store-branded foods and drinks. PepsiCo's share price dropped like a stone on the news: it was off 13 per cent at one point, before recovering a little to close 9 per cent down. Why? Because investors were painfully reminded of 'Marlboro Friday' - that day in April last year when Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, had to slash the price of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes to win back market share from cheaper products. The fear underlying investors' response to price-cutting by big manufacturers goes further than concern over the immediate impact on profits. Developments like these reinforce worries that the worth of famous brands is declining because consumers are become more concerned about getting good quality at a low price than about the name on the product. A powerful example of the trend can be seen in the UK, where cola supplied by Cott to J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, sells more than Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola combined because it is apparently of comparable quality, yet retails at virtually half the price. So could June 9 1994 go down in history as 'Cola Thursday'? One argument that suggests it might is to look at Cott's rapid expansion. The company has grown phenomenally by supplying food and drinks to retailers who want to put their own names on the bottles, packets and cans. Cott's annual sales have rocketed from CDollars 43m to CDollars 665m (USDollars 485.4m) in the past five years. Over the same period, its share of the Canadian take-home soft drinks market has grown to 28 per cent. Now it is spreading into the US, Australia, South Africa and - after signing a distribution agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK  - into Europe, too. Some Wall Street analysts yesterday played down the threat to PepsiCo's US market. Mr Joseph Doyle at Smith Barney Shearson said comparisons with 'Marlboro Friday' were unjustified, because the circumstances were different. US manufacturers of premium brand cigarettes had driven up their prices for years to deliver earnings growth to shareholders, leaving themselves highly vulnerable to attack by low-cost rivals. The US soft drinks market, however, was highly competitive - prices had not changed in 10 years. Mr Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs agreed, saying the price differential in the US between PepsiCo's products and Cott's lines - typically, about 20 cents on a two-litre bottle of cola - was too narrow to raise fears of a bruising price war. Although the price differential was greater outside the US, he said, international soft drink earnings accounted for barely 5 per cent of PepsiCo's operating income. Even so, Cott's growth is due not so much to the fact that its products are cheaper for consumers, but because they are more profitable for retailers. Unlike Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, it does not spend vast amounts on advertising and marketing to promote its name, so it can afford to sell its goods to retailers at a much lower prices. Mr Gerald Spencer, Cott's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'The bottom line is that our product sells to retailers at around Dollars 3.25 a case (of 24 12oz cans) and theirs sells for Dollars 5 a case or more. If the products are of equal quality, why should retailers pay more?' PepsiCo was also playing down the threat, saying soft drink prices were down by only 2 per cent, and that most of the profits shortfall in the second quarter was due to tough competition in its fast food businesses, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken. PepsiCo acknowledged that Cott's product had a price advantage, but said its research indicated consumers were still prepared to pay a premium for the assurance of quality that came with a product they knew. 'Consumers still prefer to buy a branded product. They don't want to walk around with Brand X in their hand,' it said. Cott's Mr Pencer disagreed. 'Consumers are smarter now than they were 20 years ago,' he says. They were no longer prepared to pay a 'brand tax' - the extra costs of hiring rock stars and the like to promote and sustain a brand's image. 'You can only pay so long for an icon.'</p>

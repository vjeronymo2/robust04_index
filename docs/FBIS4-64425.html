			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Julie Wolf report: "Brittan Hits EU Firms Over Export </F> Timidity"]    [Text] Brussels -- Sir Leon Brittan, the EU [European  Union] trade commissioner, yesterday strongly criticised  European companies for not being aggressive enough in pursuing  export markets.    In a speech on the Uruguay Round world trade agreement, Sir  Leon urged companies to co-operate with national governments and  the European Commission on strategies to promote exports.    "European business is not as active on this front as are our  American or other competitors. On the Japanese market, I am  struck by the direct involvement of American chief executives,  even from very large companies, in the hunt for contacts and the  hunt for contracts," Sir Leon said.    "If industrial co-operation really is one of the keys to  sustained exports success, then the diaries of top European  businessmen must be shaped to reflect this more closely than is  the case today," he added.    The commissioner said that, although European business  leaders repeatedly stressed the importance of Asian markets in  the future, "there is not yet a Europe-wide network linking  those with expertise and resources in those markets." This  means that "European business has a less strategic vision of  prospects in Asia than is needed," he said.    Sir Leon's comments came as the commission released a report  on the "global benefits" of the GATT accord. According to  Brussels, the EU stands to reap substantial gains from the  Uruguay Round agreement signed last month in Marrakesh. Tariffs  on trade between the EU and the United States will be cut almost  in half, with about 7.5 billion pounds in EU exports to the rest  of the world no longer subject to any tariffs at all.    European firms will also benefit from the opening up of a  global public procurement market estimated at 260 billion  pounds. The commission said that clearer and tighter rules on  trade and investment set out in the GATT agreement would allow  companies to operate in a more secure environment.    According to Sir Leon, the onus in the post-Uruguay Round  world will increasingly be on the business community to remove  barriers to trade. "Since nowadays the obstacles to European  exports or foreign investments are located in other economies'  domestic rules and behaviour, the paths around those obstacles  will not always be found rapidly by government to government  negotiations," he warned.</p>

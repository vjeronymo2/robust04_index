			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (1): Manufacturers' motto is 'smaller, faster, lighter' - Now the line between portable and notebook computers is hard to draw PORTABLE computers are now set to play a central role in the fast-moving drama that is the world computer industry. The evidence can be seen in the wide-ranging deal struck last month between International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, and Groupe Bull, the French national computer champion. Included as one of its more important provisions is an agreement for Bull to supply IBM with a substantial number - perhaps up to 100,000 a year - of its Zenith Data Systems (ZDS) portable computers. ZDS, bought by Bull two years ago, is, along with Toshiba of Japan, a pioneer in portable computing. The deal also provides for IBM and Bull to work together on the future development of Zenith's portable machines. IBM, is the world leader in desk-top personal computers, but it has a dismal record in portables, where innovation counts for more than market muscle. Toshiba is the market leader in portables outside Japan. The deal with Bull, therefore, plugs an important gap in IBM's product line while providing a welcome source of extra volume for the French company's manufacturing facilities. Further evidence comes from Apple Computer, the world's second largest PC company. It moved last year into 'notebook' computers, lightweight computers capable of being carried in a briefcase, and sold 100,000 of its PowerBook systems in the first three months of its fiscal year. The result was earnings well above market expectations. If further proof was necessary, newcomers to the market are electing to make portables rather than any other kind of personal computer. An example is Nippon Computer Company, a subsidiary of the Japanese giant, Nippon Steel. It is manufacturing notebook computers only, arguing that is the fastest-growing segment of the marketplace. It is also marketing its products outside Japan for the time being, hoping to build a solid market base in the West before tackling the world's most competitive notebook market. What, these days, constitutes a portable computer? In the 1970s and 1980s, it was a machine that could be transported safely in a car boot. Compaq Computer of the US pioneered many of the design and manufacturing technologies that made it possible to lug around several kilogrammes of delicate electronics without damage. The introduction of notebook machines, courtesy principally of Japanese manufacturers, capable of being carried in a briefcase, but featuring a full-size screen and keyboard, changed that perception of portable machines. Now the dividing line between portable and notebooks is difficult to draw. Performance is similar - both operate off either mains power or batteries. Both have full-sized screens and fully-featured keyboards. Both use the most powerful microprocessor chips available with memory capacity to match. The motto for computer manufacturers has become 'smaller, faster, lighter.' It is however, easier to distinguish between notebook computers and the latest variety of portable machine to attract attention: handheld, palmtop or pocket computers. These are more versatile than electronic organisers of the Sharp IQ variety, and more sophisticated than handheld terminals. Among the manufacturers of pocket-sized computers are Psion and DIP of the UK, Hewlett-Packard of the US and Poqet, a California-based company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a substantial stake. They offer many of the functions found in full-sized PCs of IBM design. The best-selling Hewlett Packard model, for example, takes the user into the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet with a single keystroke. The problem with all handhelds, however, is the miniature keyboard which makes touch-typing virtually impossible, and the small screen. Based on the best liquid crystal technology, these screens nevertheless cannot match a back-lit display for legibility. Handheld computers can have important roles in business (for example, Gallahers' use of Victor machines, see page six in this survey), but the future of portable computing seems to lie with notebooks. These light, powerful machines are winning the fight for the hearts and minds of computer users, but the battle for their pockets is proving stiffer. Like the rest of the computer industry, the portable sector has been hit by the recession in the US, parts of Europe and Australasia and by plummeting prices. Even the once-buoyant Japanese market has lost some of its bounce. The result is that explosive rates of revenue growth predicted for most areas of the portable market were not sustained through 1991. The market for notebook machines, for example, which some thought would grow by 80 per cent last year grew only about 40 per cent, according to data from IDC Europe. It suggests the overall market for portable machines in 1991 was 3.8m units and that the overall market grew by 39 per cent between 1990 and 1991. Accurate numbers are hard to come by in the computer business, however. There is, for example, wide variation between IDC's calculations and those of Market Intelligence Research (MIRC). Portable makers are, however, optimistic that there is substantial pent-up demand for their products and believe that if the economic gloom lightens, they will see substantial growth through to 1993. Their optimism is justified by the fact that that portable computers seem to be putting the 'personal' back into personal computing. A key element of the PC revolution was the freedom from dependence on the data centre that it gave individual users. Now users are seeking freedom from the physical restraints of a desk-bound machine. The breakthrough has come about through a series of advances in technology which have made it possible to buildportable machines without serious compromises over performance or price. Where a combination of portable and desktop computing is essential, there are docking pods, desktop units to receive the portable processing unit providing it with better screen, keyboard and communications with other computer systems. There are a couple of caveats: there is some way to go in power management techniques and the development of full colour, high definition screens before portable computers will be the equal of desk-top machines. High definition liquid crystal colour screens are already available, but in small quantities. They are complex to manufacture. Yields are low - less than 50 per cent, at times - and prices are high. Amstrad of the UK, one of the first of the low-cost suppliers to realise the growth potential in portables sells its ACL 386SX for Pounds 3,999 in the UK. Sharp's equivalent is Pounds 5,995; Toshiba's is Pounds 5,450. There is a market where conventional IBM clones can be had for Pounds 1,000 or less. Battery technology, despite research which has made possible nickel-metal-hydride and lithium batteries as a potential replacement for the common used nickel-cadmium cells, is advancing more slowly than any other aspect of portable computing. The most promising technique to data has been power management - controlling software which switches off the power to any part of the computer not actually being used. Rotating disk drives and illuminated screens soak up power rapidly, for example. The performance of the tiny disk drives found in portable computers has improved remarkably. IBM, for example, has developed a 3.5 inch drive which it calls 'Corsair' capable of storing a gigabyte(billion bytes) of data. In a short time, the 60 megabyte (million bytes) drives commonly found in today's portables will look like museum pieces. Rotating magnetic memory, however, may well give way to 'flash eprom', semiconductor memory which retains information stored in its circuitry even when the power is switched off. Flash memories can easily be programmed and erased. Intel of the US, the world leader in flash memory has recently signed an agreement with Sharp of Japan to develop jointly succeeding generations of flash memory chips. Announcing the deal, Mr Richard Pashley, Intel's general manager, looked forward to a portable computer less than an inch thick and weighing only about 250 grammes. At a price of Dollars 200 and with a 200-hour battery life, he thought such machines would be available by the end of the decade.</p>

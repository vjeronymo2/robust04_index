			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F> by correspondent Grazyna Bukowska in Warsaw on 27 February; from  the "Wiadomosci" bulletin--live or recorded]    [Text] [Olechowski] Good evening.    [Bukowska] Does the fact that the leaders of the Moscow  August [as heard] coup have been set free change in any way our  relations with Russia? Can this be seen as a threat to the  partnership and to our relations in general?    [Olechowski] It can constitute a threat to everyone because  it seems the situation in Russia is once again becoming tense.  Again there is conflict between the president and parliament.  There is no way one can tell how things will develop, whether  they will move toward some sort of national accord--although it  is not known what the basis for such accord would be--or whether  the situation will develop toward confrontation. I am afraid  that news developments will keep us in suspense.    However, fundamental and neighbourly relations cannot be  ruined of course. They will be influenced by the fact that we  cannot afford to--how to put it--be completely open in this  situation with regard to Russia, which we could be today in  different circumstances; provided we were internally convinced  and without any doubt that we have sorted out our own problems  with regard to relations with the West, that we knew were we  were going and what our place was.    [Bukowska] You talk about openness. Isn't it that Russia is  constantly trying to exert pressure on us and on European policy  in general. Isn't it the case that Russia wants a situation  where nothing can happen without it. Is our concept of foreign  policy toward Russia perhaps too soft? One reads these  commentaries that you are simply too soft as far as Russia is  concerned...    [Olechowski] No, it is not like this. As I said, we know  where we want to be, that we want to be part of the European  Community, NATO, and western European institutions. The fact  that Russia does not like it, that Russia does not generally  like these institutions is understandable. Russia is a great  country and a superpower. It has a different perception of the  world and, of course, would like to have an impact on  everything. It is understandable. A great country thinks in a  different way than a small country. This does not mean that we  have to change our way of thinking because our big neighbour  thinks this way. No, and that is why we have no hesitations  here. We are not faltering here. We are walking toward the  West firmly and at a steady pace each day, and we do not have to  talk about this with Russia because we are not moving in the  direction of Russia.    [Bukowska] Thank you very much for the interview.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- By the end of this  century, China will finish the construction of a major  telecommunications network composed of 16 trunk optical cable  lines, which will cover all the provincial capitals, and become  connected with the world's network.    Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said  today that the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for  telecommunications development has been initially drafted. He  said that in the new plan priority is given to construction of  long-distance optical cable networks.    According to major targets set in the plan, the ministry's  total business volume will have an annual average increase rate  of 23.7 percent, while the annual average increase rate for its  business income will be 24.2 percent.    Wu said that fulfillment of the plan will bring the national  telephone capacity from the present 42 million lines up to 140  million lines, and the national telephone availability rate will  reach eight percent, while that for urban areas will reach 30-40  percent.    In addition, mobile telephones will cover all the country's  large and medium-sized cities, as well as most of the towns,  basically realizing national automatic roaming.    The ministry will establish its own air postal route and  improve other postal facilities to shorten mail delivery time.  Meanwhile, computer networks will be established for EMS  [electronic mail system] inquiry, issuing of publications,  postal management, postal deposit and other business.    Posts and telecommunications have been experiencing the  fastest development among all the country's industries in the  past few years. Last year its increase rate reached 59 percent,  exceeding the development speed of the national economy for the  ninth successive year. An official from the ministry predicted  that this year the sector will maintain a development speed of  about 50 percent.    To ensure that the targets set in the plan be fulfilled, the  ministry has drafted a huge budget of 360 billion yuan for the  construction of posts and telecommunications infrastructures.    At present China's telecommunications capacity ranks seventh  in the world; if all these targets are hit, it will be able to  edge into the world's first three positions.</p>

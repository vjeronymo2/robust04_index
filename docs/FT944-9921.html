			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Reprieve for herbal remedies Selling herbal remedies will continue to be legal, the government announced yesterday. The Medicines Control Agency - an executive agency of the health department  -had said herbal medicines were covered by EU directives requiring their licensing. However, Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said that because herbal medicines were made by traditional processes, and not 'industrially produced' as required by the directives, they could be exempted.</p>

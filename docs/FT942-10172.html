			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / US Court appointment close President Bill Clinton's search for a new Supreme Court justice to succeed the retiring Harry Blackmun, on which an announcement is imminent, appears to have narrowed to a shortlist of three. All white male law graduates of Harvard University, they comprise, in uncertain order of preference, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior, and two sitting federal judges, Richard Arnold from Arkansas and Stephen Breyer from Massachusetts. Also said to be not out of the final running are Judges Jose Cabranes from Connecticut and Amalya Kearse from New York. The late entrant into the short list is Judge Breyer, 55, the federal appeals court judge based in Boston, who got as far as an interview with the president last summer before he settled on Mrs Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the Court. His re-emergence as a candidate reflects both his high reputation as a consensus-building jurist and some problems with picking either Judge Arnold or Mr Babbitt. Mr Arnold, 58 and chief judge on the federal appeals court based in Little Rock, is known for the distinguished quality of his written legal opinions, which have generally remained sufficiently in the broad mainstrean to have impressed Democrats and Republicans alike. He is a former law clerk to retired Justice William Brennan, the liberal jurist still influential behind the scenes of the Court, and an old acquaintance of Mr Clinton. But doubts have been raised about his health (he suffers from lymphoma and takes periodic radiation treatment) and his state of origin. Mr Clinton could be accused of cronyism for choosing him and may be reluctant to subject Arkansas, already under the Whitewater miscroscope, to further minute examination. Some women's groups have questioned his commitment to preserving the right to abortion. Mr Babbitt, 55 and a former governor of Arizona, is the sort of 'real world politician' Mr Clinton has often said he would like to see on the Court, much in the manner of the late chief justice Earl Warren, who served from 1953-69. Mr Babbitt, like Judge Breyer, was considered last year and had appeared to take his name out of consideration when Justice Blackmun retired. But it is his politics which have attracted opposition, noteably from Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, ranking Republican on the judiciary committee. He charged Mr Babbitt would be liable to influence by the 'far left' and predicted Western senators, long unhappy with his environmental policies at the interior department, would oppose him. But two of these, Democrats Harry Reid from Nevada and Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado, promised to back Mr Babbitt.</p>

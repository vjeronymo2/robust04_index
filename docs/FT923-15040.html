			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Danes tighten controls on imported pigs DANISH PIG farmers have set up an extensive system of controls to prevent any contamination of their herds by imported pigs. The system is a reaction to the introduction from July 1 of free trade in live animals across borders between European Community countries. The Danes are the biggest EC exporters of pigmeat to non-community countries, especially Japan and the US, which set stringent veterinary conditions. The US will not permit the import of any Danish pigmeat if it includes as much a single pig imported to Denmark from other EC countries, said Mr Bent Sloth, chairman of the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses. The slaughterhouses' and pig farmers' organisations, in co-operation with the government and with the authorisation of the European Commission, have imposed a system by which all imported animals must be ear-marked and no pigs can be sent to slaughter from any herd containing an imported pig. Chicago markets were closed yesterday for a pre-Independence Day holiday</p>

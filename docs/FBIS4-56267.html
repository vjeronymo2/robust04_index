			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Sixto Duran-Ballen on </F> legislative and municipal elections with unidentified reporters  at the Presidency on 1 May; broadcast in progress -- recorded]    [Text] [Duran-Ballen] For the time being, we have a bloc of  eight deputies, but we will confirm this in a few hours when we  have the results of today's democratic exercise. Even if we add  the remaining deputies to that figure, the number is lower than  we have had as far back as 1992. But the number of our deputies  has not been reduced to the extent reported in the country. The  attitude of the 15 other parties has not been to go to Congress  to make specific proposals. No. Their only goal has been to  oppose the current government. They have not presented any  proposals nor have they been constructive. They were bent on  destroying the government's image. The fact that we have the  number of deputies you people say we will have, although we did  not elect even one deputy in some provinces, the two lists  constitute substantial proof of support. That means that the  people in general, the majority within the center-right option,  favor changes like restructuring the economy, changing the  political stand, and creating more jobs. The people have seen  that this is what my government has been doing.    [Reporter] What can you say about today's political victory,  Mr. President, considering that, as you say, there has been  [words indistinct]?    [Duran-Ballen] We cannot talk about a political victory or  say that the opposition has won. There is an anticipated  result, which will depend on the spirit with which the deputies  will work at the National Congress and in the provincial and  canton councils over the next two years.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you say that all parties have  banded together to campaign against the government. There is no  doubt that the number of votes received by the government  parties represents a rejection of the government's policy. It  seems that not all the people are aware of what your government  is doing.    [Duran-Ballen] Well, I cannot expect uniform acceptance by  the Ecuadoran people. If I asked any one of you whether my work  as mayor of Quito was positive, you would probably say yes.  Well, this very same thing has happened to me halfway through  my term. There has been a reaction. The people could not see  the purpose of planning and the administrative and financial  reorganization of Quito municipality. I had the same reaction  to the government in general.    [Reporter] The majority of the next Congress will be in the  opposition [words indistinct].    [Duran-Ballen] No. The people are aware that the only goal  of  the parties in Congress has been to oppose the government's  work. At some time, not only the Social Christian Party has  cooperated with the government. Several deputies have supported  government proposals because they found them reasonable and were  convinced that the country urgently required these proposals to  advance.    [Reporter] Do you expect a similar stand now that a letter  of  intent has been sent to Congress so the obligation with the IMF  can be paid?    [Duran-Ballen] I would not talk about an obligation with the  IMF. I would talk about commitments with the country,  commitments we have told the IMF that we would try to fulfill.  It is worth clarifying, however, that the IMF has not set  terms. Quite the opposite is true. I have explained this a  number of times. Any country's letter of intent to the IMF  represents a pledge by the country to solve its economic  problems in the near future. Consequently, there are no  impositions other than those that we have placed on ourselves.    [Reporter] Will the government be able to do all that has  been planned?    [Duran-Ballen] Regarding the aspects that depend solely on  the executive branch, we will continue to do everything we had  in mind, just as we have been doing. [words indistinct]    [Reporter] Mr. President, there is no doubt that the number  of votes received by the government parties is disappointing.  What do you think has been your worst mistake in these two  years? Do you think it should be corrected in the remaining two  years of your term?    [Duran-Ballen] I would not describe those actions as  mistakes  but rather as an outside assessment of what we have done. The  country, including my fellow party members, and the media  expected the economic situation we received to be corrected. We  have made decisions to keep the number of bureaucrats low. This  decision, not only to keep the number from rising but to reduce  it, had never been made before. That is a positive step for the  country. The economic reorganization we have been implementing  is already yielding results. Consequently, a number of loans  will be signed with the World Bank and Inter-American  Development Bank in a few months. Some loans have already been  signed with the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and  the Andean Development Corporation. All of these loans without  exception are for development, exclusively to be invested in  projects and services that mean recovery for the country. None  of these loans is for administrative expenditures. The only way  we could have achieved these things is by doing what we have  been doing in these [words indistinct].    [Reporter] You said no tangible results have been achieved  in  the first two years.    [Duran-Ballen] There are tangible results.    [Reporter] But not tangible enough.    [Duran-Ballen] I invite you to take any aspect and compare  what my government has done with what previous governments did.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Duran-Ballen] Let us consider the current road construction  and maintenance programs. Tell me if the number of kilometers of  highways in 1988 through 1990 is comparable to the present  number. I am asking you to dig out the figures. You have to  have the figures to make an accurate assessment.    [Reporter] My question is specific, Mr. President. What can  the Ecuadoran people expect considering that you explained  [words indistinct]? What will those results be?    [Duran-Ballen] In these first years, we have been  reorganizing the economy and reducing the number of government  employees. As a result, we have access to international loans  from institutions and countries. We can move greater internal  resources and devote all of them to our economic development.    [Reporter] What exactly can the people expect from the  government?    [Duran-Ballen] I would like to invite you or any one of the  people here to come with me and tour the construction programs,  not necessarily of this government, and tell me whether this  reorganization has not had good results. Tell me if there are no  additional jobs, which we intended. There has been an opening to  international trade, and exports have increased.    [Reporter] It has been said that inflation goes down but  that  prices go up. It is said the number of jobs has increased but  that there are no jobs.    [Duran-Ballen] How can you say there are no jobs? Who is  building the highways? Who is working on the various programs  in the provinces? I repeat: Let us compare any two years of  any of the previous governments with the first two years of my  government.    [Reporter] Mr. President, how can you ....    [Duran-Ballen, interrupting] If there are fewer projects,  then I would agree with you that there are fewer jobs.    [Reporter] Have more jobs been created?    [Duran-Ballen] Of course, many more jobs have been created,  but there are fewer jobs in the public sector. I refuse and  will continue to refuse to consider the public sector as the  only source of employment in the country, as reporters seem to  believe.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you have been talking about the  government's work. How do you interpret the inconsistency  between what the people think, what has been expressed against  the government today, and what you say? Unfortunately, you seem  to speak a different language than the people. Is your  government completely impossible to understand?    [Duran-Ballen] I shall go back to the time when I was mayor  of Quito. For the first months, the first year of the first two  years, everyone said the same thing. When I started to  reorganize the real estate registry and charge fees, which had  not been collected before, when we started to outline a rational  plan to pave streets, establish services, and extend electrical  energy, no one saw or believed. There was a reaction. Now, if  I ask you -- unless you do not reside in Quito -- you would say  the projects carried out in Quito were many and real.  Otherwise, I am saying something different from the truth and  deceiving the people.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 5, SHOOTS BROTHER, FRIEND;  </P> <P> FREAK ANAHEIM ACCIDENT OCCURS WHILE CHILDREN ARE ALONE  </P> <P> A 5-year-old boy shot and wounded his older brother and a playmate with a  single bullet Wednesday in a freak accident that happened while the boys were  left unattended, police said.  </P> <P> Police said the shooting occurred about 2:30 p.m. in a quiet apartment complex  on the 600 block of West Broadway as Katherine McGuire's sons were playing with  a neighbor boy.  </P> <P> Michelle Sinescu, 22, who lives next door, said she was watching television  when she heard a single gunshot. She ran out the door and saw McGuire's  youngest son standing in the open doorway of his apartment, facing outdoors,  holding a black .38-caliber handgun in his right hand.  </P> <P> "He looked at me and said, 'Please help us,' " Sinescu said. "At first, I  thought he was going to shoot me. Then, I saw his brother lying on the carpet  inside with blood all over, and he said, 'Help me.' I realized they were  playing with a gun and the little one shot him."  </P> <P> Sinescu said she darted into the McGuires' apartment, where Edgar McGuire, 11,  was on the floor, bleeding from a bullet wound to the chest, and Oscar Flores,  10, a boy from another building in the complex, was sitting on a couch with a  bullet lodged in his right shoulder.  </P> <P> Both boys were taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where Oscar was in  serious but stable condition Wednesday evening, said hospital spokeswoman Betty  Chrisco. Edgar's condition was not released at the request of his mother.  </P> <P> Katherine McGuire and Oscar's parents, Margarita and Hector Flores, declined to  be interviewed.  </P> <P> Wednesday's shooting was the latest in a series non-gang-related incidents  involving youths and guns. Since September, there have been at least five other  shootings, four of them fatal.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said the latest incident occurred after the two  older boys found the handgun in a box in McGuire's bedroom.  </P> <P> "They had evidently taken the gun out, looked it over, laid it down and left  the apartment for a very short period of time," Barry said. "When they came  back, lo and behold, there stands the 5-year-old in the living room, and he has  the gun in his hand."  </P> <P> The older boys, one standing behind the other, screamed at the 5-year-old to  put the gun down, but "that may have startled or confused him, and in the  process of maneuvering it, he set it off," Barry said.  </P> <P> Barry said there is "no doubt" the shooting was an accident. The 5-year-old,  whose name was withheld, was taken into protective custody, interviewed by  police and turned over to Orangewood Children's Home for counseling, Barry  said. He said police are continuing their investigation.  </P> <P> Sinescu said she had rarely seen McGuire, who is deaf, since she and her sons  moved into the complex from Canoga Park on July 1. But whenever she saw the  boys, they appeared to be unsupervised, Sinescu said.  </P> <P> "It looked to me like those kids were living there by themselves," Sinescu  said.  </P> <P> Debbie Devine, manager of the Summerhill Plaza apartment complex, said McGuire,  who communicates with her through written notes, "seems very nice." But Devine  said she rarely sees her. She said McGuire does not work and subsists on  government aid.  </P> <P> "I don't know where she goes," Devine said. "Sometimes she swims with her boys  in the pool here around 5 in the evening. The neighbors say those kids are real  rambunctious, though. They're always playing music loud, late at night."  </P> <P> Devine said McGuire arrive home about half an hour after the shooting. Once the  boys were on their way to the hospital, a neighbor broke the news of the  shooting to Margarita Flores, Devine said.  </P> <P> "She was hysterical," Devine said. "All she could say was, 'Oh my God, oh my  God.' "  </P> <P> Devine said Oscar is well-known and liked throughout the complex.  </P> <P> "He's a wonderful little boy," Devine said. "He's probably the nicest boy who  lives here."  </P> <P> Neighbors described the salmon-colored, 162-unit complex as quiet, populated  mostly by singles and couples who work. There are about a dozen small children  in the complex.  </P> <P> "This kind of thing has never happened before," Devine said. "It's  unbelievable."  </P></p>

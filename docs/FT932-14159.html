			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Money Markets: France cuts two rates FRENCH FRANC futures rose modestly yesterday after the Bank of France cut its intervention rate for the first time in five months, writes James Blitz. The French authorities lowered their intervention rate, which sets the floor for money market rates, from 9.10 per cent to 8.75 per cent. This was the first time that the intervention rate had been cut since November 12 last year. The French authorities also reduced the 5 to 10-day lending rate, which sets the ceiling for money market rates, from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent. The move, announced before European markets opened yesterday morning, triggered an immediate rise in French franc futures prices. The June contract, which closed at 91.76 on Friday night, opened at 91.87, peaked at 91.94 and ended at 91.89. The cost of borrowing funds in the French franc cash market also fell back. Three-month French cash closed at around 8.63 per cent, having finished at some 9 per cent last Friday. Dealers are clearly bullish about the prospect of more reductions in French rates before the summer, believing it will soon be followed by more easing. The June Pibor contract was last night pricing three-month money at 8.03 per cent, some 60 basis points below the level of three-month cash. The French franc's strong performance in the wake of the cut has also further reduced the premium required by dealers for holding French francs over D-Marks. The differential between three-month German and French cash yesterday was down to 73 basis points. At the height of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism it was as high as 400 basis points. Some dealers were also assuming yesterday that the cut in French rates might herald further easing in the Bundesbank's official rates. The June Euromark contract rose some 3 basis points on the day to close at 92.74. Nevertheless, reasons remain for being cautious about predicting further rate declines in Europe. Sterling markets were quiet after last week's reduced expectations of a base rate reduction. Three-month rates closed softer at 6 per cent from a previous 6 1/16 per cent. The June short sterling contract finished a basis point down on the day at 93.92.</p>

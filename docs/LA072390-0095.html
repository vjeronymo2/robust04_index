			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> JOVIAL'S FIRST RACE ON DIRT RESULTS IN NARROW VICTORY IN SWAPS STAKES  </P> <P> It's unlikely that Jovial and Silver Ending, the first two horses across the  wire in Sunday's $210,000 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park, will meet again soon.  </P> <P> Jovial, a horse whose six-race career had been strictly on grass before Sunday,  has found a home on the dirt. And Silver Ending, despite winning the Arkansas  Derby and one other stake on dirt, is going to return to the grass as soon as  trainer Ron McAnally can find a spot for him.  </P> <P> Jovial, with a rush from the outside under Gary Stevens, beat Silver Ending by  a neck, and it was 3 1/2 lengths farther back to Stalwart Charger, who went off  a 3-5 favorite in the crowd of 24,723 after three consecutive stakes victories.  </P> <P> "My horse was in a good position at the top of the stretch, and then there was  no response," said Pico Perdomo, who trains Stalwart Charger. "He's supposed to  take off, but he didn't do it today. Maybe something happened to him. Maybe  nothing happened, and he just got beat."  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay, who had ridden Stalwart Charger for the first time on July 1,  when they won the Silver Screen Handicap, also seemed puzzled.  </P> <P> "All I know is that he didn't want to open up on those other horses at the  quarter pole," Pincay said. "I thought I could open up on the field, and they  would have to come and get me. The last part, he felt like he got tired. I  really don't know why he stopped like that at the end."  </P> <P> Running slow fractions, Stalwart Charger made the lead and held it until the  horses straightened out for the stretch run. Silver Ending, never far back in  second place, took over near the eighth pole, but Jovial was running even  faster on his right flank and edged ahead with about 40 yards left. Silver  Ending tried to come back, but Jovial wasn't quitting.  </P> <P> Jovial, the third choice behind Stalwart Charger and Silver Ending in the  four-horse field, paid $8.60 and $3.80 with no show betting and was clocked for  1 1/4 miles in 2:01 1/5. Silver Ending, carrying 126 pounds, six more than  Jovial, paid $3.80 to place.  </P> <P> Owned by Jack Munari, a Paso Robles real estate man, and trained by Bruce  Jackson, Jovial earned $120,000, which was about $17,000 more than the  English-bred colt had collected while winning three of six starts on grass.  Jovial's career began last year with with three races in Europe and he had won  his last two starts at Hollywood Park, including the Cinema Handicap on June  10.  </P> <P> Munari and Jackson used to race quarter horses together. Several years ago,  they won the Rainbow Derby, a $600,000 race, at Ruidoso Downs with Corporate  Bug, a horse they had claimed for $12,500.  </P> <P> "Jovial's breeding (Northern Jove and Rensaler, a Stop the Music mare)  indicated that he might like dirt, and we've been working three months to get  him ready for the dirt," Jackson said. "We sure picked the right time to try  him on dirt."  </P> <P> Stevens, who won the Arkansas Derby with Silver Ending in April, has won six  races in the last two days to virtually clinch the season's riding title at  Hollywood. Going into the last day today, he has 59 wins, three more than Pat  Valenzuela and four more than Pincay.  </P> <P> Stevens is three for three on Jovial. "When I worked this horse in company (on  dirt), he wasn't bothered by dirt hitting him in the face," Stevens said. "The  first time he worked in company, it didn't bother him. I was surprised that he  handled the dirt as well as he did.  </P> <P> "He's an awesome colt. He made the lead today a lot easier than I thought he  would."  </P> <P> Jovial came back coughing from one of those dirt workouts, and an endoscopic  examination showed that he had bled internally. That enabled Jackson to run him  on Lasix, the bleeder medication, in the Swaps.  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye rode Silver Ending for the first time. "I was surprised that  my horse made as long a run as he did, and he galloped out strong, too,"  Delahoussaye said. "Knowing that, I might have gotten into him at the  three-eighths pole and maybe been a little more gung-ho about it. I had seen  some of the horse's races on tape, but you never know sometimes until you ride  the horse."  </P> <P> The only time Silver Ending has been on grass, he won an allowance race at  Hollywood last fall. Since his fifth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby,  McAnally has been saying that the Silver Hawk colt would like grass better.  </P> <P> "I didn't know whether to run in the Swaps," McAnally said. "But the way the  race came up, I figured there was just one horse (Stalwart Charger) to beat. I  wasn't sure about that horse (Jovial) coming off the grass. My horse will be  going on the grass from here. Definitely."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Like Jovial, Steinlen is another grass specialist who will be switched to dirt.  Steinlen, who has made only one start on dirt, has been added to the field for  the Arlington Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. Steinlen, last year's male grass  champion, won the Caesars International Saturday at Atlantic City. In his only  dirt race, Steinlen finished seventh at Santa Anita in March of 1988. . . .  Hollywood Park's stewards lectured owner Jay Goldinger, who appeared in the  winner's circle Sunday with a for-sale sign after his Putting, running for a  $75,000 claiming price, won the seventh race. A multiple stakes winner, Putting  has won 10 of 45 races and earned almost $800,000. "We frowned on what  Goldinger did," steward Tom Ward said. "The trainer (Julio Canani) apparently  wasn't part of it. It looked like he didn't even want to be in the (winner's  circle) picture because of the sign."  </P> <P> Bill Shoemaker's on a hot streak, with four wins from his last eight runners.  Dean, a 2-year-old colt, won Sunday to give Shoemaker his fifth training win in  17 starts. . . . Richard Mandella saddled two winners, tying him with Ron  McAnally for second place in the standings. They are one winner behind Wayne  Lukas, who has 22 wins for the meet.  </P> <P> Bel Air Paster was scratched from the Swaps. . . . Kent Desormeaux, riding Toby  Jug, claimed foul against Stalwart Charger and Laffit Pincay for interference  on the far turn, but the stewards ruled that there was no effect on the final  order of finish. . . . Bel Air Paster is entered in the second division of the  Oceanside Stakes, the opening-day feature at Del Mar on Wednesday. . . . Today  at Hollywood, Petite Ile tries to become the second female to win the Sunset  Handicap and trainer Charlie Whittingham, who saddles Live the Dream, tries to  win the stake for the 11th time. The only female to win the Sunset was Typecast  in 1972.  </P></p>

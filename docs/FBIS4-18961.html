			<p>BFN     [Text] Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjorck says the  Bosnian Serbs must know NATO will take even tougher action  against them if the Serbs directly attack the UN peacekeeping  troops. Sweden supports the NATO raids even if Sweden is not a  member of the defense alliance. Swedish troops are part of the  Nordic UN battalion now serving in Bosnia.</p>

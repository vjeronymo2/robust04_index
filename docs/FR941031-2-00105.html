(``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change providing for technical amendments to the NASD's transaction reporting rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD has designated this proposal as constituting a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the administration and enforcement of existing reporting rules, permitting it to become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD is proposing a rule change that effects a technical amendment to the existing transaction reporting rules. The amendatory language specifies that transaction data reported via Form T shall be sent to the NASD's Market Surveillance Department of Rockville, Maryland. Specifically, the reporting provisions of Parts X, XI, XII and XIII of Schedule D, and Section 2 of Schedule G to the NASD By-Laws are amended to reflect that transaction data reported via Form T shall be reported to the NASD's Market Surveillance Department in Rockville, Maryland, rather than to the Market Operations Department in Trumbull, Connecticut. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 11, 1994, the Commission approved a series of parallel changes to the NASD rules governing transaction reporting in Nasdaq National Market <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &reg; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  securities, Nasdaq SmallCap <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> SM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  securities, Nasdaq convertible debt securities, over-the-counter equity securities, and exchange-listed securities eligible for inclusion in the Consolidated Quotations Service. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Essentially, these amendments eliminated the manually prepared Form T as the principal means of reporting transactions in the foregoing categories of securities when such transactions are executed outside normal market hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. E.T.) or outside the hours of the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') (currently 9:00 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. E.T.). Instead, the covered transactions will be reported electronically through ACT either on trade date or the next business day. Nevertheless, the amended rules still permit the use of Form T in the event of a system outage or other unusual circumstance that precludes electronic entry of trade reports by a member firm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34527 (August 11, 1994); 59 FR 42613 (August 18, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The sole purpose of this rule change is to specify that the Forms T be directed to the NASD's Market Surveillance Department in Rockville, Maryland rather than the Market Operations Department in Trumbull, Connecticut. The Market Surveillance Department compiles and utilizes Form T data for regulatory purposes. At this point, there is no longer any operational reason for the Market Operations Department to be the initial recipient of Form T data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that this proposed rule is consistent with Section 15A(b)(2) and (b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(2) requires that a national securities association be appropriately organized and have the capacity to enforce member firms' compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act as well as its own rules. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the association's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The instant rule change is consistent with these statutory provisions because it will expedite the receipt of Form T transaction data, which is collected and analyzed for regulatory purposes, by the department responsible for that regulatory function. Hence, the end result is greater efficiency in the processing of Forms T by the NASD's Market Surveillance staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were neither solicited nor received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b&hyph;4 because the proposal has been filed as constituting a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

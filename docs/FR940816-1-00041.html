Where the relationships between individual sources and air quality are relatively well defined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Where the emission control systems utilized (e.g., at major point sources) will result in swift and dramatic emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in those areas where the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problem is attributed to a few stationary sources, RFP should be met by ``adherence to an ambitious compliance schedule'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is likely to periodically yield significant emission reductions. Adherence to ``an ambitious compliance schedule'' does not necessarily mean that it would be unreasonable to achieve annual incremental emission reductions or generally linear progress, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, ``Guidance Document for Correction of Part D SIP's for Nonattainment Areas,'' Research Triangle Park, NC, January 27, 1984, page 25.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SIP's for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must include detailed schedules for compliance with emission regulations in the areas and accurately indicate the corresponding annual emission reductions to be realized from each milestone in the schedule. In reviewing the SIP, EPA will determine whether the annual incremental emission reductions to be achieved are reasonable in light of the statutory objective to ensure timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. Additionally, EPA believes that it is appropriate to require early implementation of the most cost-effective control measures (e.g., controlling fugitive dust emissions at the stationary source) while phasing in the more expensive control measures, such as those involving the installation of new hardware.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 189(c) provides that the quantitative milestones submitted by a State for an area also must be consistent with RFP for the area. Thus, EPA will determine an area's compliance with RFP in conjunction with determining its compliance with the quantitative milestone requirement. Because RFP is an annual emission reduction requirement and the quantitative milestones are to be achieved every 3 years, when a State demonstrates an area's compliance with the quantitative milestone requirement, it should also demonstrate that RFP has been achieved during each of the relevant 3 years. Thus, the discussion of quantitative milestones below refers to the ``RFP/milestone'' submittal dates, achievement dates and demonstration (or reporting) requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Quantitative Milestones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Nature of Quantitative Milestones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP's are to contain quantitative milestones (see section 189(c)). These quantitative milestones should consist of elements which allow progress to be quantified or measured. Specifically, States should identify and submit quantitative milestones providing for the amount of emission reductions adequate to achieve the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. The following are examples of measures which support and demonstrate how the overall quantitative milestones identified for an area may be met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Percent implementation of various control strategies (e.g., pave 50 percent of culpable streets, replace 75 percent of residential wood heaters with natural gas heating units).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Percent compliance with implemented control measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Adherence to a compliance schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. RFP/Milestone Due Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP's are to contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment. There is a gap in the law in that the text of section 189(c) does not articulate the starting point for counting the 3-year period. The EPA believes it is reasonable to begin counting the 3-year milestone deadline from the due date (and not the submittal date) for the applicable moderate area implementation plan revision (see section III.C.1.(f) of the General Preamble (57 FR 13539) for an explanation of why EPA believes it is appropriate to begin counting the 3-year milestone deadline from the SIP due date).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first ``RFP/milestone'' achievement date for those areas initially designated as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 by operation of law when the Act was amended will be the moderate area attainment date of December 31, 1994, as stated in section III.C.1.f. of the General Preamble (57 FR 13539). The RFP/milestone achievement date would normally be November 15, 1994, 3 years after the SIP due date of November 15, 1991. The achievement date was delayed 46 days, however, because the de minimis timing differential between the attainment date and the literal first milestone date made it administratively impracticable and of trivial value to require separate milestones and attainment demonstrations for these areas. Thus, for these initial areas that demonstrate timely attainment, EPA's policy is to deem the emission reductions progress made between the SIP submittal due date and the attainment date as sufficient to satisfy the first milestone requirement (57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus the initial RFP/milestone will be met by showing that emission reductions scheduled to be made between the SIP due date and the attainment date for these moderate areas were actually achieved. Most of the emission reductions will result from implementation of RACM (including RACT) adopted as part of the moderate area SIP. The Act requires that RACM be implemented by December 10, 1993 in the initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (see section 189(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

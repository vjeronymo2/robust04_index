			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Politically rudderless, Milan remains afloat - Haig Simonian casts an eye over a lethargic bourse marking time until the Italian presidential election IN a country without a head of state, prime minister or government, probably the biggest surprise is that the Milan bourse has not gone into freefall. This achievement, however, must be seen against a background of painfully thin trading, which has made equity business for all but the biggest of the new-style Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim) highly unprofitable. Substantial fixed costs have only been covered thanks to record trading volumes on the fixed-income side for those Sims which are also active in government bonds. But for brokers focused on equities, it has been another story. The April 5 general election, which showed a sharp drop in support for Italy's established parties, has created a period of political uncertainty as party leaders scramble to consider possible new alliances. But last week's surprise resignation of President Francesco Cossiga has led the country into uncharted territory, even by Italian political standards. A new president is to be elected on May 13. Once in office, the new head of state will have to nominate a prime minister, who will try to form a government in a parliament in which 16 parties are represented. The stock market is therefore marking time. Daily volume has sometimes fallen below L50bn (Dollars 40.4m), and the only interest has tended to come from the few foreigners still willing to take a punt on Italian stocks. The Sims have been suffering. With over half their budgets allocated to staff costs, even brokers with a sizeable market share are unable to make money. Some blame the market's lethargy on more than just short-term political factors. Mr Giovanni Borghi, managing director of Intercassa, the Sim owned by Cariplo, the big Milan savings bank, and 25 smaller savings institutions, points to last year's introduction of capital gains tax. This triggered a drop in trading volumes, despite the arrival this year of new rules limiting the possibilities for off-floor trading, which should have led to a substantial increase in recorded turnover. 'The tax dampened speculation between operators on the floor, who traded partly on rumours,' says Mr Borghi. 'Its introduction has had a much bigger role than many expected.' Poor corporate profits have also depressed the market. Higher dividends this week from Italgas, the fast-expanding gas and water group, and Eridania, Ferruzzi's agro-industrial subsidiary, were welcome exceptions. But within hours of their figures, Marzotto, Italy's biggest textiles and clothing company which last year bought control of Hugo Boss in Germany, announced a cut in its dividend because of current difficulties in the sector. Not surprisingly, brokers have been looking for scapegoats. The most popular has been Consob, the stock market watchdog. As part of Italy's stock market reforms, it set rules last year for off-floor trading large blocks of shares. The block market has seen some huge transactions in recent weeks, just as business on the floor has languished. Moreover, some deals have been executed at prices much higher those prevailing on the bourse. The most striking example involved Alenia, the state-controlled aerospace group. About 1.1m of its shares changed hands at L3,169 - some 50 per cent above the market price. Other controversial block transactions have involved Euromobiliare, the merchant bank whose majority shareholder is Midland Bank of the UK, and the newly-quoted San Paolo di Torino. Though in line with market prices, the San Paolo deal amounted to around L109bn - more than total turnover on the floor that day. Dealers ascribe the higher prices to inter-company transactions, probably for tax purposes or to avoid a write-down on the balance sheet. Such use of the block market has angered brokers, and has led to calls for the minimum size of transactions which can be done off the floor to be raised. Consob has promised to look into the matter. But in response to the criticism, it points out that the instances of large blocks of shares changing hands at above market prices have been limited. In some cases, it adds, the price difference had been within 10 per cent of that quoted on the bourse. And in other examples, the deals had taken place 'for motives not linked to normal trading' on the securities market, and had only been made public because they had taken place via a Sim. Activity on the floor has been limited to Italy's biggest companies. Shares associated with Mr Carlo De Benedetti went on a two-day roller-coaster ride after he was sentenced to over six years in jail for his alleged role in the Banco Ambrosiano collapse, but have since recovered. And Pirelli's stock has been bought by investors who believe that, having fallen so heavily, it now has only one way to go.</p>

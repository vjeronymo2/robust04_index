			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (7): A story that ought to be discounted - Hotel Deals HAVE YOU heard the one about the man who walked into one of London's top hotels, said he was prepared to pay no more than Pounds 50 a night and was offered one of the best rooms in the house? The story, or a variation of it (the man sometimes offers Pounds 75) has been doing the rounds throughout the current recession. As in all the best stories, however, the man who paid Pounds 50 a night is difficult to track down. He is invariably a friend of a second cousin or a neighbour of a colleague and his name proves oddly elusive. Mr Michael Ball, marketing director of Utell International, which handles sales and reservations for 6,500 hotels worldwide, says the wilder discounting stories began to circulate during the Gulf War, when some hoteliers began to panic. But one of the remarkable features of 1991 as a whole was that while hotel occupancies plunged, the cost of staying in them increased. Mean average room occupancy in London hotels fell 11.3 points last year to 63.7 per cent last year, according to a survey by Horwath, the hotel and leisure consultants. But the achieved average room rate rose 9.5 per cent to Pounds 81.62. Even in London's luxury hotels, where occupancy fell 14.9 points to 56.4 per cent, average room rates rose 5 per cent to Pounds 175.06. In England as a whole, room occupancy fell 6 points to 51 per cent. Room rates rose at a slightly higher level than inflation, increasing 4.7 per cent to Pounds 51.79. Although huge discounts might not be available, companies and travelling employees should not regard the official rates as immutable. The Horwath survey says: 'A discount culture prevails among consumers and published tariffs continue to show significant disparities when compared with achieved room rates.' That many companies need to reduce their hotel expenditure is not in doubt. Mr Peter Haigh, Marriott's sales and marketing director for the UK and Ireland, tells the story of the corporate travel manager at a US bank who has been instructed to reduce his expenditure by 40 per cent. For US companies, the weak dollar represents an additional problem, with managers who travel to regions with stronger currencies having to pay more. Some hotels in the UK, which rely on the US for much of their business, have attempted to make life easier for travelling Americans. The Savoy Group, which gets 50 per cent of its customers from the US, began last November to offer American guests rooms at a fixed exchange rate of Dollars 1.70 to the pound. Executives in the travel industry say there are several ways in which companies can reduce the amount they spend on hotel bills. Mr J. J. Doran, head of travel development for Asia, the Middle East and Africa at travel agents Thomas Cook, says it is generally easier to cut hotel costs than to reduce the cost of flying. Despite the range of air fares on offer, there is a greater variety of hotel rates. Mr Ball says all hotel customers should inquire whether hotels offer a corporate rate, which can be 10 per cent less than the posted price. The corporate rate is not only available to guests from large companies. Increasingly, he says, the corporate rate is obtainable by 'virtually anyone with a briefcase'. Managers in the industry say that companies should also find ways of maximising their bargaining power with hotel groups. Even relatively small hotels now have computer systems which enable them to assess who their most frequent and loyal customers are. These are the companies that get the most attractive discounts and there are ways of becoming a favoured customer. The more a company uses a hotel, the more likely it is to get a larger discount. Mr Doran says companies should look at how many hotels they use in each city. It is usually possible to reduce the number and ensure that more employees stay at fewer hotels. But Marriott's Mr Haigh says that the number of room nights booked by companies is not the only factor that hotels look at when deciding how big the discount should be. Another important factor is when the customers use the hotels. Companies which book their managers into hotels during busy periods only are not as attractive as those who travel all year round. December and January are lean times for hotels. Companies that use the hotel during these months and other quiet periods can usually strike good deals for the year as a whole. Whether or not companies should decide to eschew expensive hotels altogether is a more difficult decision. Some worry that customers and potential customers will not take company managers seriously unless they are staying in a leading hotel. Tourist industry officials, however, say that many visitors are staying at cheaper hotels than they might have used in the past. Mr William Davis, chairman of the British Tourist Authority, says: 'There is a notable tendency to trade down. Many overseas visitors are looking for cheaper accommodation, cutting their length of stay, or even staying with friends and relations.' Although the last option is probably not open to many corporate customers, the Horwath survey also found evidence of business travellers staying in cheaper hotels. Mr Doran says companies should decide which of their travelling employees need to stay in expensive hotels and which could stay in cheaper establishments without affecting the standing of the company. Less high profile employees might not need the status and services of a luxury hotel and might, in any event, welcome the opportunity to stay somewhere less pretentious and more comfortable.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco in CDollars 145m plan to replace Trail smelter Cominco, the Vancouver-based metals producer, will spend CDollars 145m (USDollars 106.5m) to replace the lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia, which has failed to meet expectations since it was installed four years ago. Cominco has abandoned the German technology, known as QSL, on which the troubled facility was based. Instead, it has turned to a process known as Kivcet, which is in use at a smelter in Kazakhstan. The QSL technology was supplied by Lurgi, a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and industrial group. Cominco has demanded compensation for the failed technology. An official said negotiations with Lurgi were continuing. Cominco also announced a CDollars 25m plan to expand zinc production at Trail, which is one of the world's largest metallurgical complexes. The two projects will increase Trail's annual lead smelting capacity from 100,000 to 120,000 tonnes, and zinc capacity from 290,000 to 320,000 tonnes. The Kivcet lead smelter, which is expected to be commissioned in 1996, will reduce lead emissions by 70-80 per cent and alleviate another pollution concern by consuming large stockpiles of residues. The expansions have been delayed by wrangling between Cominco and the British Columbia authorities over indirect taxes and the ownership of two hydro-electric dams near Trail owned by Cominco. As part of the decision to go ahead with the Trail expansion, the province will pay Cominco CDollars 51.5m for the rights to expand the dams' generating capacity. Cominco will retain a 15 per cent interest in income from the dams, starting once the lead and zinc expansion projects have been paid off. The QSL smelter operated briefly after it was completed in late 1989, but has been idle since March 1990.</p>

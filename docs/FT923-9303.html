			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / GKN beats forecasts with 37% increase GKN, the UK automotive components, engineering and industrial services group, increased its pre-tax profits by 37 per cent in the first six months of the year to Pounds 65.1m from Pounds 47.5m in the same period a year ago. The performance exceeded market forecasts. However, GKN's share price fell 12p to close at 383p as Sir David Lees, chairman, warned of little improvement in its markets in the next few months. GKN's profits rise follows a 26 per cent increase in profits earlier this week of BBA, the UK automotive, aviation and industrial components maker. GKN turnover rose only 1.2 per cent to Pounds 1.258bn. Higher demand in automotive markets in continental Europe and north America was offset by weakness in the construction sectors in the UK, Australia and California. The GKN balance sheet remains strong, and the group had a positive cash flow in the first six months with net interest charges cut to Pounds 11.9m from Pounds 16m a year ago. It is maintaining an unchanged interim dividend of 8p. Earnings per share jumped to 10.9p from 7.6p in the first half of 1991. Sir David said the group expected little improvement in demand in its main markets in the next few months. 'Profit improvement must come from increases in market share and continued rigorous attention to costs and asset management.' The workforce has fallen 7.5 per cent in the past 18 months. Profits from car components were increased by higher volumes and by cost cuts and improved efficiency. Its motor components sales outperformed the market in north America, helped by a sought after variety of models and orders from Mazda, Ford and Nissan. In Europe, GKN has taken over the supply of drive-line products to the Volkswagen group for the Audi 80. Sales were also increased by a favourable model mix, as it supplies components to some of the most successful cars launched recently in Europe. GKN will also supply Toyota, Honda and Nissan, the three Japanese car makers developing assembly plants in the UK. GKN said it had gained contracts in May and June from US vehicle makers which would come on stream from 1993. Nippondenso results, Page 22 Lex, Page 16 Market report, Page 34</p>

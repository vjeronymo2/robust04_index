			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mahmud Sharif, local administration </F> minister, by Suhayr al-Husayni; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The first question we pose to  Local Administration Minister Mahmud Sharif concerns President  Mubarak's call to develop the southern valley and encourage  investors to direct their projects to the southern governorates.  How is this done? Is there a defined plan to achieve this? Does  this plan provide additional incentives to encourage investors  to develop the southern valley rather than basing their  operations in Cairo and the surrounding cities? The local  administration minister responds:    [Sharif] Regarding the southern valley, a decision has been  made at the highest state level to channel development to the  south. The south has been deprived of vitality for many years,  given that the focus has been on the capital and the large  governorates. We are now making a maximum effort to channel the  bulk of development to the south. The state's role in achieving  this centers on support of social services in the southern  governorates, such as health, education, infrastructure,  utilities, and sewerage. That leaves production, which is an  important, vital part that can provide new jobs for young people.  <H5>  Developing the Southern Valley </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Jobs in the governorates of Upper Egypt are  perhaps limited for young people, who tend to migrate to the  capital in search of work.    [Sharif] Therefore, we are trying to create jobs in the  southern governorates by providing social services. In other  words, when we build a school, hospital, or offices for service  providers, we provide new jobs for young people. We are also  creating jobs through production projects that will be  established there. The private sector will play a primary role  in establishing these projects. To achieve this, we have begun  to establish a number of industrial zones, including one in the  governorate of Sawhaj, one in the governorate of Asyut, and  three in the governorate of Bani Suwayf.    [Al-Husayni] Are these industrial zones being established in  the governorates or in the new cities, which are considered an  extension of these governorates?    [Sharif] This is being done in accordance with each  governorate's circumstances. For example, we have established an  industrial zone in the new city of Bani Suwayf in the  governorate of Bani Suwayf, and another zone in Sawhaj, east of  the Nile. We are taking into account the creation of new  communities, but we are not moving too far away from the  infrastructure. These new industrial zones will offer all  advantages, tax and customs exemptions, unlimited exportation,  and domestic marketing opportunities.  <H5>  Additional Incentives in the South </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Someone who invests in the cities of 10 Ramadan  and 6 October on the capital's periphery can obtain all of these  exemptions and benefits. Will additional incentives be offered  for investing in the southern valley?    [Sharif] Nominal land prices are an additional incentive for  investing in the southern valley. Also, the southern  governorates are making efforts, under the governors' direct  supervision, to provide all immediate services required by  investors in the new industrial zones. We all know that  investors are most bothered by red tape and having to go from  one office to another. Therefore, an office subordinate to the  Investment Authority has been opened in the governorate of  Sawhaj to make matters easy for persons investing in the south.    [Al-Husayni] Does the Sawhaj investment office have all  authorities [to act independently], so that investors do not  need to refer to the Investment Authority's main office in Cairo?    [Sharif] (With conviction) The investment office established  in the governorate of Sawhaj has all authorities to act  independently. The investor will not need to refer subsequently  to the authority's main office in Cairo. Another incentive to  invest in the south is the ability to acquire land for a project  at a price equivalent to the cost of utilities. Land is being  offered to investors in the southern valley at nominal prices.    [Al-Husayni] What is the price for a meter of land in the  industrial cities in the governorate of Sawhaj or Asyut for  example?    [Sharif] In the industrial zone in the governorate of  Sawhaj,  for example, a meter cost 50 Egyptian pounds, even though this  new zone is located only about three or four km from eastern  Sawhaj. Also, we have built in this new city 14 schools, several  clubs, and a town for tradespeople. Residential neighborhoods  are now being built in these new cities, and roads connecting  them to the governorate are being paved. Also, investors can  acquire as much land as they wish in these new cities, with no  maximum limit. As a result, 100 projects have been submitted to  date to the Investment Authority's Sawhaj office, even though  the call to develop the southern valley was made just a few  weeks ago.    One main reason for investors' obvious interest in investing  in the new industrial zones is no doubt President Husni  Mubarak's speech to inaugurate the session of the People's  Assembly and Consultative Council. President Mubarak said that  all projects worth five million pounds or less do not require  authorization to start operating. Therefore, an investor's mere  trip to the investment office and completion of a form provided  by that office is by itself considered authorization to start  operating.  <H5>  The Investment Office in Sawhaj </H5>   [Al-Husayni] By five million pounds, do you mean the value  of  the capital with which the project will be established or the  total value of the project's investments?    [Sharif] The value of the capital with which the project  will  be established, not the volume of the project's subsequent  investments.    [Al-Husayni] Investors are afraid to start a project without  taking the measures required by the Investment Authority,  especially notification of pertinent agencies and obtainment of  authorizations. They do not want to be surprised, after their  factories start operating, by inspectors from these agencies  asking them for permits and authorizations regulating activity  in industrial facilities.    [Sharif] (Confidently and calmly) The reality is that an  investor, by merely filling in the information requested on the  form given to him at the Investment Authority's Sawhaj office,  in effect begins immediately to notify all pertinent agencies.  For example, the Sawhaj office notifies customs to exempt the  investor from customs duties. It notifies taxes to open a file  on the investor and exempt him for 10 years. Then, it notifies  the notary office, because the investor may need to purchase and  register land. It notifies social insurance and manpower to  permit the investor to employ the manpower required for the  project. It notifies electricity and the governorate to which  the investor is subordinate if the investor wishes to purchase  land in the governorate. It notifies the Construction Ministry  if the investor needs to purchase land outside of the  governorate's cordon. The investment office does all of this as  soon as the investor fills out a form given to him by the office.  <H5>  Approval of 40 Projects </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Will the Investment Authority's office in the  governorate of Sawhaj serve all investors in the southern  valley? Or will investment offices be opened in each governorate?    [Sharif] Our goal in the future is to establish an office of  the Investment Authority in each governorate. We have begun with  an office in the governorate of Sawhaj. That office is striving  to provide all facilities to investors in the southern valley.    [Al-Husayni] In your estimation, when will these new  investment projects begin to be implemented in the industrial  cities in the southern valley?    [Sharif] (Smiling with optimism) Actually, investors are  very  interested and enthusiastic. The Investment Authority has  approved 40 projects. I therefore expect that factories will  begin operating in these new industrial zones in the south  within a year, God willing.    [Al-Husayni] As we move to promote development in Egypt's  governorates, will the governorates be divided into integrated  economic regions in geographical planning, instead of being  treated as independent provinces, to achieve the goals of  development plans, especially now, when it has become a crime to  transport goods from one governorate to another?    [Sharif] (Responding immediately) First, we need to treat  this issue in the framework of the economic reform plan with  which the country is now proceeding. Based on regional economic  planning, and with a view toward production as an economic  pivot, we have begun to shift the major load in reform to the  private sector. Based on these concepts, the dimensions of  regional planning and development have expanded, because, as you  said in your question, we cannot study the problem of  development in Egypt by examining it in each governorate  separately. This is especially so, because there are very small  governorates that cannot by themselves generate development  opportunities. For example, it is difficult to plan development  in the governorate of al-Qalyubiyah, because development  opportunities exist there in only two or three projects at most.  However, development planning becomes more substantive if we  speak of the greater Cairo area, which includes Cairo, al-Jizah,  and al-Qalyubiyah. The same applies to the Sinai Peninsula. We  cannot think about developing North Sinai and South Sinai  without also considering Ismailia, which extends 30 kilometer  east of the Suez Canal into the peninsula, and Port Said as  well. This region should be viewed comprehensively. The Gulf of  Suez should also be viewed as an integrated, coordinated unit  for development purposes. We cannot view the governorate of the  Red Sea or Suez separately. Therefore, when we study a project  to develop the governorates, it is better to think on the level  of region, where resources are better integrated.  <H5>  Regional Planning </H5>   [Al-Husayni] What is meant by institutional building, and  how  is it supported?    [Sharif] There is a Regional Planning Authority in the  Planning Ministry. Its current role is to collect and study the  governorates' projects to pave the way for implementing them. We  are now looking beyond this role to one in which the Regional  Planning Authority begins to formulate comprehensive development  plans for each region, instead of just collecting them. This  requires a review of these organizations. There are 26  governorates in Egypt. These governorates are also divided into  seven planning regions. We are now stimulating planning activity  to generate economic integration between the governorates.    [Al-Husayni] For a long time, we have disregarded regional  planning for the governorates. Have measures actually been taken  to stimulate regional planning activity as you stated?    [Sharif] I have asked that the governors, the leaders of  these regions, begin to meet as a regional council. Three  councils have actually met and begun to discuss regional  development plans. These steps are being taken now to achieve  development at the level of the region, not the governorate.  <H5>  Decline of Small Industries </H5>   [Al-Husayni] Even as we strive to encourage small  industries,  we see vital industries--tourism and export industries--starting  to disappear, such as the silk rug industry in the village of  Abu-Hamam and Akhmim, most of whose output was exported, and the  industries of Khan al-Khalili, because the older generation of  craftsmen are more interested in sending their children to  college to become physicians and lawyers.    [Sharif] (Shaking his head in objection) We are using all of  our capabilities to encourage small industries, based on an  integrated plan. Six thousand workshops in all of Egypt's  governorates have been financed with loans totalling 64 million  pounds. Regarding the silk rug industry you mentioned, the  Social Affairs Ministry is now purchasing and marketing abroad  all of the silk rugs produced by tradespeople or families.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Project to Count the Number of Unemployed </H5>   [Al-Husayni] A propos training, a large training institute  with major capabilities is subordinate to the Local  Administration Ministry. Why is its role limited to training  only local administration workers? Why do we not try to use  these enormous capabilities to train workers in other sectors?    [Sharif] First, this institute was established to train the  ministry's local administration leaders. Courses are also held  for local administration officials. For example, housing sector  workers were given training when the new housing law and  Egyptian construction code were promulgated. This was done in  cooperation with the Construction Research Institute. The latter  is also involved in international activities through its  cooperation with the Arab League and the Organization of Arab  and Islamic Capitals and Cities, whose training center is  located at the institute. Also, two courses were held. One of  them was in connection with the Arab Development Institute and  concerned the problem of rural-urban migration. We have numerous  activity programs. Our policy is that the institute should  operate continuously and that its capabilities should be  exploited as much as possible, taking into account that we need  to complete construction of the institute. Until then, the  institute can admit only a limited number of trainees.    [Al-Husayni] Some time ago, the ministry began cooperating  with the Manpower and Training Ministry in a project to count  the unemployed in all governorates with the goal of providing  jobs for unemployed young people. Then you stopped. Are there  reasons for that?    [Sharif] (Calmly) We stopped, because we actually completed  the unemployment count in 21 governorates. The other five  governorates do not have an unemployment problem.    [Al-Husayni] Which governorates do not have an unemployment  problem?    [Sharif] The governorates of North Sinai, South Sinai, Red  Sea, Marsa Matruh, and New Valley [al-Wadi al-Jadid].    [Al-Husayni] Was the count in the governorates restricted to  college graduates, or did it include all unemployed young people?    [Sharif] This count was only for graduates of the  educational  track, in other words graduates of universities and intermediate  institutions. [passage omitted]</p>

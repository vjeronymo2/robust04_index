			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Insurers change tack - Not so long ago, premiums were soaring. Now, they are starting to fall as companies chase business Storm damage, subsidence and theft claims late in the 1980s led to big increases in home insurance premiums. But companies are now again seeking customers actively, according to Tom Walton, manager of Towry Law Insurance Broker Services. And the hunt for new business is proving good news for consumers. Walton says: 'Rates are down, particularly for buildings insurance, but contents rates are beginning to soften as well. A number of new insurers are coming into the market and prices should gradually reduce for the next 12 months.' Some of the keenest competition comes from the telephone-based direct insurance companies. They are eager to exploit the public's appetite for cheaper insurance and its distaste for the selling methods of some building societies, which 'tie' mortgage and insurance in one non-negotiable package. Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, has dubbed this particular practice 'a billion pound burglary'. Direct Line's research suggests that nearly 13m UK householders pay an average 20 per cent more than they need for their household insurance and the company claims that, on average, its premiums are 20 per cent lower than those for policies arranged by building societies. There are, however, many variables attached to insuring your home and belongings, and the cheapest premium does not always represent the best policy. Recently, the Household Mortgage Corporation compared the block buildings and insurance policy it offers its borrowers with the policy issued by a leading direct insurer. It found that the latter excluded a number of risks, including accidental damage, and concluded: 'Despite the advances in marketing and use of technology by the new insurers, block policies which use the lender's negotiating power to maximise the cover available to customers can still provide better value.' Insurance companies no longer sell buildings insurance at a flat premium. Instead, they rate the cost according to postcodes to reflect the insurer's experience of subsidence, heave, flood and theft. But there is no unanimity among the insurers on rating areas and this can throw up both pricing anomalies and bargains. Prospective policyholders also should look at excesses, which can be triggered by different types of damage or can be applied to all claims. The risk of subsidence invariably carries an excess, with Pounds 1,000 a common figure and a hefty Pounds 3,000 not unknown. Other points to check with buildings insurance are if the policy extends to garages, greenhouses and garden sheds, and whether alternative accommodation is provided in case of disaster. The property itself should be insured for its re-building cost, not its market value or council tax valuation. With contents insurance, claims are met on one of two bases: replacement-as-new or indemnity, which is the replacement cost, less wear, tear and depreciation. Most policies require buyers to insure their possessions for their full value, but some base premiums on the number of bedrooms and provide a maximum sum insured. This strategy makes for simplicity but also means that people run the risk of being under-insured. Segmentation is a buzz word in the contents insurance market. There are policies designed for the young, the 'grey' market of the over-50s, and for high net worth individuals who are credited with taking greater care of their possessions than the rest of us. The National &amp; Provincial building society has just launched three insurance policies designed respectively for first-time buyers, families, and for the mature whose children have left home. Premiums on the first-time buyer option are around 30 per cent cheaper than for the others. At the same time, the society is keeping its existing comprehensive policy on sale. A spokesman explains: 'We are retaining our existing Homepack policy, which is a bit expensive but is a cover-all, sleep-easy option. Our new policies are more keenly priced and segmented.' Certainly, market segmentation has led to cheaper premiums for older customers. Norwich Union cut household insurance premiums for 'mature' customers by as much as 30 per cent in some cases earlier this month, while Provincial Insurance's HomeCover 50 Plus buildings and contents policy offers both a mature householder discount and a no-claims discount. Most insurers also give discounts for good quality security and alarms, regardless of the age of the policyholder, and some reward members of Neighbourhood Watch schemes. While the extent and relevance of the cover is crucial when choosing household insurance, price is the bottom line for most people and Walton says: 'There can be a difference of 50 per cent between the most, and least, competitive policies on the market.' Consumers should get a quotation from both an insurance broker and a direct insurer. Look at the actual cover provided by the most competitively-priced policies and ask some questions about service, particularly the length of time taken to settle claims.</p>

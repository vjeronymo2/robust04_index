Welcoming Kozyrev, Jiang said that "the whole year's work  depends on a good start in spring." Kozyrev's current visit  symbolizes a good beginning for Sino-Russian relations in a new  year.    Jiang said that President Boris Yeltsin's China visit in  December 1992 was "very successful", adding that the bilateral  ties witness steady growth on the basis of mutual respect,  equality and mutual benefit.    He noted that to maintain and further the good-neighborly  and  friendly relations with Russia is an unswerving policy of the  Chinese Government.    The Chinese side cherishes the hard-won cooperative  relations  of good neighborliness between China and Russia, Jiang said,  hoping that the two nations and their peoples could live in  harmony from generation to generation, which is in accord with  the fundamental interest of the two peoples and conducive to the  peace and stability of the region and the world.    Kozyrev conveyed a personal letter and greetings of Yeltsin  to Jiang.    In the letter, Yeltsin again invited Jiang to visit Russia.  Jiang, thanking for the invitation, said that he would pay a  visit to Russia in due course. He also asked Kozyrev to pass on  his regards to Yeltsin.    Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, Chinese  Ambassador  to Russia Wang Jinqing, and Russian Ambassador to China Yegor  Rogachev took part in the meeting.</p>

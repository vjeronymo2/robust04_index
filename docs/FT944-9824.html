			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Engineers need body to exert influence Sir, Rowland Morgan (Letters, November 5) seems intent on reliving old battles and restricting the role of the new Engineering Council to being a lobbyist for narrow sectional interests. What engineers need urgently is a governing body that can speak with a powerful single voice to enable the engineering profession to exert its proper influence on government and society in general. In order to deliver this important objective, the new arrangements must encompass the present Engineering Council, the engineering institutions, industry and academe. The idea that we can have a unified profession which excludes the institutions is a contradiction in terms. If the new central body is to have credibility it must represent the whole profession and not operate in some quasi-trade union role. Rowland Morgan is wrong to suggest that the Engineering Assembly has not been allowed to express an opinion on the new arrangements. In fact, when the assembly met in July, I gave a presentation on the unification proposals which was followed by a lively discussion. Also, a number of the motions debated at the assembly covered the unification issue. More recently, I presented the unification proposal to the chairmen of the Engineering Council's regional branches and they gave their unanimous support. The time is fast approaching when we have to take a decision. I hope that all engineers will grasp the opportunity that we now have to unify the profession and make its presence felt in the corridors of power. John Fairclough, chairman, Unification of the Engineering Profession, 10 Maltravers Street, London WC2R 3ER</p>

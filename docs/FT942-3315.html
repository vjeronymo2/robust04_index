			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Charter plans to build fourth leg Charter, the diversified industrial group, could spend between Pounds 200m and Pounds 400m on building a fourth leg, according to Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive. The company was restructured last year, selling its stake in Johnson Matthey and using part of the proceeds to buy back Minorco's 36 per cent stake. The deal left Charter with Pounds 156m of cash, and its independence. The company has refocused on three core businesses of building materials, coal and rail track equipment. Mr Herbert said a number of proposals were under consideration for the fourth. The company also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.1m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 289.2m, which was distorted by the sale of the Johnson Matthey stake. Operating profits from continuing operations fell 4 per cent to Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 35.2m). Building materials contributed Pounds 14.7m, up from Pounds 12.6m. Cape, Charter's listed subsidiary, showed a strong increase in overseas sales, and Hargreaves, the quarrying business, benefited from new road contracts and a recovery in the price for aggregates. The US miners' strike last year cost Charter's coal operations about Pounds 3m, and reduced divisional profit from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4m. Rail track equipment contributed Pounds 13m, up from Pounds 12.5m, despite shrinking margins on its US maintenance business. Interest income amounted to Pounds 13.9m, up from Pounds 11.6m, boosted by a lag between receiving the proceeds from the JM sale, and buying its shares from Minorco. The company is proposing a final dividend of 15.5p, making a total for the year of 22.5p (22p). Earnings per share, distorted by the restructuring, amounted to 36.4p, against 242.9p. COMMENT While Charter's shape may be becoming clearer, the key to its near-term performance still depends on how the management chooses to spend its cash pile. There were few surprises in the 1994 figures, and the current year will show marginal growth at the operating level, but a decline in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 48m. This would result from falling interest income. Earnings will benefit from the share buy-back, but Charter is still trading on a p/e of about 16.3. This is high, but the shares carry almost 230p of cash, and whatever happens, the management should eke a better return from an acquisition than a bank vault. In the meantime, investors should continue to hold.</p>

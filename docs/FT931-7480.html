			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Amstrad's return to profit surprises AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics company left limping by price wars in the personal computer business, returned to the black in the half year to December 31, 1992. It announced profits before tax of Pounds 5.61m compared with a loss of Pounds 11.99m in the same period a year ago on essentially flat sales of Pounds 195.55m (Pounds 196m). Amstrad's first set of results since founder and chairman Mr Alan Sugar failed in December last year to persuade shareholders to sell him back the company at 30p a share, surprised and pleased analysts. They had expected neither a positive result nor for the company to pay a dividend - albeit a nominal 0.2p per ordinary share. Some pointed out, however, that Mr Sugar was disingenuous during the privatisation battle in declining to make a profits forecast when it must have been clear by November that a good performance was on the cards. Earnings per share were 0.7p compared with a loss of 1.3p last time. The shares, which have been languishing about the 25p mark, rose to 29p on the news. Mr Sugar emphasised that the first six months were Amstrad's best sales period and there was no guarantee that the company would be profitable or pay a final dividend at the end of the year. He also said trading conditions in the UK remain difficult and that Amstrad's products will have to be re-engineered to meet selling prices which will generate volume sales. The company's profitability was increased by sales of satellite equipment in the UK and Germany and by interest payments of Pounds 3.75m derived from Pounds 111.9m of cash. Amstrad's cash rose by Pounds 65m during the year.</p>

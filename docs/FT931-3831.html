			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wind-up worry AFTER SELLING a business in 1970, my wife and I were left with a company which had previously run the business. Since that time, it has been reorganised by the tax authorities as an investment company - my wife and I being the sole shareholders. In the beginning, the value of the investments held amounted to very little, but this has grown gradually over the years to Pounds 20,000. There are no debts and no activity other than the payment of a few hundred pounds for secretarial services to my wife. But accounting charges amount to around Pounds 400 per year, which seems a waste of money. Because of our age - we are both 70- plus - we wish to liquidate the company but have been quoted Pounds 2,000-plus for this. What should we do? It might be preferable to take a different course from formal winding-up: namely, to have the company struck off the register of companies as having ceased to trade. Briefly, you would pay off any creditors and all taxes and distribute the assets as dividend. You then prepare a balance sheet, which need not be audited if the company has not traded since the last accounting date. The directors should pass a resolution to take personal responsibility for any unquantified liabilities (accountancy fees) plus a resolution that the company has ceased to trade, is no longer required, and that the companies' registrar be asked to strike it off the register. Signed copies of the resolutions and balance sheet are then sent to the registrar with a note of the company's tax office and reference number. If the inspector of taxes responds to the registrar's enquiry and confirms that all tax liabilities have been settled, the registrar will normally proceed to strike off the company. This will involve considerably less cost than a winding-up. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

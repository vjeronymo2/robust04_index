			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from the ABC COLOR Regional Bureau] </F>   [Excerpt] Last night, the Brazilian Armed Forces occupied  the Foz de Iguazu [Brazil] side of the Friendship Bridge to  guarantee the free circulation given the indefinite strike of  the Brazilian Federal Police, who have been on strike for more  than 30 days. Foz de Iguazu businessmen have lost more than 85  billion guaranies [figure as published] as a result of a drop in  the flow of tourists due to the strike. Federal Tax Office  inspectors have also joined the strike.    Last night, military forces took control of the Brazilian  side of the Friendship Bridge due to the prolonged strike of  that country's Federal Police, thus confirming persistent rumors  that circulated last night.

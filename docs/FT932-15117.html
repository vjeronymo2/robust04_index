			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Government stands firm on oil reforms - North Sea THE government stood firm on its controversial reforms of North Sea oil taxation yesterday. The Finance Bill left unchanged the proposals put forward by Mr Norman Lamont in his Budget last month, in spite of protests from parts of the oil and gas industry. Under the bill the rate of petroleum revenue tax (PRT) will be reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent on existing oil and gas fields, and abolished altogether on those given government consent after the Budget. But rules which allow oil companies to set exploration and development costs against profits from existing fields will also be changed. The cost of new fields started after the Budget cannot be offset against profits from older fields. However, transitional arrangements are proposed to cushion the impact of the changes: contracts entered into before the Budget will continue to be eligible for relief for two years. The bill also proposes provisions for streamlining North Sea oil taxation. The tax reforms were said by Mr Lamont to be necessary to encourage oil companies to become more efficient in both drilling for oil and gas, and extracting it. The existing rules were 'anachronistic', he said, and belonged to a time when oil prices were high and the typical oilfield was very large. Oil prices were now low, and it was important that companies have an incentive to extract the maximum from their fields. The changes would transform what was in effect a tax subsidy for oil explorers to a revenue earner for the Treasury: the yield in 1994-95 would be Pounds 300m and in 1995-96 Pounds 400m. Mr Lamont's proposals have already been welcomed by large North Sea operators such as BP which maintain that the old tax regime discriminated against large producers. But they were strongly opposed by exploration companies who claimed that the changes would discourage new drilling and cost thousands of jobs in offshore services, and onshore support and fabrication industries. Although some oil companies said yesterday that they were disappointed by the bill, they said further changes might still be possible as the oil lobby gears up to influence the debate in parliament. The UK Offshore Operators Association, which earlier warned that the changes would 'put a substantial burden on the industry', declined to comment on the Finance Bill yesterday. The association said it would be discussing contents of the bill with its members.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Obstacles on the mainline: Charles Batchelor assesses the remaining problems facing British Rail as it prepares for privatisation Cut-price fares; a 'kids go free' scheme; discounts on purchases at airport duty-free shops. The 27 miles from London to Gatwick airport have become the most hotly-contested stretch of British Rail track. The three companies competing on the Gatwick line are providing a first glimpse of what rail privatisation might mean for Britain after 45 years of a nationalised network. Critics of privatisation say that competition on the Gatwick route consists of marketing gimmicks that have simply confused travellers unused to competition on the railway. But the outcome of the battle for the airport passenger will provide vital markers for the future of BR's entire 10,270-mile network. Gatwick Express is the first of BR's 'shadow franchises' - parts of the railway network which will be run by their existing management as independent operations to establish how attractive they might be for private bidders. The experience of its first few weeks provides an indication of how difficult it will be to run a railway at a profit. Gatwick Express just about broke even in spite of carrying higher than expected numbers of passengers because of a surge in the volume of travellers passing through Gatwick. Gatwick is an experiment on a very modest scale but it illustrates the size and nature of the problems still to be addressed when private-sector managers, including management buy-out teams from BR, get down to making the theory of privatisation work in practice. For all the controversy that accompanied the passage of the railways bill through parliament last year, the proposed framework still falls far short of the conventional pattern of privatisation of the past decade. BR's losses  -Pounds 164m in 1992-93 in spite of a government subsidy of more than Pounds 600m - forced the government to adopt a compromise: franchising out the running of the trains to private operators while offering them subsidies where necessary. The sale of franchises is due to start this year with Gatwick Express and accelerate through 1995 as more lines are prepared for operation as independent companies. However, some BR managers believe BR will be unable to keep to this ambitious timetable. A separate company, Railtrack, has been set up to take over the ownership of BR's infrastructure from April 1. Railtrack last month announced its charges for train-operating companies that wish to use BR track. The charges are sharply higher than those made to BR's regions under its internal accounting system. Railtrack says private-sector train operators will be compensated for the higher track charges with an increased subsidy. But some potential bidders for BR franchises say the onerous track charges will push even profitable parts of BR into loss. Private-sector operators would also be vulnerable if state subsidies are reduced in the future. Railtrack itself is due to be privatised within the next few years under the leadership of its chairman, Mr Bob Horton, a former chief executive of British Petroleum. Two other key personalities have also started to piece together the rail privatisation jigsaw. Mr Roger Salmon, a former merchant banker, has been appointed by the government as franchising director to negotiate contracts with private bidders for BR's operations. Mr John Swift, a lawyer, has come in as rail regulator, charged with ensuring that safety standards are met and that a fair balance is struck between the conflicting interests of all participants in the post-privatisation era. But other important parts of the jigsaw have yet to be assembled, including the three regionally-based financing companies that are to own and lease rolling stock to the train operators. The crucial question of how many private-sector groups are likely to bid for a franchise is still unanswered. Between 40 and 50 companies have expressed an interest but it is not clear how many will emerge as serious bidders. Bus companies such as Stagecoach and Badgerline are among the interested parties; so too is Sea Containers, the transport and ferry group. Senior BR managers are considering staging management buy-outs, among them Mr Chris Green, managing director of InterCity. Mr Green takes charge of Scotrail in April and is already working on plans for a management buy-out of the Scottish rail network. Transport specialists express concern that most of the possible private-sector bidders that have so far emerged lack the financial or management resources to develop a railroad. The bus companies and management buy-out teams at least have experience of running transport systems but are unlikely to be in a position to make substantial investments. 'If rail staff come along with Pounds 100 of capital each in a buy-out we will have a deteriorating system,' says Mr James Sherwood, chief executive of Sea Containers. 'Big companies must come in and invest billions of pounds to improve the system,' he says. An additional fear on the part of bus operators is that UK monopolies regulations could prevent them from running train and bus services in the same area. 'Why should bus companies go through the hoops of trying to buy a rail franchise when they could more easily expand their bus operations through acquisition,' says one industry observer. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, is sanguine. 'I would be surprised if there was any great interest (in bidding) at this stage because no one knows enough about the franchises,' he says. Increased interest will only come when more of the framework in which the private-sector railway companies will operate has been put into place, he says. The central aspects of the privatised railway regime that still concern potential private-sector franchisees include: The ownership of BR's track and signalling. In spite of the creation of Railtrack and the government's decision to separate the ownership of the railway's infrastructure from the operation of the trains, some potential private-sector franchisees are lobbying for a relaxation of the rules to allow them to own infrastructure as well as run trains. Supporters of the present framework point to airlines, which do not own airports, as an example of an industry where infrastructure and service are successfully split. But private-sector bidders say that with track costs accounting for more than half of their overheads, railway operators must be allowed to own the track on which they propose to run their services. The government is, however, willing to allow vertical integration in certain exceptional cases such as the Isle of Wight railway; there is also private-sector pressure on the government for the Scottish network to be treated in the same way. Acceding to such pressure would strike at the core of the government's post-privatisation rail structure. The government's room for manoeuvre is, therefore, limited. But Mr Salmon says he is willing to consider 'non-compliant bids' which diverge from the ground rules laid down by the government, provided they are submitted early. There is a wide body of opinion in both BR and the private sector that believes splitting track and train operations will prove unworkable. 'There will be chaos for two to three years and then a sensible system will emerge but only after substantial reform by government,' says one transport analyst. The degree to which private-sector competitors will have 'open access' to run trains on franchised routes. The government wants open competition but the experience of bus privatisation, where fierce rivalry erupted on popular city centre routes clogging traffic and leading to a poorer service, has frightened off some potential private-sector rail franchisees. The likelihood is that given 'open access', private-sector competitors would only offer limited services on lucrative lines. 'They would cream off the profitable routes and the whole edifice would crumble,' says Mr Brian Cox, managing director of the rail division of Stagecoach Holdings, a bus operator. The duration of franchises. The government believes the shorter the franchise period the better. This is because it would ensure private-sector operators met minimum levels of service within the briefest time-span. A short franchise would also allow the government to bring in a new franchisee if the original operator did not perform satisfactorily. The initial government proposal for the duration of the franchise was between five and seven years; but Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has grudgingly moved to the idea of 15-year franchises, largely in response to private-sector lobbying. But, faced with buying rolling stock with a life of about 30 years, possible private-sector bidders are still pressing for longer terms. The flexibility of the system. With separate companies owning the track, rolling stock, and carrying out repairs, how efficiently will the proposed framework operate? The general fear is that such a set-up will lead to an elaborate system of contracts and agreements. 'The complexity of the privatisation proposals will not make it easier to raise funds,' said one potential private-sector bidder. 'There is a danger that there will be even more bureaucracy than there was under BR.' And, ask many industry observers, who should bear responsibility in the event of a derailment or when a train breaks down? And whose trains should be given priority when timetables are rescheduled following cancellations? There is a danger that such disputes between different players in the new railway age could lead to damaging litigation. Franchise director Mr Salmon claims to have devised a 'no-fault incentive scheme to keep the lawyers in their place'. The theory, he says, is that all participants have a commercial interest in solving problems quickly and providing a a sound service. But doubts remain about whether so many players can work efficiently together. Mr Swift, the railway regulator, has made plain the limits of relying on commonsense and points out that the law is the ultimate guarantor of fair dealing. But tensions between Mr Swift and Mr Salmon seem inevitable: Mr Swift's role is to ensure a fair pricing structure; but this objective could undercut Mr Salmon's drive to attract private-sector bidders determined to set their own fares. Ministers are fond of drawing comparisons with the airline industry, which operates on a system of contracts with airports for landing rights and maintenance services; the comparison is designed to show that such a division between the 'infrastructure' and the 'service operator' can work. Similarly, Mr Horton points to Marks &amp; Spencer's successful relationship with its suppliers, under which the manufacture of M&amp;S clothes and foods by sub-contractors is distinct from the retail end of the operation; critics point out, though, that M&amp;S does not have to share its stores with Tesco. The validity of tickets across the system. One advantage of the present set-up is that passengers can travel across the entire network on a single ticket. This may cease after privatisation. The government is insisting that private-sector rail operators recognise each other's full fares and season tickets; discounted tickets, however, will not be mutually recognisable. With up to 80 per cent of all tickets sold at a discount this could either push up the cost of travel for the vast bulk of travellers or bar passengers from taking the most convenient train. For the private-sector rail franchisees, the problem of sharing revenues from a journey that criss-crosses the routes of several different operators, could prove a nightmare. How are costs and takings to be allocated over a journey that involves a mainline section followed by a shorter stretch of local line? These unresolved issues are daunting and time is running out before the next round of 'shadow franchises' start and Railtrack takes over responsibility for BR's infrastructure on April 1. 'It is important to get the first one or two franchises right,' says Sir Bob Reid. But with the first private-sector railway companies now only months away from commencing services, it remains an open question whether the new system can be made to work. Railway privatisations in countries such as Japan and Sweden have been more modest in their scope. BR's aim is more ambitious and the possibility of derailment that much greater.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk marking the 30th anniversary of Kim </F> Chong-il's work at the Workers' Party of Korea, WPK: "The Dear  Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is Our Destiny and the Fatherland's  Destiny"]    [Text] The current times, when an acute struggle between  socialism and imperialism, and progress and reaction is being  waged, are seriously raising the question of the destiny of the  popular masses, the country, and the nation in an international  point of view.    In countries where socialism has been frustrated due to the  antirevolutionary maneuvers of the imperialists and  reactionaries, and where national sovereignties have been  infringed upon, the popular masses are hovering between life and  death, and the destinies of the countries and the nations are  being miserably trampled upon.    Solving the question of the destiny of the popular masses,  the country, and the nation is one of the historic tasks of the  progressive people shrewdly presented by the last decade of the  20th century. The significant question put forth by the  current times has been most brilliantly solved in our country in  which the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is being upheld high  at the top of the party and revolution.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our people  are singing the song "Without Comrade Kim Chong-il, the  Fatherland Does Not Exist." I like the song. As the song's  lyrics state: Without Comrade Kim Chong-il, you comrades and  the socialist fatherland do not exist. It is his destiny, as  well as the destiny of you comrades and the fatherland.    The great leader [widaehan suryong] of the working class is  the one who plays the decisive role of pioneering the destiny of  the people, the country, and the nation. The destiny of the  people, the country, and the nation is pioneered, protected, and  brilliantly elucidated by the leader [suryong].    The great leader of the working class analyzes and  integrates  the independent demands and interests of the popular masses to  found the guidance ideology of revolution and leads the  activities of the popular masses to elevate the ideology in a  unified manner. He makes the popular masses into a  self-defending main force of history and revolution by making  them conscious and organized, and enables them to pioneer a  bright future for themselves, their descendants, the fatherland  and nation as the true masters of their destinies.    The fact that the destiny of the people and the fatherland  is  brilliantly pioneered and blossomed only under the wise  leadership of the leader [suryong] is a lofty truth proven by  our revolutionary practices. Our people have become the  proudest and most dignified people by upholding the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song at the fore of revolution. Our fatherland  is shining brilliantly in the whole world as a strong  independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist country.    The struggle to pioneer and elucidate the destiny of the  people, the country, and the nation is a long-term struggle to  be continued generation after generation. To win or lose the  historic struggle depends on whether or not the leader  [suryong], who first pioneered the revolutionary road, and the  people's true leader [chidoja], who is endlessly loyal to the  cause, are upheld at the top of the party and revolution.    To the people, the greatest misfortune is having a wrong  leader [chidoja], and the greatest fortune is having the  leadership of a wise leader [suryong].    Shouldering the destiny of the fatherland and the nation all  by himself, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great  leader [widaehan yongdoja] who leads to victory the chuche  revolutionary cause pioneered by the respected and beloved  leader [suryong], and a benevolent father [chaaeroun oboi] who  devotes his everything for the people. Thanks to the dear  comrade leader, our people have a rewarding life today and a  promising future tomorrow, as well as the glory and bright  future of chuche-based Korea.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a genius of  ideological theory who plainly enlightens the road of  elucidating the destiny of our people and fatherland with  extraordinary wisdom. The destiny of the people, the country,  and the nation can only be pioneered and elucidated by a correct  ideological theory. As a boat without a compass cannot  correctly sail to its destination, the destiny of the people,  the country, and the nation cannot be successfully pioneered  without the guidance of a revolutionary ideological theory.    The only guidance for pioneering the destiny of the popular  masses is the immortal chuche idea. Chuche idea, which is based  on the philosophical principle that the master of one's destiny  is oneself, and the power of pioneering one's destiny also lies  in oneself, elucidates the most correct road for pioneering the  destiny of the people, the country, and the nation. The dear  comrade leader has formalized the respected and beloved leader's  revolutionary ideology into an integrated system of chuche-based  ideology, theory, and methods, and further deepened and  developed the chuche idea in conformity with the demands of the  current times and the development of revolution.    Developing and completing the great revolutionary theory  of pioneering and elucidating the destiny of the popular masses  by further enriching the chuche idea with new theories and  contents, and deepening the idea on a full scope is the dear  comrade leader's immortal historic achievement accumulated  during pioneering and elucidating the destiny of the people, the  country, and the nation.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader  [widaehan yongdoja] who leads the struggle to elucidate the  destiny of our people and fatherland to victory.    The struggle to pioneer and elucidate the destiny of the  people, the country, and the nation is propelled by the  spontaneous function and role of the main force of revolution.  The main force of revolution, which is a united body of the  leader [suryong], the party, and the masses, is the decisive  force and the one directly in charge of pioneering the destiny  of the people, the country, and the nation. Therefore, the  leadership of the people's leader [chidoja] is significantly  reflected by the way he gathers the main force of revolution and  the way he enhances its role.    The leadership of the dear comrade leader, who leads the  struggle to elucidate the destiny of our people and fatherland  to victory, is wise because throughout the times, he has  strengthened the main force of revolution and taken the question  of enhancing the role of the main force as the fundamental task.    The dear comrade leader has strengthened and developed our  party into an invincible and ever-victorious chuche-type  revolutionary party, and firmly consolidated all the people  around the party, thus making them into a powerful force of our  revolution. He has also extraordinarily enhanced the role of  the main force of our revolution by tightly combining the  leadership of the party with the line of revolutionary masses  and giving precedence to the human reform work and political  work.    Because the party and the popular masses have firmly united  as one to become the main force of revolution and the role of  the main force has been enhanced, the great historic  transformation of nature and society has been achieved, the  dignity and honor of our fatherland and people have been proudly  displayed, and our people's destiny has become more brilliant.  This is another special historic achievement of the dear  comrade leader for our party and revolution.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a benevolent father  [chaaeroun oboi] who endlessly cares about and loves the people,  and devotes his everything for the people. The destiny of the  people, the country, and the nation can only be blossomed in the  bosom of a leader [yongdoja] who possesses the extraordinary  wisdom of ideological theory and outstanding leadership, as well  as an endlessly lofty virtue.    A lofty virtue of the people's leader [chidoja] eliminates  the slightest shadow from the work and life of every member of  society. It is also a fountain enabling the people to absolutely  trust and follow the leader [yongdoja], wholly entrust their  destiny to the bosom of the leader [yongdoja], and lead a  rewarding life.    The dear comrade leader bears the highest loyalty toward the  great leader, embraces revolutionary comrades and people of all  walks of life in his benevolent bosom, and warmly takes care of  their work and life. Thanks to the great labor and warm love of  the dear comrade leader, who always involves himself with the  people, shares joy and sorrow with them, and generously gives  away everything for the people's happiness, the destiny of our  people and fatherland is shining more brilliantly today. That  is why all our people are upholding the dear comrade leader as  the benevolent father and wholly entrusting their destinies and  future to the comrade leader.    Indeed, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the symbol  of  victory of our fatherland and nation, and happiness and  brilliant future of all our people. Upholding the dear comrade  leader, who is matchless in terms of ideological and theoretical  wisdom, leadership, and virtue and who is the great man of great  men, is a rare fortune of our people and honor of the generation.    The future of our people and the socialist fatherland is  even  brighter upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is  our destiny and the destiny of chuche-based socialist  fatherland, high at the top of the party and revolution.</p>

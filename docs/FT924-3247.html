			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Fimbra row over new watchdog FINANCIAL ADVISERS yest-erday expressed disquiet about the proposed formation of the Personal Investment Authority, which would take over the role of Fimbra, their self-regulatory body. Many members dissented from the governing council's support for the new body, intended to merge Fimbra with Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance and unit trust industries along with some members of Imro, the fund managers' body. The PIA has been proposed because of Fimbra's inability to raise enough money from members to regulate its area effectively and to make its full share of contributions to the Investors' Compensation Scheme. Life companies have capped Fimbra's compensation scheme liabilities in the past two years. Mr Paul Beard of the Cheshire-based Alexander Beard Group said the independent status of advisers should be clearly disclosed, adding that the levy to meet advisers' obligations under the investors' compensation scheme would put many Fimbra members out of business if the PIA was not accepted. Mr David Kauders, a Taunton-based fee-charging financial adviser, called on the council to relate compensation-scheme contributions to capacity to pay instead of establishing the PIA. Mr Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, referred to the 'implicit blackmail threat' of the life companies not to cap Fimbra liabilities for this year unless Fimbra votes for the PIA. Mr Bryant questioned what he said was a change in Fimbra's accounting policy last year to treat deferred subscriptions and registration fees in its balance sheet as capital and reserves rather than creditors. Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of Fimbra, said this was the most accurate place for them as they were monies already received and not returnable. Sir Gordon said the PIA would bring together all those concerned with the personal investor under one umbrella, enabling 'a level playing field to be established'. It provided the opportunity for consistent standards of regulation, which would help eliminate the confusion caused by a multiplicity of regulators, said Sir Gordon, who is also chairman of the PIA shadow board. Banks and building societies have refused to join the PIA, arguing they are regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, while many say they do not wish to stand behind the potential liabilities of all financial advisers.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The Markets: Lessons for UK training - Economics Notebook Human capital investment may be everybody's favourite economic cure-all, but applying the prescription to the UK seems an increasingly thankless task. Attacked from all sides, the government's training policy is partly the victim of a longstanding ambivalence about the state's role which has yet to be resolved. Mr Michael Portillo, the new UK employment minister, was widely criticised last month for proposing to halve the Pounds 4bn his department spends on training. Yet the two central ingredients of training policy hardly received ringing endorsements in the weeks that followed. The Training and Enterprise Councils, established in 1990 to implement much of the government's training programme, are ill-managed squanderers of public funds, according to an Unemployment Unit study of London Tecs. And as for the much-fanfared system of national vocational qualifications, an article published in the National Institute's latest Quarterly Review* found them an 'inappropriate' and 'inequitable' response to the UK's training problems. Could Mr Portillo be right in suggesting the government effectively cede that it can do little to improve training? At the Detroit Jobs Conference in March, his predecessor at the Department of Employment joined his G7 colleagues in signing a statement favouring efforts to equip the workforce with the right skills to compete for jobs. All the participants admitted that they had difficult choices ahead in deciding how best to reform their approach. But the difficulty facing Mr Portillo is that the theory guiding the UK approach has always been especially muddled. Of the philosophies of state intervention in training represented in Detroit, the German and American varieties seem especially relevant to the UK's current plight. Essentially, the US forgot about 'training' and went for an education-based strategy to invest in human capital. No US administration has ever tried to build a 'system' of government involvement in individuals' or companies' employment decisions. Heavily subsidised student loans allowed a large segment of the population to go to college. The rest was up to that familiar US formula of individual, and corporate, enterprise. In Germany, government training policies were no mere educational matter, but built on an active system of labour market involvement by the state. Fewer young people receive general academic degrees than in the US, but many more pupils stay on to receive narrower vocational qualifications. Unions, central and local government and business associations have traditionally worked together to determine the provision of training for each part of the workforce. As the accompanying chart confirms, the UK has not decisively opted for either model in the past. Governments have launched a succession of different strategies, with decidedly mixed results. But the country has never decided whether training is primarily a matter of education or employment policy. Few would suggest that the UK now rush to take a 'German' or 'American' stand on the question, even if such a late conversion were possible. Indeed, both countries are now seeking to amend their answers in important ways. In Germany, many feel that a heavy emphasis on vocational qualifications produces an inflexible workforce. In the US, the fear is that a 30 per cent graduation rate leaves too many out of the equation altogether. Does this mean that the UK is now perfectly placed for a mixed approach, one which avoids all the pitfalls? The government appears to be aiming at just such a blend: boosting the number of graduates while introducing 'modern apprenticeships' and NVQs. Changing established habits, however ill-defined, will be a long process: Mr Portillo should certainly draw this conclusion from experiences elsewhere if he does not not know it already. But the American and German experiences could hold deeper warnings for the strategy as a whole. The cautionary tale from the US is social. Graduates earn hefty wage premiums in later life, but an economic and social chasm has developed between graduates and unskilled 'high school drop-outs', whose real wages have fallen steadily over the past 20 years. Recent German experience hints at a rather different lesson: letting nearly everyone get some kind of qualification does few favours to those who are taught to work in a highly specific, possibly declining, line of work. Britain's mixed approach may attempt to avoid these pitfalls but the authors of the National Institute study find little evidence to suggest that the 'third way' promises to be a fruitful one. Explicit and implicit education expenditures remain skewed towards university, and pre-university, students. At the same time, in the building trade, at least, they find that the 16-18 year-olds not queuing for college places are acquiring NVQs which are too narrow to permit 'the flexibility or career development in later years which the economy and technology increasingly demand'. Eclecticism, in other words, seems to be delivering the flaws of both systems and the benefits of neither. *Shifting Foundations: the Impact of NVQs on Youth Training for the Building Trades.

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as Taipei recoups 1.2% Small lot purchases by retail and overseas investors supported share prices, and the Nikkei index posted moderate gains in light volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average rose 87.45 to 19,752.98 after a low of 19,509.15 and a high of 19,763.78. Arbitrage unwinding depressed share prices in the morning session, but arbitrage buying and blue chip buying by foreign investors supported the index later. Volume totalled 210m shares against 254m. Individual investors focused on speculative favourites, while a European bank targeted blue chip electricals. Institutional investors remained sidelined ahead of the New Year holidays. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 2.55 to 1,554.34 and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.12 to 286.36. Losers outnumbered gainers by 597 to 398 with 157 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.05 to 1,286.49. The dollar weakened against the yen, falling below the Y100 level. Some traders said that volatility on the currency market was a good test for the underlying strength of the stock market, and that the Nikkei could rise further in the new year if share prices manage to withstand the current rise in the yen. The consensus among most analysts, however, seemed to be that share prices will hit a low in the first three months of the year, according to a survey by the Kyodo News Service. Of 30 analysts surveyed, 27 said that they expect the Nikkei index to hit a low of around 19,000 early next year, while 14 predicted that the average would rise to the 23,000 level in the second half. Speculative issues gained ground. Pacific Metals, the most active issue of the day, rose Y27 to Y560 while Sakai Ovex gained Y33 to Y758. Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y20 to Y1,630 on foreign buying as did Nomura Securities, up Y20 to Y2,070. Automobile makers were actively sought. Toyota Motor rose Y20 to Y2,090 while Nissan Motor gained Y15 to Y817. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 27.37 to 21,629.23 in volume of 23.6m shares. Roundup The holiday season continued to limit activity in the Pacific Rim, where Seoul, Jakarta and Bombay were closed. TAIPEI gained nearly 1.2 per cent in a rebound after two days of falls, led by financials, textiles and some speculative shares. The weighted index ended 79.60 higher at 7,027.43 in heavy turnover of TDollars 88.76bn. Financials recovered after a recent consolidation, China Development rising TDollars 4 to TDollars 144.50. Textiles responded to product price rises, with Tah Tong Textile up by its 7 per cent limit to TDollars 42.30. HONG KONG was lower on futures-linked selling but recovered from morning lows after local and UK bargain hunters stepped in as the firmer US dollar during the afternoon also helped sentiment. The Hang Seng index lost 72.20 or 0.9 per cent to 8,196.02 in turnover of HKDollars 1.7bn, against Wednesday's HKDollars 1.51bn. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrials index finished 8.87 higher at 2,243.02 on last-minute advances by several key stocks but, overall, the session was weak and mixed. KUALA LUMPUR saw further losses as volume slumped to 50.3m shares, the lowest this year. The composite index ended down 8.83 or 0.9 per cent, at 967.14, largely due to a 60-cent fall in Telekom Malaysia to MDollars 17.00. SYDNEY ended slightly weaker after being supported for most of the session by institutional buying of stocks whose options expired yesterday. The All Ordinaries index ended 2.7 lower at 1,932.8 after an intraday high of 1943.0. Dealers said that institutions were caught short in BHP after its strong rally in recent days. This, combined with the strong performance of golds, underpinned a market which otherwise was weighed down by Wednesday's profit-taking on Wall Street. WELLINGTON's leaders, Brierley apart, dragged the market down after Wall Street's overnight retreat, the NZSE-40 index closing 10.46 down at its low for the day of 1,909.37. MANILA indulged in some light window-dressing, institutional investors picking up selected bargains in order to book higher values for their portfolios. The composite index rose 8.03 to at 2,785.81 in moderate turnover of 1.59bn pesos. BANGKOK saw light selling after falls in key foreign markets and the announcement of a Thai import tax cut. The SET index closed 10.35 lower at 1,352.89 in turnover of Bt7.1bn. KARACHI fell on profit-taking by short-term investors, the KSE 100 index losing 8.53 at 2,047.24.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with al-Bayyati, "leader of the Iraqi opposition </F> in exile," by Barbara Stefanelli in London; date not given: "We  Are Boosting the Challenge; Help Us Overturn the Regime" --  first three paragraphs are CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] For a few hours at the Iraqi National Council -- in  its London headquarters -- everything ground to a halt around  the information received from its own sources: two U.S.  helicopters brought down over Kurdistan.    Had Iraqi President Saddam finally committed a fatal error,  venting months of rage and powerlessness against "any old" enemy  target? The leaders of the Council, which brings together the  six groups opposing the Baghdad regime, were expecting something  of key importance for the entire country to happen soon, and  this "something" would open up a breach through which to start  fighting the president once again.    Exiled opposition leader al-Bayyati told me: "We were the  first to hear about the choppers being shot down and the first  to spread the news. We were certain that, sooner or later,  Saddam would go for a surprise action, to break the blockade of  silence and hunger into which he has been pushed by the UN  embargo and international isolation.    [Stefanelli] So you see the regime's hand behind the  shooting  down of the helicopters.    [Al-Bayyati] We never received any information or signs  indicating that. Whatever the reason, it is a sign that the  tension has risen dramatically in Kurdistan: Even before the  end of Ramadan two divisions of the Republican Guard, the  military elite, were deployed and took up positions in the  Kirkuk and Mosul areas. Some expected the customary brutal  repression against the Kurds, as has happened at other times of  crisis in the regime. But no, nothing. However, the danger has  not gone away: Saddam has entered a terminal phase,  increasingly alone, not even succeeding in "feeding" the  traditional caste of privileged people -- in the Army, the  services, the party -- which forms his power base. Do you  understand? Trapped in this corner, he will choose to act, to  strike in one way or another: in the North, the South, over the  borders. He will not wait for his head to fall under the slow  guillotine of sanctions.    [Stefanelli] Let us just suppose showdown point is reached:  Driven by desperation, Saddam launches a new attack and the  international community responds; are you people in opposition  ready? Are you united, and do you represent a concrete  alternative?    [Al-Bayyati] We are a coalition of groups, we have been  working together since 1983 and -- more especially -- since the  war between Saddam Husayn and the international forces. We have  reached a common agreement, despite the differences remaining  between the groups represented in our front, an agreement on two  points: First, freeing ourselves from the current regime.  Second, implementing democracy. It will be up to the Iraqi  people to elect the president and parliament. The one who gets  the majority will govern, the others will go into opposition.  Classic rules, no problems. But that will come later: Today  we are moving ahead united, and we will fight against a common  enemy.    [Stefanelli] But how do you intend to fight? Do you have  weapons? Who is backing you?    [Al-Bayyati] We have relations with all the countries in the  region. Kuwait, for example, has helped us and is continuing to  do so. Our guerrillas have infiltrated everywhere: in the  marshes to the south of the country, in Kurdistan where we have  our headquarters, and also in Baghdad where opposition is  growing. We are receiving arms and money. Iraqi businessmen  and companies outside the country are very generous. We are  receiving political and logistic support from other countries.  Right now we are strengthening our contacts within the Iraqi  Army. Certain officers, increasingly higher in rank, have  deserted to our side and are serving as bridges. We are certain  that, when the spark is ignited, military and civilians will  unite against the regime.    [Stefanelli] Three years ago the people seemed to be almost  all on Saddam's side, with the exception of the Kurds and a  large part of the Shiite community. What consensus can the  president count on today?    [Al-Bayyati] I would say that consensus no longer exists.  People are hungry and reduced to unbearable poverty. Saddam's  three traditional circles of allies are shrinking: The Sunnite  minority, which has so far controlled wealth and power, is no  longer fully behind him, nor is the clan from Takrit [as  published], the dictator's birthplace and the heart of the  regime. But what speaks loudest is the fact that not even his  family, the closest and most basic circle, is now 100-percent  behind him. The plots and ensuing reprisals -- the purges which  have followed one after the other in these three years of Iraqi  decline -- have split the old power system right across the  board and for good.</p>

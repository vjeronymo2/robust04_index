			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Move to cut NHS waiting lists HEALTH AUTHORITIES are scrambling to meet a government commitment that all patients on hospital waiting lists for more that two years will be treated by April. The final Pounds 3m from this year's Pounds 39m waiting-list fund, used to buy extra treatment for health conditions which have long waiting lists, is about to be allocated. In December 28,197 people had been on waiting lists for more than two years. This figure is now around 20,000. Health authorities can supplement NHS capacity by buying treatment in Ministry of Defence or private hospitals, although they are expected to keep within the broad NHS cost-structure when doing so. The attempt to meet the deadline is producing extra work for private hospitals, although leading private-sector health providers say that they are not experiencing a large upsurge in NHS contracts. The health department said that reports of surgeons being paid excessive fees for extra operations would be investigated if there was firm evidence. So far there had been no proof of abuse.</p>

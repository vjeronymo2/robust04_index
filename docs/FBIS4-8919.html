			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 19 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton and members of the National Security Council on Tuesday  morning [19 April] began discussions on a future U.S. diplomatic  and military platform for Bosnia-Herzegovina. As indicated by  U.S. Administration officials, the basic U.S. idea is to try to  persuade its allies and the United Nations to step up air  attacks on Bosnian serb targets. Yesterday's verbal attack on  the Bosnian Serb leadership by Vitaliy Churkin in Moscow has  directly spurred and encouraged Clinton's advisors to opt for  more severe punitive measures against the Bosnian Serbs, sources  in Washington said.    Churkin's statement that Russia would not allow the Serbs to  treat it as a `banana republic' and that `negotiations with the  Serbs' should be suspended was received in the White House with  relief because it was interpreted as a direct suggestion to the  U.S. to adopt a radical platform which would not be countered by  a Russian veto.    Commenting on Churkin's statement, Russian Ambassador to the  United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov said that neither the Russian  Government nor President Boris Yeltsin were behind it. U.S.  papers write that Monday's request by U.N. Secretary-General  Butros Butros-Ghali for new NATO actions against Bosnian Serbs  had been inspired by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations  Madeleine Albright, who is also a member of the National  Security Council. On Monday, she was briefly absent from a  National Security Council session, which discussed proposals for  Tuesday's meeting with Clinton, in order to telephone to  Butros-Ghali and tell him that the White House was willing to  launch more radical air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs.    Observers in Washington are not sure what kind of reception  the new, more radical U.S. variant will get. It is believed  that a difficult diplomatic manoeuvre will be needed to win over  NATO allies for a wider-scale bombing. Indicating a tougher  stand toward the Bosnian Serbs, U.S. papers and a part of  political structures on Tuesday said that the White House was  ready to exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the embargo on arms  deliveries to all sides in former Yugoslavia. After an  incredible pressure from the Congress and the radical wing in  the White House on Monday, the issue was put on the agenda of  Clinton's meeting with the National Security Council on Tuesday.</p>

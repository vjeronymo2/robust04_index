			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Xining, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's  Qinghai Province chalked up a record value of the total goods  and services last year, with big progress in all the sectors,  including agriculture, industry and foreign trade.    According to statistics from the local government, the  province harvested 1.2 billion kg of grain and 150 million kg of  oil-bearing crops in 1993, both record high.    Despite a rare storm at the beginning of last year, the  province's stock breeding industry achieved good total in major  livestock.    The output of the province's rural and township firms  registered a 30 percent growth over 1992 to exceed one billion  yuan (110 million U.S. dollars).    Qinghai's industry has picked up momentum, due to more  technical input and reforms of companies' management systems.  Many crisis-ridden trades, such as machinery and woollen  industry, have stepped out of the doldrums.    More and more state-owned businesses have meshed with the  demand of the market and produced a number of high-quality  products, which are welcomed by consumers both in and out of the  province.    Last year, Qinghai's total industry output amounted to eight  billion dollars (990 million U.S. dollars).    In addition, local government further boosted individual and  private enterprises. About 120 new trading markets have been  put up, contributing to a four billion retail transaction last  year.    In 1993, the province took great strides in foreign trade,  with a total import and export volume of 100 million yuan (11  million U.S. dollars).    Another 49 foreign-funded firms were built up, bringing in  45  million U.S. dollars in investment.    In addition, the province held a large-scale commercial fair  in Hong Kong, striking 20 million U.S. dollars worth of deals  and concluding 40 cooperative contracts with foreign companies,  which will bring in another 300 million U.S. dollars.    Last year, the local government slashed a number of  money-consuming construction projects to ensure energy and  material supplies for key national projects.    By the end of last year, several key projects had been put  into operation, such as a one-million-ton refinery in Golmud,  the expansion of Qinghai Aluminium Plant and first-stage  renovation work on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.</p>

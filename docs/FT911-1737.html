			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Philips changes shape and name SHAREHOLDERS in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, yesterday approved a a simplification of the company's complex structure involving, among other things, a change of its legal name to Philips Electronics. The changes end the long-standing division between the former operational company, NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken (Philips Light Bulb Factories), and the company which formally holds the group's shares, NV Gemeenschappelijk Bezit. By simplifying its structure, Philips has effectively scrapped the weakest of its three anti-takeover mechanisms but it remains well protected against a hostile bidder through two layers of preference and priority shares. Mr Jan Timmer, the head of Philips, addressing his first annual shareholders' meeting since being elevated to president at an extraordinary meeting in July, said the group's profitability was still unsatisfactory in absolute terms. On Wednesday, Philips unveiled a first-quarter net profit from normal business operations of Fl 135m (Dollars 71m), a sharp rise from a year earlier, on turnover of Fl 12.5bn. Under Mr Timmer, Philips has embarked on a wide programme of restructuring, including a 20 per cent in the group's worldwide workforce. In an upbeat assessment of the progress so far, Mr Timmer said a change of mentality was taking place at Philips, which has long been synonymous with a flabby bureaucracy and a sluggish reaction to new market conditions. 'Above all, there is once more a winner's mentality within this company,' he said. However, Mr Timmer refused to be drawn on whether the company would be in a position to resume its dividend payments in 1991 after suffering a net loss of Fl 4.24bn and omitting its payout in 1990. The 1990 loss was due in large measure to Fl 4.64bn in restructuring charges.</p>

The disused building, across the Thames from St Paul's Cathedral, is to be converted into the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art. The final shortlist of architects for the Pounds 80m project was announced yesterday. Just one is from the UK - David Chipperfield Architects. The others are Herzog &amp; de Meuron (Switzerland), Office for Metropolitan Architecture (Netherlands), Rafael Moneo (Spain), Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Italy) and Tadao Ando Architect and Associates (Japan). The six were chosen from an initial shortlist of 13. The winner will be announced in February, with the building work due to begin in 1996. The gallery, which will be bigger than the whole of the Tate's Millbank building, is planned to open in the year 2000.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Spain rises on prospects for devaluation CENTRAL banks acted in concert to support the peseta, there were further interest rate cuts, particularly from France, and some investors began to worry about the outcome of Sunday's Russian referendum, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID was volatile in early trading but regained positive territory later in the session. The general index ended 1.33 higher at 247.03, a 3 per cent gain on the week and a year's high, as turnover soared to nearly Pta30bn. Mr Chris Cooper of James Capel observed that it was rather a question of when, rather than if, the peseta was devalued, although the Socialist government had been clinging to a desire to hold off until after the June 6 elections. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities expects interest rates to come down swiftly after devaluation and has overweighted the market accordingly. In the market there was considerable activity in exporters with Acerinox, the stainless steel producer, a significant gainer, closing up Pta500 at Pta7,900. Among the banks, Popular and Santander both showed strongly with respective gains of Pta520 and Pta70 to Pta14,600 and Pta5,100. Utilities were sold with Iberdrola slipping Pta25 to Pta708. PARIS was active on the last day of the account with considerable US selling noted. The CAC-40 index, driven by futures, lost 27.8 to 1,916.58 after a high of 1,946 and a low of 1,900. The index has shed 3.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was FFr3.4bn. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe commented that the repo rate cut by the Bank of France had been expected and lent little support. In spite of the day's declines he believes that the market will rise again next week to test the 2,000 level. Peugeot went against the trend with a rise of FFr22 to FFr564 as buyers came in after positive comments from Mr Jacques Calvet. However, some analysts feel that Mr Calvet's hopes of a slowdown in the fall in European car sales are too optimistic, since there would have to be a phenomenal recovery in the second half. Elf lost FFr13 to FFr357 on indirect confirmation that it would be interested in increasing its stake in Petrofina while among the financials Paribas outperformed with a rise of FFr3.80 to FFr425. BRUSSELS met profit-taking amid uncertainty over the Russian referendum and the Bel-20 index dipped 17.92 to 1,223.94, for a weekly fall of 2.4 per cent. Petrofina dipped 6 per cent at one stage before closing BFr320 or 3.5 per cent lower at BFr8,770. But the share subsequently picked up to BFr9,050 in the London after-market after suggestions that Elf was interested in increasing its stake. FRANKFURT lost ground in thin volume as investors remained on the sidelines. Traders, who had rushed to buy after the Bundesbank's cut in the discount rate, took profits to adjust their positions. The DAX index fell 9.64 to 1,657.10, falling 1.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was DM6.2bn. Gains made in Thursday's post-bourse trading on the interest rate cuts were eroded across the board. Siemens fell DM7.1 to DM628.4 on speculation of lower than expected earnings figures to be announced next week. Linde was dragged down DM10 to DM751 in spite of higher than expected earnings forecasts announced on Thursday. MILAN rallied as speculators bought blue chip issues, encouraged by the Bank of Italy's move late on Thursday to cut the discount rate, and on hopes that the political outlook will become clearer over the weekend. The Comit index rose 3.43 to 531.63, for a weekly rise of 3.5 per cent, as the market waited to learn who President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would appoint as a new prime minister following Mr Guiliano Amato's resignation. Fiat again led the advance, rising L100 to fix at a two year high of L6,860, before continuing up to L6,920 after hours. ZURICH ended easier but above the day's lows as uncertainty about the the outcome of Sunday's Russian referendum weighed on the market. The SMI index shed 14.6 to 2,162.7, little changed on the week. Exporters were easier in response to the lower dollar and US economic data. Nestle registered shares dipped SFr10 to SFr1,115 while Roche certificates shed SFr20 to SFr4,280. AMSTERDAM fell back in tandem with the weaker dollar and the CBS Tendency index dipped 1.0 to 110.3, a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week. STOCKHOLM eased as the central bank failed to cut its marginal lending rate during the trading session. The Affarsvarlden index fell 7.14 to 1,020.42, or 2 per cent on the week. After the close, the central bank eased its key lending rate by 25 basis points to 9.5 per cent. OSLO, however, ended higher as overnight lending rates were cut to 8 per cent from 8.25 per cent. The all-share index rose 2.16 to 398.53, up 1.2 per cent from the previous week. HELSINKI finished the week on a firm tone on hopes of lower interest rates. The HEX index rose 17.7 to 1,118.6, advancing 5.4 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices April 23 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1159.94  1158.75   1158.53  1156.25 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1226.16  1225.53   1226.64  1223.64                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.72  1155.51   1155.45  1156.50 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1224.46  1223.01   1223.01  1223.66  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 22    Apr 21    Apr 20    Apr 19    Apr 16 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1164.35   1157.71   1158.12   1164.59   1159.61 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1234.50   1224.52   1220.73   1221.99   1217.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1160.50; 200 - 1229.68 Low/day: 100 - 1154.16 200 - 1220.93.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

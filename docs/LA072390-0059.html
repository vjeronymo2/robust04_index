			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> PMS TREATMENT DOUBTED  </P> <P> Progesterone suppositories, the most common treatment for premenstrual syndrome  (PMS), are not significantly effective for the condition that afflicts up to 7  million American women, University of Pennsylvania researchers said last week  in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> The researchers studied 168 women who reported various PMS symptoms, including  irritability, mood swings and breast tenderness -- the largest such study ever  conducted.  </P> <P> Women in the 1988 study received vaginal suppositories containing progesterone  for two months, followed or preceded by two months of treatment with a placebo.  </P> <P> Forty-four percent of the 121 women studied reported at least a 50% decrease in  PMS symptoms. But because all the women had received both progesterone and a  placebo, researchers said the improvement could not be attributed to the  hormone.  </P></p>

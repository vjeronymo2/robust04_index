			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, April 3 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Moslem  army has stepped up attacks on Serb defence lines in the area of  Doboj in the north of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina while their attacks in the areas of Gorazde,  Cajnice and Foca in eastern Bosnia are becoming less intensive  after a defeat of their troops in the area.    Bosnian Serb army sources said on Sunday evening that the  strongest Moslem assaults had been reported in the area of Mount  Ozren, south of Doboj, where they had carried out several  infantry attacks on Sunday morning before being forced to  retreat with major casualties in their ranks.    The Moslems fired ten shells on Doboj and continued to bring  in fresh troops to the Teslic battlefront in the south.    As part of an all-out offensive on the territory of the  Bosnian Serb republic, Moslems have been continually shelling  Doboj over the past five days, causing great damage to the town.    Moslem units continued attacks in the area of Trebava east  of  Doboj and in the area of Brcko north of that town, as well as in  the region of Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) and Mt. Vlasic in  central Bosnia.    Despite a defeat suffered over the past few days in the  areas  of Gorazde, Cajnice and Foca, the Moslem army is carrying out  new mobilization and re-grouping of its troops, Bosnian Serb  army sources said.    They said they had received an information that the Moslems  had on Saturday night expected in vain a large quantity of  weapons, ammunition and food to be airdropped in the Gorazde  area.    The Bosnian Serb army command said on Saturday that it  possessed proofs that the airdrop operation (in which  humanitarian supplies are parachuted to the population of Moslem  enclaves in eastern Bosnia, including Gorazde) was being used  for supplying the Moslem army with up-to-date arms.    The Bosnian Moslem army has used those weapons in its latest  offensive on Serb positions from the direction of Gorazde, where  more than 10,000 Moslem fighters are based in spite of the fact  that the enclave should have been demilitarized a long time ago  under a resolution of the United Nations which proclaimed the  town a "safe area."</p>

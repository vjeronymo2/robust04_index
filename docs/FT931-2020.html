			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (3): Sales continue to fall - Mainframes THE world will only ever need five mainframe computers,' said Thomas Watson, the founding father of International Business Machines. His prediction, made many decades ago, may yet come true as sales of the industry's workhorse 'number crunchers' continue to fall. IBM's 1992 results - one of the worst losses in financial history - are the final evidence, if any were needed, that the day of the proprietary mainframe is finally over. Now IBM is intent on capturing the open systems market, rather than on trying to pen its customers into proprietary systems architectures. 'Customers are very clear about what they need to solve large problems,' says Mr Nicholas Donofrio, IBM's Enterprise Systems general manager. 'We are responding by making our products more open, by further enhancing server capabilities and by continuing to reduce the total cost of computing on multiple platforms.' And the company certainly seems to be opening up its architectures, announcing open standards as recently as February 1993 for MVS/ESA, a key IBM mainframe operating system. Britain's ICL has also announced changes, mainly performance upgrades, to the System 39SX range, its top-end mainframes. And it, too, has opened up its mainframe operating system, VME. ICL's VME, launched in the mid-1970s, is perhaps the youngest of the mainframe operating systems, and it was relatively easy to fit open interfaces on top of the operating system software, says Peter Slavid, ICL's corporate business systems manager. 'We've learned a lot from the Unix environment about openness,' he says, 'and we can apply this to the mainframe environment. But we've also learned some of the limitations.' Mr Slavid does not believe Unix is yet capable of managing a very large corporate network, for instance, leaving some room for potential growth in the mainframe arena. BESIDE the ageing of the mainframe market, though, there is increasing pressure on mainframe vendors from the makers of supercomputers. Many believe, though, that the machines from companies such as Pyramid and Sequent are probably not as resilient or as fault tolerant as mainframes, or as effective at archiving and data management, especially if they support more than a few hundred users. Of the true supercomputer vendors, such as Cray and other scientific mainframe suppliers, mainstream mainframe manufacturers seem even less worried. 'In other European countries, supercomputers are common in commercial environments,' says Mr Slavid. 'But these people are coming from a scientific background and these applications are very different from the banking and commercial applications in Br itain.' Which means that mainframe manufacturers still have the pick of the UK market - for the present, at least. A problem with that UK market, though, is price. Once unassailable, the prices of mainframe systems are tumbling now like PC prices at sale time. 'With the commoditisation of the market, mainframes are now just boxes,' says John Perkins, a director at the National Computing Centre. 'There is intense pressure on the margins of mainframe suppliers who are being attacked on all sides,' he says. 'That's inescapeable.' This explains the switch in focus of hardware vendors, away from hardware sales and into software and services. IBM, ICL and Digital among others are all becoming service-oriented suppliers. The watchword is 'solutions.' One remaining demand for mainframe systems, a demand that will keep sales trickling in for some time, is the requirement for large transaction processing systems. Mainframe systems in banks and building societies effectively operate as country and even continent-wide networks. Trying to replace these with a distributed network of Unix boxes may mean saying goodbye to processing power and security. 'It's important to remember that we have learned a lot of lessons in the mainframe market over the last 30 years,' says John Perkins. 'For many people, mainframes represent a significant investment of time, money and effort. This is not something they will throw away lightly.' But that is exactly what many users are considering. In a 1992 survey conducted by the NCC, over 55 per cent of its members - representing 584 medium to large computer installations and over two million staff - have already considered downsizing and a further 11 per cent plan to do so within two years. The main reason users are looking to move away from mainframes is their initial cost, but ease of access and flexibility of use are also important to today's increasingly sophisticated users. The result for mainframe vendors will be a 31 per cent cut in the number of mainframes in the coming year. They will be replaced chiefly by super-minicomputers and intelligent workstations. Perhaps the most important, often forgotten factor companies should consider when downsizing is corporate culture. Clearly, a decentralised, distributed IT system is not the best solution for a hierarchical and highly centralised organisation. In companies such as this, service to the user will deteriorate and cost-savings will evaporate in a flood of corrective measures designed to remedy an irremediable solution. Further problems may arise for users with the change in skills needed among IT service personnel. The key problem here is that software development platforms will move away from the traditional mainframe database management systems and ever closer to the PC-based database systems and fourth generation languages of the Unix world. In the medium-term, therefore, skills issues will become increasingly central to the drive away from mainframes. In the short-term, however, downsizing will continue, as will the fall in price. And to combat the drainage, away from mainframes and into open, Unix-based systems, hardware companies will continue evolving into software and service companies. 'The hardware companies will continue to move into the service business as fast as they can,' says Doug Eyeions, secretary of the Computing Services Association. IBM, ICL and Digital Equipment all make more money from software and services today than they do from hardware sales. This may suggest a sudden death for the mainframe, but its future for the time being is assured. 'The mainframe is still good at cost-effectively sharing large volumes of data among large numbers of users,' says Peter Stuart, marketing strategy manager for ICL's mid-range systems. Large scale applications such as airline reservation systems will stay on mainframes, he suggests. Doug Eyeions agrees: 'For the rest of this decade we will still need mainframes as database drivers on very large applications, but that's all.' But what about the future? In the long-term, it seems, mainframes will becoming corporate data centres, massive repositories of data. But to get at the data, users will be managing a transparent network of Unix boxes. And what do users think of this diagnosis? 'In the long-term, Northern Electric's strategy is to move away from proprietary mainframe platforms,' says Peter Wadham, programme manager for integrated billing services at Northern Electric. 'At the moment, though, the size, availability and processing power of Unix boxes just isn't there.' The users seem to agree.</p>

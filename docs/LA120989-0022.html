			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH AND GORBACHEV'S MALTA SUMMIT  </P> <P> The well-kept secret of the Bush bombshell dropped at the very first session of  the historic summit -- that the 20th summer Olympics be held in Berlin -- had  little connection to the weighty work at hand (Part A, Dec. 3). It was no great  appetizer for the momentous menu of world alignment lying ahead. It  demonstrated Bush's unawareness of the sensitivity, both East and West Europe  have to the German problem. He likes throwing a wild card in the deck, as in  Danforth (Quayle).  </P> <P> Did Bush try to preempt the usual Gorbachev by a bold announcement of worldwide  significance? It fell as flat as the Russian ruble, with the thud of silence.  </P> <P> LOUIS E. HYMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

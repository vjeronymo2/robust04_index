			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Thai police halt march on king's palace: Security forces block protest by tens of thousands demanding removal of prime minister THIRTY thousand sit-down protesters confronted riot police in the Thai capital of Bangkok early today after the country's unelected prime minister defied their demands to quit. Facing the country's most serious unrest in twenty years General Suchinda Kraprayoon, went on television to insist that he was the country's legitimate leader. But well over 100,000 people poured onto the streets to try to force the general, who led a military coup which toppled an elected government last year, to resign. The protesters want the prime minister to be chosen from the ranks of elected lawmakers. Gen Suchinda does not hold a parliamentary seat. Thousands of the protesters led by opposition leader General Chamlong Srimuang, the former governor of Bangkok who has been on hunger strike since Monday, tried to march towards the Royal Plaza, scene of huge demonstrations this week, but six ranks of riot police armed with clubs blocked their way. Soldiers erected barricades and trucks armed with water cannon stood behind the lines. Gen Chamlong, weakening from the hunger strike he has vowed to maintain until Gen Suchinda quits, appealed from the back of a truck for calm. The protesters sat down and started singing. 'If you want to kill the people, you kill me, the first person,' he told police at the barricades. A strict Buddhist, Gen Chamlong is immensely popular in Thailand and is considered to have great integrity. If he were hurt or killed, it could trigger serious riots. His march yesterday towards the royal palace to appeal to Thailand's king to intervene seemed to be designed to bring the month-long crisis to a head. During the day there had been speculation that Gen Suchinda, appointed prime minister without standing in last month's election, might resign. The rumours contributed to a 20-point rally on the stock market. But when he appeared on television in the evening he defended his decision to accept the premiership saying that a neutral leader was needed to hold together the five-party government coalition. He argued that it was 'universal' democratic practice for the prime minister to be a person supported by a majority in parliament. The prime minister pledged that the military and police would not use violence to suppress the demonstration unless infiltrators caused sabotage and violence. Protesters say last year's coup was part of a plan to instal the dominant group of officers in full political control.</p>

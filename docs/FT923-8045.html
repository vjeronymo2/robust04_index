			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 8.5m land sale by Graseby Graseby, formerly Cambridge Electronics, yesterday announced a sale of development land that will substantially reduce gearing for the environmental monitoring and medical products group. The company expects to use the Pounds 8.5m proceeds from the sale to J Sainsbury and Schlumberger Industries to reduce group borrowings. The proceeds should help almost halve net debt which is likely to have risen to nearly Pounds 20m at the end of June. The land being sold is at the Great Cambridge Road, Enfield, where Enfield Borough recently granted planning permission for retail and industrial development.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA TOURNAMENT OF ROSES MARKS ITS CENTENNIAL FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Your series on the Tournament of Roses was fascinating (Part I, Dec. 29-Jan.  1). I have attended probably half of the 100 parades over the years, having  been initiated by my late mother Grace Moore Gales, who was exactly 1 year old  when the first parade was held. Seeing the 1913 picture of the woman in a cart  drawn by the ostrich reminded me that my mother worked at the Cawston Ostrich  Farm about then, and she once rode in the parade with her brother driving a  decorated power lawn mower provided by the Annandale Country Club. How the  floats have changed!  </P> <P> If sponsoring companies calculate so carefully the cost of a float versus the  minutes of exposure on television, I cannot understand why their drivers don't  keep recommended distances from the participant ahead of them. Too many  "tailgate" on the parade route as if they were in traffic rather than keeping  back so spectators can fully enjoy each entry until it has completely passed  by. Leaders of marching bands and banner carriers are even worse at tailgating.  </P> <P> If committee members wants to get a cut of the vending money and benefit  spectators too, they should sell an audio tape through street hawkers. Using  information only available to the association, it would describe each float's  motif and flowers, tell who is on board, give tales about horses and  participating bands like one hears on TV. One does not have time to read a  program about each float and watch it too, but one could listen to a tape while  watching to enhance the enjoyment of the visual spectacle. One would just have  to remember to bring one's own tape player or buy or rent one there.  </P> <P> DONALD GALES  </P> <P> Rolling Hills  </P></p>

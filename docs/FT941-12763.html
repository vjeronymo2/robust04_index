			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / MMC opposes public competition inquiries Moves to inject greater transparency into the workings of the UK competition authorities by holding inquiries in public are being blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A review last year of the commission's internal procedures carried out for the Department of Trade and Industry by accountants Price Waterhouse has called for greater transparency in commission procedures. But Mr Graeme Odgers, MMC chairman, said yesterday the need for the commission to have access to highly sensitive commercial information meant inquiries should continue to be held in private. Presenting the commission's first annual review since taking over from Sir Sydney Lipworth last April, Mr Odgers said open inquiries would make companies under investigation more cautious and would result in longer, more formal proceedings. That would increase the period of uncertainty faced by businesses caught up in an investigation at a time when the government was trying to reduce the burden on industry of complying with competition law. The Consumers' Association said that while some parts of the inquiry process should continue to be held in private to deal with confidential information there was a strong case for exposing the commission's broader findings to wider public scrutiny. Mr Stephen Locke, the association's director of policy, said the MMC's stance was in marked contrast to that of the Office of Fair Trading. OFT attacks delay, Page 9 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

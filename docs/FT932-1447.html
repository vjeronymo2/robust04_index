			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (15): Solid and serious / Profile of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya THE healthiest thing that has happened to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) is that it has stopped worrying about being the number one domestic bank. It has settled down to being a very solid, serious and indisputably large, banking group. BBV was the first of the large domestic banking groups to emerge as a result of a merger process and it is the first to come out the other side, intact and with the traumas of union behind it. When Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya, the arch-rivals of Basque banking savvy, merged at the end of the 1980s to form BBV, the numero uno ideal was something close to an obsession. It was also a short-lived ambition for the Basque alliance begat others. A couple of years after Bilbao and Vizcaya had walked down the aisle together in 1988, two Barcelona-based savings banks, the Caja de Pensiones and the Caja de Ahorros de Barcelona, linked up to form La Caixa, Spain's biggest financial institution. A year later, in 1991, a second wave of mergers was in process that was to definitively alter the profile of the domestic financial institutions. BBV was finally knocked off its top perch when the state-controlled banks linked up to form Argentaria and when Banco Central joined forces with Banco Hispano Americano to create Banco Central Hispano (BCH). Argentaria posted larger average assets for 1992 and BCH's net interest income, although down on its 1991 figure, was above that of BBV. The downgrading in the banking system's ratings does not appeared to have wounded BBV's pride overmuch. Nor, for that matter, was it too upset about the fact that its net profits had dropped by nearly 20 per cent in 1992 to Pta81bn. The reason for the lowered profits was that the banking group had posted a fall not in its day-to-day business but in extraordinary profits through disposals. Non-banking business income last year was, at Pta40.2bn, 42 per cent down on what had been earned in 1991 when the banking group had sold off two of its subsidiary networks. The extraordinary income of the previous years - when BBV rationalised all the duplication that had resulted from the merger - had, however, been put to good use. It had used the cash flow to improve its products and its fee business and to reduce its costs and pick its clients. BBV's real bottom line at the end of last year was that it had improved its margins where they mattered. It was this that pointed to the banking group's exit from the merger traumas. The key points in BBV's 1992 figures were that its operating profit grew by 11.1 per cent to Pta136bn; its ordinary profit was up by 8.6 per cent to Pta74.2bn; and its share of the banking sector's deposits and other borrowed funds increased by 1.25 per cent to represent 14.29 per cent of the total. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, argued with disarming logic that 'today's clients are tomorrow's profits.' Analysts, who gave the balance sheet high points, noted that BBV's bad debts grew by just 15.7 per cent against an average 50 per cent increase in bad loans for the domestic financial sector as a whole and that its operating expenses declined by 2.3 per cent. Mr Ybarra, hailing 'a tremendous improvement' in the bank's profitability profile, announced that the dividend would be increased by Pta6 to Pta169 per share. By the first-quarter milestone of this year, BBV seemed to be clearly on the right track. It reported a 4.4 per cent rise in net income to Pta17bn over the first three months of 1992, an operating profit rise of 7.3 per cent to Pta36.7bn and a 10.4 per cent rise in ordinary profits to Pta21.8bn. By comparison with net first-quarter profit rises of 8.1 per cent and of 6.1 per cent that were reported by Banco de Santander and by Banco Popular respectively, BBV's three-month figure looked more modest. But once more BBV appeared to be gaining advantage on account of its size over its smaller rivals. The 1992 trend which had BBV increasing its share of the sector's deposits and borrowed funds appeared to be still very much in force. The banking group said its first-quarter customer deposits stood at Pta6,200bn; 10 per cent up on the volume at the end of the first three months of last year. What was quite clear from the first-quarter balance sheet was that the quality of BBV results was consistently improving. If the operating profit continues to grow this year then the 1992 net income drop will prove to have been an isolated hiccup and Mr Ybarra's upbeat remarks to the group's AGM will have been fully justified.</p>

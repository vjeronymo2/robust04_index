			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd's investment fund details released NOBLE &amp; CO, the Edinburgh-based issuing house, yesterday released details of its fund designed to invest in Lloyd's of London, the insurance market. In a memorandum, it says it plans to raise Pounds 30m which will be invested through two separate but linked (or split capital) companies from the 1994 underwriting year. The vehicle takes advantage of proposed plans by Lloyd's to introduce corporate capital into the market without the unlimited liability requirement currently imposed. Premium Underwriting will be allocated Pounds 12m and Premium Trust, a separate company, will receive Pounds 18m. The underwriting company will provide an interest-free loan of Pounds 11m to the trust. In exchange, the trust will pledge Pounds 28m to Lloyd's. This will allow Premium Underwriting to maintain an initial underwriting capacity of Pounds 56m, which will be allocated between up to 40 syndicates. This will be co-ordinated by Wellington Members' Agency. Premium Trust will be managed as an investment trust by Martin Currie Investment Management. Minimum investment will be Pounds 3,000. The fund aims to attract about 30 per cent of the total from individuals. S G Warburg yesterday announced proposals for New London Capital, a listed investment company designed to provide corporate capital for Lloyd's of London. It will be advised by a London subsidiary of Chartwell Re and its investments managed by Mercury Asset Management.</p>

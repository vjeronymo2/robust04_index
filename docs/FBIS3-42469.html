			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text] Rollei AB (Skelleftea, northern Sweden) has  developed a new  type of wheelchair with which a disabled person can be moved not  only in the sitting position but also while standing at full  height. Its developers--the firm's owners, the Degermans, father  and son--are currently involved with manufacturing a prototype  of this chair, which has received the designation RTS (Raise To  Standing).    The RTS wheelchair can be gradually adjusted for height.  Instead of ordinary belts to secure the position of the body, a  disabled person can use front and side supports. Electric  drives, control of which is carried out using switches located  on the armrests and at the chair level, are used to change  position and other operations. A person can stand in the chair  not only straight up but also with a slight forward incline:  that position is recommended as promoting strengthening of the  skeletal system.    The inventors say that "this is not the first wheelchair  that  permits a disabled person to assume a vertical position, but it  is the first one in which a disabled person can move in the  vertical position." To do that, wheels equipped with hand rings  which permit a disabled person to rotate the wheels have been  made in such a way that they are accessible from any of the  disabled person's body positions. These wheels are comparatively  small in diameter in order to permit the wheelchair to be  maneuvered in a restricted space. The fact that the chair's  armrests are retractable downward and the disabled person can  leave the chair from one of its sides is another advantage.    The RTS wheelchair is specifically recommended for patients  who are paraplegics, polio sufferers, or people suffering from  rheumatic diseases. A user of the wheelchair obtains greater  independence, thanks to which a person's self-confidence  increases. From the medical point of view, breathing is eased  and digestion and blood circulation improve when the body is in  a vertical position.    After some refinements, the RTS wheelchair will be ready for  testing at the Swedish Institute for Problems of Disabled  Persons and then for series production. The item has been  patented; its development was financed by the Swedish National  Committee for Industrial and Technical Development (NUTEK).    Rollei AB has already previously developed and produces  several models of special wheelchairs. One of them, "Partner,"  facilitates accomplishment of various labor operations for the  user. It is comfortable, height-adjustable using an electric  drive, and has small dimensions. The other chair helps a  disabled person to perform his natural hygiene needs.

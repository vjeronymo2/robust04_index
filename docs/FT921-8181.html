			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory school choices highlighted - Education LABOUR yesterday attempted to push education up the pre-election agenda by asking why Tory ministers continued to prefer private schools for their children in spite of their claims to 'have improved state education out of all recognition'. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said the entire Labour frontbench used the state system while only one Cabinet minister - Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary - sent his children to state secondary schools. His charges were promptly derided as 'nasty, personalised attacks' by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, who claimed they showed that Labour did not have an education policy. 'The point of our reforms is to raise standards in state schools so that no parents should feel obliged to send their children to private schools unless they wish to,' Mr Clarke said. Mr Straw insisted that the fact that ministers still opted for private schools was eloquent testimony to their lack of confidence in state education, in spite of 13 years of Tory government. This point, he added, was first made in a 1990 pamphlet by Mr George Walden, Tory MP for Buckingham and a former education minister. Asking why ministers avoided the state sector, Mr Walden concluded: 'The only answer now is the truth, and the truth is scarcely sayable by any government minister.' Mr Straw said that the election would give voters the choice between a Labour Cabinet who used state schools and 'a Conservative party who have no personal interest in state education'. He went on to produce new Labour research showing that nearly all cabinet ministers in Germany and France used publicly funded schools. Asked whether he was dragging personal issues into the election, Mr Straw insisted he had taken care not to identify individual Cabinet ministers' children or their schools. 'What I was articulating was a profound question about this government's commitment to state education first raised by a Tory MP,' he said.</p>

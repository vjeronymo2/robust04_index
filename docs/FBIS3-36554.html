Katsman: "Missiles -- Merely the First Step"] </F>   [Text] Dnepropetrovsk regional organizations of the Party  of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine and the New Ukraine association  have adopted a joint declaration in support of the tripartite  Ukrainian-U.S.-Russian agreements on nuclear weapons. The  declaration points out that courageous and resolute steps should  be taken to save Ukraine's economy, including those in foreign  economic and diplomatic spheres. Leonid Kravchuk's actions,  although a little too late, give some hope for the improvement  of economic indicators as a result of a decrease in expenditures  on maintenance of nuclear arms. On the other hand, an urgent  need for Ukraine's domestic economic reform has become even more  evident. The road to the world community has opened before  Ukraine, but to set out upon it, Ukraine must prove to its own  people its loyalty to progress, market principles, well-being,  and prosperity.    Sergey Mikhaylenko, leader of the regional organizations of  the two parties, who has been nominated candidate in  Dnepropetrovsk electoral district No. 76, underlined that  fidelity to economic reform will be the distinctive feature of  the centrist forces' electoral platform. In particular, four  principles represent the epitome of S. Mikhaylenko's electoral  program: Priority of human rights, the curbing of inflation,  reform in the system of ownership, and increased independence of  regions.</p>

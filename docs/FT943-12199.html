			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Scandinavia Local investors in the Nordic markets, who traditionally take summer holidays earlier than their southern European counterparts, are returning to work to find that the bourses have been putting in strong performances, albeit in low turnover. The Nordic countries were among the best performers over the last week, and month, as they continued to pick up after their uncertain performances earlier in the year. In addition, Denmark saw a strong performance by banks, helped by a rising bond market, while foreign analysts have also proved enthusiastic about the outlook for TeleDanmark and DDL, the Danish part of SAS. Sweden witnessed foreign demand for Volvo, while Outokupu and Nokia were the driving force behind Finland's improvement. Norway had high expectations, in the event justified, of yesterday's results from Norsk Hydro. Mr Richard Lilley of Unibank commented that the figures were likely to confirm that positive tone as investors turned their attention to next month's raft of half-yearly corporate figures.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                  % change in local currency**   sterling**  USDollars**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             1 Week   4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of    Start of                                         1994       1994        1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +0.93     +1.82    +9.78    -7.91     -3.30        -0.14 Belgium      +2.08     +2.18    +6.42    -5.12     +1.15        +4.45 Denmark      +3.00     +5.57   +21.28    +1.19     +6.37        +9.85 Finland      +4.24    +10.54   +47.23   +16.96    +24.41       +28.47 France       +3.30     +6.60    +6.88    -9.26     -4.95        -1.84 Germany      +2.05     +5.76   +14.61    -6.60     -1.57        +1.65 Ireland      +2.24     +9.08   +16.05    +0.20     +3.73        +7.12 Italy        +2.91     +6.21   +28.49   +19.79    +25.36       +29.45 Netherlands  +3.16     +4.61   +15.58    -4.59     +0.23        +3.50 Norway       +3.24    +10.94   +23.63    +5.75    +10.75       +14.37 Spain        +1.72     +3.58   +14.79    -6.76     -1.93        +1.28 Sweden       +3.76     +6.99   +24.92    +3.93     +6.99       +10.49 Switzerland  +3.35     +0.48   +12.03   -10.53     -4.84        -1.72 UK           +1.35     +8.10   +10.59    -8.40     -8.40        -5.41 EUROPE       +2.28     +6.09   +13.00    -5.97     -2.97        +0.21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -0.52     +1.60   +14.20    -4.68     +0.80        +4.10 Hong Kong    +0.20     +2.67   +36.49   -23.98    -26.37       -23.96 Japan        -1.99     -2.52    +0.40   +12.29    +22.93       +26.94 Malaysia     -0.71     -1.02   +38.66   -23.18    -22.64       -20.12 New Zealand  +0.92     +0.18   +18.43    -6.50     -2.01        +1.18 Singapore    -0.27     +0.35   +25.74   -12.66     -9.99        -7.04  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       -0.02     +5.18   +11.98    -2.07     -8.89        -5.91 USA          -0.25     +2.43    +1.63    -2.62     -5.70        -2.62 Mexico       -1.90     +0.55   +35.18   -13.05    -23.18       -20.67  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -0.59     -0.79   +41.87   +13.19     +2.66        +6.02  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -0.15     +1.70    +5.66    -0.44     +1.59        +4.92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **Based on July 22nd 1994.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., and NatWest Securities Limited.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

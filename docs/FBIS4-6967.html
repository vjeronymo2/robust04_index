			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] formally  decided to leave the ruling coalition at an emegency meeting of  its central executive committee on Tuesday [26 April] morning,  party officials said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama earlier Tuesday had announced  that the largest party in the coalition would quit the alliance,  leaving it without a majority in parliament. Murayama revealed  the decision following a meeting of key SDP leaders.    The SDP pulled out to protest the abrupt establishment of a  new parliamentary group "Kaishin" by five groups including  Shinseito, headed by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Murayama said he is willing to hold talks with Prime  Minister  Tsutomu Hata, who started wooing the SDP back to the alliance  immediately after the party broke ranks with the ruling  coalition.    In a TV program, Murayama said, ''I am ready to talk (with  Hata),'' if the newly elected premier seeks a meeting.    But he nevertheless reiterated that the SDP has no plan to  rescind its decision to part with the other coalition partners  after the party was infuriated with the move to form a new  parliamentary bloc.    ''Unless the prime minister demonstrates stronger leadership  and offers 'evidence' that they have mended their ways (of  handling Diet affairs), the same thing will happen again,'' he  said.    The party has no intention of changing its decision to quit  the coalition, he said.    The SDP chief showed a clear eagerness to seek alliance with  new party Sakigake [Harbinger], which earlier decided against  joining the Hata administration while providing some legislative  support.    ''We have had good cooperation since we were in the  coalition  in efforts to check the dual power structure (within the  coalition).''    ''I believe we can further deepen our ties and join forces  to  set Japanese politics on the right course,'' he said.    Murayama did not rule out the possibility of a snap election  for the House of Represetatives, while sounding cautious about  seeking that course of action.    "It would be better not to create a political vacuum under  the current economic conditions," he said. "But we should make  a decision on that issue after carefully assessing the entire s  ate of affairs."    Meanwhile, SDP members of both houses of the Diet met and  endorsed the decision by the party's policy-making board to walk  out of the coalition.    At the meeting, Murayama called for unity among the party  members.    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and some other coalition  partners "want to see the SDP split up. Let us unite to guard  against that," he said.</p>

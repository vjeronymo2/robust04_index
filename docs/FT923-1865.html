			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Sarajevo flights set to resume THE United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees will ask international aid agencies and governments to resume the humanitarian relief effort to Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina later this week. All flights to the Bosnian capital, which Serb forces have besieged since early April, were suspended after Croat forces shot down an Italian relief aircraft on September 3. The plans to resume flights follows agreement at the weekend in Geneva by the Serbs, Croats and forces loyal to the Bosnian government. They agreed to make the airport secure for the airlift operations, to grant safe road passage for the delivery of humanitarian aid, to desist from disrupting electricity and water supplies to the civil population in all areas, and to ensure safe passage for convoys carrying released detainees. But Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UNHCR's high commissioner, said: 'The guarantees are not wholly satisfactory, and all the security risks for the airlift operation have not been eliminated.' Since the downing of the Italian aircraft, road convoys have also been attacked by Serb forces near Stup, a key strategic route which links the road from the airport to Sarajevo. Despite the continuing fighting and the risks facing the convoys, Mrs Ogata said it was crucial that aid reached Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities before winter. Even if Sarajevo airport is re-opened, it will not be able to receive flights every day throughout the winter because of heavy snow and the thick fog which regularly settles over the city after October. Because of this prospect, the UNHCR convoys, backed by UN armoured patrols, will have the task of negotiating the opening of four road routes out of Croatia and Serbia into Bosnia. Many of the main routes are controlled by gangs of Serb and Croat forces. Many are also impassable because they have been mined, or else bridges have been blown up. It is the task of the UN to help repair these routes. But European Community diplomats in Belgrade yesterday conceded that 6,000 additional troops committed by Britain, France and other countries to assist the UNHCR's operations, would take several weeks to arrive. Mourners burying 12 war victims in Sarajevo scattered in terror yesterday when two mortar shells exploded 100 metres from graves dug in one of the city's main cemeteries, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Witnesses said scores of screaming people ran for cover and some jumped into open graves as shrapnel ricocheted round their heads. The mortars hit a road between the Lion cemetery and the Kosevo hospital. The cemetery is always busy with the funerals of those killed in the daily shelling and sniper attacks.</p>

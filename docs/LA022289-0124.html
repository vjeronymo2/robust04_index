			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL 'JUNK BOND' UNIT REPORTEDLY TO STAY IN SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission will permit Drexel Burnham Lambert's  highly profitable "junk bond" department to remain in Beverly Hills under terms  of a settlement likely to be made public soon, sources close to the  negotiations said Tuesday.  </P> <P> In talks on settling pending SEC charges of fraud, insider trading and stock  market manipulation, the agency had demanded that Drexel move the high-yield  junk bond operation back to the firm's headquarters in New York, where SEC  officials felt it could be more closely supervised.  </P> <P> But Drexel strongly resisted, claiming that closure of the office would be  catastrophic to the firm's business. Officials said they feared an exodus of  key employees who were reluctant to move. The junk bond department, headed by  Michael Milken, has been the direct or indirect source of most of Drexel's  profits. Its activities also have been the source of nearly all of the firm's  legal problems with federal regulators and the U.S. Attorney's Office in  Manhattan.  </P> <P> The threat of being forced to close the Beverly Hills office prompted Drexel in  January to mount a lobbying campaign with Los Angeles city officials and  congressmen from California. Both of California's senators and seven  representatives wrote to SEC Chairman David S. Ruder asking that Drexel be  permitted to keep the office open.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement, however, were worked out with the SEC's enforcement  staff. Ruder and the other commissioners are believed not to have officially  considered it yet, and it isn't known if they played any role in shaping it.  The commissioners must formally approve the settlement before it becomes  official.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills office was founded by Milken in 1978. He had almost  single-handedly developed Drexel's hugely profitable junk bond business in New  York and then won approval to move the department to his native Los Angeles.  The junk bond operation has been a major force in financing hostile corporate  raids and leveraged buyouts. Although the department nominally was under  control from New York, Milken in actuality was allowed much independence.  </P> <P> The accord would end the SEC's lawsuit, which has been pending against Drexel  since September. It also would clear the way for Drexel to carry out its  announced agreement with federal prosecutors in New York to plead guilty to six  criminal counts and pay $650 million in penalties. Under that agreement, Drexel  is also supposed to fire Milken and deprive him of his 1988 bonus. But that  provision is being challenged in court by Milken's lawyers. Milken, who denies  any wrongdoing, is still expected to be indicted on a variety of securities  fraud and racketeering charges.  </P> <P> Although the core of the junk bond operation will remain in Beverly Hills, the  agreement will, as expected, require Drexel to move some peripheral operations  back to New York, sources said. These include trading in convertible securities  and the limited trading in stocks carried out by the high-yield department.  </P> <P> Although the junk bond operation will remain where it is, the Beverly Hills  office will be subject to much closer scrutiny under provisions of the  tentative settlement, the sources said. The firm will be required to name at  least two outside directors to its 22-member board, and it will pay for the  services of a Philadelphia-based law firm, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius,  selected by the SEC, to closely review Drexel's compliance with securities  laws.  </P> <P> It is understood that one reason the firm was selected is that it has offices  in Los Angeles as well as in New York. A member of the law firm's management  committee noted that the SEC commissioners hadn't taken final action on the  settlement yet and so declined to comment on reports that his firm had been  selected to monitor Drexel's compliance.  </P> <P> The Morgan Lewis firm has been retained before to conduct this type of  monitoring for the SEC. It was hired in 1987 to review procedures at Los  Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co., a brokerage firm, after its founder and  chief executive, Boyd L. Jefferies, pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges.  The law firm found no major problems at Jefferies. But some congressmen and  others at the time criticized the selection of Morgan Lewis because the firm  had been Jefferies &amp; Co.'s outside counsel while Boyd Jefferies carried out  his illegal activities.  </P> <P> Morgan Lewis, however, doesn't represent Drexel. And a source said the SEC is  likely to require a much more extensive review of Drexel than it required of  Jefferies &amp; Co.  </P></p>

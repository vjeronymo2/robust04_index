			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 19, RIA -- A State Duma delegation has  returned from China in the early hours of May 19. It was  staying there since May 14 at the invitation of the Chinese  parliament's standing committee. The Russians met with state  and communist leaders, visiting several enterprises and free  economic zones.    According to Speaker Ivan Rybkin, the reforms must be  implemented in a capable manner, with due respect toward history  and traditions. He also stressed the need for economic and labor  incentives. For his part, Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the  Agrarian Party, says Russia shouldn't have destroyed the old  system and that it ought to have borrowed some useful aspects as  China had done. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's  foreign-affairs committee, stressed that the trip had corrected  a small infatuation with Western-style politics and economics,  saying that the Chinese economic-reform experience was quite  interesting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Laszlo Bekesi, the elaborator of the economic  policy of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], does not believe  very much in the government's economic success policy or the  predictions of an imminent economic upswing. [passage omitted]    [Begin Bekesi recording] We know precisely that a bitterly  hard lesson awaits the next government; and this will be true  even if on the basis of today's results there are perhaps better  chances for the creation of a successful coalition and a  successful government program than there were even a day ago.    There is a good chance that an efficient coalition will come  into being. What is at least as important is that there is also  a good chance that this coalition will have a good program. We  can only hope -- and we wish this for all of us, for society  above all -- that those who voted for us will stay with us even  while we wrestle with the difficulties of implementing the  program we have outlined. And we are also clear that after the  elections, you, the overwhelming majority of the press, will  automatically become an opposition press. I think I can promise  on behalf of us all that we will not blame you for the bitter  problems. [end recording]    In the event there is an overall victory, it will probably  be  Bekesi who will have to conclude the social contract which will  expect entrepreneurs to moderate their profits and employees to  exercise restraint in the wages battle. According to [MSZP]  Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja, the phase of change in the system  in which the Hungarian left wing struggled for its life, has  ended.    [Begin Baja recording] It is true that the second round will  be the decisive one. Prime Minister Peter Boross was right in  this. The position from which we are preparing for this second  round is that in 152 individual constituencies we are starting  out from the victorious first place. We will not commit the  mistake, either, of regarding the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free  Democrats] as an opponent in the next period just because it is  in second place. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

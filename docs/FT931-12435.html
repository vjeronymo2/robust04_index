			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner plan to cut debt moves ahead TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, moved ahead with its plan to lower its debt burdens by announcing plans to redeem the remaining 20m shares - at a cost of Dollars 1.1bn - of its Series D convertible preferred stock, writes Alan Friedman. Last week Time Warner said it would redeem Dollars 2.5bn worth of the Series D stock. The share buy-back provides more evidence of the company's intention to tackle the cost of preferred stock dividends, which have been a heavy burden on the balance sheet. Prior to yesterday's announcement the company had a total of Dollars 4.1bn of preferred stock outstanding. Dividend payments for both Series C and D preferred stock, which was issued as a result of the 1989 agreement by Time to merge with Warner Communications, cost the company Dollars 579m in 1991. Following the Dollars 1.1bn redemption there will still be Dollars 3.1bn of Series C preferred stock outstanding.</p>

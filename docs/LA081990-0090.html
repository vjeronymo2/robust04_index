			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> POLICE, BORDER PATROL WRONG PARTNERS;  </P> <P> LAW: CALLING IN AGENTS WHEN MIGRANTS SEEK HELP FROM THE LAW HELPS NO SIDE IN  THE MIGRANT PROBLEM.  </P> <P> A couple of weeks ago, two undocumented farm workers went to East County's  Ranchita sheriff's substation to ask for help claiming unpaid wages from a  local grower. The way they figured it, being cheated out of several months'  hard labor was too great a wrong for las autoridades (the authorities) not to  set right.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies on duty called in Border Patrol agents, ostensibly to  interpret for them. The two farm workers soon found themselves on their way to  San Ysidro in a Border Patrol van -- dubbed perrera (dog-catcher's wagon) --  empty-handed and convinced that any contact with law enforcement invites  deportation.  </P> <P> In the northern half of San Diego County, where sheriff's deputies not only  police the unincorporated areas but are under contract to cities with numerous  day laborers, this conviction is widely shared by migrants.  </P> <P> The consequences of such mistrust can be dire for a population that is actually  terribly victimized, despite a series of attempts to portray farm workers as  perpetrators of serious crime.  </P> <P> For example, early this year, farm workers in Rainbow-area encampments endured  several weeks of payday holdups by a pair of gun-toting Anglos. Only when a  robbery victim was shot in the stomach without provocation was the Fallbrook  sheriff's substation called.  </P> <P> Asked what took them so long, the workers explained that el sheriff usually  brought along la migra (the Border Patrol), making even the newly legalized  among them apprehensive.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies again professed that they team up with the Border Patrol  simply to avail themselves of Border Patrol agents' Spanish-language skills.  Few sheriff's deputies are sufficiently conversant in Spanish to qualify for  the department's bilingual bonus.  </P> <P> Clearly, it behooves the department to quickly better its ability to  communicate directly with the substantial number of non-English speaking people  working and living in North County. For sheriff's deputies, a smattering of  street Spanish, ineffective in the past, no longer does the trick, because  Spanish is barely a second language for a new wave of migrants from southern  Mexico and the highlands of Guatemala.  </P> <P> However, the community relations problem at hand goes beyond the Sheriff's  Department's non-compliance with state bilingual services' mandates for public  agencies like those involved in law enforcement.  </P> <P> Given the leading role sheriff's deputies played in recent alien roundups  solicited by the city of Encinitas, it would seem that the department has opted  to actively enforce immigration laws, instead of focusing on police work.  </P> <P> Inevitably, this partnership between the two agencies is self-defeating for the  Sheriff's Department because it burns much-needed bridges to immigrant  communities. Police departments from Santa Ana to San Jose have recognized  this, and decline to participate in immigration raids.  </P> <P> San Francisco police do not even inquire into immigration status or release  information to the Border Patrol of an arrestee's suspected illegal presence,  unless the offense charged entails controlled substances. A narrower directive  allowing release of such information in the case of any felony has been  proposed in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ignoring the fact that effective law enforcement depends on a high degree of  cooperation by the entire public served, sheriff's deputies, with border patrol  agents at their sides, descended on three Encinitas encampments one Sunday  afternoon last month.  </P> <P> Using trespass as a pretext to detain and interrogate migrants about alien  status, they set the stage for immigration dragnets of questionable legality.  </P> <P> The trespass arrests become all the more transparent when one takes into  account that complaints wholly unrelated to secluded encampment living (ranging  from drinking and urinating in public, to a perplexing "verbally harassing  children") were cited at every turn to justify participation by sheriff's  deputies. All too predictably, each one of the 29 arrested was summarily turned  over for deportation.  </P> <P> Aside from the civil rights questions raised by the blatant piggybacking of  immigration sweeps onto minor offenses, the joint operation is troubling  because it greatly intensified undocumented migrants' fear of sheriff deputies  and fueled anger and resentment on the part of documented migrants with whom  they share encampments.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, an "I'm your amigo" message delivered last week by a  sheriff's deputy to an all-documented work force at Encinitas' hiring hall was  reported in the press as not sitting especially well with observers of the  raids.  </P> <P> Another issue that looms large is law-enforcement priorities. The Sheriff's  Department has a wide latitude to set them in unincorporated areas and retains  such discretion in cities contracting for its services. Was a big show of  muscle that netted the deportation of 29 encampment dwellers -- most of whom  returned within two days -- cost-effective? Probably not.  </P> <P> Contrary to most people's understanding, undocumented migrants' illegal  presence in this country is normally not a crime, but a civil matter that  carries a deportation penalty. All the more reason why the Sheriff's Department  shouldn't launch police efforts aimed primarily at deporting undocumented  workers by detaining them under the guise of enforcing trespass, loitering,  littering and public drinking and urination laws.  </P> <P> If compassion for workers subjected to so much indignity while trying to feed  far-away families is not motivation enough for rethinking stepped up  cooperation between the Sheriff's Department and the Border Patrol, pragmatic  considerations certainly should be.  </P></p>

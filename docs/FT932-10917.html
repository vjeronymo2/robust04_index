			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: BSN adds to American interests BSN, the French food group, is expanding its North American interests by buying Aliments Delisle, a privately-owned Canadian dairy products company. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, turns BSN into the largest player in the Canadian yoghurt market. Aliments Delisle, which made sales of FFr300m (Dollars 56.6m) last year, makes cheese, cream and yoghurt under the Silhouette and Delisle brand names. BSN, a force in the European food industry which last year played a pivotal part in the bitter takeover battle for Perrier mineral water, is already present in the North American yoghurt market through the Danone brand in the US and the Danone label in Mexico. Fresh food, including dairy products, was one of BSN's strongest areas of activity last year. The group saw overall net profits before exceptional items rise by 5.6 per cent from FFr3.44bn in 1991 to FFr3.64bn in 1992 on sales of FFr70.84bn. Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, may expand in Portugal by investing in the water, telecommunications and transport industries after privatisation, Mr Paul-Louis Girardot, chief executive, said in Lisbon yesterday.</p>

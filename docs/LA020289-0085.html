			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER SEEKS ALLIES;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD INVITED TO DINNER, PEP TALK  </P> <P> Is the way to a neighborhood's heart through its stomach?  </P> <P> A Woodland Hills developer hungering for support for his planned $150-million  office project at the edge of Warner Center hopes so.  </P> <P> Builder Jack Spound invited a whole neighborhood to a fancy hotel dinner  Tuesday night to ensure backing for his controversial project at a crucial Los  Angeles Planning Commission hearing next week.  </P> <P> And Spound has asked all 850 members of the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce  to stop by the hotel tonight for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres and to talk about  supporting him at the hearing.  </P> <P> Spound said the Tuesday night dinner was a reward for residents of the Warner  Hills condominium development who have backed his project, which he hopes to  build in partnership with the Johnson Wax Development Corp.  </P> <P> But foes of the proposed development criticized his hospitality.  </P> <P> Residents of the condominium development next to the site where Spound wants to  build his "Warner Ridge" high-rise project were treated to cocktails and veal  with wild mushroom sauce and filet of salmon on the side in the grand ballroom  of the Warner Center Marriott hotel.  </P> <P> About 60 residents were expected; 34 showed up.  </P> <P> After dessert, guests heard a pep talk about how crucial the neighborhood's  support will be when the Planning Commission conducts the 5 p.m. public hearing  for Spound's application at Parkman Junior High School, 20800 Burbank Blvd.,  Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Homeowner Opposition  </P> <P> Other homeowners in the area oppose the project. Their objections have prompted  City Councilwoman Joy Picus to try to rezone the site so that only  single-family houses can be built there.  </P> <P> Spound contends that his proposed nine-structure development, which would  include two seven-story buildings, is endorsed by the majority of homeowners  who live near his 22-acre site at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and  Oxnard Street.  </P> <P> Spound's hospitality drew a hostile reaction from project opponents.  </P> <P> "I don't consider it ethical," said Robert Gross, a vice president of the  Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization, whose neighborhood was not invited to  the dinner.  </P> <P> "The wining and dining of selected local residents shows this developer will  stop at nothing to achieve his goal," Gross said. "I have a real problem with  him trying to pit neighbor against neighbor."  </P> <P> But Spound said outside the hotel ballroom Tuesday night: "This is just a way  of thanking people who have supported us all along."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, his public relations consultant said the dinner was held to build  "team spirit and camaraderie" among supporters.  </P> <P> Sydney Wilson Knott said the dinner was aimed at boosting the self-confidence  of supporters. She said some of them emerged from a previous public hearing  with a bitter taste in their mouths after they were hooted down by project  foes.  </P> <P> Gross denied that assertion.  </P> <P> "Everybody was very polite to the proponents of the project," Gross said. "If  they felt intimidated, I guess they had a guilty conscience. If I decided I  wanted to support an unpopular thing in the community, I'd feel as intimidated  as hell. It's a natural reaction."  </P></p>

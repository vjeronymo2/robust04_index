			<p>BFN     [Text] At the Labor party's Central Committee [CC] meeting  today, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin criticized both Histadrut  trade federation officials and central committee members. He  said that the responsibility for the party's failure in the  recent Histadrut elections lay with the Histadrut members.  Rabin expressed disappointment with the party's central  committee and complained that half of its members had been  appointed through various party machinations. However, the  prime minister asserted, elections to change the current  composition of the central committee would be held prior to the  next Knesset elections.    Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that throughout the  speech, the hostility between Rabin and the Labor Central  Committee members was evident, and the prime minister's speech  was constantly interrupted by catcalls. Yitzhaq Rabin warned  the central committee members that if the new Histadrut  secretary general was not nominated by August, it would mean a  death sentence for the Histradrut sick fund. He attacked those  who violated the party bureau's decisions with regard to  establishing a coalition with the Ramon-Meretz Histadrut list,  and said that there was no room in the party for people who  broke agreements. Our correspondent adds that when Gershon  Gelman, the secretary general of the Tel Aviv workers council,  stepped up to the podium, Yitzhaq Rabin stood up and stormed out  of the hall, sparking an uproar. Many participants yelled that  because of Gelman, the Labor party had lost 40 worker council  branches.</p>

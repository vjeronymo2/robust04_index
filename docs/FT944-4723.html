			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Extending the EU eastwards It is five years since the the end of the Soviet empire in eastern Europe. But western Europe has still not recovered from the shock. Members of the European Union have been timid, where eastern Europeans have been heroic. Judged by the 'pre-accession strategy' for the associated countries of central and eastern Europe, to be discussed at the meeting of the European Council in Essen this week, the EU still fails to appreciate the urgency of the challenge. This does not mean that the EU has done nothing. At the Copenhagen summit in 1993, the European Council 'agreed that the associated countries in central and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union. Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required.' In addition, the 'Europe Agreements' have committed the EU to industrial free trade with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Slovenia and the Baltic republics are expected to join quite soon. Yet this is insufficient either to provide adequate encouragement to reform in eastern Europe now, or to ensure a smooth transition to membership of the EU later on. The fundamental failure has been an unwillingness to recognise what is at stake. The mission of the EU is neither to protect European farmers, nor to succour European steel mills, nor to transfer the odd tens of billions of Ecu from rich members to poorer ones. It is to integrate Europe. The fall of the Soviet empire was not an annoying interruption, but what made this feasible at last. The enlargement of Nato is, happily, a side issue. Extension of the opportunities afforded by a prosperous market economy will integrate and stabilise the two halves of divided Europe, as it once did the divided and impoverished west. This task is not similar to the challenge posed by north Africa, partly because these countries will never join the EU. Free trade The EU should start by providing industrial free trade to eastern Europe now. If EU competition policy is adopted by these countries, it should also eschew anti-dumping and other forms of contingent protection. And it should insist that liberalisation by these partners towards the EU be extended, automatically, to one another, in order to avoid the emergence of a discriminatory 'hub-and-spoke' relationship. Eastern Europeans need secure market access if they are to attract more foreign direct investment. For this reason, they must be protected from EU contingent protection, particularly since their exports are concentrated in 'sensitive sectors'. The EU should remember that, in 1992, it enjoyed a surplus of Dollars 13bn in manufactures with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Total imports of manufactures from all these countries were less than 60 per cent of imports from Switzerland alone. The terror felt by EU member states - demonstrated by the fact that the Europe Agreements contain seven safeguard clauses - is pathological. Preconditions The second requirement is a statement of the preconditions for accession, particularly of how and when the candidate states are to apply the acquis communautaire. Those preconditions should not, as the statement from leading European economists published today by London's Centre for Economic Policy Research rightly argues, include conditions EU members themselves do not meet. The third - and most difficult - requirement is to change the EU. A study by Prof Richard Baldwin for the CEPR concluded that by the end of the century the net budgetary cost of enlargement might be 70 per cent of the planned budget. This may be an exaggeration. But it would still be less than 1 per cent of the EU's total GDP. What is needed is cuts in spending, particularly on agriculture (perhaps by nationalising most compensation payments) and some increase in revenue. Whatever happens in the meantime, accession negotiations should be started directly after the inter-governmental conference in 1996. Even if those negotiations were completed swiftly, there would, no doubt, be a lengthy and well-defined period of transition. Such a period is precisely what is needed by both sides. Why should the most advanced countries not have finished that transition by 2005? Sixteen years from the end of communism to the first full memberships does not seem unduly hasty. The EU is a creature of timetables. It should commit itself now to a date for opening membership negotiations, along with a statement of what will need to happen if they are to be concluded satisfactorily.</p>

The delegations were led  by Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Oliynyk and Alibek  Kasimov, the Kazakhstani Armed Forces chief of staff.    The NOVYNY television and radio agency learned that the  Ukrainian side said it was ready for technical and scientific  cooperation in developing new types of equipment and in  modernizing the already existing one. Mutual assistance between  Kazakhstan and Ukraine in this sphere will enable this work to  be carried out as efficiently as possible. The communique  deemed promising the cooperation of both countries in developing  their rocket and space capabilities. The Kazakhstani delegation  expressed its interest in a more intensive utilization of  Ukraine's repair facilities for the benefit of the Kazakhstani  Armed Forces. A mechanism for settling mutual accounts will  soon be determined, including the quick liquidation of debts.  Both sides noted the vast opportunities for cooperation between  the Kazakhstani and Ukrainian Defense Ministries in the sphere  of logistical support, military training, and other military  aspects. These kinds of bilateral consultations are in  compliance with international commitments and do not encroach on  the interests of third countries. During the negotiations, an  agreement was reached to hasten work by Kazakhstan and Ukraine  intended to finalize a military cooperation treaty.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by newly appointed Defense Agency [DA] </F> Director General Atsushi Kanda with unidentified domestic  correspondents at the prime minister's official residence in  Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified official]. We will now have a news  conference with Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda.    [Kanda] I am Atsushi Kanda, and I was just appointed  director general of the Defense Agency.    The situation facing Japan is tough. With the end of the  Cold War, an era of disarmament has begun. In particular, the  issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons  was taken up at a session of the UN Security Council, and the  Security Council is about to decide on various measures. Japan  should deal properly with the issue, taking the tough situation  into account. In the future, I will work hard toward Japan's  defense buildup. I would like to solicit your cooperation.    [Unidentified correspondent] Under the present  interpretation of the Constitution, [words indistinct] cannot be  acknowledged. In its party convention, the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP] has decided such a constitutional interpretation was  incorrect. What is your opinion?    [Kanda] The people have a variety of views regarding the  Constitution. As for the DSP, it has never made such a  decision. I think it is appropriate to deal with things within  the scope of the Constitution for the time being.    [Unidentified correspondent] It is said that since the Hata  cabinet is a minority coalition government, it will last  approximately two months. What is your opinion?    [Kanda] It may not necessarily become a stable  administration. However, I will do my best to enable this  cabinet to become a full-fledged administration and to respond  to the people's expectations. I intend to work hard to  successfully fulfill my duties.    [Unidentified correspondent] Viewing the Hata cabinet, it  consists mainly of Komeito members and others who were formerly  affiliated with the Liberal Democratic Party.    [Kanda] DSP Chairman Ouchi is a member of the Hata cabinet.  The important things are what measures the coalition cabinet  undertakes and how it makes the people understand what it does.  Therefore, I do not care who participates in the Hata cabinet.  As for myself, I intend to work hard to carry out my duties.</p>

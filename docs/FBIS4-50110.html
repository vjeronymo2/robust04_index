			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup" by Xie Dongfeng: "Israel, PLO Are Turning </F> Words Into Deeds"]    [Text] Jerusalem, May 13 (XINHUA) -- It is the ninth day  after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Israel and the  Palestinians are turning words into deeds smoothly on the whole,  though there have been some delays in the entry of Palestinian  policemen into the autonomous areas.    In Jericho, Israeli and Palestinian officials will hold a  brief ceremony this morning during which the authority of the  city will be transferred to Palestinians, who will then take  control of the civil administration building.    The last Israeli troops will leave the area this afternoon,  ending almost 27 years of Israeli rule.    On Thursday [12 May], an advance team of 20 Palestinian  officers crossed the Allenby Bridge and toured the Jericho area.    Later today, they will be joined by another 40 police  officers who will take control of the sites to be taken over by  Palestinians.    The two major military installations to be taken over are  the  Israeli Army base in the south and the Israeli police office in  the city center. Only a handful of Israeli troops still remain  there and everything is ready for a hand-over.    The Palestinian police will be also stationed at the site of  the ancient synagogue, although under an agreement, Israelis are  guaranteed access to the synagogue.    If the hand-over goes on smoothly, the area will be taken  control by 426 Palestinian policemen from the Palestine  Liberation Army from the Iraq-based Aqsa brigade who will arrive  later this afternoon through the Allenby Bridge from Jordan.    Palestinian Police Chief Mudar Yusuf said Thursday in  Jericho  that the first priority will be to ensure law and order and the  plans are for a self-rule area open to all.    So far, Jericho is still a closed military zone. An Israeli  Army commander, Ilan Biran, said he issued such an order for  fear of terrorist attacks both by extremist Palestinians and  Jewish settlers.    In Gaza, though the first entry of Palestinian policemen was  much delayed until the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli  troops completed the withdrawal from Southern Gaza Thursday  night.    The soldiers evacuated all the outposts in Rafah although  Palestinians have yet to take control of them. Earlier this  morning, three positions in Khan Yunis were handed over to the  Palestinian policemen.    It is reported that the Gaza City, Jabalya Refugee Camp and  the rest of the northern strip of Gaza are expected to be handed  over to Palestinians by next Wednesday.    In the coming days, contingents of PLA and Palestinian  policemen will arrive in Gaza and Jericho from Arab states.    Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  published a list of 15 members of the 24-member governing  council for the Gaza-Jericho areas. Israel had demanded a full  list before handing over the reigns of authority.    Under the Gaza-Jericho accord signed in Cairo last week, the  transfer of power from Israelis to Palestinians will be  concluded within three weeks, that is, by May 25.    Israeli Deputy Chief of General Staff Amnon Shahaq said  Wednesday that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho  could be fulfilled by the end of next week.    Now it seems that the Israeli troops are speeding up their  pace of withdrawal to keep its promise that it had no intention  to drag on in the future autonomous areas.    While the Palestinians are celebrating and preparing for  their long-awaited autonomy, the Israeli Cabinet and Parliament  have given green light to the Gaza-Jericho agreement to ensure  support for the implementation of the accord. The opposition  forces are strong, but nobody can turn the page upside down.    Accompanying the implementation of the accord is a peaceful  scene the two areas have never seen in these years.    Both Israeli soldiers and Palestinians have shown their  restraint, except for the clashes between Israeli soldiers and  the anxious and impatient Palestinians awaiting the arrival of  their own police Sunday.    On the other hand, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)  has stopped its terrorist actions recently, after it reached an  agreement with the Fatah that it would suspend attacks on  Palestinian collaborators for a month once the autonomy accord  was signed.    However, there were still violent elements emerging these  days.    Israeli security forces Thursday detained two Palestinians  suspected of firing at an army post in Jabalya. Israeli border  policemen arrested four men near Rafah Thursday, who were  suspected of shooting and wounding an Israeli truck driver in  Gush Katif in the afternoon.    On Tuesday, three Israelis were wounded by gunshots fired at  egged bus No. 474 in Beitel of the West Bank, but it is still  not clear who the attackers were.</p>

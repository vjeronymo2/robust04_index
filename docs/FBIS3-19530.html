			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy by Laurent </F> Maudit; place and date not given: "Sarkozy: `No Clever Tricks  in the 1993 Budget'" -- first paragraph is LIBERATION  introduction]    [Text] The budget minister, who yesterday presented the  1993 budget, denied having embellished the figures by tapping  the privatization nest egg, and not taking into account tax  breaks for businesse as well as the social security deficit.    [Maudit] Do you understand why people are finding it very  difficult to understand this year's budget policy?    [Sarkozy] I understand their difficulties all the better  given that this year we have broken some old habits. The budget  ministers who came before me used to announce an estimated  deficit, and subsequently published an operational deficit which  bore no relation to the former. This year we are introducing a  change which I am very proud of. Our 325.7 billion franc [Fr]  deficit for 1993 is even Fr1.9 billion less than the estimated  amount.    [Maudit] A shrewd reply which, however, leaves the question  unanswered. Is this drop in the deficit not in fact explained  by certain clever tricks in the presentation of the figures?    [Sarkozy] What tricks? The reduction in the deficit depends  on the development of both expenditure and income. Overall  expenditure is only Fr7.2 billion higher than the initial  estimate -- which proves that expenditure limits have been  scrupulously complied with. On the other hand, income has  surpassed our estimates by Fr9.2 billion.    [Maudit] Does this confirm that recovery is under way?    [Sarkozy] Precisely, given that this income surplus is  essentially due to a rise in VAT [value-added tax] receipts,  which increased toward the end of the year. This is the best  indicator of a recovery in economic activity. The government is  thus harvesting the first results of its policy.    [Maudit] The deficit is dropping, but the debt is soaring...  Do you believe, therefore, that indebtedness is not the only  trustworthy indicator?    [Sarkozy] You are talking like a theologian. I am a  pragmatist. Both indicators are equally important, because  today's deficit is in fact tomorrow's debt, and today's debt  consists of yesterday's deficits. It is therefore perfectly  true that the state's debt has increased by 38 percent over two  years. However, 30 percent of this figure is explained by the  increase in the deficit that we have inherited from our  predecessors. The remaining 8 percent is explained by the fact  that the social security debt has been taken over, and the fact  that VAT reimbursements by installments have been abolished.    [Maudit] Are you not establishing a precedent by allowing  the  state to take over the social security debt?    [Sarkozy] You know very well that the social security debt  existed before we came into office. Quite simply -- and you  yourself denounced this old expedient in the past -- our  predecessors conveniently left out the social security debt from  the government's budget on 31 December, only to bring it back  into the budget at a later stage. So, please do not accuse us  of having concealed this debt! On the contrary, we have been  truthful in disclosing its existence.    [Maudit] However, social security will continue to plunge  into debt unless the state comes to its rescue.    [Sarkozy] I would like to remind you that the prime minister  wishes to implement all the necessary reforms to prevent the  social security gap from becoming increasingly wider. This is  in fact the aim of pension reform, and of the initial measures  on health insurance, which will be followed by other savings  measures. I am therefore hoping that by taking over the social  security debt, the state will be definitely settling the  account. What is inadmissible, however, is to have allowed the  social security deficit to deteriorate in the first place. That  is the real scandal.    [Maudit] However, you have yourself authorized a few  exceptions to budgetary orthodoxy -- for example, by financing  current expenses with the income from privatization, something  which Edouard Balladur always refused to do in 1986-1988.    [Sarkozy] The prime minister has entrusted me with a very  simple task: establishing a budget which will help economic  recovery as much as possible. The present context is radically  different from the situation that you have just mentioned. In  1986-1988, France was at the height of recovery, and it was  therefore unnecessary to support business activity. At that  time, it was normal to allocate the income from privatization to  subsidizing public companies and to paying off the debt. In  1993, we found the economy in a state of deep recession. I am  therefore asking you: Can the same budget be planned for an  expansion period as for a recession period? My answer is  clearly "no."    [Maudit] When recovery begins, you will therefore stop using  the state's assets to fill the gaps in the budget?    [Sarkozy] An exceptional situation requires exceptional  measures. When we are again be able to rely on income from  taxation, part of it will be used to reduce the deficit. As a  matter of fact, we have committed ourselves to doing so with the  five-year law which provides for a massive reduction in the  deficit between now and 1997. I am not happy allocating  two-thirds of receipts from income tax to reimbursing interests  on debts in the 1994 budget. But I have no other choice. When  you are faced with a Fr140-billion drop in receipts from  taxation, you must still find some means of reviving the French  economy.    [Maudit] You do not therefore share the view that the budget  process is not open?    [Sarkozy] What I can tell you is that I am fully prepared to  work toward greater openess. The first problem with the budget  process is the fact that the most important debates take place  at the forecast stage -- when nobody knows what will really  happen. When it comes to implementing the budget, then there is  no more debate. It would be advisable to change this. No  doubt, a debate should take place in parliament when the budget  is implemented, in order to draw up the balance sheet. But,  believe me, if such a debate were to be held today, I would not  be worried in the least.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Permanent interest-bearing shares --------------------------------------------------------------------- Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and sell.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Coupon  Issue    Minimum   Price*   Yield* Stock                   (gross  price    (Pounds)  (p)      (gross                          %)     (p)                          %)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires    9.375   100.165  1,000     85.75    10.927 Bradford &amp; Bingley      11.625  100.129  10,000    110.00   10.568 Bradford &amp; Bingley      13      100.2    10,000    121.5    10.7 Bristol &amp; West          13.375  100.338  1,000     122.25   10.941 Britannia               13      100.423  1,000     119      10.924 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs     11.75   100.962  50,000    112.50   10.444 Coventry                12.125  100.749  1,000     111.75   10.836 First National          11.75   100.247  10,000    99.50    11.809 Halifax                 8.75    100.615  50,000    84.50    10.355 Halifax                 12      100.28   50,000    114.25   10.503 Leeds &amp; Holbeck         13.375  100.227  1,000     121.50   11.008 Leeds Permanent         13.625  100      50,000    128      10.645 Newcastle               10.75   100.317  1,000     98.75    10.886 Newcastle               12.625  100.446  1,000     114.50   11.026 North of England        12.625  100.135  1,000     115.75   10.907 Skipton                 12.875  100.476  1,000     117.25   10.981  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price as at midday 10 Nov 94 excluding accrued interest.

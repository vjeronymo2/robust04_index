			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Body Shop spillage details revealed Body Shop International, the cosmetics and toiletries group, was pursued by local US environmental authorities in connection with four separate releases of liquids from its New Jersey plant in the last two years. The details of its environmental performance appear to contradict statements it has released in the last few days as pressure has grown over its green and ethical image. Body Shop was responsible for at least three releases into the sewage system which were detected initially by the local sewage authority, a senior official of the authority said yesterday. In a letter, published in the Financial Times on Wednesday, Mr Gordon Roddick, Body Shop's chairman, said there had been two spills from its New Jersey warehouse of 30 gallons of shampoo two years ago after which it 'immediately notified the authorities'. However, documents obtained by the Financial Times show that the company released a total of at least 62 gallons of shampoo or shower gel in three spills, two in 1992 and another in 1993. On each occasion, it was officials of the Hanover Sewage Authority who identified the releases and traced them back to the Body Shop. In another incident in 1993, Body Shop notified the authorities immediately when sub-contractors hired while it was cleaning its warehouse emptied adhesive remover chemicals into the system. Mr Michael Wynne, executive director of the authority, said yesterday: 'It should have been relatively easy for them to comply with our regulations. They kept saying they were going to move.' He said Body Shop provided assurances that it would improve its systems after the first incident, but after two more it decided to issue it with a permit. He said he believed that the spills were readily preventable, and that there should have been time for Body Shop to identify them and notify the authority before its officers did. Body Shop yesterday said it was aware of two spills totalling 60 gallons and the release of the cleaning chemicals, but that while it was difficult to determine the exact sequence of notification the spills were insignificant. 'We have never said we are a perfect company. This is a small incident in the life of a worldwide company. Things like this do happen,' it said.</p>

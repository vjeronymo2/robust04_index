			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Merck It is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff in yesterday's profits warning from Merck. If profits at the largest US pharmaceutical company are being squeezed by government regulation and price-sensitive customers, the rest of the sector will surely suffer. The market's knee-jerk response in marking down Wellcome and Glaxo then looks correct. But to the extent that Merck's earnings are damaged by a strong dollar - around half its sales are made outside the US - UK pharmaceutical companies actually stand to benefit. There is also the nagging suspicion that companies like Merck might seek to blame the poor performance of specific drugs on wider industry trends. The fine print in its first-quarter figures will make more interesting reading than usual.</p>

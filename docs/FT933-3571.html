			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: LTV plans share offer to help reorganisation LTV, the third-biggest US steel producer, is planning an international share offering just weeks after emerging from seven years in bankruptcy protection. The company plans to sell 20m new shares, 3m of them internationally, according to a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Its share price fell Dollars  1/2 on the news, to end last week at Dollars 11. LTV said it planned to use the proceeds to support its capital spending and make contributions to its pension plan, among other things. As part of the court-approved agreement with creditors that allowed it to emerge from bankruptcy in June, LTV agreed to pay Dollars 850m into its pension fund at once to cover part of the plan's Dollars 3bn underfunding. It has to pay the remainder over the next 28 years. The issue will be the second injection of capital for the steelmaker: its financial reorganisation also triggered a Dollars 200m investment from Sumitomo Metal Industries of Japan, which now holds around 10 per cent of the company. The share issue will be underwritten by Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Smith Barney.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: The 'grass roots' strategy for holding back the deserts - Efforts to involve local people more in the battle against land degradation About 100 governments are expected to sign a new convention to combat desertification at the Paris headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation during a two-day conference starting today. Two fifths of the earth's land surface, with a fifth of the population, are drylands susceptible to desertification. However, just how much land is desertified and what desertification is - over 100 definitions have appeared in the past 20 years - have been hotly debated. Since the first desertification conference in 1977, the UN's own estimates of the areas affected have fallen dramatically from about three-quarters of drylands to less than a quarter, says Professor David Thomas, director of the Sheffield Centre for International Drylands Research, Sheffield University, in his recently published book Desertification: Exploding the Myth. In the convention, desertification is defined as 'land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid tropics'. At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, from which the new convention emerged during follow-up negotiations, climatic variation was added to human activities as a cause of desertification. This, fears Prof Thomas, could be used as an excuse to avoid supporting the local actions necessary to combat desertification caused by people. Soil degradation is the key indicator of land degradation. Overall, about 20 per cent of the world's soils are degraded according to the latest global survey. This was based on a computer database using local assessments of degradation. If the light degradation category is omitted, as this covers minor changes that can be easily reversed, the figure comes down to about 12 per cent. Europe's relatively high figure applies mainly to the semi-arid lands around the Mediterranean, while the low figure for Australia's dry land is because most of the changes relate to vegetation in rangelands rather than the soil itself, notes Prof Thomas. Most degradation is caused by water and wind erosion, followed by chemical degradation (salination, alkalination and nutrient loss) and physical degradation (mainly compacting and crusting). About 6m hectares of land are lost to desertification each year according to UN Environment Programme 1991 estimates. Wherever it occurs the effects can be devastating for the people involved. Many villagers near Hodeidha in Northern Tihama in Yemen, for example, have lost their houses to encroaching sands. For 10,000 years, all but the farmed areas of Yemen were covered by trees. Even the hot, dry coastal and inland fringes of desert were thick with acacia until 30 years ago. But, for the past few decades, traders have bought the trees for charcoal or building materials. Over 1,000 sq km of desert have been created according to World Bank reports, says Mr Tony Milroy of the Arid Lands Initiative, a small non governmental organisation (NGO) working with local communities in rural Yemen. Elsewhere in Tihama, herders can still graze their goats on trees because villagers have maintained the traditional practice of not cutting down live trees. Other communities have organised their children to collect seeds and local farmers are planting them into the denuded soil to re-establish cover, using techniques from Australia, says Mr Milroy. The common image of desertification is shifting sand dunes obliterating land and housing. But this is true only in very specific and limited circumstances, like those in Yemen, and not in much of the area fringing the Sahara. There has been a serious misunderstanding of how semi-arid areas adapt to the large fluctuations in climatic conditions normal in those areas, says Prof Thomas. Arid and semi-arid areas may have, for example, 15 to 20 years with relative high rainfall then a similar period with little rain. The vegetation dies off and the desert appears to advance but when rain returns, so does the vegetation. People living in these semi-arid regions have also adapted - moving their herds and varying their size, according to conditions. It is when other factors affect how the land is managed that desertification arises - social and economic changes and population pressures may lead to overcultivation, overgrazing, deforestation and poor irrigation practices, any of which can trigger desertification. These vary in different regions, making desertification not a single global problem with one solution but a problem with global dimensions, many causes and many solutions. It needs not grand global and national plans, but planning with and action by local people, building on the systems used in many of these areas for centuries, believes Prof Thomas. Although the new convention's provisions are broad and often vague, unlike earlier work it specifically stresses 'the importance of ensuring the full participation of men and women at all levels in programmes to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought'. The problem, says Mr Milroy, is that neither the UN and national governments lack structures suitable for working closely with local people. 'Our research and documentation of practical success stories shows that grass-roots initiatives that involve the real experts, local farmers, livestock herders that have subsisted in low-rainfall areas for millenniums, cannot only succeed but can be replicated at low cost without the involvement of outside expertise.' He and Prof Thomas are sceptical about the value of national plans and both urge greater support and encouragement to NGOs able and willing to work with local groups. Up to 50 NGOs from all over the globe will meet in Burkina Faso in early November to ensure grass roots follow-up to the convention. They will develop the networking abilities and pay particular attention to a strategy for Africa.

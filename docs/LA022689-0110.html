			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration proposed an $801,000 fine against Northwest  Airlines for safety violations, including the use of Boeing jumbo jets on 8,198  flights without a required engine bolt inspection. Northwest was also charged  with making unauthorized repairs on two 747s and failure to comply with a dozen  other FAA rules and directives. The proposed fine amounts to an FAA settlement  offer, which will take effect if the airline does not object. Alleged  violations were initially outlined in a Feb. 17 letter to Northwest President  John F. Horn., the FAA said. William Slattery, Northwest executive vice  president for operations, described the problems as primarily "instances of  inadequate record-keeping and differences in interpretation."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has  allowed the reopening of two electoral registration centers in  areas under its control in Nampula Province's Malema District --  namely, (Nicuassula) and (Leia). Benedito Vasco Verde, chairman  of Nampula's Provincial Electoral Commission, says the delay in  the reopening of the centers was due to a lack of transport.  With the reopening of the two centers all Renamo-controlled  areas in Nampula Province can now be registered.</p>

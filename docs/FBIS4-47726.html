			<p>BFN     [Text] The prefect of Cyangugu, Mr. (Emmanuel Mbagamiki),  has just delivered, to OZRT [Zairian Radio and Television  Office] in Bukavu, a denial that we are going to read for you--a  denial of a report broadcast by our station this morning  concerning massacres in Cyangugu. The same information was also  broadcast by other radio and television stations. Here is what  the prefect of Cyangugu said:    Following the serious events that have shaken Rwanda since  the death of the president of the Republic on 6 April, and the  resumption of hostilities by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  [words indistinct] (?7) April, thousands of people of all ethnic  groups and nationalities have been forced to flee their homes.  These displaced people took refuge wherever they thought they  would be protected from people's anger and [words indistinct]  RPF combatants' weapons.    In Cyangugu Prefecture, certain displaced people were taken  to Cyangugu Stadium. There were (?5,126) people there on 22-23  April when Mr. (Georges) [word indistinct] of the International  Committee of the Red Cross in Bukavu paid us a visit and left a  certain quantity of drugs for them. All these displaced persons  are still in the stadium. The shots heard on 29 April were  weapons fired by members of the security forces, who were  dispersing looters and robbers who were attempting to grab the  few belongings which the displaced had managed to bring with  them.    (?A state of) confusion ensued when some of the displaced  panicked, [words indistinct] the stadium [words indistinct].  Only a few of them took refuge elsewhere, and all the others who  are there presently -- around 5,492 -- returned there under the  vigilant protection of the gendarmerie. To the best of my  knowledge, no shots were ever fired in the stadium, and no [word  indistinct] has ever been used by the Army in the stadium or its  surroundings.    The prefect of Cyangugu Prefecture has made an appointment  with Mr. (Georges) [word indistinct] for 2 May to exchange  information and [words indistinct] to be made known to  international public opinion [words indistinct].</p>

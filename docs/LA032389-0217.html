			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 LOS ANGELES TIMES ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> KINGS AND QUEENS OF THE COURT;  </P> <P> GLENDORA'S MURRAY HAS RECORD YEAR  </P> <P> As high school basketball seasons go in the San Gabriel Valley, this was one  for the record books.  </P> <P> At least when the subject is Tracy Murray, the brilliant 6-8 forward for  Glendora High School who led the Tartans to a 31-3 record and the state  Division II finals.  </P> <P> In his final season, Murray established CIF Southern Section single-season  records for most points and highest scoring average and surpassed the career  mark for most points. Murray saved his best for last, pouring in a  state-tournament-record 64 points in his team's loss to Menlo Atherton in the  state final last week.  </P> <P> So it is no surprise that Murray tops the list of players on The Times All-San  Gabriel Valley high school all-star basketball team.  </P> <P> Charter Oak, which won the Sierra League and finished at 21-5, is the only team  with more than one player on the squad. The Chargers placed 6-9 center Jeff Von  Lutzow and 6-5 forward Shane Bowers.  </P> <P> Other team members are guards Jason Ferguson (6-0) of Workman, Jason Giambi  (6-2) of South Hills, Idris Jones (6-3) of Pasadena, Carlos Lopez (6-1) of  Rosemead and Corey Rogers (6-3) of Nogales and forwards Tony McGee (6-7) of  Azusa and Pablo Patino (6-7) of Bishop Amat.  </P> <P> There are no juniors on the squad. Murray is the only repeater from last year.  </P> <P> Murray is the first player to make the all-valley team three years in a row.  </P> <P> Murray averaged 23.1 points and 10.4 rebounds as a sophomore and 31.3 points  and 11 rebounds last year. This season he averaged 44.3 points -- best in the  nation -- and 14 rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots.  </P> <P> That gave him 3,053 points -- the first CIF Southern Section player ever to  surpass the 3,000 plateau. He also finished with Southern Section single-season  records of 1,505 points and a 44.3 average and finished in the Southern Section  top 10 for his career in rebounds and scoring average.  </P> <P> The three-time league most valuable player has been named to the McDonald's  All-American team and Gatorade state and regional player of the year. He has  narrowed his list of schools to UCLA, UNLV, Villanova, Louisville and New  Mexico.  </P> <P> Bowers hasn't nearly received the attention of Murray or even his teammate, Von  Lutzow, but has quietly emerged as one of the valley's top players. A two-time  All-Sierra League selection, Bowers averaged 18.6 points and 10 rebounds as a  senior.  </P> <P> He is an all-around athlete, captain on both the basketball and baseball teams  at Charter Oak.  </P> <P> Ferguson enjoyed a big year. He was one of the best shooters in the valley,  averaging 28.4 points, and averaged a valley-leading 12.6 assists and 5.3  rebounds. An All-Valle Vista League selection, he will probably attend Mt. San  Antonio College for one season and transfer to a four-year program.  </P> <P> Another standout named Jason from the Valle Vista League was Giambi, who led  South Hills to its best season in recent years. The Huskies won their league  title and finished at 19-6 as Giambi averaged 22.9 points and 10.9 rebounds.  </P> <P> Selected most valuable player of the Valle Vista League, he is also one of the  top pitchers in the valley, having led the Huskies to the CIF 4-A Division  finals last season.  </P> <P> When it comes to shooting guards, there may not have been anyone better than  Jones. He averaged 20.2 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals  to lead resurgent Pasadena.  </P> <P> With Jones earning Pacific League most valuable player honors, the Bulldogs won  their first league title in seven years and were ranked No. 1 in the CIF 5-A  Division most of the season before losing in the semifinals of the playoffs and  finishing at 24-3.  </P> <P> Jones, who was also named most valuable player of the Glendale and Bishop Amat  tournaments during the season, is considered one of the top college prospects  in the valley and has signed a letter of intent to attend UC Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Another outstanding shooter was Lopez, one of the premier players from the  three-point line in the Southern Section with 103, including 10 against  Mountain View. He made five or more three-pointers in a game 13 times in his  senior season.  </P> <P> Lopez finished the season with averages of 21.7 points and 4.8 rebounds to lead  Rosemead to a 19-5 record and its first league title and the second round of  the 4-A playoffs. He was selected the league's most valuable player.  </P> <P> McGee has followed a path of steady progress in three years as a starter for  Azusa. He averaged 17.3 points as a sophomore, 22.6 points and 8.5 rebounds as  a junior and 26.9 points, 11 rebounds and six assists this season.  </P> <P> He earned All-Montview League honors for three straight years and was named  league most valuable player the last two seasons. An outstanding offensive  player from both inside and outside, McGee was heavily recruited by Division I  programs and has signed a letter of intent with Hawaii.  </P> <P> This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for Bishop Amat. But with Patino  leading the way, the Lancers finished at 16-10 and reached the 4-A  quarterfinals before losing to Barstow.  </P> <P> An all-league first-team selection in the rugged Angelus League, Patino  averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds. He has been recruited by numerous Division  II and III programs, including Cal Poly Pomona, UC San Diego, Redlands and  Pomona-Pitzer.  </P> <P> Rogers stamped himself as one of the top guards in the valley. He averaged 15.2  points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.3 assists as a junior before improving to 25.9  points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.7 assists as a senior. An outstanding outside  shooter, he finished third in the CIF in three-point baskets with 92.  </P> <P> He was named to the All-Sierra League first team two years in a row and earned  all-tournament selection three times as a senior. He signed a letter of intent  last November with Northern Arizona.  </P> <P> Von Lutzow, perhaps the top center in the valley, averaged 24.5 points and 12.3  rebounds to lead the Chargers to a 21-5 record and the second round of the 4-A  playoffs.  </P> <P> Von Lutzow, a two-time all-league selection, was second to Murray in balloting  by valley coaches. He is considered an excellent college prospect and has  signed with UC Irvine. He also plays baseball.  </P> <P> Receiving honorable mention are Don Mitchell, Chris Henson and Burl Irby of  Pasadena, Ryan McKee of Pasadena Poly, Jason Green of Bishop Amat, Kenny Hall  of Garey, Clyde Jordan of West Covina, Johnny McWilliams of Pomona, Kevin Cable  of Covina, Criss Freeman of Baldwin Park, Rod Taylor of San Dimas, Derrick  Cooper of Blair and Hung Duong of Alhambra.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 ALL-STARS  </P> <P> The all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, their coaches  and parents will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday, April 2, at the  annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch where all-stars teams from 12  circulation areas will be honored at the Anaheim Hilton. The featured speaker  will be George Yardley, a former All-American at Stanford University, who went  on to become the first player ever to score more than 2,000 points in an NBA  season. The players and the coaches of the year from each area will be  announced.  </P> <P> The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to  fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the  observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will recieve the  traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOYS PREP TEAM  </P> <P> Name: Shane Bowers  </P> <P> School: Charter Oak  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-5  </P> <P> Average: 18.6  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jason Ferguson  </P> <P> School: Workman  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-0  </P> <P> Average: 28.4  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jason Giambi  </P> <P> School: South Hills  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Average: 22.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Idris Jones  </P> <P> School: Pasadena  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Average: 20.2  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Carlos Lopez  </P> <P> School: Rosemead  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-1  </P> <P> Average: 21.7  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Tony McGee  </P> <P> School: Azusa  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-7  </P> <P> Average: 26.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Tracy Murray  </P> <P> School: Glendora  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-8  </P> <P> Average: 44.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Pablo Patino  </P> <P> School: Bishop Amat  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-7  </P> <P> Average: 19.0  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Corey Rogers  </P> <P> School: Nogales  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Average: 25.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jeff Von Lutzow  </P> <P> School: Charter Oak  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-9  </P> <P> Average: 24.5  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [An article by Ian Holt of Coopers &amp; Lybrand: The Mobile </F> Green Paper]    [Text] Just before Christmas last year, the European  Commission's telecoms policy directorate produced a draft of its  long-awaited Green Paper on mobile communications. The full  document, pending official adoption by the Commission and  translation into all of the Union's official languages, is  expected at the time of writing to be published in March/April  1994. Ian Holt, who contributed to its development, looks at  the main points of the Green Paper, the background to it, and  its importance in the overall scheme of things.    Construction of European telecommunications policy started  in  earnest with the publication of the 1987 telecoms Green Paper.  The strategy was to tackle the fixed area directly, and to  address mobile and satellite communications separately. A Green  Paper on satellite policy appeared in 1990, but the mobile Green  Paper seemed to drift off the agenda.    Therein lies an apparently famous fact about the mobile  Green  Paper -- that it is two years late. This stems from linking the  Green Paper (like a lot of things) to the deadline for  completion of the single market by the end of 1992; it does not  refer specifically to the state of development of the mobile  sector itself.    In fact, in these terms, the timing of the Green Paper is  about right, coming at a point where the balance of opinion  believes that a large consumer market for personal  communications is going to develop. This provides a strategic  focus for policy development and a forward-looking context for  analysis of the current environment.    In 1990-1991, a formative period for the shaping of mobile  trends as well as telecoms policy, the Green Paper would have  had less of a sense of direction. And since actions were  already being taken to promote pan-European mobile  communications and introduce competition (second GSM licenses  being granted in France, Germany and elsewhere), it would have  had less to say.    As it is, the Green Paper is able to build on recent  technological, market and policy advances to propose new  directions of consequence to telecommunications as a whole.  <H5>  Main Goals of the Mobile Green Paper </H5>   The Green Paper is driven by two main aims.  <H8>  Single Market </H8>   The first of these is to ensure the existence of a  Union-wide  market for mobile communications. European telecommunications  policy has been largely shaped through application of the single  market and -- of particular relevance to telecoms -- the  competition provisions of the EEC Treaty, and the present Green  Paper is no exception.    Mobile services currently remain outside the scope of the EC  directives which carry the main thrusts of telecoms policy,  concerning market opening, licensing and open network provision  (ONP). A core job of the Green Paper is therefore to propose  how to extend these directives and the principles embodied in  them into the mobile area, taking account of the specific  circumstances of the sector.    Pursuing the single market aim in the fixed  telecommunications area has set an important context for the  Green Paper. In June 1993, following the Commission's 1992  review of telecommunications, the Council of the European Union  plumped for full liberalisation of telecoms services starting in  1998. For mobile policy, a key question arising was how to  interpret full liberalisation in a sector where limited  frequency availability leads to restricted entry. Of a more  strategic nature, it became of interest to consider what new  factors would come into play as a consequence of dissolving the  regulatory boundary between fixed and mobile service areas.  <H8>  Development of Personal Communications </H8>   The second aim comes from within the sector itself, and  gives  the Green paper its strategic focus. This is to push the  development in Europe of a mass market for personal  communications services (linking this to a point with the  "Trans-European Networks" initiative introduced via the  Maastricht Treaty). In part, this is because the Commission  sees personal communications as an area in which Europe could  lead the world, building on the success of GSM.    The Green paper suggests that as many as 80 million  Europeans  could be users of mobile personal communications by 2010, with  ultimate potential to reach 80 per cent of the total population  (i.e., one connection per adult -- easily exceeding the  penetration level for fixed telephony). The most critical  factor for achieving mass market penetrations is seen to be the  price of handsets; it is predicted that take-up will accelerate  significantly once prices fall below 250 ECUs.    It is envisaged that personal communications will be based,  at least initially, on combinations of existing systems such as  GSM, DC51800 and DECT, together with intelligent functions  providing mobility services on the fixed network, and use of  satellite personal communications in thinly-populated areas.  The Green Paper further sees that "personal communications will  ultimately allow person-to-person calling independent of the  location and the terminal used, the means or transmission (wired  or wireless) and/or choice of technology." Flexibility in  service provision, including the possibility to combine services  offered via different networks and technologies in response to  market demand, is seen as particularly important to enable  movement in this direction.    Whilst noting Europe's generally strong positioning for  development of personal communications, the Green Paper also  highlights a number of barriers to market development,  including: -- maintenance of restrictions on entry and operation  which constrain market development and prevent equality of  opportunity for market participants; -- market fragmentation,  caused by different licensing arrangements in different  countries and through awarding licences along the lines of radio  system technologies (a consequence of frequency assignment  methods); -- lack of a common approach regarding service  provision, in particular by independent service providers, which  could provide flexibility to overcome problems of market  fragmentation; -- constraints on freedom to achieve economic  mobile network operation, particularly regarding dependence on  fixed network operators for interconnection and infrastructure;  -- lack of firm timetables for allocation of frequencies for key  personal communications technologies.  <H5>  Main Proposals </H5>   The Green Paper's major prescription for realising the goals  and overcoming the barriers set out above is, unsurprisingly, to  maximise commercial freedom and allow market forces to play a  full role. A broad interpretation of the Green Paper's  positions picks out the following as components of the  regulatory regime proposed for mobile services:  <H5>  Open Market </H5>   -- Abolition of exclusive and special rights for mobile  network operation, in essence requiring introduction of  competition and non-discretionary licensing. The Green Paper  states that the procedures and criteria for award of licences  should be fully objective and transparent, and that applicants  should be treated in an equal manner.    The Green Paper does not recommend a method of awarding  licences, but states that the method chosen should aim  particularly at maximising benefits for users e.g., in terms of  prices, quality, etc. It implies that licensing competitions  (beauty parades or auctions) should be resorted to only where  there is contention for available frequencies. It stops short  of suggesting that regulators should leave determination of  numbers of entrants to the market.    -- Unrestricted entry into service provision. The Green  Paper states that both independent service providers and mobile  network operators should be allowed entry. It further states  that mobile network operators should accept all reasonable  requests from service providers (including those integrated with  other mobile network operators) to deal, within the limits of  normal commercial practice and competition law. It considers  that service provision does not require licensing, however  service providers should follow a self-regulation code of  conduct.    -- Mutual recognition. The Green Paper extends the  principles of mutual recognition of national authorisations into  the mobile area, in order to reduce barriers to entry in  different countries. However, it points out that full mutual  recognition of mobile network operator licences is only possible  where there is no limitation on the number of operators. As  regards service providers, it states that their established  relationships with mobile operators should be fully recognised.    -- Frequency availability. The Green Paper stresses the need  to efficiently use frequency spectrum, to involve market  participants in frequency planning and to publish clear and  non-discriminatory frequency allocation procedures.  <H5>  Level Playing Field </H5>   -- Non-discriminatory licensing conditions. This includes  abolition of special rights granting any player a lasting  advantage.    -- Safeguards in licensing to ensure equal treatment. The  Green paper makes specific reference to the interface between  mobile network operators and service providers. It considers  that the licenses of mobile network operators should require  sufficient transparency, in particular concerning accounting, to  allow supervision of service provision activities which are  integrated into their operations.  <H5>  Freedom of Operation </H5>   -- Minimum necessary regulation. The Green paper considers  that regulation should be limited to what is justified in the  general interest. It states that mobile licensing conditions  may set purblicservice requirements concerning permanence,  availability and quality of service, and should restrict  activities only on the grounds of "essential requirements" such  as the integrity of public networks.    -- Free combination of service offerings. The Green paper  sees as essential for development of personal communications the  freedom for service providers to offer a combination of mobile  services provided under different licences (in the same or  different countries) and using different technologies. Come  1998, this freedom should be extended across both fixed and  mobile areas.    -- The Green Paper indicates that mobile network operations  would as a normal rule be allowed to expand their mobile  operations through bids for multiple licences. From 1998,  mobile operators could bid for licences for provision of public  voice via the fixed network, and fixed network operators could  bid for mobile licences.    -- Open interconnection. The Green Paper indicates that the  principles of interconnection defined under ONP for access to  the fixed network should be employed in the mobile area. Mobile  operators should respond to reasonable requests for  interconnection, with agreement reached primarily through  commercial negotiation. They should be allowed to directly  interconnect, both within and between Member States.    -- Infrastructure. The Green Paper considers that mobile  network operators should have rights to establish their own  infrastructure or use that provided by a third party, subject to  use for their licensed activities. They should also be able to  share infrastructure and sites.    The implementation of these proposed positions is seen to  involve some extension of EC directives, but mainly requires  action to be taken by administrations and regulators at the  national level.    EC mobile policy did not start with the Green paper (but  could only get so far without it). Since 1987, actions have  been taken in a number of key areas:    -- Support for introduction of GSM, ERMES and DECT. In 1987,  the EU Council of Ministers adopted a recommendation and  accompanying directive promoting the coordinated introduction of  GSM. The recommendation set targets for rollout and  availability; the directive required Member States to make  available the necessary frequencies. Subsequently, a similar  dual measure approach was taken in 1990 for ERMES (digital radio  paging) and in 1991 for DECT (digital cordless).    -- Frequency coordination framework. In 1990, the Council  adopted a resolution calling for CEPT wide cooperation on radio  frequencies focused on the CEPT European Radiocommunications  Committee (ERC). The ERC adopted a mechanism in 1991 for  implementation of 'ERC Decisions' which the EC Council  subsequently said should be used in preference to EC frequency  directives. The arrangements for cooperation between the  Commission and the CEPT bodies concerned under this approach are  being worked out. A similar framework is being developed for  numbering.    -- Introduction of competition. The Commission's competition  directorate, DGIV, has acted to encourage a small number of  Member States to license a second GSM operator.    -- Mobile terminals. The first common technical regulations  (OTRs) were adopted in 1993 as the basis for mutual recognition  of type approval of GSM terminals according to the 1991  directive covering this subject.    -- Research and development. The RACE mobile project  (Research Into Advanced Communications in Europe) is carrying  out research into a 3rd- generation UMTS system (Universal  Mobile Telecommunications System).  <H5>  Actions to Promote Development </H5>   A number of further actions at the European level are  proposed to promote development of Europe-wide mobile and  personal communications. These include:    -- Completion of CEPT-wide frameworks for frequency and  numbering coordination.    -- Promoting Europe-wide introduction of key personal  communications systems, such as DCS1800, UMTS and LEOs, via the  setting of firm frequency allocation schedules and, for future  systems, coordinated/Community-level licensing.    -- Introducing a European numbering space for Europe-wide  personal numbers.    -- Establishing a code of conduct for service providers.    -- Setting up an action programme to address concerns about  health hazards and interference from radiocommunications devices  and establish safety standards.    -- Promoting standarisation to ensure interconnection and  interoperability, including access to intelligent network  functionality.    -- Working out common positions with regard to non- EEA  countries concerning porvision of mobile and personal  communications.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   The mobile Green Paper shows that there is a lot more to  mobile policy than simply licensing two operators in each area.  It points, for example, to the structure of the sector itself  and indicates a general requirement for greater flexibility.    The timing of the Green paper is just about right,  coinciding  with initial steps towards development of personal  communications. This allows it to contribute some significant  ideas concerning the future direction of European  telecommunications, such as the emergence of the  wholesale/retail concept -- with service providers operating  across the boundaries of network provision -- as a major  structure for the future supply of telecommunications services  in Europe.    Its timing also allows it to take advantage of the recent  policy success of the 1992 telecoms review, for example  initiating the adaptation of ONP towards becoming a set of  general regulatory principles applicable throughout the sector.    Overall, better late.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Shipunova: "Accord Is Not a Mushroom, </F> You Will Not Find It in the Forest"]    [Text] A friend of mine often quotes the following saying:  "It is too late to drink Borzhom water, doctor, when your  kidneys have fallen off." For some reason, I always think of it  when I hear the newly fashionable appeal for "civic accord."    In itself, the idea is, of course, a good one. It is the  right idea. It should have been presented earlier--in about 1990  or at least in 1991, or at the very least somewhere in mid-1993.  Had this idea been brought to life then, it would have saved  many human lives and fates. Perhaps it would have saved entire  peoples and our once great state. But what now? Now the  memorandum proposed by the president will perhaps only save the  president himself. First of all, from early re-elections,  secondly--from the responsibility for two state overthrows, and  thirdly--from corrections to the new constitution (and primarily  from the correction regarding those same re-elections). All else  is more than problematic. And here is why.    The agreement is entitled, "On Achieving Civic Accord in  Russia." Wonderful. No one opposes this. But how do you intend  to realistically achieve it (and not just on paper)? Judging by  the title, we are speaking not only about an agreement between  the political elite, but about accord in society itself. Yet  what is our society like today? It has been torn to bits, to  pieces, which have grown farther and farther apart from each  other. Who or what can force the poor and the rich, the  criminals and their victims, the all-powerful bureaucracy and  the citizens without rights to agree amongst themselves? What  document can reconcile warring ethnic groups, rival mafia clans,  and polarized social currents? First of all, the present-day  contradictions in society, the opposition of its various strata  and groups, the open enmity and hatred, have already gone too  far. Secondly, they are objectively defined by the condition of  life itself in Russia--and primarily by the economy.    No decree, memorandum or agreement can remove these  objective  contradictions or eliminate the very source of disagreement in  society. And this source, no matter how you look at it, is the  policy of reform. There will be no accord until reforms begin to  yield a positive result. That means that in order to achieve  true accord in society, what we need is not to compose  memoranda, but to work toward this positive result. However, the  people do not see such work. Up until the present, we have not  been able to positively resolve a single acute and painful  question: Neither the question of prices, nor of inflation, nor  of non-payments--all those questions which reforms have given  rise to and which millions of people suffer from. Without the  resolution of these and many other vitally important questions,  there is no use in waiting for accord and peacemaking at the  lower levels. And without this, what is the value of accord  reached at the top?    Let us assume the miners' trade unions sign a "social  obligation" not to strike, while the miners, if their situation  does not improve (and it will not improve, since there are as  yet no prerequisites for this) will go on strike and will demand  a change of the government and resignation of the president. And  they would spit on any memoranda. The same is true also of the  parties, as for example the Agrarian Party. What will its  signature under an agreement be worth if the deception of the  peasantry, which in our country has become a state policy,  continues?    The tension in society is growing. Even the students (the  harbingers of all Russian revolutions) have taken to the  streets. One sector replaces another in the picket lines around  the White House, and the news releases are full of announcements  of the stoppage, one after the other, of the country's former  industrial giants. Unemployment is at the door of millions of  Russians. And what have the recent elections to the local organs  of power demonstrated? They have demonstrated a mass distrust of  the ruling political forces, the total alienation of the people  from power (even the authors of the Agreement on Accord were  forced to acknowledge this fact). And what is the crime  situation in Moscow today, and throughout all of Russia? Every  day there is a terrorist act. The level of banditism is almost  the same as it was during the civil war, and there are probably  as many firearms in the hands of the population as there were  during wartime. Yet they tell us about "civic accord," as if we  have just fallen from the Moon.    At first, the authorities did everything to see that society  became splintered and destratified, that it fell apart into  irreconcilable component parts. But now they want to bring  everyone to accord with some document (even it if be three times  as good and re-worked 100 times). Is this not naive? We get  something like the introduction of communism by decree. As of 28  April, civic accord is being proclaimed. But where is the  material base for it? They have not built it yet. Another little  anecdote comes to mind here: "Zhora, fry the fish." "But there  is no fish!" "You just fry, and there will be fish."    The prospects of achieving accord at the top--between  various  political forces--are almost as unrealistic. This is  specifically because of their differences, which bear a  principle character. In fact, the draft agreement asks them to  sign under a moratorium on waging political struggles, and  primarily the struggle for power, which is basic to the activity  of any party, even "Russia's Choice." It is for this, generally,  that the entire business was cooked up. And from this standpoint  the president's initiative is nothing other than a change of  tactics. Up until now, the main political weapon of the  presidential side has been disagreement (practically with  everyone), confrontation and violence. However, these tactics  have not brought success. The people have become angry, but have  not been frightened and continue to offer resistance. The  opposition has not scattered, but has become strengthened and  has even legalized its activity. The president's authority and  respect for the president (or even fear of him) have not  increased. Rather, it has been the opposite. His rating in  Russia and abroad has notably declined.    The policy of confrontation has become bankrupted. Now they  want to try the policy of accord. On paper everything is pretty.  Yet how does all this correlate with the actual reality? The  very subject of political differences has not been coordinated  or regulated:    What path should Russia follow?    What kind of society should we build?    Toward what ideal should we strive?    By what means and methods should we move toward our  goal?    Yet they want to agree simply not to touch this subject, to  avoid it. In other words, the problems over which all the  discord has taken place in our society will not disappear, but  it is as if everyone will agree to keep quiet about them. In  that case, the Agreement on Accord is no more than an effort to  hide our shame with the palm of our hand. I doubt that the  parties and movements which have already gained sufficient  influence will so easily and simply reject their political  convictions.    There is one other side to the matter, which casts doubt  upon  the possibility of general agreement. Recent events in the State  Duma and the Federation Council (amnesty, dismissal of the  procurator general) have shown that even with the new parliament  the president has a fleeting, unsteady accord, and that this  organ--the closest in state hierarchy--certainly has not become  his unconditional ally. And all because one thing is written in  the agreement, while something else is done in real life. The  tradition of violating the constitution and the laws, of  exerting pressure on the legislative and law enforcement organs,  is retained. The episode with Kazannik was a regular  continuation of the episodes with Rutskoy, Stepankov, Zorkin,  and Barannikov. Is it not strange that the leaders of the main  law enforcement agencies in the country suddenly, one after  another, find themselves in contradiction and open conflict with  the head of state? Is this fact alone not proof that law is  being scorned in the state, and not by just anyone, but by the  supreme authorities. In everyday life they say the following  about such situations: "It cannot be that everyone is bad and he  alone is good."    With the attitude toward law and toward the laws and moral  standards which still prevails in the Russian upper echelons,  not to mention the lower levels, we need hardly speak of any  accord. If only this accord is not with lawlessness, such an  accord when some transgress the law while all others agree to  pretend that nothing terrible is happening.    If only the agreement were preceded by the honest and noble  confession: Yes, citizen Russians, there has been a sin. I did  violate the constitution and the laws, I employed violence, I  repent and promise never to do so again! Let us start all over,  like human beings..."    Yet nothing of the sort is being said. They are calling upon  someone--we do not know who--not to behave disgracefully any  more. The list of potential signers, however, is not specified.  If these are only the state agencies--the president, the  government, and parliament--according to the constitution they  are obligated to do all that is written in the draft, including  to work for accord in society.    Will the opposition sign all this--that is the question.  Some  of those in the president's encirclement propose that its  extreme flanks be excluded from the number of participants. But  then the entire idea loses its meaning. You can cross them out  on paper, but it is not in your will to exclude them from the  political life of Russia. Then about what accord--of whom with  whom--are we speaking? Of Yeltsin with Gaydar? They will come to  an agreement without a memorandum. But is it possible for them  to come to agreement with Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and  Rutskoy--the real figures on the political scene of Russia? And  without the mutual accord of specifically the polar, extreme  forces, once again, what would be the value of such an agreement?    Nevertheless, even understanding all this, realizing the  unreality and utopian nature of another political manifesto, we  would like to believe and hope. To believe that there will not  be a civil war, and to hope for civic accord, and mainly--for  the reason and conscience of the politicians. If, thanks to this  "Agreement on Accord," they do not shoot down parliament once  again, even that is good. Although, of course, it is shameful  that the constitution and the laws are not enough for the  politicians in our country. They must also give a signed  statement promising not to throw pitchforks at one another.</p>

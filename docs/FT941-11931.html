			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Consortia bid for Peru telecoms Five internationally-led consortia have expressed interest in the privatisation of Peru's telecommunications industry, the country's biggest sell-off so far. This month's sale will end 25 years of state control of the industry. The possible bidders are: Southwestern Bell of the US with Korea Telecom and Daewoo of South Korea, Mexico's Condumex-Carso Group and Peru's Banco de Credito; GTE of the US with Portugal's Radio Marconi and Empresa Brasileira de Telecomunicacoes of Brazil; France Telecom and Stet of Italy, which both pre-qualified separately earlier but have now joined forces; AT&amp;T of the US and a local partner; Telefonica de Espana, also with Peruvian participation. The eventual purchaser will acquire the state's controlling share in Lima's telephone company, CPT, and 35 per cent of Entel, a state-owned monopoly operating national long-distance and international services. It is expected that the remaining Entel shares will be sold off later, possibly through the stock exchange. The level of international interest reflects the industry's growth potential. Peru has the worst telephone provision in Latin America, with only 2.6 lines per 100 inhabitants. Purchase of the system - which comes with a five-year monopoly - will contractually involve the new owner in installing 638,000 new lines in the capital and 559,000 in the rest of the country before the end of the century. Additional conditions require every Peruvian town with more than 500 inhabitants to be provided with telephone communication, and waiting time for connection to be slashed from the present five years to three days by the year 2000. Investment of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 670m-Pounds 1bn) is expected. The five potential bidders will make financial offers on February 28.</p>

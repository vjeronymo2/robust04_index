			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister Secretary General of the Presidency Genaro  Arriagada has said that even though corruption is not prevalent  in Chile, "it is the right time to take action if we want our  institutions and political practices to meet the ethical  requirements of public service."    At the opening session for the academic year of the School  of  Political and Managerial Science in the Academy of Christian  Humanism, Arriagada lectured on "Public Probity and Ethics,"  noting that the country has a deficit in the development of its  public ethics. "We do not have a sick, but rather a developing  country, with good intentions but without experience in matters  like this, vital and dynamic, but fragile," he said. He added  that "we are not clearly aware of the limits of power, the rules  and criteria that must be observed by politicians, public  servants, and citizens in case of conflict of interest. We have  a legalistic mentality coupled with the idea that violating the  law is not something serious." He said that many of the cases  that the press has reported as being instances of corruption "do  not originate with a deliberate desire to acquire wealth, but  with the ignorance of elected authorities -- especially those in  municipal governments -- who believe they can manage power as  liberally, and as free from any rules as they run their small  private businesses."    He said that the border between power and money is hazy, "to  the extent that leading entrepreneurs usually boast of the  political power they have acquired by financing political  campaigns, while there is a dangerous lack of definition of  incompatibility."    He added that in light of this situation, the government has  created a high-level commission to focus on the problem from the  viewpoint of a state policy, beyond partisan confrontation and  beyond the disputes between the government and the opposition.    He said that public servants, because of their being in  government, have stricter obligations in their public and  private lives, despite the fact that the country demands high  levels of morality in all areas of activity.    He added that corruption originates not only in the  weaknesses of human nature, but also in the faults of the  political, institutional, and administrative systems.    Referring to the state's relationship with the economy,  Arriagada said the greatest risks of corruption are hatched in  this relationship, as there are private agents seeking  illegitimate influence in their favor, and also state agents --  in what is considered true corruption -- who sometimes also  receive private benefits.    Arriagada said that in order to fight this potential threat,  it is necessary to combat obscurity in the decisionmaking  procedures, and where there is ample room for public servants to  exercise discretional power. He added that the third source of  corruption is the monopoly public officials have in allocating  funds.    Arriagada also referred to the relationship between money  and  politics, stating that this is a problem that is common to  political parties, movements, and any political system, and  which if not controlled and clarified greatly harms respect for  politics as well as the legitimacy of the resources.    He said that in order to solve this problem, laws must be  created to reduce the costs of political campaigns, and in  addition establishing forms of public, state, or private  financing. "Any form of financial aid, whether it come from  private enterprise, international political organizations, the  abusive use of state resources, or any other imaginable  resource, must be carefully controlled."    Arriagada ended by stating that democracy requires clear,  powerful efforts and results in this regard. "In many countries  of the world, upholding the superiority of democracy as a form  of government is not, in the eyes of the public, currently based  on the capacity of democrats to establish an open style of  political and governmental action, with the sole purpose of  serving the people they represent."</p>

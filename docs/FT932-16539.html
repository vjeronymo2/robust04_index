			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Treasury economic model may be run by US group A KEY element of preparing the UK government's much-criticised economic forecasts could be contracted out to a US company und-er proposals put to the Treasury. Massachusetts-based DRI is the world's biggest economic consultancy and its clients include General Motors, IBM, Exxon and British Petroleum. It says running the Treasury's computerised model of the UK economy is 'not impossible' and would add to its prestige. If DRI and the Treasury agree a deal, the secretive process would receive the biggest shake-up since economic forecasts started in the 1940s. DRI, owned by the McGraw-Hill media and financial services company and with annual worldwide revenues of about Dollars 60m (Pounds 42m), would scrap the Treasury's existing model, run by an in-house team of about 30 economists. DRI would replace it with one maintained by its own economists and software experts. The Treasury model is a computer containing more than 100 mathematical equations. It links factors such as unemployment and taxation and is used to forecast likely output growth and inflation. The Treasury would neither confirm nor deny whether talks with DRI are taking place, on the grounds that it did not want to influence any possible negotiations with other companies. It is examining the possible contracting-out of its computerised model as part of a Whitehall-wide scheme to encourage more private-sector involvement in government activities. The cost of Treasury forecasts is an estimated Pounds 750,000 a year. Two are published each year, while more are worked on internally. DRI, with 450 staff - 80 per cent of them in the US - would base any work for the Treasury partly on its expertise in modelling parts of the North American economy on behalf of about 30 US states, including New York and California. Under DRI's plans, Treasury ministers and officials would continue to be responsible for published UK forecasts. The basis for how these are worked out would be left to a non-government agency, one step removed from political constraints. In recent years, Treasury forecasts have been criticised for under-estimating both the extent of the late 1980s boom and the recession. Even though these shortcomings have been shared by many private-sector forecasters, some politicians and industrialists believe the Treasury projections have been 'massaged' to provide a favourable view of economic conditions. Mr Jean-Michel Six, the DRI executive in charge of operations in Europe and Asia, said talks were at an early stage and still had to cover such areas as fees and how new ideas DRI might like to introduce would fit in with Treasury requirements.

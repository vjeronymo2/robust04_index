			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Todres commentary: "Federation Treaty Outlives </F> Its Usefulness"]    [Excerpts] Both Moscow and Kazan are satisfied with the  signing of the treaty between the Russian Federation and  Tatarstan. The Tatar leaders rejoice that they have finally,  after a three-year tug-of-war, wrenched from Moscow recognition  of their independence. Boris Yeltsin is pleased that he had been  able to remove from the document a clearly separatist spirit  expunging the former autonomous entity's sovereignty slogans.  The authorities of the other republics, components of Russia,  are hoping to use the path beaten by Tatarstan. But yesterday  seems to have become critical for the future of the Federation  Treaty, upon which, some people some time ago were going to  build "a new, stable Russian statehood." [passage omitted]    The Tatar leaders sacrificed political rhetoric for getting  all the benefits in the economic sphere. It is these agreements  (especially the budget agreement), rather than the treaty  itself, that were the hardest to secure. The day before, the  republic's premier admitted that "Boris Fedorov's departure made  the entire process substantially easier."    The historic Tuesday is nevertheless fraught precisely with  political complications. Its smaller consequence consists in  the fact that the concluded treaty is not going to add  predictability in relationships between Moscow and Kazan: Even  if Tatarstan contravenes the constitution of the former  autonomous entity, nobody there for this reason will alter their  own Fundamental Law, by Mr. Sabirov's admission. This signifies  that also still remaining is the legal basis for fresh claims  (should they arise) to the federal authority. Thus, when Boris  Yeltsin states that the treaty is going to be a model "of  removing differences between the federal and republican  constitutions," he, to put it mildly, overestimates the  achievement.    Here is the greater consequence: Russia has a further 87  regions, not counting Chechnya. The new federal constitution  has proclaimed them all equal. The question "If the Tatars can  do it, why can't we?" is quite natural. Why should the other  regional leaders swallow this treaty in silence? By the way,  their kurultay -- the Federation Council -- already wants to  consider the Russo- Tatar treaty at its session, for precisely  these reasons, it seems. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Realism steers PM's first agenda - Reduced majority forces caution; Balance of controversial and populist measures WHEN Mr Neil Kinnock began the unfinished task of returning the Labour party to the centre ground of British politics, somebody coined the phrase 'the new realism'. As Mr John Major set out yesterday the first legislative programme that he can call his own, it was from the comfortable position of a leader who has defied overwhelming odds to win a fourth term of office for the Conservatives. Yet as the prime minister's colleagues emerged from the pomp and ceremony of the state opening of parliament, the most frequent comment was that his programme's strength lay as much in its realism as its radicalism. Mr Major has not abandoned reform in favour of consolidation - but he has called a halt to the permanent revolution that proved the downfall of his predecessor. The programme for the next 18 months is radical in intent but realistic in its ambitions. It is intended to reinforce his reputation for achieving objectives by consensus rather than confrontation. It recognises that there is a world outside Westminster, that legislation is not the sole instrument of change. That does not mean it will be free of controversy. The short bill due within a few days to implement the treaties concluded at the Maastricht summit will provoke great public soul-searching on the right of the Conservative party. With his majority reduced to 21, Mr Major cannot afford more than a handful of rebels. Mr Major's promise to make the London government more responsive to Scotland's aspirations may do little to cap the rising tide of support north of the border for a new constitutional settlement. Legislation to privatise British Coal and parts of British Rail may not be free from political risk. The first will force a belated acknowledgement from the government that many more pits will be forced to close. The second will throw up more hidden horrors - and demands for public money - than ministers are ready to accept. The education bill planned for the autumn - designed to accelerate rapidly a move towards grant-maintained status for most of the nation's schools - will oblige the government to decide who or what will replace local authorities in making strategic decisions about educational provision. Some parents will welcome the return of selective education. Many more will not. Mr Major has been careful to balance the difficult with the more instantly populist. The National Lotteries Bill and legislation establishing the urban regeneration agency and extending further rights  - including rents into mortgages - to council tenants promise some good headlines. Even without its present debilitating troubles over the party leadership, Labour would find it hard to stir public anger against the bill promising a further erosion of the power of trade unions. The pace will be more sedate. Ministers are desperately anxious to counter the impression that parliament could be twiddling its thumbs for much of the 18 months. They admit, though, that the programme has been designed to mesh with the proposed reform of MPs' working hours and with the political reality of a reduced majority. The prime minister's public avowal yesterday of the existence of the Secret Intelligence Service was designed to signal another break with the past by promising a more open, relaxed, style of government. But there was a more substantial shift. Much of the legislation has been framed around Mr Major's belief in individual choice, ownership and responsibility, but a single sentence emphasises the core of his own prospectus. The government, it says, will 'give priority to improving public services through the Citizen's Charter which will be at the centre of decision-making'. Translated, that means that the welfare state is to be preserved but its monolithic structure dismantled in favour of a more diverse pattern of locally managed services. Mr Major's ambition is to create a new consensus on the management of the public sector to outflank Labour in the 1990s, in much the same way as his party's approach to the economy left the Opposition stranded during the 1980s. It may prove a powerful brand of realism.</p>

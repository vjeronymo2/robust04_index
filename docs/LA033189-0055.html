			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> SHORE ANGLERS GETTING MORE DISTANCE AND BIGGER CATCHES WITH FLOAT TUBES  </P> <P> Shore fishermen have always been limited by the distance a line can be cast  into the surf.  </P> <P> Anglers who head out beyond shore use float tubes with success, and two South  Bay tubers have set some records.  </P> <P> Pete Wight, 29, of Torrance attaches his float tube and arms himself with a  light rod, small reel and bag of bait.  </P> <P> For six years Wight has ventured 100 yards or more beyond the waves to fish for  halibut during the fall and winter.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, fishing off Torrance Beach using a jack smelt for bait, he hooked  a halibut that pulled him a quarter-mile out to sea. Using his swim fins as a  rudder, he paddled backward over the waves and slowly brought his catch onto  the beach.  </P> <P> The flattie weighed in on the Marina del Rey scales at 32 1/2 pounds.  </P> <P> Wight holds two International Game Fish Assn. records. In 1986 he caught an  eight-pound, 14-ounce halibut using two-pound test line.  </P> <P> His strategy continued at Torrance Beach last year. Using four-pound test line  he set another IGFA record with a 13-pound, 10-ounce halibut.  </P> <P> Does the chance of hooking a great white shark while tube fishing concern him?  He replied, "If I identified it as a white shark, the line would be cut and I  would scurry back to shore."  </P> <P> Mark Larson, 25, of San Pedro fishes from his float tube at Cabrillo Beach. He  uses six-pound test line but prefers to use feathers and jigs instead of bait.  </P> <P> Larson heads out from the Cabrillo rocks area as much as a mile when the ocean  is calm.  </P> <P> Using a red and white feather jig, he recently caught a 20-pound, 4-ounce  halibut.  </P> <P> He said he prefers the Cabrillo area because he hooks big bat rays there that  he can challenge and move to shore.  </P> <P> Wight and Larson agree it takes practice to become a good float tube angler,  since it requires a certain amount of caution.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Halibut Derby is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, with 2,200  anglers competing for about $25,000 in cash and prizes.  </P> <P> Any angler catching the tagged fish "Big Bertha" will win $5,000.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Myron Wong of San Pedro, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Topgun, was  reeling up from the bottom to change baits and hooked a white sea bass. It  awarded him the whopper of the week at 24 1/2 pounds.  </P> <P> Homer Johnson of Long Beach, aboard the Southern Cal at Catalina Island, hit  the jackpot with a 24-pound ling cod.  </P> <P> Charles Harwood of Wilmington, fishing at the oil rigs aboard the Hitless Miss,  caught a 22 1/4-pound ling cod.  </P> <P> Herb Mueller of Redondo Beach, on the Redondo Special at Twin Roads, landed a  15-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Fish Reports:  </P> <P> Fishing slowed over the weekend as storm conditions shut down most of the  surface- and bottom-fish action.  </P> <P> The weather cleared up Monday and anglers nailed halibut, sculpin and rockfish.  </P> <P> With squid absent, big anchovies have proved to be the hot bait.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught  15 sand bass, seven halibut and six sculpin.  </P> <P> The Happyman on a half-day trip to the Rockpile returned with 23 sand bass, 14  halibut and five calico bass.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Redondo Special fished Twin Roads on a morning  trip, and anglers chalked up 22 halibut and 10 rockfish.  </P> <P> The Sea Spray worked Santa Monica Bay, and 28 sand bass, 21 halibut, 20  rockfish, one bonito and one barracuda went into anglers' sacks.  </P> <P> The barge Isle of Redondo found the mackerel invading -- 350 were hooked, plus  210 rockfish and one salmon released.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo fished Horseshoe Kelp on a half-day  trip and garnered 50 bonito, 15 rockfish and nine sculpin.  </P> <P> At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Topgun fished Catalina Island and found the  bonito, with 140 sacked, plus 20 rockfish and one white sea bass.  </P> <P> The Outerlimits tried San Clemente Island and chalked up 100 rock cod, 69  sculpin, 30 whitefish and six calico bass.  </P> <P> The Matt Walsh on a half-day trip to White's Point returned with 30 sculpin, 14  rockfish, three red snapper and one sole.  </P> <P> At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Southern Cal fished the west end of Catalina in  shallow water and found the rockfish eager to grab the bait; 424 went into the  sacks, plus seven ling cod.  </P> <P> Freshwater Notes: Gary Halderman of Lomita, fishing Irvine Lake, caught nine  bass totaling 15 1/2 pounds and released them.  </P> <P> Nicholas Litall of Long Beach used mini jigs and landed a six-pound trout at  Anaheim Lake.  </P></p>

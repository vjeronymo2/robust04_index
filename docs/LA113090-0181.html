			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NCAA ASKED TO RESCIND OSU PENALTY  </P> <P> Oregon State basketball Coach Jim Anderson wants the NCAA to rescind a penalty  levied against the Beavers, citing the NCAA compromise reached with UNLV.  </P> <P> The NCAA found in 1982 that some Oregon State players violated rules at a  regional tournament in Provo, Utah, by exchanging game tickets for merchandise.  </P> <P> Oregon State was forced to return the money it made from the tournament,  believed to be in excess of $300,000.  </P> <P> "I thought from our case, from several years ago, they (NCAA) were pretty  severe, but we really didn't have any ground to stand on," Anderson said.  "Maybe now a lot of schools should go back and ask for the same courtesy  extended to Vegas."  </P> <P> Anderson said he was shocked by the compromise that allows the UNLV Runnin'  Rebels to defend their national title.  </P> <P> "You feel there's been pressure applied and that from the pressure, they've  (NCAA) buckled under," Anderson said.  </P></p>

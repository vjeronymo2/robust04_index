			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTROVERSIAL CONTRACT FOR EX-RTD DIRECTOR  CANCELED  </P> <P> The controversial $99,500 consulting contract that had been used to hire former  Rapid Transit District board member Jan Hall as a district lobbyist was  canceled Thursday by the board.  </P> <P> The 10-1 vote terminated the contract negotiated in January by RTD Executive  Director Alan F. Pegg with CBC, a South Bay consulting firm.  </P> <P> The firm had hired Hall immediately after the contract was signed. She left the  board to take the lobbyist's job.  </P> <P> Pegg's unusual move, which RTD lawyers said was legal, sidestepped the  district's revolving-door policy preventing directors from going to work for  the district for a year after their term expires or they resign. The contract  drew a storm of protest when news of it became public.  </P> <P> After canceling the contract, the board adopted a more specific policy  prohibiting hiring an ex-director directly or through a second-party contract.  </P></p>

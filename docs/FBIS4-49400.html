			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Singapore said today  that it would be regrettable if the execution of caning on  American teenage vandal Michael Fay were allowed to affect  Singapore-U.S. relations.    "It world be regrettable if the actions of one individual,  Michael Fay, who had transgressed Singapore law and been  punished according to the law, were allowed to affect bilateral  relations," a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said.    Singapore had to enforce its laws impartially, whether  Singaporeans, Americans or other foreigners were involved, he  stressed.    The spokesman made the comments when responding to the  statement by Christine Shelly, acting spokesperson for the U.S.  State Department on Thursday [5 May].    In her statement, Christine Shelly said that Assistant  Secretary of State Winston Lord met with Singapore Ambassador to  the United States S.R. Nathan on Thursday and informed the  ambassador that President Bill Clinton "was very disappointed"  by Singapore's decision to "deny clemency to Michael Fay".    Fay, 18, was caned at the Queenstown Remand Prison in  Singapore on Thursday for vandalism. He was originally  sentenced to six strokes of caning in early March. But the  Singapore Government announced on Wednesday that the country  decided exceptionally to reduce the punishment from six to four  strokes of the cane to accommodate Clinton's concern over the  case.    Clinton had written to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong,  asking for commuting Fay's sentence of the cane and expressed  his concerns over the case three times in the public.    In his meeting with Ambassador Nathan, which was described  as  "frank and candid", Lord also warned that this incident of Fay  "will have to be taken into account in the overall relationship  between the U.S. and Singapore," Shelly said.    The spokesman of Singapore Foreign Ministry said however  that  he believed that U.S.-Singapore ties "were robust enough to  weather any difficulties caused by Michael Fay's caning."    "The U.S. and Singapore have always enjoyed a strong  relationship, based on many common interests and shared  strategic objectives," he said.    He said he hoped that "both sides would focus on their  larger  mutual interests and put this incident behind them".</p>

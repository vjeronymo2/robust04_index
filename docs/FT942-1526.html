			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Swiss bank three points in thriller against Romania In one of the most open and entertaining games of the tournament so far, Switzerland romped to their first World Cup finals victory for 40 years by beating the fancied Romanians 4-1 to put themselves in a strong position to progress to the second phase. Four points from two matches and a 5-2 aggregate goal edge should be enough against all but a complete collapse against Colombia next Sunday. After Switzerland's Alain Sutter - who is heading for Bayern Munich after the tournament - had a goal disallowed for offside, the Swiss turned up the heat and there was no doubt about his sensational strike five minutes later which give his side the lead. Romania's influential playmaker Georghe Hagi has a tendency to blow hot and cold, and last night he was distinctly chilly until the 36th minute, when he curled a spectacular long-range equalizer past Marco Pascolo. The Swiss came out after the break with more than their supporters' cowbells ringing. Stephan Chapuisat got the lead back after 52 minutes following a goal mouth scramble with more than a suspicion of a Swiss handball. There was just a hint of offside in Adrian Knup's 65 minute third goal, but nothing could take away from the beauty of Sforza's powerful run and pass to set it up. Knup got another seven minutes later, deflecting a right-wing cross from close range. There was further misery for Romania when substitute Ion Vladoiu, who had been on the pitch for just four minutes, was sent off for a wild tackle on Chapuisat. The result leaves Romania needing at least a draw against the USA next Sunday to clinch their place in the next round.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Coal fumes over bill of health for gas: The Littlechild report's likely impact on the government's strategy for energy PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild touched a sensitive spot in the energy debate yesterday, judging by the noisy reaction to his report on the 'dash for gas'. Stripped of its technical language, the 50-page report dismisses one of the central arguments put forward by supporters of the coal industry - that gas has been unfairly squeezing coal out of the electricity generation market. His analysis will make it much harder for the government to justify curbing the growth of gas as it seeks ways of averting further pit closures. To compile his report, Prof Littlechild examined dozens of contracts for the sale of electricity produced from a variety of fuels - coal, gas and nuclear. His conclusion is clear. The contracts that regional electricity companies have signed with power generators for gas-based electricity are not uneconomic. Prof Littlechild says they should be welcomed as they add diversity to fuel supplies, and bring environmental benefits. He goes further, and maintains that gas-based electricity is the cheapest on the market and distribution companies are right to sign up for it. While admitting that comparing prices is difficult, he places electricity from coal at 3.2p per kilowatt hour, nuclear power at 3p, and gas in the range of 2.7p to 3p. Altogether, it is a much clearer and stronger conclusion than anyone expected. That accounts for the furious reaction from the coal lobby. The main objection from the power generators was that Prof Littlechild had used wrong assumptions about the extent to which generation capacity is used. His prices were based on average use of 53 per cent, while many power stations operate up to 90 per cent of the time. The longer they run, the cheaper their costs. 'He's comparing chalk and cheese,' National Power said. There are, however, nuances to the report that coal may find more encouraging. One of Prof Littlechild's findings is that there is still a large hole in the energy market in the mid 1990s that could be filled, at least in part by coal. He added up all the long-term supply contracts and matched them against the electricity companies' forecast needs. That showed that in 1995 as much as 35 per cent of the market will remain uncontracted for. The hole, by Offer's estimates, is the equivalent of 25m tons of coal. Although other fuel sources will fill part of it, it shows the market is far from closed. Gas occupies a smaller part of the market than generally believed - only one sixth. Prof Littlechild raised the possibility that while gas contracts may be the cheapest, they may not accurately reflect the true cost of generation. He has no evidence of this but intends to investigate further. That is worrying for the gas industry - many electricity distributors have equity interests in gas generation projects. The report has a sting in the tail. Prof Littlechild wonders whether power generators are overcharging for coal-based power in the new round of contracts they are negotiating with distributors. Although that is consistent with Prof Littlechild's concerns that the generators dominate the electricity market, it implies that coal-based power might be sold more cheaply, benefitting the coal industry. 'Can the price of coal be brought down? Is there scope for reduction in the generators' margins?' he asked yesterday, implying that the answer to both questions was yes. His questions sent tremors through distributors because they could be interpreted as implying that a company which signed up for the new coal contracts might be in breach of its licence obligation to buy electricity as economically as possible. That might further damage efforts to get long-term coal contracts in place. Prof Littlechild sought to soothe those fears by saying he would not stand in the way of short-term deals that enable the market to function. The question in the wake of the report is its impact on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, as he formulates a new policy for coal. Prof Littlechild's report reflects the views of an independent regulator. However, its task is not to address the political issues that might have a decisive influence in shaping policy, and the report could equally be brushed aside if Mr Heseltine decided that halting the dash for gas was the best way of preserving miners' jobs.

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) Lloyd's set to hire debt collectors to chase Names Correction (published 6th August 1994) appended to this article. Lloyd's of London is poised to hire commercial debt collectors as part of a tough new campaign to collect money from loss-making members of the insurance market. The move would represent a substantial stepping up of its efforts to close a shortfall of nearly Pounds 662m owed by thousands of Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said yesterday that Lloyd's did not have the resources internally to collect all its debts. He said the initiative was partly in response to complaints from Names' organisations that some members of the insurance market were unfairly concealing their assets to avoid making payments. At present Names either enter 'hardship', a Lloyd's alternative to bankruptcy, or are pursued for payment - ultimately through legal action. A committee of the ruling council of Lloyd's has been created under the chairmanship of Mr Bernard Bradford, who recently retired as head of corporate recovery. Mr Philip Holden, a partner with Dibb Lupton Broomhead, a law firm with two specialist debt collection offices, will be working with the committee to produce recommendations for the next council meeting on September 14. Mr Holden said last night: 'This is not a normal debt collection situation. I think there are things that can be done on a constructive basis that can make life better for everybody.' The aim is to develop ideas as well as quantifying the size of the problem, which may cover as many as 14,000 Names. Mr Robert Miller of the Association of Lloyd's Names, the biggest Names group, welcomed the initiative but Mr Michael Freeman, a partner with lawyers Epstein Grower Michael Freeman which is acting for many loss-making Names, has complained about the idea. He said it looked as if Lloyd's was trying to by-pass the legal system. Lloyd's plans reforms, Page 6 Observer, Page 13 CORRECTION The Association of Lloyd's Names welcomes efforts by the insurance market to ensure that all Names with outstanding debts are treated equally, but does not support the use of debt collectors, contrary to suggestions in yesterday's FT.</p>

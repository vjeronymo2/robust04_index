			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Aho's swift rise takes observers by surprise THE SWIFT rise to the limelight of Finnish politics by Centre party leader Esko Aho, 37, who formed a new government yesterday, has taken political observers by surprise. Few Finns had heard of Mr Aho before last summer, when he was elected to the helm of the Centre party leadership. A father of three who was raised on a farm in western Finland, Mr Aho has been active in politics since his youth. He was elected to parliament from his native village of Veteli at the age of 28, and has now become the country's youngest-ever prime minister. Views differ concerning the factors behind Mr Aho's success. Some believe that last month's election victory by the Centre at the expense of the ruling Social Democrats and conservative Coalition party was in part a vote against European integration. Others believe that the economic policies of the Blue/Red government, which was made up of the Social Democrats, Coalition and Swedish People's party, helped the Centre to become Finland's largest party after a 25-year reign by the Social Democrats. Mr Aho's friends say he is modest, discreet, pragmatic and intelligent. His adversaries, however, describe him as banal and without any clear political convictions. After the end of the war, Finland has maintained a special relationship with its giant neighbour, the USSR. Friendly relations between Helsinki and Moscow were mainly forged by one of the main architects of Finnish consensus, the late President Urho Kekkonen, who also belonged to the nationalistic Centre Party and ruled the country for almost a quarter of a century (1956-82). Even if the aim of consensus has been to set aside political differences for the sake of national unity, the critics of such a policy claim that it had subdued political debate within the country to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish today between the agenda of the Social Democratic and Coalition party. The Centre party has traditionally had a negative attitude towards foreign investment. This attitude is reinforced by a recent poll, which claims that only 36 per cent of all Centre party members are in favour of EC membership. An archetype of the Centre party politician, Mr Aho has toned down his opposition to Finland's integration with western Europe through European Economic Area (EEA). He has also stated publicly that he is against foreign ownership of the country's forest industry.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sharp gains at Commerzbank COMMERZBANK, Germany's third biggest bank, increased total operating profits by more than a quarter to DM651m (Dollars 407m) in the first three months of this year, the chief executive told shareholders yesterday. Speaking at the bank's annual meeting, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen explained that the bulk of the growth in profits came from the bank's own account trading activities in currencies and securities markets. Partial operating profits - calculated before own-account trading profits were taken into account - grew by just 2.6 per cent to DM468m. Mr Kohlhaussen attributed this to the moderate 2.3 per cent increase in interest earnings. In spite of the surge in total profits, the figures showed that the recession in Germany was beginning to catch up with the banking sector which enjoyed a record year in 1992. Total lending contracted by 1.9 per cent to DM163.4bn in the quarter. The first-quarter profit figures are struck before provisions for bad and doubtful debts which last year totalled DM2.09bn - almost as much as 1992's total operating profits which rose 20.7 per cent to DM2.2bn. The bank's exposure to Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer, has alone given rise to a DM300m provision. The bank announced yesterday that Mr Kurt Richolt, 55, head of the bank's Scandinavian operations and the board member responsible for this loan, was to be dismissed. This is unusual in Germany. Mr Kohlhaussen said that he was very satisfied with the bank's performance in the first quarter, giving him confidence about the rest of the year in spite of difficult economic conditions in Germany and abroad. He indicated that the bank may hold another rights issue to follow the DM500m issue earlier this year. He gave no hint about timing, saying the bank would return to the market 'whenever profitable growth prospects existed for the funds raised'. The bank is likely to raise more capital through the issue of profit-sharing certificates: shareholders yesterday authorised the board to issue up to DM1bn of the certificates.</p>

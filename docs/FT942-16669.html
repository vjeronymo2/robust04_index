			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium finds support - Market Report ALUMINIUM prices rose to session highs in after hours 'kerb' trading at the London Metal Exchange, erasing earlier losses and positioning themselves for a further rally, dealers said. Overnight investment fund selling left the market looking vulnerable at Dollars 1,290 a tonne for three months delivery. But 'there was good support at the lows,' said one trader, 'and this close (Dollars 1,300.50 a tonne, down Dollars 11.25) takes us back into the Dollars 1,300-Dollars 1,320 band again, with a good chance of taking out those highs.' COPPER also recovered from its morning lows, but the three months price still closed Dollars 17 down at Dollars 1,876 a tonne, the lowest for five weeks. LEAD prices rallied smartly from four-month lows, with the market's fundamentals not really justifying sharp declines, while selling below Dollars 450 lacked follow-through. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Congress has sent most government  secretariats a document that resembles a government plan. The  document includes recommendations, and it reviews issues that  range from exerting financial control over decentralized  institutions to eliminating the Finance Police.    The document, which bears the number 96-94/SCN, is dated 22  February, and a copy of it was provided to TIEMPO in Congress.  The document contains the text of a motion approved by the  legislative body regarding a total of 41 recommendations on  various issues. The document also conveys claims being made by  National Congress President Carlos Flores Facusse regarding a  government plan.    The official note was sent to the members of the economic  cabinet and the Government Secretariat to enable its  recommendations "to be considered in the Economic and  Administrative Action Plan that will be prepared by the  executive branch and be presented to the National Congress."    The recommendations include resuming the practice of  verifying all invoices in the Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula  offices; extending the practice to La Ceiba, Puerto Cortes,  Santa Rosa de Copan, Danli, and Choluteca; and gradually  establishing this practice in cities with a slower commercial  pace. The reestablishment of the fiscal lottery also has been  suggested.    Another proposal involves "placing more emphasis on  recovering pending debts to the state by clamping down on  defaulters by way of lawsuits; not handing over goods without  prior payment of import duties; and suspending vehicle permits  for Hondurans and alien residents who fail to pay import duties  and license fees, with the exception of tourists who can prove  their transient status."    Other recommendations include effectively preventing the  underpricing of imports and exports, establishing administrative  and criminal sanctions for offenders, and maintaining special  control over the smuggling of goods and the introduction of  tax-exempt vehicles, as well as the obvious underpricing of  shrimp exports to the United States. It is also recommended that  a modern computer system be created in combination with the  Honduran Central Bank to control the authorization and use of  foreign exchange and prices on exports and imports to guarantee  the correct settlement of customs papers. The installation of  electronic guages to keep a tangible record of the production of  fuels as well as the production of alcohol and spirits, and to  establish a computerized system to estimate the oil differential  [diferencial petrolero]. Another suggestion is to conduct  administrative audits of the current transactions involved in  exporting coffee to determine the extent of compliance and to  protect fiscal interests in accordance with current laws and  regulations.    Although Liberal Party deputies are killing themselves to  find supporters in customs, in the document they urge "the  recruitment of capable and qualified personnel into the  country's Customs Division to bring under control the high  degree of tax evasion resulting from the underpricing of goods  and excessive appraisals at the moment the settlement of papers  takes place." The document adds, "a law against contraband and  tax evasion should be approved with harsher penalties than the  current ones for offenders, the Finance Police should be  eliminated, and a computerized accounting system to verify the  entry and exit of consumer goods in the country should be  sought."    Another suggestion is to exercise control over revenues  earned by the national press and similar organizations, such as  agricultural schools that earn money through sales related to  agricultural-livestock services. Additional recommendations  include exerting financial control over the Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise, the Honduran Corporation for  Forest Development, and the National Children's Board to  determine the amount of revenues, expenditures, and investments;  examine the financial situation of the National Agricultural  Development Bank; and issue strong measures with the cooperation  of the judicial branch to ban games of chance.</p>

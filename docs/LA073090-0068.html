			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBINSON LASHES OUT AT HOLDOUT SLATER;  </P> <P> RAMS: VETERAN GUARD IS SEEKING TO RENEGOTIATE CONTRACT, WHICH REPORTEDLY IS FOR  $550,000 THIS SEASON. HE'S BEING FINED $1,000 A DAY UNTIL HE REPORTS.  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson, using his strongest language to date, reprimanded  14-year veteran tackle Jackie Slater on Sunday for holding out of training camp  while being under contract.  </P> <P> Robinson also said that Slater, a team captain and six-time Pro Bowl selection,  is being fined $1,000 per day during his holdout, which began last Wednesday  when Ram veterans reported to camp at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> "He has a contract and has violated the terms of that contract," Robinson said.  "I think he's out of line in what he's doing."  </P> <P> Slater, who has been unavailable for comment, is trying to renegotiate his  contract for 1990, which reportedly will pay him $550,000.  </P> <P> Robinson said Slater's reputation as a team leader and his years of service to  the organization do not excuse his absence from camp.  </P> <P> "He's been a very responsible player here, a very responsible person here,"  Robinson said. "But his responsibility continues.  </P> <P> "Just because he's been a great player, and an outstanding person in the past,  he still has a responsibility to this team to be here. In my view, the tact  he's taking is not going to be successful."  </P> <P> Slater, 36, said he plans to play two more seasons. If he does and remains  healthy, he will break franchise records for most seasons, 16, and games  played.  </P> <P> Slater enters his 15th season with the Rams, tying him on the team's all-time  list with Charlie Cowan and Joe Scibelli.  </P> <P> As for games played, Slater, with 194, trails only Merlin Olsen (208), Cowan  (206), Jack Youngblood (202), Scibelli (202).  </P> <P> If Slater plays 16 games in each of the next two seasons, he'll finish with 226  appearances.  </P> <P> Bern Brostek, the team's first-round draft choice from the University of  Washington, signed a five-year contract and reported to camp.  </P> <P> Terms of the deal were not available. The Rams had reportedly been offering  Brostek the same four-year, $1.8-million deal they gave Cleveland Gary last  year. The two sides compromised by adding another year to the length of the  contract.  </P> <P> Brostek, who was drafted as a center/guard, will be used exclusively at center  this season, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "He doesn't have time to learn two positions," Robinson said. "We feel good  about our guards -- (Joe) Milinichik, (Duval) Love, and (Tom) Newberry. If we  ever have a disaster, I think (center) Doug Smith is probably more equipped to  play guard than Brostek, rather than asking a guy to do both."  </P> <P> Anticipating his signing, Brostek flew from his home in Hawaii to California  late Saturday night. Brostek said he never wanted to hold out for one minute,  let alone 18 days.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be here on the first day (July 11), he said. "It's time to play  some football."  </P> <P> Brostek, the heir apparent to eventually take over veteran center Smith's  position, will spend his first season in a learning role.  </P> <P> "He doesn't have to come in and fill a hole," Robinson said. "He's here in a  support role initially, we hope, and feel from what we've seen, that he's  capable of playing in a responsible way in the NFL his first year, which  doesn't happen very often for offensive linemen. He's probably just as well off  to be in a support role."  </P> <P> Brostek, 6-feet-3 and 300 pounds, said he hopes to catch up with his teammates  quickly. He spent one month after the April draft working out with the team in  Anaheim. He's ready to work.  </P> <P> "Wherever they want me to play, I'll play," he said. "I heard center. I'll help  any way I can."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Receiver Flipper Anderson bruised his tail bone Sunday and was held out of the  evening practice. . . . The Rams have yet to sign their second-round draft  choice, safety Pat Terrell, and four veterans -- defensive end Kevin Greene,  safety Michael Stewart, defensive lineman Doug Reed, and tight end Damone  Johnson. Running back David Lang, the team's 12th-round choice, is also  unsigned, but he probably won't play this season because he's serving out a  prison sentence for receiving stolen property.  </P> <P> With Brostek's signing, the team must release one player to meet the roster  limit of 80. The Rams depart for Berlin, Germany, next Saturday for an Aug. 11  exhibition game with the Kansas City Chiefs.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Through its secretary for humanitarian affairs, the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]  today condemned the threats that the Luanda government has been  making concerning humanitarian aid. According to a source in  that secretariat, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] threats jeopardize the norms of  the humanitarian organizations and show that Luanda continues to  manipulate humanitarian aid policy in favor of the government  and the MPLA-PT.    That source also said that UNITA had no responsibility  whatsoever with the attacks on World Food Program, WFP, aircraft  in Malange, where, ironically, the People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola are on the offensive and are logistically  supplied by aircraft. That source added that UNITA will work to  facilitate humanitarian aid work in Angola, as long as the  government keeps its distance and stops interfering in the  distribution of [word indistinct], the WFP's cooking oil, or the  UNICEF's soap.</p>

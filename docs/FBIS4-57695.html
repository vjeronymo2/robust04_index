			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ``special correspondent'' Arturo Gudino] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 May (AFP) -- Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez, presidential candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary  Party (PRD), has appealed to Dominicans to engage in peaceful  resistance "in favor of a patriotic solution" to the crisis  unleashed by the controversial 16 May general elections.    In a televised appearance Sunday night [22 May], Pena Gomez  also warned that the vote-by-vote count by the Central Electoral  Board (JCE), which is scheduled to begin Wednesday, will be  meaningless unless it is determined beforehand how many citizens  were unable to vote. He also appealed for prayer meetings to be  held Wednesday in churches nationwide and asked supporters to  avoid confrontations with the Army and police.    A week after the elections, which the PRD called fraudulent,  the JCE still has not proclaimed a winner.    Pena Gomez, a 57-year-old black leader, and veteran  President  Joaquin Balaguer, 87, who is seeking reelection to a seventh  term in four decades, were the favorites in the presidential  election.    According to Pena Gomez, the vote-counting center of the  JCE,  in collusion with two of the JCE magistrates, staged a "colossal  fraud" by altering the lists of voters, preventing approximately  200,000 people from voting.    For his part, Fernando Alvarez, vice presidential candidate  of the PRD, opposed to the ruling party, said "five types of  fraud" were detected in favor of Balaguer. Alvarez declared:  "This crime cannot go unpunished. Whether it is with new  elections or complementary elections in those places where  irregularities were detected, Dr. Pena Gomez will be president  of the Dominican people as of 16 August," the date established  by law for the new government to take office.    In light of the charges of fraud, Balaguer's government,  through the Nationalist Union comprising businessmen and  intellectuals, launched an intense campaign, starting the middle  of last week, alleging that the United States and France are  seeking to merge the Dominican Republic and Haiti soon to quell  the crisis in Haiti. According to the Nationalist Union, the  post-electoral crisis is being used by Western powers to  destabilize the country and eventually justify military  intervention, after which the "merger" would follow.    The campaign has caused alarm in some sectors of the  population, above all, among those less politically cultured,  who speak openly in the streets of the danger of "integration"  with Haiti. With a predominantly mulatto population of 7  million, Dominicans do not view their neighboring Haitians,  mostly blacks who are illiterate and live in a state of poverty,  in a good light.    Pena Gomez urged that whenever power outages occur, as took  place frequently during the elections, the people go out and  light candles on the sidewalks. "We must cover the sidewalks  with burning candles," Pena told his supporters, urging them not  to respond violently to "enemy provocations."    "In the face of fraud, we are not going to stand by," the  PRD  candidate stated. Equally as bad as interventionism -- promoted  by the ruling party -- is continuing with the status quo, which  he said has been the cause of all revolutions that have shaken  humanity and the Dominicans in general.    On Monday, the city of Santo Domingo with 2.5 million  inhabitants appeared calm and business activities appeared to  have regained normalcy, but citizens remained gripped by tension  and uncertainty.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / BA surprises as profits soar to Pounds 100m: UK airline's shares rise after third-quarter results beat market expectations BRITISH AIRWAYS surprised the City yesterday by reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m for its third quarter ended December, compared with Pounds 20m the year before. The results were double City expectations and sent BA shares higher to close at 248p in heavy trading, a gain of 23p on the day. The sharp profit improvement will strengthen BA's hand in negotiations for a merger with KLM. The Dutch carrier reported last week a third quarter net loss of Fl 8.9m (Pounds 2.76m) against a loss of Fl 213.9m a year earlier. BA also made a Pounds 140m extraordinary net gain from the sale last December of its engine maintenance plant in Wales to General Electric of the US. Pre-tax profits for the first nine months were 16 per cent lower at Pounds 285m, compared with Pounds 340m. BA's strong financial performance in the current recessionary environment contrasts sharply with the heavy losses or small profits recently reported by its main international competitors for the latest quarter. However, Lord King, chairman, said the airline would have to continue its cost-saving drive in the face of the uncertain conditions in the airline business. He added that BA was positioning itself to take advantage of any economic recovery in its main markets when this happened. The airline also reported a 12.9 per cent increase in passenger traffic last month compared with January 1991 when the industry was hit by the Gulf crisis. However, when compared with January 1990 the increase was 6.7 per cent. BA said last month's traffic results continued to reflect the economic recession with premium traffic still below January 1990 levels. Third-quarter operating profits of Pounds 111m compared with break-even in the same period last year. Group turnover rose 6.1 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn largely because of better yields and in spite of a 3.1 per cent fall in total passengers. The airline carried 5.7m passengers in the latest quarter on scheduled services. For the first nine months the operating surplus was 13.5 per cent higher at Pounds 319m and turnover was flat at Pounds 3.6bn. The improvement reflected lower costs and the return to profitability after the Middle East conflict last year. Group expenditure in the latest quarter declined by 2.9 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn. The airline cut its staff by 4,600, or 10.9 per cent, during the past 12 months, increasing productivity by 11.4 per cent. However, pay settlements increased staff costs 4.7 per cent to Pounds 376m in the latest quarter. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose 416 per cent in the latest quarter to 9.8p from 1.9p in the same quarter the previous year and were marginally lower at 28p versus 28.3p for the nine-month period.

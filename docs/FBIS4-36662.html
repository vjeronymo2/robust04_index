			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 12 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni  gunners opened fire on the breakaway southern Yemeni capital  Aden Saturday, killing two people and wounding 22, the  al-Jumhuriyah Hospital reported.    Shells continued to fall sporadically on the city centre  Saturday evening [11 June], causing fires and destroying several  houses, after a third ceasefire in Yemen's five-week-old civil  war collapsed.    The worst-hit areas were Khormaksar near the airport,  Mansurah and Ma'allah.    A northern spokesman earlier Saturday announced that north  Yemen planes attacked the airport in al-Mukalla -- where rebel  southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid has his headquarters -- and  "caused heavy damage."    Al-Mukalla is located 700 kilometers (400 miles) east of  Aden.    In the Ma'allah district here meanwhile a bomb exploded  under  a car, wounding three. Southern officials said the "sabotage"  had been carried out by "elements of the Jihad fundamentalist  movement, who are trying to destabilise the city."    Explosions could be seen and heard from the center of Aden  as  rival forces fought artillery duels about 20 kilometers (12  miles) away.    The north had declared a ceasefire to take effect midnight  Friday, proposing a joint military commission to supervise the  truce. But southern leaders insisted on international  observers, a proposal already ruled out by the north.    The south nonetheless vowed to observe the ceasefire and to  "act only defensively," but violent artillery duels around Aden  continued throughout Saturday.    Two other ceasefires have been broken after only a few hours  this week, with north and south blaming each other.    South Yemen proclaimed itself independent on May 21, four  years after North and South Yemen had merged to form a fragile  union and weeks after fighting broke out between the two sides.    Political leaders in the unified state, at odds  ideologically, had never been able to agree on the  administration of the country.    There was no immediate confirmation of the airport attack,  which came hours before southern officials had expected UN peace  envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to hold talks with al-Bid in al-Mukalla.    Brahimi met earlier with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah  and with the northern Yemen president, 'Ali Abdallah Salih in  Sanaa to promote support for UN Security Council resolution 924  calling for an immediate ceasefire and political dialogue.    The north has accused Saudi Arabia of supplying the south  with arms from eastern Europe.    Here in Aden, running water was restored to some  neighborhoods after repairs were made to part of a pumping  station shelled last week, city officials said.    But electricity is still being rationed and occasional power  cuts have plagued the city since its power station was hit  Friday.    A member of the ruling southern Yemen Socialist Party  council, Sa'ib Sa'il, said two standby stations had been put in  service to guarantee power supplies.    In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross  announced that one of its ships was waiting off Aden for safety  guarantees before unloading emergency medical supplies for the  wounded.    A Red Cross official told journalists in Aden Saturday that  nearly 2,000 soldiers and civilians were being held in detention  in north and south Yemen because of the civil war, which he had  left thousands dead and wounded.</p>

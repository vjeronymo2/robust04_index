			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Sterling fall puts renewed pressure on punt STERLING came under renewed selling pressure against the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday as the government's 1 percentage point cut in base rates continued to undermine the confidence of investors in the British currency. The pound fell more than 4 pfennigs in intra-day trading, bottoming out at DM2.388, amid strong selling from bank dealers, overseas companies and institutional investors. The base rate cut from 7 per cent to 6 per cent and sterling's subsequent fall triggered fresh tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism, pushing the punt below its floor against two ERM currencies. There was a strong belief in the foreign exchange market that sterling's fall had left the punt heavily overvalued against the pound, undermining Ireland's trading position with the UK. Ireland's central bank once again responded to the speculative attack on its currency by raising its overnight lending rate to 100 per cent, only two days after it had reduced the rate by one percentage point to 14 per cent. On the Dublin interbank market, one month interest rates doubled to around 35 per cent. The moves failed to lift the punt above its floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder after official ERM trading closed at 4 pm in London. Sterling closed in London at DM2.3975, down nearly 3 pfennigs on the day, and more than 11 pfennigs below the level at which it was trading three weeks ago. Against the dollar, it closed down nearly 2 1/2 cents at Dollars 1.538. In New York it closed at DM2.3965 and at Dollars 1.5105. There was a more modest deterioration in sterling's trade weighted index, which measures the pound against a basket of currencies and which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said he monitors closely. The index fell from 78.9 to 78.6. The values of sterling and the punt were undermined by a growing perception in markets that the Bundesbank may ease its short-term rates more slowly than had been anticipated earlier this year. Mr Lothar Muller, a member of the Bundesbank council, said conditions were not right for another cut in German interest rates. Uncertainty about the direction of German rates also undermined the lira, which in London fell sharply against the D-Mark from L919.75 to L933. In late New York dealing it was trading around L936 against the D-Mark. The Irish government said it was determined to continue defending the punt. However, the renewed pressure after more than a week of an easing of tensions within the ERM is rapidly eroding the political consensus the government had succeeded in creating last September in defending the currency. The Irish Farmers' Association is to hold an emergency meeting of its national executive on Monday to discuss the crisis, which it says has badly affected Irish food exports into the UK market.

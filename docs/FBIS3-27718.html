In a meeting with Gennadiy Burbulis, a close  aide to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Hata said he plans to  visit Russia but did not specify the timing, the officials said.    Burbulis said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hopes  to hold talks regularly with his Japanese counterpart and that  Russia welcomes a trip by Hata, according to the officials.    Hata told Burbulis he hopes frank discussions will be held  during the bilateral working-level talks February 21 and 22 in  Moscow on the two countries' territorial dispute and that he  wants to visit Russia based on the outcome of the meeting, they  said. The officials said a specific schedule will be worked out  after studying the results of the February talks.    Burbulis, a lower house member of Russia's new Parliament  and  president of the Moscow-based Russian Political Strategy  Research Center, is in Japan to attend a forum on security  attended by experts from Japan, Russia and the United States.    In a 20-minute meeting, Hata told Burbulis reform must be  achieved in Russia and that instability of the Russian  Parliament should not be an excuse to delay the process of  democratization and other reforms.    Burbulis voiced optimism toward Russian reform, saying he is  not worried about the difficulties the new Russian Government  faces and that he is certain the government will achieve reform,  the officials said. Yeltsin will not allow the halt of the  reforms, he was quoted as saying.    Earlier in the day, Burbulis met Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and congratulated him on the passage last weekend of  political reform bills, the officials said.    Burbulis told Hosokawa in a 30-minute meeting that reforms  in  Russia are "irreversible" and that Yeltsin is making efforts to  overcome the difficulties, they said.    Burbulis also said the enactment of a new Constitution has  established a basis for Russia's political stability and that he  hopes the Constitution will open new possibilities in solving  problems between Japan and Russia, the officials said.</p>

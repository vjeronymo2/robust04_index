			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / M&amp;S up 25% on turnover ahead 3%: Group regains title of most profitable retailer MARKS and Spencer regained the title of the UK's most profitable retailer yesterday as it lifted its pre-tax profit 25 per cent to Pounds 736.5m. The clothing and food retailer knocked J Sainsbury, the grocery chain which last week announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 732.8m, into second place. M&amp;S said the improvement was due to a pick-up in consumer spending, increased efficiency, and the success of its 'outstanding value' campaign, which involved lowering the prices of 25 per cent of its clothing. The shares, however, fell 9 1/2 p to 345 1/2 p, apparently on worries about a wage settlement that will add 6 per cent to the wage bill. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, was characteristically blunt in his reaction to M&amp;S regaining the title it first lost to Sainsbury last year, quoting the former Liverpool FC manager Mr Bill Shankly: 'We never worry or concern ourselves with how the other teams are playing, we are only interested in how we are performing.' 'We are very much on the front foot as we see the consumers coming out of the trenches,' he added. Turnover for the year to March 31 increased 3.4 per cent to Pounds 5.9bn. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 736.5m on an FRS3 basis, up 25 per cent on last year's restated Pounds 588.9m. Earnings per share increased to 18p from a restated 13.5p, while the total dividend was raised from 7.1p to 8.1p. Operating margins were boosted from 11.9 per cent to 12.5 per cent. In the UK and Eire, Sir Richard said clothing sales had improved strongly thanks partly to its aggressive pricing policy, and the company had increased volumes and market share. He rejected claims that M&amp;S had been 'screwing' its manufacturers, insisting price reductions had been achieved by lowering its own buying margins. Food sales increased by about 5 per cent in the second half, with M&amp;S retaining its overall market share. The overseas performance was encouraging, with total sales up 8.5 per cent to Pounds 736.9m, and the devaluation of sterling helped operating profits increase 34.6 per cent to Pounds 56m.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Russian presence splits Tajiks TAJIKISTAN'S government was split yesterday over the presence of Russian troops sent to put down fighting in the central Asian republic, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. Mr Abdulmalik Abdullodzhanov, the acting prime minister who heads a loose coalition of Moslems and parliamentary democrats, said the Russians should stay until the conflict was over. 'The Russian troop reinforcements came to our republic not to shoot. We invited them to establish control over the fighting,' he said. But Mr Davlat Usmon, deputy prime minister and a prominent member of the Islamic Revival Party (IRP), said he was against the deployment of Russian troops in the former Soviet republic. He said the Russian army in Tajikistan had been the main source of supply of weapons to the warring sides. The coalition has ruled the backward, clan-dominated republic of 5m people since the ex-communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev was forced from office last month. Russia sent reinforcements this week, saying they were needed to protect the families of the troops already there from the rival Tajik factions.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA HOTEL EXEMPLIFIES LINCOLN S&amp;L'S EXTRAVAGANCE  </P> <P> What's bizarre about the upper-class Phoenician Hotel here is that everything  appears so normal.  </P> <P> Nestled at the base of Camelback Mountain, a Phoenix-area landmark, the hotel  reeks of elegance and money, from its $25-million art collection to afternoon  teas that are served in the marble-floored main lobby. Daily fact sheets  provide each guest with weather reports and hotel activities.  </P> <P> The still waters are deceptive.  </P> <P> The Phoenician is the erstwhile crown jewel of Charles H. Keating Jr., the  controversial Phoenix businessman who stands as the center of the storm over  the massive taxpayer bailout of the savings and loan industry.  </P> <P> Financed by Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, the hotel  represents one of the excesses of the thrift industry in the 1980s, a period  when many thrifts went from mortgage lender to real estate developer, often  with poor results.  </P> <P> Although many in Phoenix rave about the resort's beauty and style, some hotel  consultants believe that the Phoenician is a financial white elephant doomed to  unprofitability because it was far too expensive to build. The complex cost  almost $300 million, government figures show.  </P> <P> The hotel, which has more than 600 rooms on 130 acres, would have to charge  about $500 a night to make money, according to estimates by Richard A. Warnick,  partner in the Phoenix office of Laventhol &amp; Horwath, an accounting firm.  </P> <P> That's more than three times the average room rate in the luxury hotel market  in the Phoenix area. "At that price, they won't make money in my lifetime, and  I'm not that old," said Warnick, who is in his early 40s.  </P> <P> Keating disputed that reasoning, however, saying in an interview that the  outside consultants were "absolutely dead wrong." He maintained that the hotel  was already making enough money to pay its operating expenses and had potential  for great profit if sold in a few years.  </P> <P> Keating's real estate and banking empire collapsed in 1989 after years of  bitter feuding with the bureaucrats who regulate the nation's thrift industry.  Keating's development company sought refuge in bankruptcy court, and Lincoln  Savings was seized by government savings and loan regulators as part of what's  expected to be the costliest thrift failure in U.S. history.  </P> <P> Federal agents delivered the final indignity Nov. 16, when they ousted Keating  and his cohorts from management of the hotel during a pre-dawn raid that was  barely noticed by the guests.  </P> <P> Government regulators are now faced with the formidable task of finding a buyer  for the hotel. One possible acquirer is the Kuwait Investment Office, which  already has a 45% interest in the property.  </P> <P> The hotel was plagued by building revisions and luxurious excesses that added  millions of dollars to its eventual cost, according to those familiar with its  construction. The building changes were usually mandated by Keating and his  wife.  </P> <P> But the early evidence also indicates that the hotel has fallen on hard times  since Keating was removed. During one three-day stretch in early December, the  Phoenician seemed uncommonly empty during the normally busy tourist season.  </P> <P> The hotel's new government-installed manager, Hans D. Turnovszky, confirmed  that the hotel had an occupancy rate of only 50% to 55% early this month, and  angry Keating loyalists say the hotel has sustained widespread cancellations  since the government seizure. The resort was 95% occupied at the time of the  raid, regulators said.  </P> <P> "I have good sources who tell me that November was way below expectations, and  December looks just as bad," said Bradley J. Boland, a Keating spokesman and  son-in-law. He added that "1990 looks bad because no one wants to stay in a  government-owned hotel."  </P> <P> Keating, who is seeking to regain control of the Phoenician through litigation,  argues that he could have eventually sold the resort for a profit of several  hundred million dollars if he had been allowed to finish his plans to expand  the resort to more than 850 rooms.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview earlier this week, the 65-year-old developer said he  also had plans to bolster the hotel's finances by selling some of the  surrounding property for real estate development.  </P> <P> Those moves would have increased the Phoenician's value and made it more  attractive to potential investors, particularly those from Japan who recently  have paid princely sums for luxurious resort properties in the United States,  he said.  </P> <P> "That resort was built to be sold," said Keating, who also maintained that the  hotel cost only $275 million, not $296 million as banking regulators contend.  </P> <P> Regulators who supervised the investments of Lincoln Savings viewed the  Phoenician with alarm in its early stages of development, but their concerns  ebbed somewhat later on. The hotel was not a major contributor to the collapse  of Lincoln, which was seized because of risky loans and questionable  investments in other real estate development projects.  </P> <P> Several months before the hotel opened, regulators placed the Phoenician on a  special watch list, but they did not require Lincoln Savings to write off any  value in the project, according to regulatory records that are now part of a  lawsuit between Keating and the government.  </P> <P> In late 1986, Laventhol &amp; Horwath estimated that the hotel was worth only  about $200 million if it had an occupancy rate of 70%. But regulators later  agreed the property had a market value of $297 million after the Kuwait  Investment Office (KIO) paid $134 million for its minority stake in the  property, the regulatory records show.  </P> <P> The KIO, based in London, is an arm of the Kuwait Finance Ministry that invests  in real estate and hotels worldwide. Officials of the agency could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> The Phoenician was a very personal undertaking for Keating, who closely  supervised its construction. His wife, Mary Elaine, designed the hotel interior  after the firing of several professional interior designers.  </P> <P> The family stamp is all over the grounds. One restaurant is named Mary  Elaine's, and a nightclub is known as Charlie Charlie's. A crucifixion scene  along a golf-cart trail behind the hotel is an apparent reflection of Keating's  deep religious beliefs.  </P> <P> Joe Gilbreath, general manager of a Phoenix firm that performed glass work at  the Phoenician, recalled that Keating lived at the hotel in the two months  prior to its Oct. 1, 1988, opening. "He was roaming around the place like a  guard dog 20 hours a day," Gilbreath said.  </P> <P> At the same time, construction was plagued by costly changes. Gilbreath said  Keating once ordered him to encase one marble stairway in glass, a job that  cost more than $25,000, then ordered him to tear it down when he didn't like  the look.  </P> <P> "There were well over 1,000 change orders," Gilbreath said. "I've been in (the  construction) business for 31 years, and I've never seen anything like it."  </P> <P> The history of the Phoenician goes back to the late 1970s, when Canadian  investors leased the land around the historic Jokake Inn, once the home of  artist Jessie Benton Evans.  </P> <P> The inn, turned into a tearoom that took overnight visitors, was once a  fashionable resting spot for famous winter tourists such as the Astors and  Rockefellers. But its glory days were over by the 1970s, and it closed in 1979.  </P> <P> The Canadian investors planned to build a hotel known as the Four Seasons  Phoenician Hotel, but they sold the leases in 1984 because American  Continental, Keating's development firm, "made us an offer we couldn't refuse,"  one investor said.  </P> <P> Construction of the Phoenician was a massive and turbulent undertaking.  </P> <P> Keating quarreled loudly with Phoenix city officials over how much water could  be used on the property for the golf course, swimming pools, and decorative  lakes and ponds. Delays caused by the fights were a "perfect example of how to  bankrupt a developer," Keating charged at a news conference in 1987.  </P> <P> The hotel is also entangled in messy litigation over unpaid bills. Dozens of  subcontractors claim that they are still owed about $13 million, but they have  yet to be paid because of a continuing dispute between the hotel and the  general contractor.  </P> <P> What eventually happens to the Phoenician depends largely on bureaucrats such  as Anthony Scalzi, western region head of the Resolution Trust Corp., the  government agency created this year to liquidate the assets of failed savings  and loans.  </P> <P> Scalzi confirmed that the Phoenician may eventually be sold to the Kuwaitis,  but he also suggested that the bargaining would not be easy. "There is a  chance" of a sale, he said in a recent interview, "but we are not going to give  it away."  </P> <P> Free-lance writer Steve Webb in Phoenix contributed to this story.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY A1  </P></p>

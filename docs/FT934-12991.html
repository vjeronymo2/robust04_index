			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's Even after the introduction of corporate investors next year, Lloyd's will have neither a price mechanism nor a secondary market. Capital will continue to be allocated to underwriting syndicates through a system of queueing rather than on price. Shares in the proposed Lloyd's investment trusts will be traded on the stock exchange, but Names will still not be able to buy or sell their syndicate participations. That prevents them paying for losses on bad syndicates by selling their rights to profitable participations. The advent of quoted Lloyd's investment trusts is a step towards accurate pricing. Corporate investors are demanding more information on the performance of syndicates, which can only be good for transparency. The price of a trust's shares should reflect the value of its assets and likely profits from syndicate participations. The shares should trade at a premium to net assets when the outlook for underwriting profits is good and at a discount when it is poor. Once a basis for pricing has been established, trusts might also trade syndicate participations between themselves by buying and selling subsidiaries. But it will take another giant leap before Names are free to trade in a similar way. The legal hurdles are immense. If individual Names are wholly replaced by corporate investors, the issue will not have to be addressed. But that cannot be taken for granted. If corporate investors are free to take profits in the form of capital gain while Names cannot, the playing field will have to be levelled.</p>

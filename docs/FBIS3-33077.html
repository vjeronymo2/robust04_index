			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] A spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry  reiterated that entering embassies is not an acceptable way of  leaving the country and that those who do so are on the mistaken  path.    In allusion to a group of persons who on 26 January entered  the Belgian Embassy in Havana, he told PRENSA LATINA that [the  authorities] will not allow this method to be adopted by those  intent on leaving Cuba.    The Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry spokesman explained  that  entering a diplomatic mission cannot be a privilege or safe  conduct for emigration. In that regard, he said that Cuba has  not changed its policy and remembered that there are emigration  laws that allow any citizen to travel abroad, as long as he has  received a visa and paid for the transportation.    The spokesman said that the four men, two women, and one  minor who are in the Belgian Embassy in this capital must leave  the diplomatic mission voluntarily and return to their residence  and undertake the normal steps to leave the country, even if  they have a visa.</p>

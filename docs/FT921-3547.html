			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Election 92: Lib Dems pledge to raise tax to 26% LIBERAL DEMOCRATS have decided to enter the election pledged to increase the basic rate of income tax to 26 per cent and to abolish the lower 20p rate announced in the Budget, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman, agreed the increases with parliamentary colleagues in order to balance the party's commitment to a Pounds 6bn programme of public investment. They mean that the Liberal Democrats have opened up a flank to Labour and the Tories by becoming the only party pledged to raise the basic rate of income tax if elected. However, the Liberal Democrats believe their commitment to use the 1p on the basic rate for an extra Pounds 2bn on education spending will prove electorally popular by demonstrating a strong commitment to improving Britain's workforce. Previously the party has said it would only increase the basic rate 'if necessary'. Mr Beith said in a televised broadcast last night: 'What the Budget has revealed is that the cupboard is bare - the chancellor hasn't left us the money to do the job, but it must be done. 'We're going to need that penny to build up the education system to the point where it can really make a difference to our children's chances and our nation's chances to pay our way.' Mr Beith envisages the public sector borrowing requirement rising to Pounds 30bn in the 1992-93 financial year, compared with the Pounds 28bn forecast by the Treasury. Full costings will be published with the manifesto early next week. Other Liberal Democrat spending pledges include Pounds 1 a week extra on child benefit for each child and Pounds 8 a week more in state pension for a couple. Mr Beith said the cost of introducing the 20p income tax rate would have been used more effectively if spent on housing, transport infrastructure, energy conservation and job creation. The Budget 'certainly isn't going to get the country out of the recession', he said.</p>

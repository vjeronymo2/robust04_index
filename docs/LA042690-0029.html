			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> SCHOOL TO BE DESIGNATED AN HISTORIC SITE  </P> <P> One old school and the site of another won't just be old after today -- they'll  be historic.  </P> <P> The designation of historic status will be extended to an elementary school  that has stood in Port Hueneme for 62 years and to the site of a four-room  schoolhouse that was the city's first school. The actions will be taken by the  Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board and the Hueneme School District.  </P> <P> Hueneme Elementary School, a stately Spanish-style building constructed in  1928, will be dedicated as a county historical landmark in a ceremony at 1:30  p.m. today at the school. It will be held in conjunction with National Schools  Week.  </P> <P> A nearby playground where the old Hueneme Grammar School was located and where  many of Port Hueneme's pioneers received their early education will be declared  a county historical point of interest.  </P> <P> The original frame grammar school was built in 1889 for $9,000, said Katherine  Garner, board administrative assistant.  </P> <P> Board chairwoman Dorothy Ramirez said the old school served as an unofficial  town meeting place.  </P> <P> "The schoolhouse was the central location for everybody," Ramirez said. "It was  the community center because we didn't have a community center, so any event  that was held would be held there."  </P> <P> Walter Moranda, 75, attended the original school from 1924 to 1928.  </P> <P> It had about 63 students in eight grades. A highlight of the school day was  sounding a bell in the tower by pulling a cord that ran through classrooms on  both floors, Moranda said.  </P> <P> "I remember it very fondly," he said. "Each of the rooms had two grades, and  with only eight grades, classes were pretty small."  </P> <P> Moranda said students watched with excitement as the new concrete, Spanish-tile  school was constructed beginning around 1927, and also watched without much  regret shortly after as the old one was razed.  </P> <P> "When you're happy with something new, you don't mind losing something old,"  Moranda said.  </P> <P> However, Hueneme Principal Eldon Mrstik said the old has blended well with the  new at the present school, where several classrooms have been added and other  renovations made since the building's construction.  </P> <P> The school, at 345 N. 3rd St., will hold an open house beginning at 5 p.m.; a  historical exhibit recounting the school's history will be displayed. Elaine K.  Garber, a member of the school district board of trustees, will speak on the  history of the school at 5:45 p.m., and the school's PTA will hold a spaghetti  dinner beginning at 6 p.m. ADRIANNE GOODMAN  </P></p>

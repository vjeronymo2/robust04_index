			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Stock exchange urges wider penalty net The London Stock Exchange is proposing to start ordering restitution for victims of misconduct and to start making it easier to penalise wrongdoers and publish their names. The proposals appear in a consultation document released yesterday on changes to the member firms' Rule Book, which has not had any significant revisions since 1988. The move came as Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday said that the criminal justice act, which spells out tougher rules on insider dealing, would take effect on March 1. Under the stock exchange plans, a rules committee would for the first time be able to consider breaches of rules and set fines of up to Pounds 25,000 in addition to ordering member firms to repay victims. Fines for misdeeds over that amount would have to be considered by the disciplinary committee, and the names of those found to have breached rules would have be made public. The exchange said it had previously made disciplinary actions public, but it had no automatic power to do so. The exchange would also be able to award costs to a complainant or, if the complaint is deemed frivolous, to a firm. The rules committee would give automatic decisions for specific breaches of rules. The exchange said that the proposals would bring it into line with the other self-regulating bodies authorised to police the financial services industry. It said the planned revisions to the Rule Book were 'a tidying-up exercise' because the myriad rules for members are confusing and often overlap. However, some City officials said the exchange was concerned that it was sometimes seen as ineffectual in punishing misdeeds and informing the public. 'Before, the exchange didn't have any teeth to it. Now the board is trying to give it a few molars,' said one board member. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has also made tighter supervision of all investment exchanges a priority since irregularities at the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) were found last year. Also among the proposals - to which the exchange is seeking comments by mid March - are adjustments to rules to take account of the move to 10-day rolling settlement of transactions from July 18. The exchange also proposes to tighten rules on market practice. For instance, in spelling out the obligations of marketmakers, persistent failure to answer telephones while open for business will be considered a violation of the obligation to 'actively offer to buy and sell'. There have been complaints that during volatile trading periods marketmakers have avoided answering phones.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Clinton keeps ahead of Democrat pack ARKANSAS Governor Bill Clinton has survived the second in a series of televised debates among the Democratic presidential candidates with no apparent damage to his front-runner status for next month's New Hampshire primary. The youthful governor turned in a smooth performance in the Sunday night debate in the face of a fierce attack from Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. Mr Harkin, an early favourite for the nomination among organised labour, has been losing union support to Mr Clinton, and a new poll showed him running fifth in New Hampshire. Mr Clinton also brushed aside allegations of womanising by blaming the rumors on Republican opponents and declaring: 'I can deal with the kind of sleaze the Republicans put out.' For most of the two-hour debate the candidates sparred genteelly over the economy, taxes, crime and schools. Mr Harkin saved his most direct attack until the closing stages of the debate, after Governor Clinton had finished, criticising the governor's education and environmental records and accusing him of having brought 'Reagonomics into Arkansas.' The candidates, aware that most Americans still do not know them, took time to emphasise their pet issues. The moderator gave each candidate the opportunity to address his perceived 'negatives,' and she listed them. Senator Bob Kerrey, said to lack a detailed programme except for his health care plan, said nothing else could be done 'until we establish health care as a fundamental right'. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, accused of being 'way out', said: 'I don't know why people don't believe me when I tell them the system is corrupt.' Mr Harkin, accused of being 'out of the mainstream of the American electorate', said he had 'the longest record of running against Republicans in Republican areas and whipping them'. Former senator Paul Tsongas, accused of being a boring Greek from Massachusetts, said he was proud to be a Greek and that President George Bush had also been born in Massachusetts. New Hampshire is a crucial testing ground because it holds the first primary, in which party voters express preferences for candidates. A poll of New Hampshire Democratic voters published by the Boston Globe on Sunday found 79 per cent undecided over the February 18 race. But voters asked to pick from a list of candidates gave Mr Clinton 29 per cent, followed by Mr Tsongas with 17 per cent. The five Democrats running for president have all urged President Bush to send immediate aid to the former Soviet republics, and four out of the five have agreed to the use of US troops to deliver food supplies already in Europe, Nancy Dunne writes.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / M0 increase eases fears over taxes: Indicators bolster recovery hopes A sharp rise in money supply last month yesterday provided the first tentative statistical evidence that the spring tax increases have not damaged the economic recovery. The Bank of England reported that its provisional estimate of M0, the narrow measure of money supply, increased by a seasonally adjusted 6.2 per cent in the year to April, well up on market expectations of a 5.8 per cent increase and a year-on-year rise of 5.6 per cent in March. The news strengthened market expectations that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, would decide against cutting bank base rates from 5.25 per cent at their monthly monetary meeting today. A decision to change rates was already considered highly unlikely in view of tomorrow's local elections, recent indicators of steady first-quarter economic growth and rising yields for UK government bonds. Yesterday's figures for M0, normally regarded as a good guide to retail sales, provided the first statistical evidence that the tax increases have not deterred UK consumers. 'The figures showed there is quite a lot of momentum in consumer demand,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, the stockbrokers. M0, which consists of notes and coins in circulation and banks' operational deposits, is regarded as a normally good guide to consumer spending trends. Although increased taxes, including value added tax on domestic fuel, higher employee National Insurance payments and reduced mortgage interest relief, took effect at the beginning of last month, the growth of M0 in April alone was an adjusted 1.9 per cent, the biggest monthly rise since February 1981. The annual rate of M0 growth continues to be well above the government's 'monitoring range' of zero to 4 per cent which is meant to be consistent with steady non-inflationary growth. On a seasonally adjusted annualised basis, M0 rose by 13.1 per cent in the latest three months and 9.1 per cent in the six months to April. Notes and coins, the core component of M0 with the most relevance to consumer trends, increased by a seasonally adjusted 6.5 per cent in the year to April. Bank officials said they regarded the sharp rise in M0 as a continuing reaction to lower UK interest rates, which reduced the cost to individuals of holding cash balances, and the steady growth of consumer demand. However, they did not rule out technical factors because March, April and May are traditionally difficult months for seasonal adjustment.</p>

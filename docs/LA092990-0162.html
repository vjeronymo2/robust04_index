			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY AWARDS $26 MILLION TO SAN DIEGO FIRM  </P> <P> A U.S. District Court jury in San Diego has recommended that Sunnyvale-based  Advanced Micro Devices pay $26 million in damages to San Diego-based Brooktree  for infringing on three Brooktree patents that cover computer chips used to  generate color graphics on computer screens.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William Enright on Thursday prohibited AMD from making,  using or selling any products that infringe on the patents.  </P> <P> Enright also gave AMD 10 days to appeal the injunction.  </P> <P> Attorneys described the case as the first test of the Semiconductor Chip  Protection Act of 1984, which is designed to protect technological advances in  the hotly competitive computer chip industry. The same federal jury on Sept. 10  determined that AMD had violated Brooktree's patent rights for the chips.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, AMD Chairman and Chief Executive W. J. Sanders III  said AMD would comply with the order, pending an appeal. "We are aghast at the  implications of the verdict," Sanders said. "If the jury verdict and damages  are confirmed by the court and not overturned on appeal, a gross miscarriage of  justice will have been done."  </P> <P> The closely watched court case focused on patents covering microchips that are  known as color palettes. They are used to control the display of colors on  computer monitor screens. Industry analysts have set the fast-growing market  for color palettes at about $70 million a year.  </P> <P> The case, which dates to November, 1988, pitted privately held Brooktree, which  expects to report about $60 million in revenue during 1990, against AMD, a  giant chip maker with more than $1.2 billion in annual sales.  </P> <P> The award covers three Brooktree patents that are used in graphics applications  in engineering workstations and high-resolution personal computers, according  to Brooktree spokeswoman Cathy Batchelor.  </P></p>

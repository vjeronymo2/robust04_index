			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Intervention steadies pound: Bank of England spends Pounds 1bn to hold the line on interest rates THE BANK of England's biggest intervention to support sterling in six years helped yesterday to steady the pound against the D-Mark and to stave off a possible rise in UK interest rates. The Bank spent about Pounds 1bn buying sterling for D-Marks after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, stressed that Britain would not devalue the pound or withdraw from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The impact of Britain's intervention was reduced after remarks by a member of the Bundesbank council about the 'potential' for an ERM realignment. The pound sagged for a few hours before closing in London up  3/4 pfennig at DM2.7950, 1 1/2 pfennigs above its effective floor in the ERM. In New York, it was quoted at DM2.7925 at the close and early today was trading at DM2.7945 as markets opened in Japan. Mr Lamont, speaking yesterday morning on the steps of the Treasury building in Whitehall, said he wanted to remove any 'scintilla of doubt' that government policy was committed to maintaining sterling's ERM position. The government would do 'whatever necessary' to keep sterling within ERM parities. The chancellor's statement was followed by heavy buying of pounds by Bank currency dealers. In a well-rehearsed operation, they sought to amplify the effect of Mr Lamont's comments by large purchases of sterling in selected international banks. This move was seen on the currency markets as a significant stepping up in the government's battle to defend the pound. The last time that the Bank intervened on such a scale to support sterling was in 1986. But comments yesterday by Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia, strengthened the belief of foreign exchange dealers that the Bundesbank might be trying to provoke a realignment. Such a move, which would consolidate Germany's anti-inflation strategy, might lead to large selling of weaker ERM currencies, including the pound and the lira. Mr Jochimsen's remarks were contained in the advance text of a speech he made yesterday in Dusseldorf. Later in the day, he excised the passage from his talk. This allowed the Bundesbank to issue a statement denying that it was seeking a realignment. Mr Jochimsen's comments fitted in with the views of a growing number of international economists that the recent strains in financial markets and on currencies might make a realignment inevitable. Such a move would revalue upwards strong ERM currencies and depress the value of weak ones. Yesterday's slight weakening of the D-Mark against the dollar eased anxieties about the immediate prospect of strains within the ERM pushing up interest rates across Europe. The dollar closed in London up some  3/4 pfennig at DM1.4065. Against sterling, it was nearly half a cent firmer at Dollars 1.9870. In New York it finished at DM1.4067 and Dollars 1.9845, while early today it was quoted at DM1.40825 and Dollars 1.98335 shortly after Japanese markets opened. The faltering signs of dollar strength led to steadier trading on most European bourses. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 4.0 at 2,285.0, helped by a firmer tone on Wall Street, which finished 14.59 higher at 3,246.81. The rate for three-month money in the sterling cash market eased slightly, indicating slightly reduced expectations of an imminent rise in bank base rates, now at 10 per cent. Dealers, however, continued to price in an increase of at least  3/4 point. The more settled market conditions led to a reasonably smooth auction by the Bank of England of Pounds 2.5bn of long-dated gilts. The offer was 1.2 times subscribed. Gilts, however, closed about  1/2 a point lower in volatile trading. Nervousness about sterling's longer-term prospects was heightened by another opinion poll in France indicating a narrow margin favouring a 'No' vote in next month's Maastricht referendum.

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Simon Engineering About the only piece of encouraging news amid the red ink is that Simon Engineering has finally stopped leaking cash. A cash outflow of Pounds 80m over the last 18 months - more but for recent asset sales - cannot be blamed on poor markets alone. The shame is that it took a breach of banking covenants and a change of management to bring about effective action. While additional cash might be squeezed by reducing working capital, the sheer scale of indebtedness now demands further disposals. The promised refinancing agreement contains a timetable for repayment, leaving the banks with the whip hand. Shedding surplus property and loss-making subsidiaries is unlikely to suffice. The recovery potential of what is left will not be clear until that process is complete.</p>

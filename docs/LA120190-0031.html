			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : PICARDO RELIES ON 'WONDER YEARS'  </P> <P> At a time when 85% of Screen Actors Guild members are unemployed, Robert  Picardo at least has something better than a day job to fall back on. ABC this  week put "China Beach" on hiatus -- that's networkese for "all but canceled" --  so Picardo's Vietnam Army surgeon Dick Richard is now on semi-permanent  R&amp;R.  </P> <P> But Picardo is still working in prime time as gym coach Ed Cutlip on "The  Wonder Years." And this summer he racked up credits in two hit films, providing  the voice and likeness for the robotic cab driver in "Total Recall" and  appearing in the flesh in "Gremlins 2: The New Batch."  </P> <P> Not bad for someone who initially aspired to be a doctor -- until Leonard  Bernstein, whom Picardo met while appearing in a Yale student production of the  composer's "Mass," provided some influential career counseling.  </P> <P> "I'd always done acting strictly for fun," Picardo, 36, says. "Bernstein  encouraged me to go into performing, which gave me the courage to give up my  pre-med career." He went on to leading Broadway roles in "Gemini" and  "Tribute," television work including a recurring role on "Alice," and  appearances in such films as "The Howling" and "Innerspace."  </P> <P> The Philadelphia native's current TV bonanza came about when Coach Cutlip, a  guest shot he did before being cast in "China Beach," proved popular enough to  become a recurring role, an opportunity he accepted with the blessings of  "China Beach's" executive producers.  </P> <P> Having sometimes gone from the set of the sweetly nostalgic "Wonder Years" to  the intensely dramatic "China Beach" in the same day, the actor says that the  hardest aspect of switching roles is that "it taxes your listening. The coach  doesn't listen to anyone, whereas on 'China Beach,' the camera often focuses  not on who's talking, but on who's hearing."  </P> <P> "The season before last, I was simultaneously shooting a 'Wonder Years' episode  where I was hit on the head by a basketball, (for which he was Emmy-nominated)  and the heaviest 'China Beach' episode, where my character's wife sent him  notice she's divorcing him. I'd work on the 'China Beach' script in a little  room, spilling my guts, and then have to go walking around with 12-year-olds  bouncing basketballs off my head. I was struck by the absurdity of it."LIBBY  SLATE  </P></p>

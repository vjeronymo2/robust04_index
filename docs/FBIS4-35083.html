			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Chiapas  State government pledged today that in the next 24 hours, it  will begin to evict peasants and Indians from 462 properties,  which they have occupied in this southeastern state, authorities  have reported.    Interior Secretary General Rodolfo Ulloa announced that this  was a pledge made to cattlemen and ranch owners, who, last  Friday, began demonstrations in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state  capital. The pledge supercedes the request made to the Mexican  Army to intervene and clear the properties, Ulloa Flores stated,  referring to the occupation of lands in the Chiapas conflict  zone since 1 January.    The state government turned down the request to investigate  the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC)  for the occupations "because it felt this action should be  conducted through a direct request by the persons affected", he  noted. The official added that the response to a list of  demands submitted by cattlemen and ranch owners includes the  continuation of negotiations in "appropriate" cases involving  farms that were taken over before 14 April. The negotiations,  he said, involve sales, relocations, or evictions from lands  occupied before 14 April, which is when the government,  cattlemen, ranch owners, and CEOIC, signed an agreement banning  occupations as of that date.    Evictions will occur if relocation agreements are not  reached  with squatters on properties that were occupied before that date  and have not been put up for sale. He explained that these  operations will conclude on 31 August.    Ulloa Flores said that on Monday, the payment of  compensatory  rent was agreed upon to cover damages caused between the date of  the occupation and the date of the eviction or sale of the  property. The official said the Chiapas Attorney General's  Office was also instructed to review prior investigations of  evictions, damages, thefts, and cattle rustling, and to hand out  indictments. The secretary general added that the Chiapas  government's response requests banking institutions to pay  special attention to the owners of occupied lands.    Last Friday, approximately 4,000 cattlemen and small-scale  ranch owners began demonstrating outside the local town hall to  demand a solution to the invasion of some 500 properties in the  conflict zone and to overdue debts.    The conflict began on 1 January when the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN) took over towns to press Indian demands  and fought the Mexican Army for 11 days in clashes that left 150  people dead. In late February and early March, the EZLN held a  nine-day meeting with Manuel Camacho Solis, the then  commissioner for peace and reconcilation in Chiapas, and on 12  June, reiterated its willingness to seek a peaceful solution to  the conflict. The police have carried out evictions from dozens  of properties this year in operations resulting in at least 100  arrests.</p>

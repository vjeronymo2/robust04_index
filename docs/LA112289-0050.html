			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LT. GOV. MCCARTHY URGES END TO SALVADOR AID  </P> <P> As the civil war in El Salvador took a dramatic twist Tuesday, opponents of the  Central American nation's government stepped up their activity in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, during a news conference with actor Ed Asner and a  coalition of labor leaders and clergy, called for a boycott of Salvadoran  coffee and a suspension of all U.S. aid to the country.  </P> <P> "We should use California's power in the House and Senate to end the  million-dollar-a-day military aid to the government of El Salvador," McCarthy  said. "The time has passed when we should allow American guns to murder  innocents."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at a spirited rally in front of the Salvadoran Consulate in  Westlake, about 200 protesters sang chants in Spanish linking the Salvadoran  government to the killing of six Jesuit priests last week.  </P> <P> The demonstrators also set up a symbolic "people's consulate" to protest what  they called the "inaction and apathy" of the Salvadoran consul general in Los  Angeles. The consul general, Jose Mauricio Angulo, a member of the ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance, has made statements denying government  involvement in the murders of the priests.  </P> <P> "We want to denounce the consul for trying to maintain this campaign of  disinformation," said Sara Martinez of the Coordinator of Salvadoran  Committees, which organized the protest.  </P> <P> Martinez said that many of the 350,000 Salvadorans living in Los Angeles -- the  largest Salvadoran community outside El Salvador -- have lost contact with  their relatives in their homeland since the fighting intensified last week. She  was critical of the consulate for failing to provide information to local  residents about their missing relatives.  </P> <P> "We are suffering, like them, the bombings and the assassinations," Martinez  said.  </P> <P> For his part, Angulo attacked the demonstrators, most of whom were Salvadorans,  as "very unpatriotic people, most of them brainwashed. . . . They've been here  too long. They don't know the reality of El Salvador any more."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles protest was peaceful. But at a San Francisco demonstration,  involving about 300 rowdy protesters, police officers made about 140 arrests  and escorted government workers into the Federal Building.  </P> <P> The demonstration at the Los Angeles consulate was only the latest in at least  a dozen similar protests held throughout the Southland since the rebel  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front began its offensive in San Salvador  last week.  </P></p>

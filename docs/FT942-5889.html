			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Granada eyes Yorkshire TV: Pre-tax profits rise 51% to Pounds 103m - Acquisitions weigh in with Pounds 27m Granada Group has identified Yorkshire-Tyne Tees as its next television target if, as seems likely, the government decides on a further liberalisation of the rules on television ownership. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of the broadcasting, leisure, rental and business services group, yesterday identified Yorkshire as a possible acquisition target. His comments accompanied the group's announcement of a 51 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 103m. Such a move would create a greater northern television empire, plus London Weekend Television - acquired for about Pounds 760m early this year. The government is looking into the whole issue of cross-media ownership and plans to report before the autumn. Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada chairman, said yesterday that all the group's principle businesses had recorded improved profits in the 26 weeks to April 2. Some Pounds 11.8m of the growth in profit before interest was organic, while Pounds 27.1m came from acquisitions, mainly Sutcliffe Catering and Spring Grove Services. LWT, included for just one month, made a Pounds 4.7m contribution to pre-tax profits. Mr Robinson said he had been 'rather confused' by City rumours that the integration of LWT was going badly. 'In fact it is one of the easiest integrations we have been involved with.' Twenty people have already gone at LWT and the Granada chief executive said there would be further announcements in five or six weeks. Some expect around 100 jobs to go. Turnover totalled Pounds 941.4m, compared with Pounds 640m in the same period last year. Earnings per share rose from 9.8p to 13.8p and the interim dividend goes up by 10 per cent to 3.33p. Granada's share price rose 10p to close at 501p yesterday. Sutcliffe's revenues grew 10 per cent during the period and margins improved substantially, helped by improved purchasing clout. Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at Smith New Court, yesterday increased his full-year pre-tax profit forecast from Pounds 245m to Pounds 256m. 'We kept looking for the catch but we couldn't find it,' he said. Ms Katherine Pelly, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, raised her forecast to Pounds 252m. UK rental profits grew 5 per cent to Pounds 52.4m, computer services rose 10 per cent to Pounds 4.4m, television, including LWT, was up 64 per cent at Pounds 34.8m and leisure grew 38 per cent to Pounds 11.7m. Mr Robinson, who said he was now seeing clear evidence of regular sustained growth, added that over the past 18 months the company had become better balanced and had developed 'a group of highly cash generative companies operating in strong, predictable markets'.

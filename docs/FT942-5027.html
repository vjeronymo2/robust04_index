			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 3: The target is Europe - Profile / MD Foods MD Foods, the large Danish dairy co-operative, is delivering milk to British doorsteps as part of a move to stretch its reach abroad. Through its corporate arm, MD Foods International, the co-op has bought into the UK market in advance of the coming liberalisation of milk production. Mr Finn Christiansen, executive director of MD Foods, explains its international ambitions: 'We'd invested very heavily in the rationalisation of the Danish dairy industry at the end of the 1980s and had got to the point where growth was stagnating.' Recognising the need to expand abroad, the co-op thought it could not ask its 10,600 farmers to put up the cash. 'Emotionally, it's very difficult to get farmers to understand that we would be going to other countries and processing other producers' milk.' Four years ago, the co-op set up MD Foods International in which it owns a 52 per cent share, with the rest of the capital supplied by institutional investors. The Danish Dairy Federation, which represents dairy companies, contributed some overseas assets and the Danish Dairy Suppliers, a co-op which provides equipment to the industry, put up DKr100m (Pounds 10.3m). Mr Christiansen stresses that MD Foods has targeted Europe as an area of primary interest since the company believes it will face restrictions on exports of dairy products to third countries as a result of the Gatt settlement. In 1990, the company began its acquisition route into the UK and it is also looking at moving into Germany. The export trade is vital to Danish dairy farmers, who produce three times their domestic requirements. The UK, restricted by EU milk quotas to output covering only 85 per cent of its milk needs, is seen as an extremely important prize by overseas suppliers. MD has spent Pounds 150m in the UK in the past four years, gaining a 10 per cent share of the UK milk market. 'The liberalisation of the market will present good opportunities for us to work closely with farmers. That comes naturally to us as that's what we do in Denmark,' Mr Christiansen explains. The opening up of the Pounds 3bn UK milk market will leave dairies to buy their supplies directly from farmers if they wish. MD Foods controls 81 per cent of the milk output in Denmark - 70 per cent directly and the rest in co-operation with Klover, another dairy group. Milk production in Denmark has traditionally been quite fragmented with the average producer owning just 40 cows, but growing cost pressures are forcing dairy farmers to expand. Last year, the number of milk producers fell from 17,200 to 15,000 with the remaining farmers increasing in size. This is a trend that is likely to continue. Mr Christiansen believes the whole of the EU dairy market is becoming more competitive as a result of the Gatt settlement. In the run-up to the implementation of the Gatt deal next July, dairies are positioning themselves on the European market and buying market share at almost any price. In April, MD secured an additional DKr50m to its annual investment budget of DKr500m specifically to invest in facilities for making products aimed at the EU market. The extra funds will probably be spent on producing mozzarella and other cheeses for the German market. The big impact of the Gatt deal could come on the cheese market, Mr Christiansen believes. Cuts must be made in subsidised exports of cheese to countries outside the EU - this will involve reducing subsidised exports to 305,000 tonnes by the year 2000. At the same time, the EU must give access to its internal market to third countries. Mr Christiansen reckons the combination of these two measures will mean the EU market must absorb an additional 280,000 tonnes of cheese by 2000. 'Prices are already being squeezed as people are trying to position themselves in the market in anticipation of the export cuts,' he says. MD Foods is also looking to increase its position in the European market for higher-value products as a way of securing market share under the rigours of Gatt. Mr Christiansen is keen to build on the success of its Lurpak butter brand in the UK and, since the butter market is declining, substitute cheese and dairy products. A new cheese spread, which was launched in the UK last year, has not taken off because Mr Christiansen acknowledges that it was placed wrongly in the market and is too expensive. 'We need to do more research into the type of products that will fit well into the UK,' he says. Its new Gaio yoghurt will be introduced in the UK later this year in the hope that it will enjoy the levels of demand found in Denmark. Since last October, Gaio has captured a 15 per cent share of the Danish yoghurt market - MD Foods had to cancel television advertisements several weeks after the launch as the company did not have enough production capacity to satisfy demand. Gaio is based on a recipe found in a remote part of the Ukraine where villagers traditionally live to extremely old ages. MD Foods is not allowed to make any health claims for its product, but it has captured the imagination of many consumers. Eventually, MD Foods hopes to sell products such as these outside the EU, particularly in the growing Asian market, but it is a slow process. Mr Christiansen says he has been developing the Japanese market for 35 years to which MD Foods sends mozzarella and cream cheese. Asia accounts for 9 per cent of MD's export sales. 'Gradually, the Japanese are eating more pizza and cheesecake, but they still consume very small amounts of dairy products compared with the west,' he said. The European dairy industry is concerned that some of these markets could be jeopardised by the cuts in subsidised exports required by Gatt. For this reason, the Danish Dairy Federation has suggested to the European Commission that some farmers could produce a little extra milk at world prices. This proposal is still in its very early stages and no final decisions have been made, but it would get round the problem of maintaining export markets. 'If we don't find a way to produce more without subsidy, we will see that in six years at the end of the current Gatt deal, we will have lost a big part of the world market,' says Mr Christiansen. Some 55 per cent of MD Foods' export sales come from outside the EU. Mr Christiansen is hoping that he can hold onto this in spite of Gatt.</p>

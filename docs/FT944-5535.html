			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Chechens threaten Russian nuclear plants Chechen leaders yesterday threatened widespread terrorism in Russia, including attacks on nuclear power stations, if Russian troops massing on the border invaded their breakaway state. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has so far held back from his threat to intervene. The deadline of his ultimatum to declare an emergency situation in the rebel Caucasian republic ran out on Thursday. Mr Russif Shamsuddin, the Chechen foreign minister, said: 'Our interests would be nuclear power stations, in attacking them. Why not? We would do it if attacked, believe me.' The Russian government appears to be taking the threat of Chechen terrorism very seriously. Security outside government buildings and railway stations in Moscow has been noticeably tightened since the crisis escalated. Mr Yeltsin said on Tuesday he would crack down hard unless the Chechen government and opposition forces stopped fighting and freed Russian prisoners within 48 hours. But the threats have petered out in a welter of contradictory statements from senior officials including Mr Yeltsin himself. The first sign he might be rethinking his strategy came on Thursday when a senior presidential source told Itar-Tass news agency that the Kremlin leader would not sign a decree imposing a state of emergency on Chechnya in the very near future. The suspicions seemed to be confirmed when, in a bizarre move, Mr Yeltsin's original ultimatum to the two warring sides was reissued without the key phrase about introducing a state of emergency. In Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, a delegation of Russian parliamentary deputies, who are trying to negotiate the release of Russian soldiers captured during battles last weekend, were humiliated by General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, by being kept waiting all day while a succession of supporters were ushered into his presence. But after meeting the president the deputies said they were optimistic that some of the 21 captured Russian soldiers would be freed. 'In principle the authorities have no objections. I think they will be freed eventually,' Mr Anatoly Shabad said. However, Mr Shamsuddin claimed: 'We will never give back the Russian prisoners, never.' No bombing raids of the kind which have been a feature of the past three days and which have destroyed the military and civil airports at Grozny were made yesterday. According to Reuters, at least nine people have been killed in air strikes on Grozny although a lower figure of seven deaths was given by the Interfax news agency. The Russian delegation, led by Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the Duma defence committee, and composed of deputies who disapprove of the threatened use of force against Chechnya, appealed to Mr Yeltsin to halt the air strikes. 'Please do anything possible to stop the bombing of Grozny. If this happens again while we are here then what happens next?' they said in an appeal after meeting Gen Dudayev. Mr Shabad said there was little doubt the aeroplanes were Russian and said the Kremlin had sent in Russian troops to support the opposition. Man in the News, Page 6</p>

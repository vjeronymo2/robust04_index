Jing Shuping, chairman of the federation, said that China's  reforms have entered the stage of "storming the fortified  positions" as the central government have instituted a series of  major reform measures in banking, taxation and other key  economic fields since the beginning of this year.    His federation, a non-governmental organization and a  chamber  of commerce mainly linking with private and other non-public  economic sectors, will do its best to facilitate the reforms, he  said.    He noted the herculean task for the taxation reform. For  instance, though the private sector handed over 29.3 billion  yuan taxes to the state in 1993, tax evasion was serious because  of poor taxation awareness among the self-employees and private  businesses.    Jing said that the federation and its subordinates  throughout  China will organize publicity of the new tax law among persons  engaged in non-public sectors.    The federation will also encourage private businesses to  absorb more surplus laborers and help enterprises solve problems  in social security, labor protection and welfare so as to  maintain social stability, he said.    Jing pledged that the federation will help its members to  upgrade product quality, improve service, expand exports and  participate in more international economic activities.    The federation will bring into full play its role of  political consultation and democratic supervision, participate  in the anti-corruption drive and help persons in the non-public  sectors abide by law and make contributions to the establishment  of a socialist market economy.</p>

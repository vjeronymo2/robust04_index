			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 7 (CTK) -- Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus met today former Prime Minister of the Serbo-Montenegrin  Yugoslavia Milan Panic who is consulting his concept of the  post-war economic reconstruction of former Yugoslavia on his  trip to some European states and the United States.    Asked whether he contemplates a come-back to high politics,  Panic replied he still considered himself a politician. He  added that the countries of former Yugoslavia needed a new  generation of young ambitious politicians.    Panic said he was, indeed, acquainted with the affair  regarding his alleged letter to former Slovak Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar in which he had allegedly refused Meciar's offer  for weapons to former Yugoslavia. He stressed that he had not  written the letter, and that the speculations of this sort were  absurd.    Panic's visit includes meetings with Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec and Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy.</p>

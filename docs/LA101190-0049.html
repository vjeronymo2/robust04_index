			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY GOES AFTER CONVENTION, FOR BETTER OR WORSE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: SAN DIEGO IS APPARENTLY THE NO. 1 CONTENDER TO HOST REPUBLICAN  DELEGATES IN THE SUMMER OF 1992.  </P> <P> The lure is the 1992 Republican Convention -- which critics say won't help  tourism, comes at the wrong time and is too expensive for a city that has no  money.  </P> <P> The city is San Diego -- which today is wooing the GOP by escorting delegates  from the Republican National Committee to such sites as the zoo, Sea World and  San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Almost everyone involved says San Diego is the No. 1 contender for the event.  </P> <P> "It's hardly a done deal," said Paul Downey, the spokesman for Mayor Maureen  O'Connor, "but we feel very confident."  </P> <P> "The convention would be of incredible value to the city," said Downey, whose  boss, despite being a Democrat, wrote a letter to President Bush in September  that catapulted the city into the elite of leading contenders.  </P> <P> Political insiders say San Diego's chances are greatly aided by White House  official Sig Rogich, who is assistant to the president for public events and  initiatives. Rogich, a former Las Vegas ad executive, is reported to be San  Diego's biggest backer and a confidante of the president.  </P> <P> Downey and other boosters estimate the economic impact as between $50 million  and $100 million. The convention would follow on the heels of the America's  Cup, the promoters of which say may bring in as much as $900 million.  </P> <P> And, Downey and others say it's no problem that the sailing regatta, the  baseball All-Star Game and two major arts festivals are already scheduled for  that summer.  </P> <P> "With the country facing a recession, San Diego needs to do everything it can  to make itself recession-proof," he said. "That's the mayor's goal, and it's a  happy problem to have too many events than too few."  </P> <P> But while some herald the convention as one more sign of the coming of age of  America's sixth-largest city, others say it's further evidence of San Diego  wanting to be bigger than it is.  </P> <P> Critics cite the city's recent struggle with a $60-million budget deficit until  a series of controversial cuts were finally made. O'Connor has said not a penny  of public money will go toward the GOP, although millions are being offered by  rival contenders Cleveland, Houston, New Orleans and St. Petersburg, Fla.  </P> <P> Gordon Clanton, a sociologist and political analyst at San Diego State  University, said, "So who pays the additional expense, such as police and fire  protection? To say such events benefit the community as a whole is really a  bogus notion.  </P> <P> "We've heard it in connection with the America's Cup, the baseball All-Star  Game, the Super Bowl and now this. Usually, these events benefit a handful of  people but are always sold differently.  </P> <P> "Part of the problem is, San Diego has an inferiority complex. It wants to be  perceived as just as important as every other big city, but is it, really? It  has to do with the gap of being the sixth-largest city in the country as  opposed to the 17th-largest metropolitan area and the 26th major media market.  The gap is a constant measure of the city's insecurity."  </P> <P> Officials for the new San Diego Convention Center said earlier that playing  host to the Republicans would complicate scheduling for events are already  booked for the summer of '92.  </P> <P> Tom Liegler, the center's general manager, said Wednesday that while it would  be "a privilege" to host the convention, many unanswered questions remain. He  wants to know the exact window of time the GOP would want -- some say as much  as six weeks, which means a number of existing bookings would have to be  cleared. And, of course, there's always the question of who will pay.  </P> <P> "I'm told that both the Democrats and Republicans usually want host cities to  pick up anywhere between $8 million and $10 million," Liegler said. "So, the  question is, if no public money is being used, who would pay for that?"  </P> <P> Republican sources say private money is the most likely source. As Liegler  said, the city must be a top contender, because the GOP "seems to be pursuing  us more than we're pursuing them."  </P> <P> The head of the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Assn. said Wednesday that his  group now "strongly favors" the convention and is backing it "every step of the  way."  </P> <P> Reint Reinders, the president of the group, said the city maintains about  40,000 hotel rooms but needs only 17,000 on the convention's "peak nights."  </P> <P> "True, August (the month the convention is scheduled) is a terrifically busy  time for us, so some tourists would have to stay away, because conventioneers  would be filling their rooms," Reinders said.  </P> <P> Asked to assess the convention's pros and cons, Reinders said, "I don't think  it would ever be a bad thing. It's a good thing because of the tremendous  publicity it creates. It would take place on prime-time TV throughout the  country, with an August sunset, the Convention Center and the bay serving as  the backdrop to George Bush's renomination. Why, you can't buy that kind of  exposure. I think it's wonderful. It could be an incredible spectacle."  </P> <P> Bill Wilson, the manager of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, said that he had  been approached by city and GOP officials, who may want the use of his facility  for as much as two nights, if not the entire convention.  </P> <P> Liegler said he had been told that the GOP would stage all of its events at  either the Convention Center or the stadium or alternate between both sites. He  said those are among the questions to be decided later in the week by city and  GOP officials.  </P> <P> Wilson said he was first asked for a "six-week window" of time in the summer of  '92, and he laughed, telling them it would be impossible. The stadium is home  to baseball's Padres and football's Chargers, both of which use the stadium  during August.  </P> <P> As it is, Wilson said he can provide a two-week window to ready the stadium for  what Reinders calls "the spectacle," but no more than that.  </P> <P> The America's Cup sailing regatta finishes its finals in San Diego in May of  that year, just two months before the Major League All-Star Game and three  months before the convention. But Tom Ehman, head of the America's Cup  Organizing Committee, said the convention would pose "no direct conflict" with  his event.  </P> <P> "In terms of planning, the convention is a massive undertaking," Ehman said.  "And there are only so many volunteers in a community such as this willing to  help out with an America's Cup or a convention. It's a double-edged sword,  really. You may have a lot of people burned out and not wanting to help with a  big convention. But on the other hand, a lot of people may be up and running  and ready to go, more skilled at helping out with the convention than they  would have been before."  </P> <P> Ehman said he had been contacted by various unnamed officials, wanting to know  if the America's Cup media center, the site of which has yet to be determined,  could be maintained and used for the convention. Ehman said yes.  </P> <P> Downey says that as many as 16,000 media representatives may come to the city  for the GOP political convention, and the publicity is something San Diego  can't pass up.  </P> <P> Analyst Clanton speculates that the Democrats -- of whom he is one -- are  making a serious mistake by looking toward New York for their '92 convention,  while the Republicans are cleverly eyeing an upbeat, relatively healthy Sun  Belt city.  </P> <P> As Downey said, San Diego is "an important swing city in a swing state" with  the largest number of electoral votes.  </P> <P> Much of the attractiveness is economic. If recession is a full-blown reality by  the summer of '92, San Diego is not expected to fare as badly as the rest of  the country, and that may lure Republicans.  </P> <P> "It could be a case of the rest of the country having the flu and us just  having a cold," Ehman said.  </P> <P> Sociologist Clanton said the so-called spectacle factor may be the No. 1 reason  San Diego is so attractive to the GOP, at a time when other cities are courting  the party much more seriously and with much fatter pocketbooks.  </P> <P> "Despite our mayor, who, at best is a nominal Democrat, what other city in the  country is more Republican than San Diego?" Clanton said. "We have, for the  most part, a Republican (City) Council and Republicans running nearly  everything else.  </P> <P> "In the eyes of the nation, San Diego looks incredibly conservative. The  perception is, it's all white, all blue eyes, all Republicans, all Navy, and  what could be better for the GOP -- especially with war and a major recession  looming as possibilities?"  </P></p>

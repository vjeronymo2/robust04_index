			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Havas in Canal Plus share link CANAL PLUS, one of France's most dynamic television companies, faces an uncertain future following reports that Havas, the media group which is already its largest shareholder, plans to raise its stake in an elaborate share swap deal. According to the Figaro newspaper, Havas plans to add the 20.4 per cent stake in Canal Plus now owned by the Compagnie Generale des Eaux industrial group to its present 23.5 per cent holding. CGE would in return become the largest shareholder in Havas by raising its holding to 20 per cent. Meanwhile, Societe Generale, the banking group which is a long-standing corporate ally of CGE, would exchange its 5.1 per cent stake in Canal Plus for shares in Havas, where it already holds an 8.1 per cent stake. Havas declined to comment. Canal Plus said that there was 'nothing to be said at present'. Havas would have to wait for changes in French broadcasting legislation to raise its stake in Canal Plus above the present maximum of 25 per cent. The French parliament is expected this autumn to start debating a series of broadcasting reforms.</p>

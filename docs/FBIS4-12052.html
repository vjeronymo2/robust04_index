			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that the  implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians will be  very quick and will require only a few days. Mr. Rabin said  this during today's cabinet session.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 4 April, in a  report by Udi Segal on the cabinet session, adds the following:  "Prime Minister Rabin said it will take a miracle to complete  the negotiations by the middle of this month. Rabin said there  are only six or seven negotiating days until 12 or 13 April --  the no-longer sacred date -- due to Holocaust Day [7 April].  Rabin also denied press reports on 14 April as an alternative  option."]    Also in the session, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said  that  Yasir 'Arafat played a constructive role in the contacts  involved in resuming the Gaza-Jericho negotiations. Security  elements told the minister that 'Arafat's status in the  territories is shaky. The government was also told that several  mayors in the territories who had been deposed now want to  resume office, like newly reappointed Hebron mayor Mustafa  al-Natshah. Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said that 90 percent  of nationalistic motivated murders of Israelis over the last  year were perpetrated by Gaza Strip youths.</p>

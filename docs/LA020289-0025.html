			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: SOVIET DEALS  </P> <P> Mission to Moscow: Robert Wussler, senior executive vice president for Turner  Broadcasting System, is in Moscow to work on plans to get CNN's signal into  Russian homes. One scenario would distribute CNN on a VHF frequency in exchange  for a fee from the government, a distribution method that has been used in the  past (during summits, for example). Another deal in the works is to distribute  CNN on a Russian satellite. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

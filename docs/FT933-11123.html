			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea output forecast to recover after 1992 setback INDIAN TEA production is likely to be close to the 1991 level this year after 1992's heavy decline, according to J. Thomas &amp; Company's annual tea review. The world's largest producer suffered a major setback of 37.8m kg last year to 703.9m kg, but the broking house believes the 1993 crop will reach 740m kg. In the five months to May the crop totalled 182m kg, up 30m kg compared with the corresponding period last year. J. Thomas suggests that tea estates in south India 'may struggle' to reach the 1991 record of 185m but says production gains in north India, including Assam, should be 'remarkable'. The consensus in tea circles is that the world tea production in 1993 is set to return to the 1991 level of 2,546m kg with improved performances by the main producers - India, Sri Lanka and Kenya. The Indian federal government has fixed a tea export target of 210m kg, worth about Rs12bn (Pounds 260m), for 1993, but J. Thomas says 'it will be a significant achievement if we can achieve an export figure of around 200m kg'. The broker's estimate appears to be more realistic as India's tea exports declined last year by nearly 30m kg to 173m kg because of reduced purchases by the CIS, which took only 50.3m kg, compared with 104.5m kg in 1991. The report warns that CIS demand has yet to 'settle into a definite pattern' and that India will do well not to place too much reliance on it. In view of its present problems the CIS is expected to restrict its buying to the cheaper categories of tea. Demand for Indian tea in hard currency areas will be influenced by two principal factors, J. Thomas says. The continued ability of Indian teas to remain competitive and 'the extent of swing in the Indian production ratio in favour of CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea over orthodox tea.' Gardens in north India have been particularly successful in switching to production of CTC tea, the type favoured in the UK. Iran, which last year bought more than 21m kg of Indian tea is expected remain a good market, especially with the private companies there back in business. According to the report, traditional buyers like the UK, Egypt, Poland, Germany and Japan should absorb larger quantities of Indian tea. Exporters should also be able to make inroads into the Pakistani market, which imports more than 100m kg of tea, mainly from Kenya, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Last year India managed to sell only 1.55m kg to Pakistan. South Africa is another country that is believed to offer good potential for Indian tea sales. Tea prices, which have remained strong so far, will henceforward be influenced by the 'availability of tea' in the remaining heavy cropping months up to October, J. Thomas says.</p>

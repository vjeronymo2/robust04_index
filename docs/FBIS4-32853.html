			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 27 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Relations between  Panama and the United States will not be affected by the  incident yesterday in which a U.S. soldier was wounded by  Panamanian police, who fired on the U.S. soldier's vehicle for  allegedly driving with his lights off and not heeding a police  order to stop, an official source said today.    National Police (PN) Director Oswaldo Fernandez declared  that  the incident in which U.S. Sergeant Maurice Neal was wounded in  the shoulder by a Panamanian policeman does not have "any effect  on U.S. relations." In this regard, Fernandez added U.S.  Southern Command authorities and Panamanian PN exchanged reports  on the case, adding it is "indeed true" Neal evaded and ran  through a Panamanian police checkpoint.    Regarding whether the reaction of the police to fire on Neal  is justified, Fernandez said that "it is too early to tell,  because we must first verify the situation and hear the account  of events from the PN Office of Professional Responsibility,"  which is investigating the case.    The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command maintains  approximately 10,000 soldiers in installations along the length  of the 80-km interoceanic Canal. U.S. troops must abandon these  installations totally by 31 December 1999, as stipulated by the  Canal Treaties signed by the two countries in 1977.</p>

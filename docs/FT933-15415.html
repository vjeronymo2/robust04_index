			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Fake Ferrari trade uncovered in raids by Italian police COUNTERFEIT trade in brand names is no longer limited to Gucci bags and Cartier watches. Italian police have uncovered fake Ferraris - sports cars so expertly manufactured that enthusiasts in four countries bought them as the real thing. Raids on three workshops near Modena and Cremona, the heartland of the genuine article, turned up 10 counterfeit cars either finished or being built. One was a copy of a 1954 Testarossa 250 model - an original of which can fetch close to Pounds 1m. 'They are extremely good copies right down to the chassis work, numbering and interior finish', a Modena policeman said. 'Often there is a only a millimetre of difference in the size and parts. Only by looking closely at the metals used was it possible to tell the difference from a genuine Ferrari.' The operation was run by two ex-Ferrari mechanics who had access to original designs. They concentrated on prestige models of the 1950s and '60s. Two Swiss citizens are wanted for questioning about their alleged role in selling the cars. Ferrari alerted the police to its suspicions of a sophisticated counterfeit operation after it received repeated requests for parts to rebuild a car which happened to have an unexplained number of accidents. Modena police say the business began legitimately, rebuilding damaged Ferraris. But when the price for period Ferraris rose rapidly, the car-builders decided to cater to this market. Fakes were sold to collectors in Japan, Switzerland, the UK and US. Police are tracing how many copies have been put on the market: 'It could be a good 40 but we don't know - each one worth several hundred million lire.' Ferrari said yesterday it was awaiting developments to see if it should take legal action to prevent its cars being copied. Mr Robert Brooks, head of the international auction house of the same name, said: 'The replica lark has been going on for some years. But usually . . . whether they are Ferraris, Jaguars or whatever, they are known to be replicas and priced accordingly at about one-tenth the value of an original.' So far, the original purchasers of the fakes would appear to have made no attempt to pass them on. Mr Brooks said it was unlikely they would have slipped through the verification net.</p>

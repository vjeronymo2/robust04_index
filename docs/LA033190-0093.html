			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> HEARING POSTPONED IN IMPOSTOR CASE  </P> <P> Prosecutors won a delay in Ventura Superior Court Friday in the case of David  Michael Murray, the alleged impostor who enrolled for four weeks at an Ojai  high school as 17-year-old Shi Stone. Murray is accused of violating parole  from a 1980 car theft conviction.  </P> <P> Despite an objection from Murray's defense attorney, Superior Court Judge  Lawrence Storch postponed for two weeks a preliminary hearing on the parole  violation charges. Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacey A. Ratner said she needed a  continuance until she received documents from Texas proving Murray's identity.  </P> <P> "Two weeks is all you get. No further continuations," Storch told Ratner.  </P> <P> A week ago, a Ventura Municipal judge dismissed three fraud charges against  Murray for crimes he was accused of committing while enrolled at Nordhoff High  School.  </P> <P> Murray contends that he is in fact Shi Stone, a victim of mistaken identity. He  refuses to cooperate with the court-appointed public defender, but two judges  have denied four motions made by Murray since his March 1 arrest to represent  himself.  </P> <P> Court documents show that Murray stopped reporting to his parole officer in  December, 1981, and subsequently was arrested in Texas in 1982.  </P> <P> Ratner said she expected more fraud charges to be filed against Murray as a  result of a string of scams that police alleged he committed in the city of  Ventura last January.

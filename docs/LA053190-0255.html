			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD CUP REFEREES TO ENFORCE NEW GUIDELINES ON ROUGH PLAY  </P> <P> Referees are in as much danger of getting a red card at the World Cup finals as  the players, under FIFA's tough new guidelines to stamp out rough play.  </P> <P> International Football Federation President Joao Havelange said today that a  referee who failed to send off players for violent offenses would immediately  be sent home himself.  </P> <P> The tournament's 36 referees also face stringent physical fitness tests June 4  and those who fail will be thrown out of the World Cup, he added.  </P> <P> "If we finish the tournament with no referees left, I will blow the whistle at  the final myself," he said with a smile.  </P> <P> "Seriously, I don't think we will have a problem. If some referees who come  expecting to officiate at two matches, do four instead, then why not?"  </P> <P> Havelange, backing the most determined attempt ever made by FIFA to clean up  soccer, said referees could seriously damage the game by failing to interpret  the laws correctly.  </P> <P> "We are going to be severe with our referees this time," he said in an apparent  reference to widespread criticism of the low standard of refereeing at the 1986  World Cup finals in Mexico.  </P> <P> "People go to the World Cup to see good matches. The referees are the ones who  can stop rough play," Havelange added.  </P> <P> FIFA held an unprecedented course in March for World Cup referees. They want  tough action from the men in black and a consistent interpretation of the  rules.  </P> <P> Under FIFA's guidelines, players who tackle from behind or use  "disproportionate or unnecessary strength" when committing a foul must be  instantly ejected, as must those who assault or insult a referee.  </P></p>

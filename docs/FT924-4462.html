			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Letter: Higher taxes are not a vote loser Sir, In 'Lonely ride into sunset' (November 27), Joe Rogaly claims that proposals to raise income tax to finance improvements to welfare benefits are a 'proven vote-loser'. This is not so. Despite the serious misrepresentation in the Tory tabloids, Labour and the Liberal Democrats received a clear majority of the votes cast - 53 per cent - for precisely this proposition at the last general election. These voting intentions were not translated into a parliamentary majority because the opposition parties are split. Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system therefore produced a minority Tory government with only 43 per cent of the vote. It is a complete misreading of the election result to claim that parties of the left and centre-left should abandon the case for higher direct taxation of the wealthy. Mr Rogaly also quotes from Professor Galbraith's recent lecture in London. But he curiously omits any reference to Galbraith's declaration that Labour must not abandon its commitment to income re-distribution: 'A firm stand for a more equitable sharing of income must be strongly a part of our platform.' I would, however, agree with Joe Rogaly that tax policies should, in future, also cover environmental protection and road financing. However, these new taxes should be in addition to, and not a substitute for, a much more progressive income tax on the higher paid. James Dickens, 64 Woodbastwick Road, Sydenham, London SE26 5LH</p>

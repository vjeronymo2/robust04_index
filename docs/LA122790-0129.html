			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE'S PRESTON TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR CAL  </P> <P> Todd Preston of Westlake High, who began the 1990 season as a relatively  unheralded college quarterback prospect, has orally committed to attend  California in the fall.  </P> <P> Preston, the Marmonte League's most valuable offensive player as a junior and  senior, said Wednesday that he will sign a letter of intent with Cal on Feb. 6,  the first day of the next signing period for high school seniors.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-3, 180-pound Preston, who completed 166 of 285 passes for 2,427  yards and 21 touchdowns in leading Westlake to an 8-2-1 record, took a  recruiting trip to Cal last weekend and to the University of the Pacific a week  earlier before commiting to the Pacific 10 Conference school on Christmas Day.  </P> <P> "I went (to Cal) thinking I wanted to go there, and everything I saw convinced  me that it was the place for me," said Preston, an All-Southern Section  Division II selection.  </P> <P> "I liked the coaches, I liked the players, and I liked the campus. It's also a  good academic school, and that was a big plus."  </P> <P> Preston became the Westlake starter in the second game of his sophomore season  after splitting time with senior Chris Edwards in a season-opening 17-14 loss  to Buena. During his career, he completed 391 of 785 passes for 5,608 yards and  46 touchdowns. He threw 43 interceptions.  </P> <P> He ranks second on the all-time Ventura County career passing yardage list  behind Tim Gutierrez, who threw for 7,272 yards for Santa Clara from 1987-89.  </P> <P> Preston said he also was heavily recruited by Pac-10 schools Oregon,  Washington, Washington State and USC.  </P> <P> "I kind of wanted to play for a Pac-10 school, but that's not the only reason I  went to Cal, and not Pacific," Preston said. "I just really felt comfortable up  there. There are a lot of guys on the team who went to high school down here,  so we've got something in common."  </P></p>

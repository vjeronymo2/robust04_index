			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that there may be a misconception that permitting authorities allow facilities to run the same conditions over and over again without making any changes. The Agency would like to remove any confusion over its policy regarding performance of additional trial burns when a test condition fails. It is important first to recognize that a facility spends a considerable amount of time and resources on the trial burn, and intends to pass the first time. An informal poll of EPA Regions showed that only a dozen additional trial burns for incinerators have occurred to date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, EPA has clarified, in its Guidance on Trial Burn Failures (June 1994), the circumstances under which facilities would be allowed to run additional trial burns. According to this guidance, facilities may submit a request to conduct an additional trial burn to the Director. As part of this request, the facility should demonstrate that it has investigated the reasons for the failure and describe planned substantive changes to its process. A facility should not be allowed to retest under the same design and operating conditions at which it failed. The facility should demonstrate in a revised trial burn plan that the changes to its design and/or operations are sufficient to prevent failure from reoccurring. The Director reviews, and either approves or denies, the request. The Director should not approve an additional trial burn unless the facility has demonstrated satisfactorily that the changes proposed in the revised trial burn plan are likely to meet the performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the trial burn guidance, existing EPA policy allows for facilities to conduct additional trial burns. Current regulations, on the other hand, do not specifically address permitting procedures for interim status combustion facilities for the limited number of situations when facilities would request additional burns. Today's proposed rule establishes procedures for these situations and builds upon EPA's current policy by incorporating the circumstances described in guidance into proposed regulatory language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;270.74(c)(7), interim status combustion facilities may request an additional trial burn. According to the proposed section, the facility's request for an additional trial burn must contain an explanation of the reasons for the previous trial burn failure, as well as a revised trial burn plan that has substantive changes to address the reasons for the previous failure. EPA encourages facilities that pursue this option to fulfill the above requirement by expanding the preliminary explanation that they are required to provide in order to continue operating during the post-trial burn period (as discussed in the previous section). The Agency believes that these provisions, along with the requirement that the permitting agency approve trial burn plans before the facility conducts the burn, will help ensure that facilities conduct trial burns properly and the public is informed throughout the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it is important to inform the public when the permitting authority anticipates an additional trial burn. Thus, in proposed &sect;270.74(c)(7), the rule will require the Director to inform the people on the mailing list and appropriate units of State and local government once he or she has reviewed the revised trial burn plan and has tentatively decided to approve it. This notice will provide the public with an opportunity to review the revised plan, and see the rationale for the additional burn. EPA wants the public to be aware of the reasons why the facility believes the additional run will be successful. The Director's decision to approve a revised trial burn plan is not subject to administrative appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Denial of permit application after the trial burn.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There may be occasions when a combustion facility cannot demonstrate compliance with the performance standards through the trial burn, or has not demonstrated to the Director that an additional burn is likely to address the causes of the previous failure. In the case of permitted facilities, the Director may choose to terminate the permit. Existing regulations in &sect;270.43 provide the Director with the authority to terminate a permit for cause, following procedures set forth in part 124.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would like to provide similarly clear authority to the Director in the case of interim status combustion facilities. Existing regulations in &sect;270.29 provide the Director with authority to deny a permit application, pursuant to procedures in part 124. In order to clarify the applicability of this provision to trial burn failure situations, EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(8), to provide specific authority for the Director to deny a permit, pursuant to procedures in part 124, for an interim status combustion facility, based on the facility's inability to demonstrate compliance with the performance standards. It is not EPA's intent, in providing this authority, to imply that the Director would deny a permit automatically if the facility failed any of the trial burn plan conditions. Every facility, permitted and interim status alike, will have the option of requesting and proving that it can meet the requirements for an additional burn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In keeping with EPA's goal of involving the public at key points in the permit process, EPA would like to reiterate that the current procedures for permit denial, set forth in part 124, include requirements for the permitting authority to notify to the public of intent to deny the permit application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

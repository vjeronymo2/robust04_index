			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell gains 53.6% of Arnotts with AMP stake CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, last night claimed victory over Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, after its hostile takeover offer was accepted by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution. AMP said it had sold a 6.3 per cent stake in Arnotts, reducing its stake to 2.2 per cent. This reversed AMP's earlier decision to reject Campbell's ADollars 9.50-a-share offer, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 870m). The society's change of heart increases Campbell's stake in Arnotts to 53.6 per cent, comfortably in excess of the group's target of 50.1 per cent. Further acceptances are expected before the bid closes today. However, Campbell will be prevented from taking control of Arnotts by a shareholding agreement which prevents the US group from appointing a majority of board members unless it acquires 85.1 per cent of the shares. The agreement was drawn up when Campbell took a friendly 33 per cent stake in Arnotts in 1985 as part of the company's defence against a hostile bid by Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings. Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, said the group would encourage Arnotts to expand its presence in the growing Asian biscuit market, which it claims the Australian company has neglected. Mr Johnson, who was born in Australia, said AMP's change of mind was 'wise and responsible'. He said it would serve the national interest by assisting Arnotts to grow. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said he was 'disappointed' by the AMP's decision, but claimed it was 'out of the question' Campbell would gain control of the board. The AMP move was criticised by family shareholders, who have campaigned strongly against Campbell's offer on the grounds that it would transfer control of important Australian consumer products to foreign owners. Ms Alice Oppen, chairman of a shareholder lobby group and a descendant of one of Arnotts' founders, said Campbell must have offered 'inducements' to AMP to change its decision. She said family shareholders, who account for more than 20 per cent of the stock, would try to ensure that Campbell was unable to achieve control of the board. Mr Leigh Hall, AMP's investment manager, said the society had accepted the offer because it believed that the bid would not be increased or extended. AMP was 'sympathetic' to calls for Arnotts to remain Australian-owned. But he said 'Arnotts is now more than one-half foreign-owned and. . . Campbell will in any event have a considerable input into its operation. 'Given this position, AMP considers that the size of the minority Australian element is no longer a relevant issue.' Arnotts shares closed 1 cent lower at ADollars 9.51.</p>

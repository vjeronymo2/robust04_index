			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Old image still hangs heavy on slimmer Sears - Laurie Morse reports on the transformation of the troubled US retail group This week's decision by Sears, Roebuck, the US department store group, to spin off its Allstate insurance subsidiary to shareholders not only takes the company back to its retailing roots, but completes a reorganisation that ranks among the biggest in US corporate history. The revamping was initiated in 1992 by Mr Edward Brennan, chairman and chief executive. In the two years since, the company has divested its Dean Witter securities arm, its Discover credit card operations, its mortgage banking business and its real estate group. Earlier this week, the company even announced that it was giving up ownership of the Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's tallest building. The reorganisation will also see the departure of Mr Brennan himself. Now 60, he said he would retire after the Allstate spin-off has been completed next year. He will hand over the slimmed-down Sears to Mr Arthur Martinez, the 55-year-old former Saks Fifth Avenue executive brought in two years ago to revitalise the ailing store operations. The dismemberment of Sears may have been drastic, but for shareholders it could not have come soon enough. Mr Brennan's predecessor, Mr Edward Telling, had dreamed of transforming Sears by turning it into a 'socks and stocks' operation that sold financial services alongside hosiery, but the idea never really caught on. Although the financial service businesses performed well, the retail operations began to sag: by the time Mr Brennan took over in 1986, shareholders were demanding a break-up. When Mr Martinez becomes chairman next year, he will inherit a company with 740 department and specialty stores, a small property development company called Homart, and part ownership in Prodigy, an on-line computer service. The difficulty he faces is simple: the shopper of the 1990s is less than impressed when offered the services of a 1950s-style department store. In the 1970s, Sears was the world's biggest retailer. Today, it still has loyal customers for its power tools, lawnmowers and washing machines. However, distracted by its adventures in financial services and left behind by changes in retailing, it has slipped into third place behind Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart, the huge US discount store groups. When Mr Martinez was made chief of Sears's merchandising group, he wielded the knife early and often. He dropped the loss-making catalogue operations on which the Sears empire had been founded; he closed 113 unprofitable stores; he reorganised an unwieldly and dated buying organisation; and he axed nearly 50,000 jobs. He then embarked on a five-year, Dollars 4bn repositioning programme aimed at refurbishing stores, boosting sales of high-margin clothing and accessory lines, and creating a more glamorous image. The results have begun to show. After recording net losses of Dollars 3.9bn in 1992 - a year in which profits were hit by a Dollars 3.1bn restructuring charge and insurance losses from Hurricane Andrew - Sears made record net profits of Dollars 2.4bn last year. The merchandising group has had seven consecutive profitable quarters, posting Dollars 890m in nine-month operating income this year, up 37 per cent from last year's Dollars 632m. Growth in same-store sales outperformed the industry average last year and has continued to do so this year, albeit by a narrower margin. Last month, sales were 7 per cent higher than in October 1993 - itself a strong month. However, Sears has a long way to go. Even with Mr Martinez's direction, industry analysts say it lacks the strategy to turn a dowdy retailer into a trend-setter. Despite drastic cost-cutting and the advantage that most of its stores are debt-free, its profitability lags its competition. In the third quarter, its costs, at 26.3 cents per dollar of sales, were 20 per cent higher than other mid-price department stores. To narrow the cost gap, Sears will make more use of its floorspace, adding the equivalent of about 100 new stores over the next two years by converting administrative offices in its existing properties into sales floors. Cost-cutting will add value to the department store, but the second part of Mr Martinez's plan - to recapture the market for high-margin women's clothing - has not yet produced the required result. Observing that Sears had once been successful because it offered an array of dependable products to middle America when there were few shopping choices, Mr Phil Johnson, president of Leo Shapiro and Associates, a Chicago-based retail consulting firm says: 'From a consumer perspective, nobody needs Sears any more. High-quality products are available everywhere, and wealthy shoppers are mobile. They don't need everything in one place any more.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Alejandro Bolanos Davis] </F>   [Text] Many of us have wondered, and still others continue  to wonder, why Dona Violeta cannot get Humberto Ortega out of  the Army. If she is president of the Republic, why is it  impossible for her to remove him from office?    There are certainly many different answers to this question.  I will give an answer that is based on the political  Constitution that was tailor-made to suit the Sandinists' needs.    According to Article 144 of the Sandinists' political  Constitution, the president of the Republic is the "commander in  chief of the Defense and Security Forces of the Nation," but  nowhere in the Constitution is there any other reference to  these Defense and Security Forces of the Nation (FDSN).  Therefore, the president of the Republic is the commander in  chief of a nonexistent military force.    What does exist is the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), but  the  Constitution itself does not recognize it as the "Defense and  Security Force of the Nation." Article 95 of the Constitution  states:    "The Sandinist People's Army is a national force and shall  protect, respect, and obey this political Constitution.    "The Sandinist People's Army is the military arm of the  people and the direct heir of the National Sovereignty Defense  Army. The government plans, organizes, and directs the people's  participation in the armed defense of the fatherland through the  Sandinist People's Army. No armed bodies other than those  established by law shall exist in national territory, and the  law shall regulate the organization of military forces."    The above makes it clear that:    1) The president of the Republic is the commander in chief  of a nonexistent army, not of the EPS.    2) The EPS, the army of the Sandinists' party, is not the  national army of Nicaragua, but it is a "national force" because  it replaces the Defense and Security Forces of the Nation.    3) Only the EPS, the army of the Sandinists' political  party, is allowed to exist in Nicaragua, and it is a national  force because it has replaced the FDSN.    4) The EPS derives its power directly from the Army of  Sandino, and arrogates to itself the exclusive power to organize  the people's participation.    5) The EPS is independent of civilian power, in that it is  not under the orders of the executive branch.    In short, the Sandinist political Constitution states that  Dona Violeta cannot remove Humberto Ortega from office because  she has no power over the commander of the EPS.    Antonio Lacayo, who devised and signed the famous Transition  Protocol with Humberto Ortega, committing Dona Violeta's  government to honoring the structure of the EPS and the  Sandinist Constitution, complicated this situation even further.    In one paragraph, the Transition Protocol states: "Respect  for the integrity and professionalism of the EPS and the forces  of public order, as well as their ranks, personnel registries,  and commands, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws  of the Republic, is also the fundamental basis for the orderly  transfer of government."    It is rumored that Humberto Ortega will retire from the EPS  soon, but for reasons of political and economic convenience that  have nothing to do with the executive branch. Before retiring,  Ortega will make sure his successor is loyal to him and no one  else, so that the EPS will continue to be an integral part of  the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], a "national  force."    Hence the urgent need for a constituent assembly to draft a  new political constitution, with new deputies elected by the  people, rather than partial amendments to the Constitution by  the current Congress, with a majority of deputies favoring  Sandinism. We will never free the country from the grip of the  Sandinist military by merely amending the Constitution.</p>

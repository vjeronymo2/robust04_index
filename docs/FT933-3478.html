			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Unionists present Major with 'new Ulster proposals' THE DEMOCRATIC Unionist Party in Northern Ireland has approached Mr John Major, the prime minister, with what it claims are new proposals on the province. A document called 'Breaking the Logjam', was sent to Downing Street yesterday with a request from Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, for a meeting with the prime minister. The move has effectively bypassed the Northern Ireland Office, which has been working for the past 10 months to get the main political parties in the province back around the negotiating table. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, brushed aside this latest snub. He said in Londonderry yesterday: 'I am concerned only to secure what the vast majority of everyday people in Northern Ireland want, namely to see the politicians talking. I am very interested to see whatever proposals any party leader may have.' The DUP has remained silent on the specifics of its new proposals, but it is thought they flesh out ideas on the DUP's favourite theme - the devolution of power to the province. Mr Peter Robinson, the deputy leader of the DUP, said yesterday: 'These proposals are an alternative to a process which has failed in the past and which is bound to fail if it is tried again.' He added: 'We do not believe that the process will produce a way forward.' Last Friday Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, met in London and reaffirmed their commitment to restarting the 'round-table' talks. These came to a halt last November, without agreement, and the DUP has since insisted that the Irish Republic must drop its territorial claim to Northern Ireland before talks can restart. The DUP has since set down a further pre-condition - that Mr John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, must end his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. Mr Hume said that his bilateral talks with Mr Adams, which started last April, were aimed at bringing about 'a total cessation of all violence' in Northern Ireland. At the weekend Mr Hume said he was also willing to meet with leaders of the Loyalist paramilitary organisations, following statements attributed last week to a leader of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association in a Belfast newspaper. The statements advocated political talks 'with everything on the table' provided the IRA ended its military campaign.</p>

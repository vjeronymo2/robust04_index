			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Ireland and Brussels clash on aid THE Irish government and the European Commission yesterday clashed over regional aid, in what officials on both sides fear could be a widening row spreading into next week's EC summit in Brussels. Dublin fears it will not now get the IPounds 7.8bn (Pounds 7.5bn) in structural aid it believes it was promised after marathon negotiations in Brussels in July, during which Ireland threatened to veto the EC's Ecu157bn (Pounds 122bn) regional aid programme for 1994-1999. Irish officials say Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is going back on the pledge he gave to Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, in the early hours of July 20 when Dublin lifted its veto. Mr Delors responded angrily yesterday, telling RTE, Irish Television: 'I always have the custom of fulfilling my promises; this is a lie.' The Commission meets in special session this morning to decide on a proposal from Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy, which would give Ireland only around Irish IPounds 7.2bn. A decision was delayed at yesterday's weekly meeting of the EC executive, when Ireland's commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn, invoked a rarely used internal Commission regulation to demand a postponement. Mr Flynn said yesterday that the lower payment was 'not in accordance with the agreement between Ireland and the Commission'. In the interim, the Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, has had several telephone conversations with Mr Delors, and Dublin was last night considering sending a high-level delegation to Brussels. One Irish source described the dispute as 'the biggest political row in 20 years of (Irish) membership of the Community' and forecast an 'untidy' EC summit next week. Ireland's share of the 1994-99 structural aid budget comes from the Ecu96.3bn devoted to backward regions of the Community, whose per capita income is below 75 per cent of the EC average. The four poorest, or 'cohesion' countries - Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece - will get Ecu70bn of this, plus an additional Ecu15.5bn from the so-called Cohesion Fund, devoted to helping them catch up with the Community's environment and transport infrastructure standards. In the three long rounds of ministerial horse-trading in July, however, the Commission pledged Ecu2bn more to so-called Objective 1 member states than it has to give, senior Brussels officials confirmed yesterday. As well as Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Italy are unhappy with their allocations, while Germany and the UK, the EC's main paymasters, are certain to insist the regional aid ceiling agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit is not exceeded. Under the 1989-93 structural aid budget, sparsely populated Ireland received between two and two-and-a-half times more funding per head than its three 'cohesion' partners. One senior Commission official said that even on the lowest figures now cited, Ireland is still 'measurably in front of the other three.' Mr Delors said, however, that what the Commission was discussing today was a 'minimum, indicative number', which could rise later. The government of Mr Reynolds, however, now finds itself in a political bind, having written IPounds 8bn in EC funding into its IPounds 20bn national development plan for the next five years. Mr Millan remarked yesterday: 'I daresay when you're talking about money, lots of people get disappointed.'</p>

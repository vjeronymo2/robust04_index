			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Scroggs moves quickly to centre stage MR CEDRIC SCROGGS was a little-known player at Fisons before he moved to centre stage last month as chief executive of the pharmaceuticals, horticultural and scientific instruments group. Since then, the former chairman of the scientific instruments division has demonstrated considerable energy. Now he must convince doubters he can help the company recover. Fisons' troubles date from 1990 when US Food and Drug Administration officials became concerned about manufacturing procedures for two products. The next year they asked Fisons to withdraw both drugs. Neither are back on the market. Fisons admits the affair has already cost the group Pounds 65m, equivalent to a quarter of last year's profits. Over the past 28 days Mr Scroggs has arranged meetings with FDA officials and adopted and implemented a strategic review to deal with earlier criticisms. 'We've been dogged by these compliance issues. But they are the entry fee required to remain in the business,' he said. 'We've taken steps to get back into the market fast.' Mr Scroggs hopes the FDA will quickly allow one of the withdrawn drugs, the hay-fever treatment Opticrom, back into the US where it had sales of about Dollars 40m. Fisons' management has yet to decide whether the investment required to resubmit Imferon, a blood product, is worthwhile. Meanwhile, Mr Scroggs believes the key to success is concentration. He has already said he wants to sell the generic, non-patented products operations. Yesterday he announced plans to concentrate further on core operations by divesting the horticultural and consumer health businesses. 'We were simply too diversified for a group of our size,' he said. Fisons' consumer health business was a minnow, Mr Scroggs said. Although it had good brands, turnover last year was only Pounds 83m. Acquisitions costing hundreds of millions of pounds would be required for the operations to gain critical mass. Similarly, the horticultural division had good businesses that were well managed. But it did not have the scale required to survive even within the context of the EC, he said. Mr Scroggs defended the decision to make the announcement without having buyers lined up. He said: 'With multiple negotiations going on it would have been impossible to keep them under wraps. That would have damaged morale inside the organisation and led to rumours in the City.' Meanwhile, the policy of concentration will also be implemented within the pharmaceuticals division. Mr Scroggs said Fisons' expertise would be centred on anti-inflammatory medicines and drugs for the central nervous system. Fisons' rigorously independent line to develop and market drugs created by its research department has also been abandoned. 'We mustn't splinter our resources,' he said. Fisons would enter more co-marketing agreements to make up for its lack of marketing muscle outside the UK, he said. Last month it announced that Temmler, a subsidiary of Asta Medica, would market its Tilade asthma drug in Germany. Mr Scroggs' strategy looks sound. He must now implement it. But some analysts doubt Mr Scroggs, with no background in pharmaceuticals, is the right man to spend the money. The pace of change at Fisons has been impressive. The question is whether the company will accelerate in the right direction.</p>

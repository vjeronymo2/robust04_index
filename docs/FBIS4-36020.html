			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, and his brother, Colonel  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 September revolution in  Libya, have spoken on the telephone.    During the conversation, the two leaders discussed current  developments in our country in light of the crimes committed  against the homeland by the rebellious gang within the  leadership of the Socialist Party, by igniting war between the  sons of the Yemeni homeland and al-Bid's secessionist  declaration.    Brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi reiterated the support  of the Libyan leadership, people, and government for Yemeni  unity. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council  expressed appreciation for the principled position of Colonel  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and the Libyan Arab people in support of  their brothers in Yemen, as well as their concern about Yemeni  unity as a national and pan-Arab gain for the entire Arab nation.</p>

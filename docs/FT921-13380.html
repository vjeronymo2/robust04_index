			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Jobs: Optimistic in spite of worst year on record - Sign that recovery in UK demand for executives is already under way backstage 'WHEN I am dead and opened, you shall find ' Calais ' lying in my heart,' lamented Queen Mary Tudor over a slip-up in her foreign policy. And the Jobs column fully sympathises, having cause to feel in much the same way. In my case, however, the phrase the autopsy will show engraved inside the pericardium is 'July 1991' - the date when I ventured a rare prediction about movements in the United Kingdom's executive-jobs market. In doing so, I took exception to the forebodings of the MSL International consultancy's market-watchers that last year would end as the worst ever known for advertised demand, at least. A pox on such jeremiads, quoth I. For one thing, they failed to recognise that demand over the 12 months to June 30, although weak, had still been a good deal better than over the corresponding months of the recession of 1980-81. For another, there were various signs that the market would turn up in the later months of 1991. How far I went astray may be seen from the table alongside, compiled as always from MSL's quarterly counts of job-openings for managers and upper-ranked specialists advertised in leading UK journals. Each opening, by the way, is counted as one no matter how many times the ad for it appears. The upper part of the table gives the calendar-year tallies from 1987 to 1991 for eight broad types of higher-ranked work. The last of them is a catch-all 'others' category including such people as buyers, economists, company legal staff and assorted consultants. Then comes the annual total for all types of executives, followed by the quarterly counts making it up. What they reveal of course is that far from turning up in the later months of last year, the advertised demand went on falling. Moreover, while the table doesn't show it, both July-September and October-December 1991 produced the lowest quarterly counts I have on record, with the result that the year bore out MSL's forebodings. The total of 16,024 was 14.7 per cent down on the previous lowest for a calendar year: 18,795 in 1981. Which means that, for every 1,000 executive posts advertised a decade before, 1991 had only 853. The following list shows which sorts of work, and which quarters, account for the difference between those two figures. So the overall loss, worst in the sales area, hides gains in general management and 'others'. And the general decline accelerated sharply from quarter to quarter. That steepening of the drop is emphasised in the comparison because, whereas last year the advertised demand kept on falling, in 1991 the final months saw it starting the rebound that continued until late 1985. Which prompts the question - important not least to Britain's politicians - whether a similarly blessed upturn is likely before general election time. Well, despite the fate of my forecast in July, I suspect that the answer is yes. But my optimism is based less on the advertised market than on events in other branches of executive-recruitment. One is of course headhunting by the personal-approach methods of executive-search where, according to the InterMex consultancy's soundings, 1991 produced a 4 per cent rise in demand over 1990. Even so, I am not banking my hopes on search which, sensibly or otherwise, tends to be used to fill the top paid posts and so to concentrate on the relatively small market niche of general management. The optimism springs rather from another branch. It consists of recruiters who keep large databases of job-seekers in broad fields such as accounting and sales, and put employers in touch with suitable candidates on their register. While the database branch has been hit by the recession, it has suffered less badly than advertised recruitment, which is inevitably more costly. It seems that, with redundancies throwing large numbers of upper rankers onto the market, a good many employers have turned to the less expensive alternative in the belief that the registers will contain enough good candidates to meet their needs. In which case, it is reasonable to suppose any upturn from the latest depths will make its first appearance backstage, in the database branch. The good news is that one of its members, the Michael Page Group, reports that recovery is already evident in one field at least. It is sales and marketing, in which group director David Bodmer says Page has more job openings on its books than at any time since July 1990, and which historically has tended to be a lead indicator of movements in demand as a whole.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Work       1981    1991    Change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- R &amp; D       144      92      -52 Sales       205     117      -88 Pdctn       154     141      -13 Acctg       212     172      -40 Cmptg        64      54      -10 GM         39      52      +13 Pers         25      22       -3 Others      157     203      +46 Total     1,000     853     -147 J-M         248     244       -4 A-J         252     225      -27 J-S         235     193      -42 O-D         265     191      -74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

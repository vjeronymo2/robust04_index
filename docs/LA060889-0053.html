			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH OKS PLANS FOR BLUE MOON SALOON TO REBUILD  </P> <P> "The Moon shall rise again!" a jubilant co-owner of the Blue Moon Saloon said  Wednesday after the Redondo Beach City Council approved plans to rebuild the  waterfront restaurant destroyed in a violent storm in January, 1988.  </P> <P> Don Poryes, who started the popular restaurant in 1976 in the Redondo Beach  Marina, said he hopes to begin construction in late August or September and  open the restaurant's doors by spring.  </P> <P> "We've struggled and worked and now at last we can see it happening," said  Poryes, recalling months of delays in getting council approval to proceed. The  project still requires review by the California Coastal Commission, but Poryes  said he and his partners, Jim Quane and Pat Laureno, expect no problems in  getting approval from that agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hit By Storm  </P> <P> The Blue Moon was one of dozens of businesses that were hard hit by storm and  fire disasters in King Harbor last year. A joint effort by the city and private  interests has restored much of the area, and longer-term plans for further  improvements are in the works.  </P> <P> The reconstruction of the Portofino Inn and Reuben's Restaurant, which were  heavily damaged by ocean waves, is expected to be completed later this month.  </P> <P> Enthusiastic Blue Moon supporters, including former employees and patrons,  packed the council chambers Tuesday night for the last of three public hearings  that resulted in the council's decision to proceed.  </P> <P> "The Blue Moon served the best clam chowder this side of Boston . . . and we  want it back," said Sam Clark, president of the South Bay Boaters Assn. and one  of about a dozen speakers backing the plan. No one spoke against it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Snags  </P> <P> After winning Harbor Commission approval in early January, the Blue Moon  project hit the first of several snags. Charles G. Johnson, the marina's master  leaseholder, filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, alleging that the city had  failed to adequately protect the marina against sea storms.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, now in arbitration, raised city concerns about potential future  liability. Officials then made approval of the Blue Moon's building permit  contingent on an agreement that generally would hold the city blameless for  damage caused by natural disasters.  </P> <P> Other issues, including parking requirements, public access in the beach area  and landscaping were resolved to the council's satisfaction Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Poryes, the Blue Moon co-owner, said the new, larger restaurant will be built  on pilings five feet above the ground and 15 feet above the water level in the  harbor. He said it will retain the old restaurant's appearance and provide a  more efficient use of space.  </P></p>

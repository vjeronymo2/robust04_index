			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Li: "Investment Oversight Will Soon Be Toughened"] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou--A new regulation governing Guangzhou's  foreign funded firms is being reviewed by the city government  and is to be implemented as soon as it receives final approval.    Officials said that although Guangzhou has succeeded in  attracting overseas investment, it has filed to maintain proper  oversight of overseas-invested firms.    Over the past few months, more than 100 such enterprises in  Guangzhou that failed to meet their financial commitments have  been closed down.    Of $80 billion in investments called for in contracts, only  $29.5 billion has actually been provided.    Yan Guanghua, joint venture boss for the local trade  commission said the regulation and crackdown willing  overseas-funded firms into line and protect their interests.    "The majority of overseas-funded firms are following the  laws  and regulations, and their legal rights and interests are  protected by the government," Yan said.    Guangzhou has nearly 5,000 overseas-funded firms. Last year  their total industrial output was 30.2 billion yuan ($3.5  billion) and their exports were worth $1.4 billion. However,  Yan complained that some foreign partners are not honest when  doing business with Chinese in Guangzhou.    Some fail to meet their financial commitments or escape  abroad with bundles of money. Others intentionally quote higher  prices for imported equipment while deflating their export  prices.    The new regulation authorizes the withdrawal of licenses for  unfunded or suspended firms.    It also specifies that export products listed among foreign  country's anti-dumping items should be reported to the local  trade organization as soon as possible and be subject to  investigation.    In addition, workers are allowed to organize legitimate  labour associations, and firms should respond to that effect.    Finally, firms should not be managed on contractual terms  without government approval.</p>

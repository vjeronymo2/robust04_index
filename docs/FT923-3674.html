			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pinault sale raises FFr1bn PINAULT has strengthened its financial position by concluding a FFr1bn deal with Credit Lyonnais, opening the way for the investment bank to take a 20 per cent stake in the enlarged capital of the timber company which is being transformed into a retailer. 'This operation gives Financiere Pinault supplementary financial means so that it can pursue its development,' the company said. The French press reported yesterday that Pinault might be interested in buying the French arm of the Habitat furniture chain which is owned by the UK Storehouse group. Such an acquisition could make a good fit with Pinault's existing Conforama furniture chain. But both sides declined to comment on the reports. However, Ms Patricia Barbizet-Dussart, deputy managing director of Pinault, added that Pinault may use the additional funds to move into new areas away from retailing altogether. Another financial priority for Pinault, which recently took over the Au Printemps retail group, has been to drive down its high level of debt which rose to FFr15.5bn after clinching the controversial acquisition at the end of last year. Last month, Pinault succeeded in selling one of its original timber businesses, Isoroy, to the German Glunz group for an undisclosed sum and indicated that it was looking for other means of raising capital. Clinvest, the investment arm of Credit Lyonnais, will inject FFr1bn of new capital into Pinault's financial holding company, Financiere Pinault, in return for its 20 per cent stake. The holding company's other main shareholders are Mr Francois Pinault - the group's aggressively entrepreneurial founder - and his family. Clinvest already controls 7.55 per cent of the capital of Pinault and 7.42 per cent of its voting rights.</p>

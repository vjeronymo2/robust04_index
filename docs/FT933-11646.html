			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: US tyre sales help Goodyear to Dollars 137m profit GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber unveiled second-quarter profits yesterday of Dollars 137.6m, the second best result in the company's history. It was boosted by lower expenses, increased US tyre sales and improved earnings from its Brazil operations. In the same quarter a year ago, Goodyear earned Dollars 106.9m. The latest quarter included two exceptional items: a Dollars 14.6m charge to cover the early retirement of Dollars 290m in debt, and a gain of Dollars 7.9m from an asset sale. The strong second-quarter results suggest Goodyear has continued to gain market share against its main European and Japanese rivals, Michelin, Continental and Bridgestone/Firestone, despite a generally weak tyre market. Although Goodyear's total worldwide sales of Dollars 3bn in the second quarter were down slightly from Dollars 3.1bn in 1992, the company said sales were actually up 1.5 per cent if last year's contribution from the now-divested films and polyester resin businesses is excluded. Goodyear, the only surviving large US-owned tyre group, attributed its higher earnings to several factors, among them an improvement in margins in the US, higher margins in Brazil following price increases and production efficiencies and lower selling, administrative and general expenses (both in total dollars and as a percentage of sales). It also benefited from lower interest expense and tax rates. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said: 'Worldwide tyre unit sales were up 2.3 per cent in the quarter and 5.4 per cent in the half, led by gains in the US market.' The results had little impact on Goodyear's share price, primarily because the company warned the market of its improved performance late last month. Just before midday Goodyear shares were up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 43 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

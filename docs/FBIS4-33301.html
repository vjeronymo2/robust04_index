			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 3 Jun (EFE) -- Today Haiti's  constitutional prime minister, Robert Malval, said General Raoul  Cedras, who toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in  September 1991, has nothing to offer the country. According to  Malval, the only thing the coupist general can offer Haiti is a  succession of puppet governments lacking legal or constitutional  foundations.    "Cedras represents Duvalierism (in reference to the dictator  Jean Claude Duvalier). He is a good timer and a visionless  epicurean," Malval said on Radio Metropole. He said Cedras is  presently "cornered," adding that the Haitian military does not  understand the crisis in the country goes beyond a domestic  problem and is viewed by the Clinton administration as a U.S.  foreign policy problem. He added Clinton will soon make his  policy known to the coupist military. "Their power rests on  rusty bayonets," Malval said.    He said the "de facto" government has not taken anything  from  Aristide because "we never intended to control the state  apparatus." Malval remarked, "It cannot be said they have taken  from us something we never had."    Concerning his change of views regarding support of the  total  embargo imposed against Haiti, Malval said in September 1993  everyone in Haiti and the international community believed in  Cedras' good faith. He added the events that subsequently  unfolded proved "the general has no word." The Haitian prime  minister said, "Any negotiation with someone who does not  respect his own word is useless. The only solution is to be  firm."    He added Cedras "had in his hands all of the cards for  himself and the country to overcome the crisis, but he,  unfortunately, confused his ghosts with reality." Malval  concluded that Haiti is experiencing the most serious crisis in  its history since its independence in 1804.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux rises 5.4% in first six months Generale des Eaux, the French utilities and communications group, yesterday posted net profits of FFr1.26bn (Dollars 245m) for the first half of 1994, an increase of 5.4 per cent over the same period last year. The improvement was achieved on sales of FFr72.8bn, a rise of 2.9 per cent. The group said sales for the full year should rise by about 4 per cent above the FFr154bn recorded in 1993. Profits are expected to increase by a similar proportion. The strongest growth in sales during the first half came from foreign markets. Turnover outside France rose by 13.1 per cent to FFr20.8bn, reflecting strong demand for the company's core utilities activities. The company said that activity in the French property sector remained weak, claiming that 'the small number of new projects weighed heavily on turnover'. Losses at Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, the group's property division, prompted a fall of 23.8 per cent in operating profits to FFr1.8bn. Generale des Eaux said it continued to invest heavily in its telecommunications activities. These include its Cofira-SFR subsidiary, one of the two mobile telephone networks currently operating in France.</p>

Since the government decided to proceed actively with the  privatization of state-owned concerns to assure continued growth  and profitability, many foreign firms have been showing strong  interest in acquiring them.    A large Japanese construction firm recently offered a meaty  price for BES Engineering Corp., but was turned away when BES  declared the bidding closed to foreigners.    The Economics Ministry has targeted Taiwan Machinery  Manufacturing Corp., Chung Hsin Electric &amp; Machinery Mfg.  Corp.  and China Petrochemical Development Corp. for privatization  before the end of June. Following suit will be Taiwan  Fertilizer Co., Ltd., Taiwan Power Company, China Steel Corp.,  China Shipbuilding Corp., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and many others    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien said recently  that given the vital role many public enterprises play in the  public's daily life, his ministry will hold firm to its decision  that public enterprises be kept under the control of Taiwan  shareholders while they undergo privatization.    Sticking to this view is Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing  Corp., a government property that will soon go private. It has  included the 40 percent foreign ownership rule in its bid  instructions.    Additionally, a recently published petroleum law regarding  foreign investment in the local refining industry also orders  that foreigners cannot hold more than a 30 percent stake in  those businesses.</p>

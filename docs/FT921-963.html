			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Swing to left among Israeli immigrants AN ISRAELI opinion poll has shown a sharp swing against the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir among the country's new immigrants from the former Soviet Union, whose votes could have an important bearing on the outcome of the general election in June. Support for right-wing parties, including Mr Shamir's governing Likud Party and its erstwhile smaller right-wing coalition allies, has fallen to 27 per cent, against 35 per cent in January, according to the latest survey of political preferences among immigrants by the Jerusalem-based Tazpit Research Institute. Support for the left, the opposition Labour Party and its traditional allies, rose to 43 per cent from 30 per cent. The results contrast with the position in April 1991, when the same survey gave the right 46 per cent support, against just 21 per cent for the left. Some 29 per cent of newcomers polled expressed no preference. The survey did not take into account support for immigrant parties which intend to contest the election. Under Israel's proportional representation, system, the immigrant vote is likely to account for up to eight of the 120 seats in the finely-balanced Knesset. At the last election, Labour won 39 seats to Likud's 40. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, newly-elected Labour leader, is looking to the Russian vote to help him tip the balance against the government. The apparent swing to the opposition among immigrants is largely attributed to the fact that 40 per cent are jobless. Prime Minister Shamir said yesterday Israel's relations with the US were firm despite problems and misunderstandings, Reuter reports. US-Israeli relations have been buffeted by Washington's refusal to grant the Jewish state Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees unless it halts settlement of occupied Arab lands. In addition, a 15-member US team is in Israel this week investigating the possible unauthorised transfer of US arms by Israel to third parties.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) State Recordkeeping Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State shall keep a record of PWSs choosing to use Option 1 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply. If the State has authorized Option 1, PWSs would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the State within 30 days of reporting a sulfate MCL exceedence, of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its decision on whether to use Option 1 or other means of achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) State Reporting Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The quarterly report shall include all systems that have violated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sulfate MCL, and those which the State has authorized to use Option 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Variances and Exemptions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Option 4 offers relief to small systems in the form of an alternative to centralized treatment. If a system in violation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate MCL chooses centralized treatment but for some reason cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve compliance, the system would apply to the Primacy Agent for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance, and the conditions of the variance would be the same elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described for Option 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Variances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1415(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, EPA or a State with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primacy may grant variances from MCLs to those public water systems that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot comply with the MCLs because of characteristics of their water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources. At the time a variance is granted, the State must prescribe a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance schedule and may require the system to implement additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control measures. The SDWA requires that variances may only be granted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those systems that have installed BAT (as identified by EPA). However, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited situations a system may receive a variance if it demonstrates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the BAT would only achieve a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction in contamination (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;142.62(d)). Before EPA or a State issues a variance, it must find that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health (URTH). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, the URTH level would reflect acute and subchronic toxicity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-term exposures and high carcinogenic risks for long-term exposures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For sulfate EPA's guidance regarding what is an URTH level is set at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL because sulfate has an acute adverse health effect. For the sulfate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance, if the PWS provides public education/notification and Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water, EPA believes that the State should be able to conclude that the PWS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be considered to exceed an URTH because those actions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered protective of public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 1413(a)(4) of the Act, States with primacy that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to issue variances must do so under conditions and in a manner that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no less stringent than EPA allows under section 1415.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act permits EPA to vary the BAT established under section 1415  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that established under section 1412 based on a number of findings such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as system size, physical conditions related to engineering feasibility, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost of compliance. Paragraph 142.62 of this proposed rule lists the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAT that EPA has specified under section 1415 of the Act for the purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of issuing variances. The variance BAT is Alternative Water and public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education/notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1416(a), a State or EPA may grant an exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extending deadlines for compliance with a treatment technique or MCL if it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Due to compelling factors (which may include economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors), the PWS is unable to comply with the requirement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The exemption will not result in an URTH; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The system was in operation on the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPDWR, or, for a system not in operation on that date, that no reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative source of drinking water is available to the new system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining whether to grant an exemption, EPA expects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State to determine whether the facility could be consolidated with another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system or whether an alternative source could be developed. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelling factor is the affordability of the required treatments. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible that very small systems may not be able to consolidate or find a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-cost treatment. EPA's analysis of cost for the proposed sulfate rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shows that, for very small systems, the cost is lower to provide public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education/notification, and Alternative Water than to provide central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment. Thus, EPA believes this alternative BAT is affordable for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, granting exemptions under SDWA section 1416  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not appear to be a viable approach to providing relief from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate MCL for smaller systems. Unlike section 1415 for variances, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1416 does not authorize EPA to vary its designation of BAT for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Economic Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact on entitlements, grants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes a means of MCL compliance that is unique in its attempt to limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection only to the affected populations. As such, this action was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or recommendations will be documented in the public record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> titled the Regulatory Impact Analysis of Sulfate (August 30, 1994). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis used the following data, where available, for sulfate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

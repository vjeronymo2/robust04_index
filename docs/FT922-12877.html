			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Sweet scent of success in L'Oreal's figures - The French cosmetics company's 19.7% rise in profits Every L'Oreal executive is a 'professional worrier' according to Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, the chairman. This time last year he and his colleagues looked as though they had a lot to worry about. The world's largest cosmetics company not only faced the short-term pressures of the economic slowdown and the upheaval of the Gulf war, but the longer term threat of fierce competition from powerful companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Kao and Shiseido which were all expanding within cosmetics. Despite this L'Oreal has emerged unscathed. Yesterday it reported a 19.7 per cent increase in net profits for 1991 on sales which rose by 10.2 per cent. Mr Owen-Jones sees this achievement as a vindication of the aggressive strategy L'Oreal has pursued since he became chairman almost five years ago. Something of an anomaly in the French business world, at 46 he is much younger than most of his counterparts. And, as a Welshman, he is one of the very few foreigners to have broken into the nepotistic ranks of France's top industrialists. When he became chairman of L'Oreal, with its 80-year history, it was established as a bastion of French industry and as a powerful player in the global cosmetics market. It has since become markedly more aggressive through a combination of rigorous cost control - the number of employees has risen by 1 per cent during five years of average annual sales growth of 12 per cent - and increased investment in research and marketing. 'For the past five years we have had very tight cost control in all areas,' said Mr Owen-Jones. 'That has not only helped us to improve short-term profits but has enabled us to increase our long-term investment in research and advertising." Research has always been central to L'Oreal, which has historically devoted 3 per cent of sales - twice the cosmetics industry average  - to it. That proportion has risen under Mr Owen-Jones to reach 3.2 per cent last year. Mr Owen-Jones has also stepped up L'Oreal's investment in marketing to increase market share, thereby making the most of the economies of scale inherent in the capital intensive cosmetics industry. Tresor, the new Lancome fragrance, has been lavishly promoted since its launch two years ago and is now one of the world's top five perfumes. The pressure on L'Oreal's research and marketing budgets seems set to intensify in the future. The level of legislative intervention in the cosmetics industry is increasing. Moreover L'Oreal's new competitors, notably P&amp;G and Unilever, have historically been more aggressive in both research and marketing. Mr Owen-Jones claims the impact of P&amp;G and Unilever's expansion has been exaggerated. 'There is a well-entrenched myth that this industry has not been competitive in the past,' he said. 'There has always been strong competition. It is just that the names of the competitors have changed." But most observers are convinced that the level of competition in cosmetics is increasing thanks to the larger scale and professional management style of the new players. L'Oreal has been expanding - so far with mixed results. L'Oreal, which has no debt, is clearly in a position to make further acquisitions or investments, should suitable opportunities arise. In the meantime Mr Owen-Jones sees its biggest challenge as proving that 'being a big company does not mean you can not be innovative. This is an industry where things change very, very quickly. It is all about six people sitting around a table and saying 'Let's do it'.'</p>

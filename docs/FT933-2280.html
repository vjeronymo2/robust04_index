			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Birt hits out on BBC licence fee THE BBC has gone on the offensive to try to defend the value of its licence fee, which raises about Pounds 1.5bn a year. Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, speaking at the Cambridge Convention of the Royal Television Society at the weekend, called on the government to preserve the value of the licence fee and continue to link it with the retail prices index. The government is expected to decide in November on the level of the licence, currently Pounds 83, for the last three years of the BBC's present royal charter, which runs out at the end of 1996. 'I don't believe that the organisation can sensibly be pushed further,' said Mr Birt, who earlier told the convention that in addition to Pounds 100m savings this financial year, savings of Pounds 50m were planned for next year and Pounds 25m the year after. He added: 'The time will come - and it's not too far away - when major efficiency savings on the BBC are no longer possible. At that point preserving, let alone developing, our programme services will be at an end, unless there is a real increase in the licence fee.' Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said the corporation faced a poverty spiral, where the more they saved the more the government took from it. He said: 'As a citizen, and as a licence payer, and as a broadcaster I will go to the barricade for the BBC licence fee.' At the convention Mr Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent Television, re-opened the issue of changes in ownership in ITV - a possibility being considered by the government. He said that without relaxation of the rules that prevent any of the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over, British commercial television would be increasingly dominated by US, continental European and possibly Japanese companies. 'If we can't grow we can't compete,' Mr Hill said.</p>

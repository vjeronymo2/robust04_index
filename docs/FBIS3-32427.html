After congratulating Figueres on his election victory over  Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez in yesterday's  elections, the president noted that "we have a country with the  highest growth in Latin America" (6.5 percent last year), which  has reduced poverty from 23 to 17 percent and has brought the  fiscal deficit under control, according to official figures. "I  feel that the new president will bring his own ideas to the  government and will have his focus, but it is very unlikely that  the trend toward national unity will be broken," declared the  head of state, who will surrender power on 8 May.    According to Calderon, the fiscal deficit projected for this  year -- 1.5 percent of the GDP -- is five times less than that  for 1990, when he assumed office from social democrat Oscar  Arias, a fellow party member of Figueres. The president  explained he hopes to meet in the next few days with Figueres to  begin the transition process.    Calderon, 44, and Figueres, 39, are two of the youngest  presidents in Costa Rican history. They are both sons of two of  the most prominent leaders and former presidents the country has  had in this century, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia (1940-44) and  Jose Figueres (1948-49, 1953-58, and 1970-74). The two former  presidents were adversaries in a civil war in which the father  of the next president of Costa Rica came out victorious and  which marked the beginning of the model democracy this country  has today.</p>

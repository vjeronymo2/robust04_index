			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Billy Budd - Opera Opera North tackles this season its first Billy Budd. This difficult, dark-spirited, musically magnificent opera almost always brings out the best in the companies that take it on. Rarely, however, has it received a performance of such raw, angry power as Friday's at the Leeds Grand Theatre. The production, which comes from Scottish Opera, was first shown in Glasgow in 1987. Then, it was electrifying; now Graham Vick and his associate Paul Maloney, matched every inch of the way by the conductor Elgar Howarth and the Opera North orchestra and chorus, have rendered it still tauter, and exposed the themes of the Britten-Forster-Crozier collaboration to a still harsher theatrical light. Budd emerges here, as it did in Tim Albery's very different 1988 ENO staging, enriched and strengthened: its combination of grand opera, historical epic, domestic tragedy and male-voice symphony reverberates with startling new insights, new illuminations. Vick treats it as a study in vicious social repression of naval serfs by their overlords. The single set (a superb feat of design by Chris Dyer) is also a single dominating image - a ship seen in transverse section, layered in deck levels, pivoted on a central mast, and contained like a globe or crucible. The 'whole world' of Captian Vere's floating monarchy (or slave ship, which is what it is) is ceaselessly evoked in the action - and, with it, the hideous violence that runs through the drama like an open sore. Few opera performances have so fully caught a sense of community, while at the same time exposing it to such keen-eyed 'political' scrutiny: how horribly vivid yet truthful the depiction of sneaks, spies, bullies, betrayers, even Dansker's backing-away from Billy at the moment of discovering he is Claggart's marked man. The erotic subtexts of the opera are not disguised; neither are they forced into undue prominence. Vick's licence in presenting a dressing-gowned alter ego of the old captain, constantly haunting the action like an agonised conscience, encourages a constant - but again, never crudely underlined - consideration of the interaction between motive, impulse and consequence. If this encourages one to view the captain's epilogue with a touch of irony, that seems only fair. It is, after all, Vere's equivocal character that affords the opera its focal point. The cast is of superlative quality from top to bottom. On opening night Jason Howard's Billy was suffering a severe throat infection; he dealt with it expertly, and brought to the part a free physicality, a credible earthiness and volatility of temperament which I have not encountered before. Nigel Robson's Vere lacks tenor volume but not subtlety of utterance: he is a singing-actor of three-dimensional eloquence. John Tomlinson, principal revenant from the 1987 Scottish Opera cast, is the Claggart of our day, certainly the most strongly voiced and roundly drawn of my experience. This is one of Opera North's most impressive achievements - not smoothly palatable Festive Fare, perhaps, but wonderfully relentless in its grip. Grand Theatre, Leeds: in repertory until January 18, then on tour to Nottingham, Birminghan and Manchester.</p>

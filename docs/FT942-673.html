			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Airtours dismisses talk of price war Airtours, the UK's second largest holiday group, yesterday dismissed talk of a summer price war, saying demand was buoyant and would be 13 per cent up on last year. The group announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.6m for the six months to March 31, compared with Pounds 15.9m last time. The larger loss, in line with expectations, is the result of the increased size of the group, which acquired the Hogg Robinson travel agency chain and the Aspro tour operating company last year. Holiday companies traditionally incur first-half losses, as full payments for the peak summer season have not yet come in. Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the pattern of losses in the first half and profits in the second would not change substantially because of the group's entry into the ski market and its purchase of SAS Leisure from Scandinavian Airlines System in April. Nevertheless, he said the Scandinavian travel market, where SAS Leisure was the market leader, was less seasonal than the UK, with four winter passengers for every six summer holidaymakers. In the UK, the figure is two winter passengers for six in the summer. Mr Crossland said he did not believe tour operators would come under pressure to slash prices as the summer went on. He said there were about 2m summer holidays unsold in the UK market. Last year, 2.1m holidays were sold between the beginning of July and the end of the summer. Airtours' summer bookings were 41 per cent up on last year, of which 29.2 per cent resulted from the Aspro acquisition. The Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel retail chains, now integrated and renamed Going Places, saw market share rise to 13 per cent from 11.4 per cent. Mr Crossland said hotel rates in the Canary and Balearic islands had risen due to improved economic conditions in northern Europe. He said Airtours was protected from the shortage of hotel rooms on the islands by its ownership of the Bouganvilla Park hotel in Majorca. Turnover was up 60 per cent to Pounds 235m. The interim dividend is 1.1p, up 10 per cent on last time. There were losses per share of 14.52p, against 15.27p. Lex, Page 20</p>

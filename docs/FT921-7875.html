			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Czechs eager for farm land THOUSANDS OF Czechs are eager to acquire private farms or start companies processing agricultural produce, according to the farmers' daily Zemedelske Noviny, reports Reuter from Prague. 'People are interested in buying parts of state farms to be privatised,' the paper quoted Mr Karel Burda, head of the Czech regional agriculture ministry's privatisation department, as saying. 'They do not want to start an archaic smallholder farm, but rather modern agribusinesses with 150 to 500 hectares of land.' He said that last year the ministry received only 700 projects to privatise ineffective state farms. The number at present was more than 2,600.</p>

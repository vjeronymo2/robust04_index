			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: US investors trigger a disclosure revolution - More Latin American companies are responding to analysts' requests for information WHEN Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telephone company, makes its planned Dollars 500m offering of American Depositary Receipts later this year, it will join 34 Latin American companies listed on Wall Street. Five years ago there were none. The transformation is a clear illustration of the extent to which foreign investment is being encouraged to support companies' capital plans and plug the gaps left by Latin America's weak capital markets and low savings ratios. The phenomenon is most widespread in Mexico, where total foreign investment in the stock market is Dollars 27.5bn, of which more than half is in US-traded ADRs. While this is around a fifth of Mexico's stock market capitalisation, analysts believe foreign investment accounts for more than 50 per cent of the volume of the most widely traded shares. The result is that US investors, usually through purchases of ADRs, dictate events in the Mexican market. Stock markets in the US open before Mexico's, and the performance of the ADR of Telmex, the telephone monopoly, in New York often dominates Mexico's market. When Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) bought the Spanish cement companies Sanson and Valenciana last year, US investors rushed to sell, worried at the prospect of the Mexican company becoming 40 per cent Spanish in terms of sales. Mr Gustavo Caballero, Cemex finance director, says US analysts did not believe a Mexican company was capable of such a bold step. However, the dependence on foreign capital might improve the way some Latin American countries are run and analysed. Once controlled by just a few dominant shareholders, companies in the region often ignored minority investors. 'Latin American companies need a shake-up in the way they disclose information and what they say to the market,' says Mr Terence Mahony, of Baring America Asset Management. More companies are responding to US analysts' requests for information, and under US regulations face more stringent disclosure rules than they do at home. On a recent holiday in New York, the head of the Mexican company Interceramic visited investors to explain his strategy - a move that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Banamex (Mexico's largest bank), Bancomer (the second largest), Cemex and others have hired public relations firms in the US, and employ investor relations executives. Local brokers are changing their practices. In Brazil companies used to be valued according to price-to-book value. But with the growing presence of foreigners, price-to-earnings value analysis has become more prevalent. Similarly, Mexican brokers rarely made earnings forecasts, preferring historic earnings. Now almost all produce forecasts. Even governments are waking up to the international competition their stock markets face. Chile recently reduced from three years to one the minimum period that foreigners had to hold initial capital in a stock before selling. Mexico has unveiled a series of reforms, allowing international stocks to be listed in Mexico and bringing regulations closer to US levels. Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, hopes that the reforms will bring share trading activity back to Mexico. This would enable local brokers to earn commissions from trading in Mexican stocks, since more foreign investment would be made in the underlying stock market in Mexico and not in the ADRs.</p>

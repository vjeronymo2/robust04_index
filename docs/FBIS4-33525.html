			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para, 7 June (AFP) -- The 34 countries of  the OAS approved a resolution on Tuesday that leaves the door  open for a future armed intervention in Haiti.    The foreign ministers approved the resolution, the product  of  long hours of negotiations, within the framework of the General  Assembly that has met since Monday in Belem do Para, Brazil.  The matter that extended the private negotiations, according to  diplomats who participated, dealt with the insistence by some  countries that the new actions that are endorsed in a general  manner in the last paragraph of the preamble of the draft  resolution be limited to the "peaceful" area. In the final  version of the draft seen by the foreign ministers, this  limitation was left out of the text.    The above-mentioned paragraph takes into account "the  relevancy for the members to strengthen the necessary political  and diplomatic actions to bring about a lasting solution to the  Haitian crisis within the framework of the OAS Charter and  international law."    "It is a triumph for the United States because, although it  does not endorse or even mention an intervention, it does not  exclude it either," a diplomat who spoke on condition of  anonymity told AFP.</p>

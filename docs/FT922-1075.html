			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Mirror images Two points stand out from the Mirror Group Newspapers' figures. First, the basic business is in relatively good shape, having posted a 12 per cent increase in operating profit before exceptional items last year. Second, the company appears to have made a comprehensive effort to establish the extent of the damage incurred during the late Robert Maxwell's stewardship. That raises the question of what it is now worth, especially in the light of the expected relisting next month. By some yardsticks, the answer might be: not very much, if anything at all. The extraordinary losses of Pounds 422m are not far short of the company's entire market value of Pounds 501m at the time it was suspended. Remaining shareholders' funds of Pounds 436m are less than the Pounds 625m at which the newspaper titles are still carried in the balance sheet. But MGN's strength remains its cash generative capacity which is likely eventually to make it a bid target. One way of assessing its value is thus to look at what MGN might be worth to a potential buyer. The starting point is twice turnover, or some Pounds 920m. From that must be deducted debt of Pounds 420m, as well as the net future additional pension fund commitment, or some Pounds 135m. Allowing for some further deductions, mostly related to extraordinary contingencies, that gives a rough market worth of Pounds 300m or 75p a share. Whether the price will settle at this level when trading resumes is another matter. There is no dividend; there is some residual uncertainty over possible claims from Maxwell companies and financial institutions; and there is likely to be some distress selling by small investors when trading resumes. Last but not least, the calculation assumes a hefty bid premium in the short term. That may be premature as the administrator does not give much sign of being in a hurry to sell.</p>

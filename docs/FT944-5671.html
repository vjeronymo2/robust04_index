			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology: Music on the cards NEC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday announced that it had developed a portable music player that reproduces sound from data stored on a credit-card sized semiconductor memory card. The device, called Silicon Audio, is light and produces sound quality comparable to a compact disc. It is a solid state device with no moving parts, which eliminates problems such as unwanted vibrations or skipping passages of music. 'You can jump up and down with it or drop it and it will still keep playing,' said NEC. The company believes it could take a decade before the Silicon Audio reaches the market. The cost of the cards needs to fall sharply from their current price of about Pounds 100 and the playback time needs to increase substantially from its present limit of 24 minutes before it is viable. NEC believes that the ultimate success of the Silicon Audio will depend on the availability of music suitable for the format. 'It is difficult for us to claim that it will overtake other formats,' said an executive. 'It is the software that really counts.' The Silicon Audio is the latest of a number of new hi-fi formats to be developed, such as the digital compact cassette, a high-quality tape player which was launched by Philips, the Dutch electronics company. The Silicon Audio system works by recording audio signals after they have been encoded and compressed onto semiconductor chips housed on a memory card. The prototype compresses a 20MHz, 770Kbit signal to one-eighth of its original size, which allows 24 minutes of recording from a 32Mbyte card. The cards use a data retrieval and storage system called 'flash memory', which works like a standard dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip except it does not require a power supply to keep the data. The prototype player measures 127mm by 93mm by 33mm and weights 217g with batteries.</p>

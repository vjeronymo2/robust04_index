			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / China scraps Patten's reform package: Beijing passes law to disband Hong Kong's popularly elected assemblies China's threat to disband popularly elected assemblies in Hong Kong was made law yesterday when the National People's Congress, China's parliament, empowered a yet-to-be-appointed group to establish a fresh political order in Hong Kong after 1997. The official Xinhua news agency said the standing committee of the NPC had issued a 'legal regulation' to abolish Governor Chris Patten's reform package. 'The last Legislative Council, city government, district government and district board will be terminated on June 30,' Xinhua said. Since October 1992, when Mr Patten unveiled his plans for political reform, China has repeatedly threatened to reverse them on regaining sovereignty on July 1, 1997. The decision of the NPC, which was expected, puts beyond question Beijing's determination to do just that. The Hong Kong government's spokesman said that electoral arrangements, approved by Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) earlier this year, provided the best means for developing 'mature institutions' consistent both with what has been agreed with China in the past and with the aspirations of Hong Kong people themselves. 'It is not immediately apparent how dismantling representative institutions which have been openly and fairly elected can be conducive to smooth transition,' he said. Xinhua said a preparatory committee, due to come into existence during 1996, has been given responsibility for matters relating to setting up the first post-colonial government and for forming its first legislature. The preparatory committee will consist of mainland officials and Hong Kong representatives. The NPC's action in altering the preparatory committee's terms of reference constitutes an amendment of the Basic Law for Hong Kong, passed in 1990. Throughout months of talks with Britain about Mr Patten's political reforms, China maintained that the Basic Law could not be amended. Hong Kong's first fully democratic elections will be held later this month when voters participate in elections for the colony's 18 district boards, or local councils. Hong Kong is decked with posters proclaiming the virtues of Liberal, Democrat and pro-Communist candidates. Ms Marian Elsden, a consultant to the conservative Liberal Party, said yesterday that most participating in the elections had accepted that there would be a change in 1997 when China takes over. 'They are an amazingly pragmatic people,' she said. 'There is also a feeling that there will be a compromise after 1997.' Be that as it may, it is clear from the NPC's decision that the Chinese government has no intention of making life any easier for Mr Patten and the British in Hong Kong. The optimism which surrounded the Anglo-Chinese agreement on military lands in June has given way to caution as talks about the colony's new airport and a container port development drag on. On the airport, talks appear to have stalled because Beijing is not prepared to sign a detailed agreement, preferring instead a general statement of support for the project. The Hong Kong government claims that lenders to the project will want to know if China approves of the financial agreements between the Hong Kong government and the two public corporations responsible for the airport and its connecting railway. If this were not enough for Mr Patten, who returned to Hong Kong from a European holiday on Monday, he also has a number of other issues to contend with. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is conducting an investigation into alleged corrupt practices at a recent land auction. If the commission should recommend prosecution, the government will face the unpalatable choice of charging some of the colony's leading businessmen or ducking the advice and reducing Mr Patten's advocacy of the rule of law to empty rhetoric. The governor is also facing the prospect of a rift between his office and the civil service, the 180,000-strong body which keeps Hong Kong functioning in an efficient manner. Mr Patten has been at odds with Mrs Anson Chan, chief secretary, over a law banning discrimination against women and school textbooks' accounts of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing. On both occasions Mrs Chan sided with officials who sought to adopt a more permissive tone. Observers in Hong Kong expect the gulf between UK and local officials to grow over the next three years as local Chinese officials adjust to the prospects of Chinese rule in the colony. There is growing antagonism to Caucasians within the bureaucracy. A senior member of Mr Patten's own staff has been unable to move from Government House to another post within the senior civil service, partly due to his links with the governor and partly because he is not Chinese.</p>

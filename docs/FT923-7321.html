			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Concern on Bundesbank policy BOTH the dollar and sterling drifted lower against the D-Mark yesterday, amid fears that the Bundesbank will keep a tight grip on conditions in the German money market, writes James Blitz. German inflation is falling but the Bundesbank's tone on money supply still seems hawkish. The particular fear driving the dollar/D-Mark rate down yesterday was that the German central bank will not add liquidity to the money market in its weekly intervention today, allowing cash rates to rise. German call money was being traded yesterday just below the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent. If the German central bank fails to add reserves, call money will rise and the Bundesbank will be forced to raise the Lombard rate. This is because the Bank would want to stop the phenomenon of 'round tripping', in which a commercial bank borrows money through the Bundesbank's emergency window and sells it at the higher call money rate in the open market. If the Lombard rate rises, the differential between short-term interest rates in Germany and the US will widen and the dollar will fall. But the Bundesbank's hands may be tied, because of difficulties bringing M3 money supply growth into its target range. The suspicion is that the central bank wants to 'sterilise' its recent interventions on behalf of the dollar on the foreign exchanges by withholding reserves. Dealers say that every DM3bn of intervention has added 1 per cent to M3 growth. The dollar's only support is the threat of central bank intervention. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, the US Federal Reserve's next intervention will have to be on the scale of Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn if it is to turn the market, and would be one of the largest central bank interventions of recent years. In Europe, the dollar fell to DM1.4555 before closing at DM1.4580, compared with Monday's DM1.4630 finish. Sterling briefly dipped below DM2.8100 in intra-day trading and ended at DM2.8125, also down  1/2 pfennig on the day and at its lowest close against the D-Mark since the UK joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. At the end of New York trading the US currency stood at DM1.4575. The yen lost ground against the German unit following the latest fall on the Japanese stock market and fears that the official discount rate will be cut again. It closed at Y86.59 to the D-Mark from Y85.98. Falling long bond yields may push the yen further downwards if European bond markets stabilise after France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Japanese bonds currently yield only 4.7 per cent compared to better returns in Europe.</p>

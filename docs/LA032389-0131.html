			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Notre Dame tailback Tony Brooks, who faces two misdemeanor charges in a  hit-and-run accident last month and was suspended from spring practice, has  withdrawn from the university, school officials said.  </P> <P> Brooks, 19, left voluntarily for personal reasons and returned home to Tulsa,  Okla., athletic department spokesman John Heisler said.  </P> <P> Coach Lou Holtz said Brooks' future at Notre Dame is uncertain.  </P> <P> Brooks was charged Feb. 26 with leaving the scene of an accident and driving  with a suspended driver's license. He had already been prohibited from  extra-curricular activities, including spring practice, for an undisclosed  infraction of university rules.  </P> <P> "I know that he was looking at certain options and felt this was the best thing  for him right now," Holtz said. "It wasn't a situation where he came to me for  advice."  </P></p>

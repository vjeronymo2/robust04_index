			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LINK? How to account for two joint appearances of George Bush and Brad Gates in  less than a year? The missing link may be Eileen Padberg, Bush's 1988  California primary campaign manager. . . . She's a planner of Bush's visit  today (B1) and is also Gates' campaign manager. . . . When Bush asked in his  1988 State of the Union address for volunteerism in the drug effort, Padberg  sent a report on Gates' Drug Use Is Life Abuse Foundation, which led to Bush's  April visit. Said Padberg: "It's just a matter of letting the White House know  what's going on out here." Kristina Lindgren and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

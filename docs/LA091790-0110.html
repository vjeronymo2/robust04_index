			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> JUDGE LIKENS KILLER TO MANSON  </P> <P> Likening David Brown to Charles Manson, a judge this morning ordered the man  convicted of orchestrating his wife's 1985 murder to spend the rest of his life  behind bars with no chance of release.  </P> <P> "Mr. Brown, you're a scary person," Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin  told the man who was convicted in June of setting up his 14-year-old daughter  to murder his wife before secretly marrying his wife's 17-year-old sister.  </P> <P> Brown sought to profit from the $835,000 in insurance on his wife.  </P> <P> McCartin said that Brown, unlike some killers, did it all under the guise of a  normal personality. "It makes Charles Manson look like a piker," the judge  said.  </P> <P> In delivering the strongest sentence open to him, McCartin also said that if  the Orange County district attorney's office had pursued the death penalty  against the 37-year-old computer whiz, he might well have been sent to the gas  chamber.  </P></p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Hartstone Hartstone Group's behaviour is a case study in how not to communicate with shareholders. Despite the Stock Exchange's intervention, shareholders remain ignorant of the causes for its precipitous fall from grace. One has to hope its refusal to explain itself is not an example of how more companies will behave once the new insider trading legislation comes into force. The hosiery group's profits warning in March, four weeks before its year-end, led stockbrokers to reduce their profits forecasts from Pounds 36m to Pounds 23m. The company, however, reassured with a promise of an increased final dividend. Just two months later, Hartstone has issued an even gloomier warning, suggesting profits may reach only Pounds 9m. Ominously, Hartstone revealed it was also in urgent discussions with its bankers and would not pay the dividend after all. Such an extraordinary deterioration requires an explanation. There is a curious inconsistency compared with Queens Moat which has also kept mum about the reasons for its misfortunes. The Stock Exchange seems content to allow Hartstone to continue trading; Queens Moat is suspended. Arguably suspension simply locks small investors in, but it would help avoid a false market if a way could be found to prise more information out of Hartstone. Another sobering point is that, unlike Spring Ram, Hartstone boasted two heavyweight non-executive directors. Even companies complying with the Cadbury committee strictures are not immune from nasty surprises.</p>

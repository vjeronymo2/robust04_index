			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Environment issue worries third world Forthcoming talks on the link between trade and environment policies in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will run into strong third world resistance if they do not focus on poorer nations' concerns, Mr BK Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador, warned yesterday. Mr Zutshi, outgoing chairman of the Gatt contracting parties (members), told the world trade body's annual meeting in Geneva that talks had to embrace the twin objectives of protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development. More open trade, coupled with financial and technical assistance, was essential to promote sustainable development. For developing countries, 'poverty is the number one preoccupation. . . . and the most important obstacle to better environmental protection', he said. If, instead, the debate was reduced to polemics about 'greening the Gatt' it would be an irrelevance for most members. Giving the latest Gatt secretariat estimates for world trade growth, he said it rose by less than 3 per cent by volume last year, against 4 per cent in 1992 despite a slight increase in world output to just above 2 per cent.</p>

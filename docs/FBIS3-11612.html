			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada promulgated the capitalization law yesterday. It becomes  effective upon its publication in the official gazette.    The sore point is that the opposition has filed, or will do  in the next few hours, a petition with the Supreme Court to  declare the law unconstitutional. The problem is one of  interpretation.    [Begin recording] [Deputy Edil Sandoval] The petition of  unconstitutionality is presented against resolutions that  violate the Constitution or affect the interests of one or more  individuals. If the Supreme Court admits the petition, which I  do not believe it will, and decides in favor of the petition,  such decision will only benefit those who signed the petition.  Therefore, in the worst of cases the decision will not  invalidate the law. [passage omitted]    [Deputy Carlos Borth] The Constitution also grants deputies  the right to make this type of petitions in special cases. Let  us recall that the capitalization law regulates the transfer of  five enterprises to the private sector. We, the MIR [Movement  of the Revolutionary Left], will specifically oppose the  transfer of YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposit] [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

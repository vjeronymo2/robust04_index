			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt: "FDP Leadership Shifting </F> Toward Herzog"]    [Text] Bonn, 3 May -- Parts of the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP] leadership are obviously trying to make sure  that the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] candidate for the  Federal presidency, Roman Herzog, gets a clear lead over the  other contenders even on the first ballot.    As FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU learned from the FDP leadership in  Bonn on Tuesday [3 May], a victory for Herzog should be obvious  from the very beginning to prevent the FDP votes from splitting  up in the following two ballots. It was said that unless there  is a convincing majority for the CDU candidate in the first  ballot, there is the danger of parts of the 111 FDP electors  supporting Herzog in the second and third ballots while others  would cast their vote for the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] candidate, Johannes Rau, and still others for the FDP's  own candidate, Hildegard Hamm- Bruecher. The result of the  first ballot is of "extraordinarily great importance" for the  further behavior in the ballots, one member of the FDP  leadership said in Bonn. If Herzog's victory were to become  obvious early on, even such FDP electors would vote for the CDU  man that would otherwise rather be leaning toward Rau.    It was further learned that FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel and  Bundestag group leader Hermann Otto Solms want to make sure that  Herzog gets elected with the help of the FDP because this could  be interpreted as a sign of the ability to act and the  solidarity of the Bonn coalition, which consists of the  CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP. The FDP  leadership intends to commit the party congress in early June in  Rostock to the continuation of this coalition after the 16  October Bundestag election. Solms and Kinkel are the advocates  of this coalition statement and both are regarded as supporters  of Herzog.    The agreement within the party so far was that first the  FDP's own candidate, Hamm-Bruecher, should be supported, and  that the further voting behavior should then be discussed after  each ballot. According to Kinkel there will not be any  commitment prior to the ballots. At any rate, by its voting  behavior, the FDP will take a considerable share in the decision  as to who will become the successor to Richard von Weizsaecker.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVING LABELS  </P> <P> A study of the philanthropic giving of 122 American corporations has concluded  that there is "an obvious bias to the left," and that most of them are "funding  organizations clearly opposed to corporate interests." That surprising  conclusion, however, depends on definitions. A close reading of the report  reveals that the lean leftward is perceptible only to those who, like the  sponsoring Capital Research Center, regard protection of the environment, race  relations, international relations and peace as issues and activities of the  left and as weakening the free market.  </P> <P> A preface to the report by William E. Simon, the former secretary of the  Treasury, removes all doubt that this is nothing more than a new exercise of  the radical right to try to discourage participation in broadly based,  mainstream public affairs programs by the private sector. Simon applauds gifts  for the Red Cross, hospitals, religious institutions and "genuinely charitable  causes." But he asserts that "an astonishing amount of money also is given to  organizations whose special-interest advocacy is geared solely to promoting the  political interests and fashionable nostrums of the left." He further says that  "capitalism has no duty to underwrite its enemies," and concludes that the  study "vividly portrays the extent to which America's corporate leadership is  boring holes in the bottom of the ship so numerous and so large that those  manning the pumps may soon be overwhelmed."  </P> <P> Which holes are sinking the ship of state? Look, then, at some of the ratings.  </P> <P> The African American Institute, the single most effective American organization  maintaining ties with the leadership of emerging Africa, is rated "left,"  defined among other things as tending "to favor accommodation with  anti-American Communist and Third World leaders." Nature Conservancy, with its  global effort to acquire additional land for preserves and parks, is rated  "center left," defined among other things as a group that "can be expected to  favor more, or more expanded, government welfare and regulation." The Martin  Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, led by Coretta Scott King,  is rated "radical left/left," defined, among other things, as being among the  groups that "favor a restructuring of the nation along generally socialist  lines." And so it goes, including a rating for the League of Women Voters as  left/liberal. Moving rightward on the scale, one comes at last to the meager  support found flowing to "conservative" groups -- Heritage Foundation, Hoover  Institution -- and "classical liberal" -- Cato Institute. The right-most  classification is "radical right," but no recipient meeting that definition was  uncovered in the research. Some, we among them, would argue that at least one  of the groups seen as "conservative" might well be called "radical right."  </P> <P> Given these definitions, it was inevitable that many of the most responsible  American corporations, such as the St. Paul Companies, Dayton Hudson,  Coca-Cola, Scott Paper and General Mills, would be listed as "left," thus  benefiting organizations "opposed to corporate interests." That is nonsense.  Rather than weaken the vitality of the marketplace in the United States, they  have helped strengthen it, for the marketplace is integral to society and the  lives of the people of that society.  </P> <P> Capital Research defines corporate responsibility and public interest in terms  unworthy of the tradition of those American businesses that have a vigorous  commitment to using a portion of their resources for the public good. Such  careless classifications may betray deliberate mischief with ideological  intent. They certainly show ignorance of the role, unique among all the  industrial democracies, that American business has played in helping public  causes that many other nations leave as the sole province of government.  </P></p>

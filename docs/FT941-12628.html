			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Parties reach election pact in Mexico Mexico's governing party and the main opposition yesterday reached their first pact setting out the conditions for holding federal elections. The agreement may help reduce political tension following the New Year uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. The pact was approved by the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution, which had previously rejected government proposals for electoral reforms as insufficient. But it still has to be fleshed out with more concrete agreements that are subject to negotiation - and may not necessarily be reached. Mexico is holding presidential elections next August. While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is favourite to win, the party's victories have been marred by accusations of electoral fraud and vote-rigging. The pact promises in general terms that electoral authorities will be chosen according to a consensus of the political parties, gives full access to the electoral roll to all parties, guarantees fair media coverage of the campaign, and will allow for a special prosecutor to investigate electoral fraud. The government appears to have made significant concessions to the PRD, although how the accord works remains to be seen. The signatories said the agreement was a significant step in creating credible and legal elections in the country. They said it would contribute to peace in Mexico, in reference to the Chiapas rebellion. Democratic reforms have been one of the demands of the Chiapas guerrillas. The agreement is an attempt by the government's to regain the initiative after the uprising, and is a response to opposition warnings that there could be more violence if the elections were not fair.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lei Feng Spirit Shines Forever"] </F>   [Text] Thirty-one years ago today, Mao Zedong and other  proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation called on  the whole party, the whole army, and people of all nationalities  throughout the country to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. Since  then, Lei Feng, as a glorious paragon of the younger generation,  and the Lei Feng spirit, as an invaluable component of our  nation's spiritual wealth, have had a profound influence on the  healthy growth of successive generations of a new type of  socialist-minded people. Although 31 eventful years have  passed, the banner of the Lei Feng spirit, as dazzlingly  brilliant as ever, still encourages and inspires us to bravely  forge ahead on the road of socialist modernization.    Comrade Lei Feng was an outstanding representative of a new  generation of people who grew up under the nurturing influence  of our party, Army, and people. He was an advanced model who  has had the most extensive, enduring, and profound influence in  the socialist period. In the vast land of China, Lei Feng's  name is known to all people, including women and children, and  his ordinary but great deeds have always been widely read and  emulated by the people. From Ouyang Hai to Wang Jie and Liu  Yingjun and from Su Ning and Zhu Boru to Xu Honggang, people  have drawn tremendous spiritual strength from Lei Feng; from  thousands upon thousands of learn-from-Lei Feng groups -- which  are active inside and outside the military barracks -- to the  "Young Volunteers' Action," which are springing up in large  numbers throughout the country, they all represent the  development and expansion of the Lei Feng spirit. Over the past  several decades, Lei Feng's name has been closely linked with  the image of the People's Army and the advanced strata of  society, and the Lei Feng spirit has frequently been accompanied  by the spiritual outlook of striving for progress and by social  justice and intuitive knowledge. When a worrisome phenomenon  emerged in general practices in society, people sighed with  feeling, "Uncle Lei Feng has disappeared," to emphatically show  their profound longing and call for the Lei Feng spirit. When  the social outlook showed signs of healthy improvement, the  people cheered, "Uncle Lei Feng has returned," to fully express  their heartfelt pleasure and praise at the rise of the Lei Feng  spirit. A host of vivid facts proves that the Lei Feng spirit  has come into being and has developed because the people,  society, and the age require it.    Another reason for the great vitality of the Lei Feng spirit  is that it has heartily embodied the political consciousness,  lofty moral character, and lifetime goals that all communists  and revolutionary fighters should have. They are: Always  listen to the party, unswervingly follow the party, and be loyal  to the socialist cause; with the "nail spirit" of assiduously  studying revolutionary theories, strive to master  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; persist in wholeheartedly  serving the people and devote our limited lifetimes to the  unlimited cause of serving the people; conscientiously maintain  hard struggle, a high standard of work, and a low standard of  living; love whatever jobs we are given, try to be proficient in  whatever we do, and strive to perform meritorious deeds and  train ourselves in our work posts, and so on. Shining with the  radiance of socialist and communist thought, the Lei Feng spirit  is the fusion of the spirit of the times and the traditional  virtues of the Chinese nation; it is the concrete embodiment of  a revolutionary outlook on life and of revolutionary values. As  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Whoever wants to be a true  communist should learn from Comrade Lei Feng's moral character  and style." If our officers and men want to become  revolutionary servicemen with lofty ideals, moral integrity,  education, and a sense of discipline, they should  conscientiously learn from the Lei Feng spirit. If our Army  wants to stand in the front ranks of society in building  socialist spiritual civilization, it should vigorously promote  the Lei Feng spirit.    Since the beginning of reform and opening up, earthshaking  great changes have taken place in our country. The situation  today is indeed vastly different from what it was when Lei Feng  was alive. However, the Lei Feng spirit is not outdated. While  engaging in our modernization drive, we have more great needs  for advanced ideas to arouse our will to fight. This is because  Lei Feng spirit is completely in tune with the principal melody  of the times being promoted. Promoting Lei Feng spirit is not  only needed in building socialist spiritual civilization but  also provides a powerful spiritual motivating force for building  socialist material civilization. The modernization drive  requires Lei Feng spirit which, in turn, also boosts the  modernization drive. Only by vigorously promoting Lei Feng  spirit can we firmly act according to the party Central  Committee's plans and requirements; cultivate an environment of  public opinion which is favorable to reform; correctly approach  the adjustment of interests; consciously work under the overall  situation; resist and oppose the corrosion of money worship,  pleasure-seeking, ultra-individualism, and other decadent ideas;  correctly handle the relationships between state, collective,  and individual interests; ensure the healthy and orderly  development of the socialist market economy; and observe market  economic principles, promote socialist styles, and attain the  goal of common prosperity by exerting ourselves, getting rich  through hard work, aiding the poor, and waging struggle in  unity. Therefore, the more we develop the socialist market  economy, the more we should promote the Lei Feng spirit. Lei  Feng's deeds are both ordinary and great and the Lei Feng spirit  is both plain and lofty. Consequently, it is of universal  significance and it reflects the higher requirements for  building socialist spiritual civilization. The strategic  principle for the new period laid down by the military  commission requires us to conscientiously study and master  knowledge in modern science and culture, especially in high and  new science. If we have the Lei Feng spirit, not only will it  provide us with a powerful spiritual motivating force to scale  heights in science, culture, and technology, but it will also  ensure that we apply what we have learned in serving the people  and the motherland, exerting our utmost strength for Army  modernization and contributing to the magnificent edifice of  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Far from rejecting it,  we need the Lei Feng spirit even more while mastering modern  scientific knowledge and culture. While striving to raise the  scientific and cultural levels of officers and men and speeding  up the process of attaining the magnificent objective of  building a revolutionary, modern, and regular army, we should  hold still higher the banner of the Lei Feng spirit.    All the leading collectives of the three generations, i.e.,  the party Central Committees with Comrades Mao Zedong, Deng  Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin as the core, have vigorously advocated  the Lei Feng spirit and have personally written inscriptions for  the learn-from-Lei Feng activities. This is an important reason  why the activities have been so extensive and long-lasting as  never before. As Lei Feng came from the People's Army, his  comrades-in-arms should all the more take him as a paragon  forever, turn the Lei Feng spirit into an enduring action, and  constantly raise the learn-from-Lei Feng activities and the  building of spiritual civilization in the Army to a new level.    The Lei Feng spirit shines forever!</p>

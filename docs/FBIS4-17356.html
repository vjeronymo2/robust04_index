			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma today  made public a statement containing an appeal to the bodies of  executive power to ensure citizens' safety and constitutional  order in Moscow. As is mentioned in the document, this has been  prompted by the fact that, as the traditional spring  celebrations approach, printed matter inciting people to  violence is being distributed in factories and organizations.</p>

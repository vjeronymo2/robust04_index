			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: GRATEFUL DEAD RISE IN PANAMA  </P> <P> The latest secret military weapon from the American arsenal showed up in Panama  when U.S. military forces tried to drive Manuel Noriega out of the Vatican  embassy by blasting him with rock music all day long. While it failed to  achieve its goal, it is now estimated that there will be a lot of  hard-of-hearing Panamanians once the fighting is over.  </P> <P> The idea of using rock music to dislodge ex-heads of state and other sleazy  enemies was thought up by the U. S. Psychological Warfare Division at the  Pentagon. It was actually an invention of a senior staff member, Col. Wolfpack  MacArthur. Wolfpack got the idea after he had been driven out of his home last  spring by his son's repeated playing of the Grateful Dead's "Skeletons From a  Closet."  </P> <P> I spoke to Wolfpack as he sat ramrod straight on top of four loudspeakers at  Andrews Air Force Base.  </P> <P> "Any casualties?" I yelled at him.  </P> <P> "We lost three microphones and one woofer, but we knocked out four Panamanian  National Guardsmen, three nuns and a Papal Nuncio."  </P> <P> "Any damage to Noriega's eardrums?" I asked.  </P> <P> Wolfpack said, "He's starting to feel the pressure. We're going to fire off the  Rolling Stones' Top 10 tomorrow, and if that doesn't make him surrender,  nothing will."  </P> <P> I shouted up, "Are we to assume that rock warfare is the wave of the future?"  </P> <P> "It's a proven deterrent. We know that no grown-up can survive four hours of  the Led Zeppelin. We believe that any tinhorn dictator will come out with his  hands high rather than listen to three Jefferson Airplane singles."  </P> <P> "What about the Geneva Convention, which forbids anyone to play loud music  around a diplomatic mission?"  </P> <P> "We don't recognize the Geneva Convention. Noriega is a thief and a drug  dealer, and we will torture him with the U2's 'Rattle and Hum' no matter what  world opinion thinks."  </P> <P> "If rock music is such a successful weapon, why is Noriega still in the Vatican  embassy?"  </P> <P> "The CIA reports that he may have taken earplugs in there with him."  </P> <P> "Why didn't the CIA know this at the beginning?"  </P> <P> "They were watching the back of the building -- Noriega came in through the  front. But we're not worried. We have more rock records in stock than Noriega  has earplugs."  </P> <P> "The Vatican has officially complained about the noise, and Washington  announced that they might knock it off."  </P> <P> "That's typical of Washington. They give us the rock war weapons and then they  chicken out to Rome. If they just let us play one Madonna platter, we will have  Noriega sticking his fingers in his ears and running naked down the streets of  Panama."  </P> <P> Wolfpack told me that many countries are interested in rock war but the United  States is worried that the weapon is too powerful to be allowed to fall into  the hands of foreign governments. "Can you imagine what the Libyans would do to  us if they could play Michael Jackson at high pitch in front of an American  consulate?"  </P> <P> "Are you going back to Panama?" I asked the colonel.  </P> <P> "Yes, as soon as we add two more boom boxes to our amplifiers. We shall return,  and this time we're going to knock Noriega out of bed with Bruce Springsteen's  greatest hits if it kills us."  </P></p>

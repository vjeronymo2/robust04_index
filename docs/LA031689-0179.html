			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PASSES BILL TO FORCE U.S. HAND IN EASTERN STRIKE  </P> <P> Defying the Bush Administration, the House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly  for legislation that would force President Bush to form an emergency board to  investigate and report on the Eastern Airlines strike.  </P> <P> The measure, which passed by a 252-167 margin after heated debate along  partisan lines, must still be acted upon by the Senate, where its chances are  uncertain. Then, the measure would have to be signed by Bush, who is being  advised by Administration officials to veto it.  </P> <P> The bill directs the President to empanel the board, as authorized under the  Railway Labor Act, in order to help solve the impasse among Eastern, the  International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Air Line Pilots  Assn., and the Transport Workers Union of America. The machinists struck March  4 after refusing Eastern's demand for $125 million a year in wage and benefit  concessions, and virtually all of the airline's pilots and flight attendants  have refused to cross picket lines.  </P> <P> If the board were formed, its practical effect would be to provide a  "cooling-off period" of 21 days during which striking workers would have to  return to their jobs. Under the legislation, Bush would be allowed to extend  that period by another five days.  </P> <P> During the floor debate, opposition centered on contentions that there is not a  crisis in the transportation system and that the parties should work out their  differences among themselves and allow Eastern's filing for protection from  creditors under the bankruptcy laws to play itself out in the courts.  </P> <P> One opponent, Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt (R-Ark.), said creation of the board  "cannot be justified on either legal or policy grounds."  </P> <P> "Although there is some inconvenience to passengers," Hammerschmidt said, "the  Eastern strike has not caused the sort of deprivation of essential  transportation that would justify an emergency board under the law." Other  carriers, he said, can adjust their schedules to accommodate passengers' needs.  </P> <P> But supporters of the measure asserted that the bill would help save Eastern,  the jobs of its employees and the communities that depend on the airline for  their livelihoods.  </P> <P> California Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), chairman of the Committee on  Public Works and Transportation, said, "Eastern's demise would be an economic  disaster; it would cause the loss of up to 30,000 jobs and a billion-dollar  payroll, as well as substantial economic damage" to communities nationwide with  Eastern Airlines operations.  </P> <P> Predictably, Eastern's unions lauded the House action while Eastern officials  criticized it.  </P> <P> "We are delighted that the House acted quickly," said Charles Bryan, head of  the striking machinists union local. "While the President was not in favor of  taking action earlier, he might now not want to be identified as promoting the  interests of Frank Lorenzo," who is head of the Texas Air holding company that  owns Eastern.  </P> <P> Capt. Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots union local, was also pleased by  the vote. "We are gratified to find that the members of Congress realize the  necessity of appointing a board in an attempt to reach a fair and equitable  agreement in the labor-management dispute at our airline," he said.  </P> <P> However, Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said, "We are still against it." He  added that creation of an emergency board to investigate the dispute would be  "blatant interference with the collective-bargaining process and is being  sought for no reason other than to maintain the status quo that is creating  extensive daily losses at Eastern."  </P> <P> He predicted defeat for the legislation in the Senate and noted that the House  vote was not large enough for the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill  over a presidential veto.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a number of airlines denied reports that they have raised ticket  prices and increased fare restrictions as a result of the strike, which has  grounded more than 90% of Eastern's flights.  </P> <P> Edwin Colodny, chairman and president of USAir Group, told a group of airline  analysts in New York on Wednesday that he does not expect his firm's USAir  subsidiary to benefit significantly from the strike. He said, however, that  Piedmont Airlines, which is also owned by USAir Group, probably will grow in  the Southeastern U.S. markets where it competes directly with Eastern.  </P> <P> A USAir spokesman, David Shipley, said later that the airline has not raised  any fares since the strike began.  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Jackie Pate said Delta also has not raised fares as  a result of the strike. She conceded, however, that it has tightened ticket  restrictions in some markets.  </P> <P> American Airlines said it has not raised fares and has not changed the number  of seats sold at a discount. A lot of such Maxsaver fares had already been sold  out before the strike began.  </P> <P> Midway Airlines, a regional discount airline, said its Chicago-to-Miami and  Chicago-to-Atlanta coach fares have been raised $10 one-way. But spokeswoman  Sandra Allen said the new fares had been set before the onset of the strike and  that the timing was coincidental.  </P> <P> In another development, a Texas Air spokesman, Art Kent, refused to confirm or  deny reports that the New York investment bank of Drexel Burnham Lambert had  been asked to find a buyer for Eastern. But he did not deny that Eastern is on  the auction block.  </P></p>

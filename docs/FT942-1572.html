			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Burns Philp acquires German yeast group Burns Philp, the Australian group which has been pruning its diverse business interests to concentrate on 'core' food and ingredients operations, is buying Deutsche Hefewerke, a German baking yeast and yeast extract business, for around ADollars 117m (USDollars 90m). DHW is being sold by Veba, the large German energy, chemical and trading group, and comprises three factories, in Hamburg, Nuremberg and Leipzig. It has annual sales of around DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) and employs some 315 people. In Sydney, Burns said that the deal, which is still subject to approval by Germany's Federal Cartel Office, would lift its share of the global yeast extracts market to around 15 per cent. Its share of the German baking yeast market would be around 30 per cent. Burns Philp already owns Mauri Products, a yeast manufacturer in the UK and has been aggressively building up overseas food ingredient interests recently.</p>

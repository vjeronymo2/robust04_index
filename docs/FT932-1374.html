			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Ecuadorean assets unfrozen A NEW YORK court has ordered the freeing of some of the Ecuadorean government assets frozen in the US as part of a Swiss creditor's attempt to secure repayment of a debt. Most of the assets frozen by the court nearly two months ago in a pre-judgment order continue to be held. They are awaiting a judgment expected in August on the validity of the creditor's claim against the government for repayment of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) of syndicated loans. The loans were bought this year at a discount in the secondary market by the Zurich-based Weston Compagnie et Finance. According to the company's lawyer in New York Weston is appealing against the freeing of Dollars 160,000 in assets which the central bank was holding for the state telephone company. The court confirmed the temporary freeze of Dollars 92,000 held by the state airline, and reserved judgment on a further Dollars 400,000-Dollars 500,000 in frozen funds. Some Dollars 900,000 of assets held for Flopec, the state shipping company, are in escrow pending the August judgment. According to bankers in London, Weston is also pursuing a claim in the English courts for repayment of Soviet-era debt issued by the Moscow-based International Bank for Economic Co-operation.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Queens Moat below City forecasts QUEENS MOAT Houses, the hotels group, announced full-year pre-tax profits down 3.9 per cent to Pounds 90.4m, slightly below market expectations, and warned that there was no sign of a sustained recovery in its UK business. A better performance on the Continent, where the company has 86 of its 190 hotels, helped raise profit before rent and interest to Pounds 157m for the year to end-December against Pounds 142m in 1990. Profits at the pre-tax level were dragged down by an increased interest charge of Pounds 56.8m (Pounds 43.1m) and higher rent of Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 5.19m). Turnover was Pounds 543m (Pounds 485m). Despite a fall in fully-diluted earnings per share to 7.58p (8.59p), a proposed final dividend of 1.54p raises the total to 2.882p (2.62p). Mr John Bairstow, chairman, said: 'In more normal times we would have no hesitation in anticipating a year of strong growth, especially with the extremely good start to 1992 in our continental hotels. However, in the face of the economic uncertainties, particularly in the UK, such optimism would be misplaced.' He added: 'It is reasonable for shareholders to expect a satisfactory outcome in 1992 and a resumption of growth thereafter.' Mr Bairstow said the continental hotels accounted for 42 per cent of profits before interest and rent. Profits in Germany, where the group has 36 hotels, and in the Netherlands, where it has 26, increased by 20 per cent. The group had seen no evidence of a slowdown in Germany, where its hotels cater almost exclusively for business travellers. The UK business was shielded to some extent by the small number of hotels the group has in London, where occupancies have fallen more sharply than in the rest of the country. Mr Bairstow said the three London hotels had been worse hit than those in the Midlands and the north of England. 'The flickers of improvement we have seen have been in those regions rather than in London and the south east,' Mr Bairstow said. Queens Moat also said it was making a recommended Pounds 6.9m cash offer for the shares it does not already own in Chester International Hotel, a four-star 152-room property near Chester city centre. Queens Moat manages the hotel and has a 28 per cent fully diluted stake in it. Queens Moat and Chester International have some directors in common and certain Queens Moat directors and their families hold 2.9 per cent of Chester's ordinary shares. Queens Moat said it had been advised on the deal by Chester's independent directors and Charterhouse. It said Charterhouse would make the offer on its behalf. See Lex</p>

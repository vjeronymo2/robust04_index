			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET CRUNCH FORCES MUSEUM TO SELL BIERSTADT LANDSCAPE;  </P> <P> ART: THE STRUGGLING SOUTHWEST MUSEUM HOPES TO RAISE $1.5 MILLION TO BOOST ITS  ENDOWMENT FUND.  </P> <P> The Southwest Museum has quietly consigned to auction an important 1864  landscape by the American painter Albert Bierstadt in hopes of raising at least  $1.5 million to boost the struggling museum's endowment fund.  </P> <P> The Bierstadt in question, "Mount Hood in Oregon," is one of fewer than a dozen  very large paintings completed by the artist early in his career that portray  American landscape scenes.  </P> <P> Museum officials and lawyers familiar with the situation said the Bierstadt's  status had been clouded by litigation filed by the museum against a descendant  of the woman who donated the work to the museum in 1926. Los Angeles County  Superior Court records indicate that an out-of-court settlement was reached in  the suit, which involved questions of title to the painting, only days before  the museum shipped the painting off to Christie's in New York, where it is to  be sold on May 23.  </P> <P> Preliminary estimates of the selling price were listed by Christie's as between  $1.5 million and $2 million, but some experts in American landscape art of the  period have said the painting might bring as much as $4 million, depending on  market conditions.  </P> <P> The work, which is 6x10 feet, had not been on public view at the Southwest  Museum in nearly 10 years. The museum board first held discussions about  deaccession of the Bierstadt at least two years ago after museum officials  concluded that they would be unable to follow through on plans to increase the  Southwest's American art holdings, establishing a  collection-within-the-collection of which the Bierstadt would have been a  nucleus.  </P> <P> "Mount Hood in Oregon" is significant, experts said, because it is one of  perhaps only a half dozen large examples of Bierstadt's work in which the  subject is a faithfully portrayed, strictly American scene. The painting was  one of six or seven Bierstadt works exhibited at the 1876 Philadelphia  Centennial celebration.  </P> <P> The work is from the early period of Bierstadt's career when he was  establishing himself as one of the most commercially successful painters of his  time. Bierstadt first saw the Rocky Mountains in 1858 when he served as a  member of a government survey party. He went on to create a body of Western  landscape scenes that became immensely popular in the 1860s and 1870s.  </P> <P> As Bierstadt matured, however, he began to mix details of European scenes into  his work. His taste for grandiose landscape portrayals subsided and Bierstadt's  reputation went into eclipse. A native of Germany, Bierstadt came to the United  States in 1832 and died in New York in 1902 at the age of 72.  </P> <P> Court records indicate the litigation, between the Southwest Museum and John  Farquhar, apparently an heir to the estate of Georgina Jones, who originally  gave the painting to the museum, was settled on Feb. 22. But the records also  show the existence of a confidentiality agreement between the museum and  Farquhar under which both parties agreed to keep all details of the court  proceeding secret.  </P> <P> File records and other information about the case obtained by The Times,  however, indicate that the suit over title to the painting led to negotiations  last year that apparently centered on Farquhar's assertion that he was entitled  to share in proceeds from the sale. At one point, the museum agreed to abide by  a requirement that the painting be sold by the end of 1991 as a condition for  terminating the suit.  </P> <P> The court file also showed that discussions were held about setting up an  interest-bearing account for money generated by the auction, pending resolution  of the suit. Sources familiar with the litigation said the judge hearing the  case strongly urged both sides to reach an out-of-court resolution late last  year.  </P> <P> Jerome Selmer, the museum's director, declined to discuss the case. Timothy J.  Harris, a lawyer representing Farquhar, refused to provide details, as well.  Harris specifically declined even to say where Farquhar resides.  </P> <P> "The board decided they would (sell the painting off). It has been discussed  over the years," said Selmer. "The decision (about what to do with the money)  hasn't really been made yet. There have been some informal discussions, but no  action has been taken on that yet."  </P> <P> In recent years, the Southwest Museum has struggled to cope with budget  problems that at one point led the museum to enter into merger negotiations  with the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. At the height of the  budget crunch, the museum temporarily closed its library -- reopening the  facility only after receipt of a large cash donation from television preacher  Gene Scott.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SLUMP BRINGING CLOTHESTIME EARNINGS DIP  </P> <P> Clothestime Inc., the discount women's apparel retail chain, said Tuesday that  earnings for its current quarter will fall below previous expectations as a  result of sluggish summer sales.  </P> <P> Earnings for the second quarter ending July 30 are expected to be 11 cents a  share, compared to 16 cents a share in the year-ago quarter, the company said.  </P> <P> John Shanklin, chief financial officer, said the lower earnings reflect a  decision not to advertise this year. July sales are down about 9%, contrasted  with a 34% sales increase a year earlier. Shanklin said the company advertised  heavily on television before the sales increase last year.  </P> <P> The advertising was intended to inform customers that Clothestime would change  the type of merchandise it offers, from private label to off-price brand names,  said Gregg Sloate, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He said he had expected second-quarter earnings to be a few cents higher than  the 11 cents a share that Clothestime is now predicting. However, Sloate said  the decrease from last year's second quarter was no surprise. "It is not an  easy comparison to go up against," he said.  </P> <P> As a result of Clothestime's announcement, Sloate said he has lowered his 1990  estimate for Clothestime from 26 cents a share to 20 cents.  </P> <P> For its fiscal 1990 year ended Jan. 27, Clothestime earned $461,000 on revenue  of $187 million, despite a fourth-quarter loss of $4.2 million. The company  lost $1.4 million on sales of $46.8 million for its fiscal 1991 first quarter  ended April 28.  </P> <P> Clothestime stock, traded over-the-counter, closed Wednesday at $3.875 per  share, down 6.25 cents.  </P></p>

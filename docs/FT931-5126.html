			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / CBI expects pay rises below 2.5% UNIT LABOUR costs in British manufacturing industry are expected to continue falling over the next few months, the Confederation of British Industry says. It expects productivity to increase by up to 4 per cent and pay settlements to fall below 2.5 per cent. Figures from the CBI pay databank for the three months to the end of January show average manufacturing pay settlements at 2.5 per cent and service-sector settlements averaging 2.8 per cent. It is the first time that the databank, which covers more than 1,400 companies, has recorded settlements below 3 per cent across the whole economy. The CBI also notes that one in three companies, in both manufacturing and the service sector, has introduced a pay freeze of up to one year since last August. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said: 'What matters now is that we keep up the progress. If we can do that we will be better placed than when we came out of the last recession to avoid inflation and to seize competitive advantages in the marketplace.' The Engineering Employers Federation recently recorded similar figures for settlements and pay freezes. However, Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay analyst, recorded slightly higher average pay settlements for the quarter to the end of January of 3.1 per cent, and recorded pay freezes covering a fifth of settlements. The continuing uncertainty about the medium-term movement of pay settlements and average earnings is, however, underlined by the pay assumptions of the government actuary built into the latest report on benefit up-rating. Government economists have assumed a very wide range for the increase in average earnings for 1993-94 with an increase of 3 per cent at the bottom end and 7 per cent at the top end.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sleepy bourses offer mild reaction to US data For once, the reaction to US data, as the NAPM October index came out much higher than expected, was more marked in the US than in Europe, writes Our Markets Staff. Among senior bourses, Paris, Milan and Madrid were closed for All Saints Day. ZURICH saw further action in UBS, as the market mulled nine-month figures out late on Monday, but the SMI index shed 2.6 to 2,503.9 in otherwise quiet conditions. UBS bearers fell SFr41 or 3.5 per cent to SFr1,136 and the registered SFr10 or 3.7 per cent to SFr257 as Credit Suisse reduced its earnings estimates for this year and next. However, Mr Ian McEwan at Merrill Lynch said that the figures were in line with expectations and the share price fall a further reaction to the board's continuing battle for influence with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision, which holds about 18 per cent of the registered stock. In his view, the bearers were still 'wildly overvalued', and he saw SFr1,000 as a more realistic valuation. The registered were trading at a premium of 34.4 per cent to the bearers on September 29, when the board announced its plans for a single share category to curb the power of predators. By yesterday, the premium had fallen to 13.1 per cent, suggesting that the market expected the board to win its battle with Mr Ebner. BK Vision fell SFr40 or 3.1 per cent to SFr1,250, taking cumulative losses since the battle lines were drawn to 13.8 per cent. CS Holding, continuing to benefit from switching out of UBS, picked up SFr8 to SFr557. Insurers, too, rose further, Zurich adding SFr18 at SFr1,163 and Swiss Re bearers advancing SFr12 to SFr775. FRANKFURT's Dax index closed the session at 2,069.73, fell to just over 2,062 after the NAPM data, and then recovered to an Ibis-indicated afternoon close of 2,066.18, up 4.60. Pressure from bund futures eased towards the end. Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Munich were closed for the holiday, and German stock market turnover fell from DM5.6bn to just DM3bn. Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt observed that share price moves needed to be approached with care. However, two of the main Ibis Dax moves, Volkswagen up DM9.20 to DM446.20 and Mannesmann up DM7.90 to DM407.40, might be significant, she said. VW and Mannesmann both came under pressure some weeks ago as the weak dollar threatened export-oriented cyclicals; the currency weakness might not be at an end, but there might be some hope for its victims. AMSTERDAM marked DSM down heavily as the chemicals group turned in third-quarter figures at the lower end of analysts' expectations, and the shares dipped Fl 5.00 or 3.4 per cent to Fl 141. However, an element of profit-taking was also in evidence following solid gains in the stock over the past week. Brokers expected DSM to rally in the medium term given the forecasts for good full-year figures, while the group remarked that the weaker dollar was not expected to have a significant effect on earnings, at least in the short-term. The AEX index ended with a loss of 2.37 at 410.25. KLM went against the trend on brokers' upgrades ahead of today's first-half results, and the shares advanced Fl 1.60 to Fl 48.50. There were expectations that the airline would return net profits in the region of Fl 300m. STOCKHOLM eased gently as good corporate results offset the international mood. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.00 to 1,482.00 in moderate turnover of SKr2.25bn. Results came from Aga, the industrial gases group, which put on SKr5 to SKr73, although James Capel said that its forecast of a 20 per cent rise in profits this year was in line with expectations. However, there was no argument about Autoliv, the car safety equipment company: earnings per share were up 81 per cent after nine months, and the shares rose SKr22, or nearly 9 per cent to SKr276. OSLO's All-share index finished 4.37 down at 600.67 in turnover of NKr478m. Hafslund Nycomed 'A' closed NKr1.50 higher at NKr120, its nine-month results proving above some expectations. Den norske Bank, reporting in line with forecasts, saw its free 'A' shares slip NKr0.10 to NKr16.90 on profit-taking after a strong showing on Monday. COPENHAGEN was led lower by a sharp decline in AP Moller's stocks amid worries about the effect on the shipping group of the weak dollar and poor international shipping rates. The KFX index fell 1.20 to 93.47. Moller's 1912 'B' share fell DKr4,000 to a year's low of DKr98,000 while its Svendborg 'B' stock shed DKr5,500 to DKr141,000. HELSINKI was pulled lower by declines in forestry shares and Nokia, the telecoms based conglomerate. The Hex index slipped 13.8 to 1,940.2. One of the sadder stories was the drop of FM3.50 to a new 1994 low in EffJohn, whose Silja Line subsidiary, in the ferry business but not connected to the Estonia sinking at the end of September, said that the number of its passengers fell by 15 per cent last month.

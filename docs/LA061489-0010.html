			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COMING HOME TO SMUG AMERICA'  </P> <P> I was living in Paris during the 1988 French presidential campaign and was  fortunate to observe the vast differences between the American and French  presidential election processes. Unlike Americans, the French are represented  by various political parties which reflect a multitude of diverse beliefs and  issues.  </P> <P> Not only do the French actively pursue political participation, they are aware  and proud of their right to vote. Moreover, they exercise that vote.  </P> <P> Stanley Meisler notes in his telling article ("Coming Home to Find a Smug,  Scared America," Opinion, June 4) that the French are frightened of the  mindless "Americanization of their elections," but need not worry as they are  far behind the U.S. Perhaps, Meisler overdoes it with regard to his praise of  the French by stating that the French presidential debates were "sharp and  meaningful."  </P> <P> I, too, watched those televised debates. I remember awaiting impatiently to  finally see a debate of substance unlike the exchange of programmed one-liners  I had been accustomed to in the States. Unfortunately, I failed to see any  difference between the dialectic capabilities of Francois Mitterand and Jacques  Chirac, and those of George Bush and Michael Dukakis.  </P> <P> A politician is a politician; campaign rhetoric and evasion of immediate  concerns are constant, regardless of one's nationality. The advent of  programmed one-liners is not only an American revelation.  </P> <P> YASMIN NETERVALA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

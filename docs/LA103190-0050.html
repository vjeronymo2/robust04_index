			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS STUDY BAN ON L.A. TRUCKS AT CALABASAS DUMP  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday requested a study to determine the  effects of a plan to close the Calabasas landfill to trash hauled by Los  Angeles city trucks.  </P> <P> Supervisors also agreed to consider preventing communities that have not dumped  garbage at the Calabasas landfill in the past from doing so in the future, said  Judy Hammond, an aide to Supervisor Pete Schabarum. The county dump  historically has been a disposal site for areas west of the San Diego Freeway  and south of the Simi Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> The two actions were taken after a closed-door session to discuss litigation  that could arise if the board adopted Supervisor Mike Antonovich's proposal to  close the landfill to trash generated within the city.  </P> <P> Antonovich's proposal was made Oct. 2 after the city killed a plan by  Browning-Ferris Industries to expand the company's Sunshine Canyon Landfill  above Granada Hills, and the company cut back dumping limits there from 3,000  tons a day to 700 tons a day.  </P> <P> Antonovich's aides said the supervisor was concerned that the Calabasas  landfill could fill more rapidly as Valley-area haulers looked for alternative  dumps.  </P> <P> Dave Vannatta, an Antonovich aide, said Tuesday that Antonovich wants to be  sure there is enough space in the landfill to accommodate trash from  unincorporated county areas and smaller cities in the years ahead.  </P> <P> About 75% of the 3,000 tons of trash dumped in the Calabasas landfill each day  is from the city. One-third of the city trash is carried in trucks owned by the  city Bureau of Sanitation, and the rest is brought by private haulers.  </P> <P> Antonovich had initially proposed closing the landfill to all city trash. But  the supervisors instead opted to study a modified plan that would prevent only  city-owned trucks from dumping there.  </P> <P> The study -- an environmental assessment -- could preclude the need for a more  detailed environmental impact report reviewing the effects the reductions would  have throughout the region.  </P> <P> Robert Alpern, assistant director of the city's Bureau of Sanitation, said it  was unfortunate that the supervisors took action without giving city officials  an opportunity to defend their decision not to permit the Sunshine Canyon  expansion.  </P> <P> Alpern said the proposal was dropped after a "rigorous planning evaluation"  concluded that it was not in the community's best interest to allow  Browning-Ferris to exceed the height limits set forth in its conditional use  permit.  </P> <P> "Seems like the city didn't get its day in court," Alpern said.  </P> <P> Vannatta, however, said he believed that city sanitation officials were aware  that the county was considering the measure and could have attended the  meeting.  </P> <P> Alpern said that if the county does bar city-owned trucks from Calabasas, the  city will be forced to find alternative sites, which he said would probably be  more expensive.  </P> <P> He also said that despite the board's action, city and county officials will  continue to work together to try to solve the region's long-range problem of  garbage disposal.  </P></p>

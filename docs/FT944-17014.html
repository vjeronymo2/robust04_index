			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / TV staff face jobs ultimatum Employees of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television face a deadline of 4pm today to accept new terms and conditions imposed by their employer or face dismissal. The company said the new cost-saving terms were necessary to ensure that it remained competitive in bidding to make programmes for the national ITV network. The unions, which say YTTV is trying to coerce its employees, are taking legal advice in an attempt to ensure that the company honours its contractual obligations to its staff. The company said last night that it was acting lawfully and added: 'If we fail to convince them, dismissal would be the result.' YTTV's 800 employees, spread through Yorkshire, Humberside and north-east England, already work on an annualised hours system. The new deal would mean than any overtime hours worked in addition to those hours would be paid at a flat rate, not at a premium rate - mostly one and a third or one and a half times normal pay, as at present. Mr Colin Bourne, the northern region organiser for the National Union of Journalists, said this change would mean some employees' earnings would drop by up to 40 per cent. Flat-rate overtime pay for flexible hours is becoming common in ITV with a number of companies paying premiums only for late rostering or very concentrated rostering. In addition new ITV companies such as Meridian have individual contracts rather than collective bargaining. At least one senior ITV executive suggested yesterday that YTTV was trying to catch up in terms of the competitiveness of its work practices. YTTV moved to impose the new terms this week after three months' negotiations with the unions failed to produce agreement.</p>

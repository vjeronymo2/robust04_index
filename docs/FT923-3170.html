			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Big investors in Hungary think again: Changes in the economic climate have upset company plans THE trail-blazing western companies which started to invest in Hungary at the end of the 1980s are beginning to ponder what they should have done differently. Should they have committed less money? Less precipitately? In a different location? Or maybe not made the investment at all? Investment decisions made two, three or even four years ago, when Hungary became the first east European country to open up to western companies, are now coming to fruition. But the economic climate has changed dramatically. Multinationals led by such US companies as General Electric, General Motors, Guardian Glass and Ford are finding that many earlier assumptions no longer hold good. No one anticipated the sharpness and duration of the fall in Hungarian domestic demand, or realised the protected domestic market would be so quickly liberalised. Nor did anyone predict that east European trading links would disintegrate so rapidly, and that exports to the west would come under pressure from rising local costs and the relative strength of the forint, the Hungarian currency. Take the car manufacturers. GM, Ford and Japan's Suzuki Motor established a presence in Hungary on the understanding that their investments would earn the country hard currency and so win access to the protected local market. General Motors, for instance, combined production of both cars and components at its green-field DM400m (Pounds 143.3m) plant in Szentgotthard which opened this year. It hoped exports of car engines produced there would meet the foreign exchange costs of imports of kits for local assembly of Astra models for the Hungarian market. But then the Hungarian government moved unexpectedly quickly to liberalise car imports. GM Hungary has a one-shift capacity to produce a paltry 15,000 cars a year at Szentgotthard. But managers admit it would be much more efficient to make the cars at larger western plants and import them into Hungary. Moreover, as a result of the Hungarian recession and import competition, only about 7,000 Astras are likely to be sold in Hungary this year. GM is in the awkward position of importing kits and assembling them in Hungary at high cost, only to re-export the completed cars back to western Europe. Depressed demand  - both in Hungary and in the rest of central and eastern Europe  - is also posing problems for Guardian Glass, the privately-owned US glass maker. Guardian, one of the first large investors in eastern Europe, agreed a Dollars 120m (Pounds 61m) joint venture in Oroshaza in the south-east of Hungary. The decision was motivated by the promise of a large east European market for float glass, together by the cheapness of energy imports from the Soviet Union. Neither assumption has been borne out. Guardian is managing to sell only 25 per cent of its output in eastern Europe, half what it planned. Instead it has to export to Italy and other west European countries. Transport from Hungary costs much more than for deliveries from Guardian's Luxembourg plant, outweighing Oroshaza's advantage of lower labour costs. 'If the company knew that all this would happen, Guardian would still invest  - I think  - in Hungary; but not necessarily in this part of Hungary,' says Mr Gabriel Pataky, finance director of Guardian in Hungary. Mindful of the difficulty of transporting bulky glass from the south-east of Hungary to western Europe, he concludes: 'It would have been a green-field site somewhere further west.' General Electric, by contrast, always expected most light-bulb production from its GE-Tungsram joint venture to be exported to western Europe. But GE has seen unpleasant surprises in other areas. Hungary's tight monetary policy and relatively strong currency have unhinged some of GE's assumptions. Although the forint has been devalued, it has been by less than the inflation rate, which peaked at a rate of 38 per cent last year  - leading to a revaluation in real terms. 'If I had known that we would have a devaluation-inflation gap of this magnitude, we probably would have invested less,' confesses Mr George Varga, chief executive officer of GE-Tungsram. Another reason for dashed expectations has been the worldwide economic slowdown. Ford's components facility at Szekesfehervar, which exports all its output, has suffered from the decline in the west European car market. With hindsight, the company says it would have curbed its Dollars 83m initial investment. The recession also adds to pressure from another direction. With global earnings faltering, multinationals' shareholders are increasingly impatient for Hungarian operations to make a contribution. 'There is a demand for immediate results,' says Mr David Fuller, managing partner of Price Waterhouse Budapest, a branch of the international accountants. For some investors, the problems have been insurmountable. German metal companies Korf and Metallgesellschaft pulled out of a joint venture at Hungary's Ozd steelworks last year after heavy losses. Most western companies, however, maintain confidence in the future. The quality of the local workforce has been better than expected, and investors retain what Mr Fuller calls an 'inner belief' that Hungary will develop into a valuable new market place. A golden future, however, is further down the trail than they first thought.</p>

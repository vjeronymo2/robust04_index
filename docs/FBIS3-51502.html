			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] A group of legislators today presented to the  Permanent Commission of Congress a report on the situation in  Chiapas. The report was based on the group's recent visit to  the state.    The two senators and 11 deputies who make up this group  under  the leadership of Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi pointed out that the  Chiapas conflict emerged because of the state's long history of  backwardness and various forms of domination that have retarded  its full development.    The document says that in this state there are unacceptable  examples of inequality and poverty. After reading the balance  of the situation, Michoacan Senator Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi  said violence in certain areas of Chiapas has become another  element of destabilization. After reviewing the situation in  Chiapas, the group of 13 legislators from the six congressional  factions that make up the Congress drafted a 16-point proposal  asking all sectors of society to contribute to the solution of  the conflict.    When reading the document, Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi said  the  relations between the Federal Government and the state of  Chiapas should be strengthened. A cease-fire must go into effect  as a necessary condition for peace. The senator said criminal  laws should be revised, especially criminal proceedings against  Indians. Authorities must support the job being done by the  National Human Rights Commission in the southeastern part of the  country. There is also a need to review and speed up the  processing of documents concerning the granting of lands, as  well as other matters. Here are the statements made by Victor  Manuel Tinoco:    [Begin Tinoco recording] The Plural Group [Grupo Plural]  hopes Congress will continue to contribute to the resolution of  this conflict with the consensus of all political parties, and  it should draft an agenda of legislative proposals to contribute  to this end. The possibility of learning about its results in  subsequent periods should be left open. We ask that the  Permanent Commission authorize the Plural Group to give a  follow-up to the fulfillment and application of all these  recommendations and proposals and the other actions and  proposals brought forth by other national authorities concerning  these same problems. [end recording]    Moreover, the board of directors of the Chamber of Deputies  was installed a few minutes ago, following the Permanent  Commission session. It will guide the work to be done during  the special period of sessions to review and approve the bill  for a general amnesty in Chiapas. Institutional Revolutionary  Party Deputy (Juan Antonio Neme Dipp) was elected, and he will  be the one to chair the board of directors at the Chamber of  Deputies for this special period of sessions, which will begin  today.</p>

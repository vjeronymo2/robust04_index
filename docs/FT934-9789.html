			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: National Australia Bank to develop UK insurance NATIONAL AUSTRALIA Bank is seeking to build up a life and pensions operation in the UK, and is considering acquisitions, joint ventures or the creation of a new life company. The Melbourne-based bank - which owns the Yorkshire, Clydesdale, Northern and National Irish banks in the UK and Ireland - has appointed a team of senior executives to develop the insurance activities of these four subsidiaries. This will be headed by Mr John Windeler, currently NAB's chief financial officer, who recently relocated to the UK. NAB has also recruited three British insurance industry executives - Mr Michael Pinder, formerly marketing director at Prudential Life and Pensions, Mr Jonathan Rasleigh, who was finance and operations director at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, and Mr Richard Field, from the TSB Group. Mr Windeler made clear that, aside from expanding existing 'independent financial adviser' operations, NAB is considering a range of ways in which to build up the UK insurance business. These could include acquisitions, a life company 'start-up', or joint venture arrangements. NAB is seen as one of the strongest of Australia's banks, and analysts note that there has been emphasis recently on 'cross-selling' - not only within traditional banking products, but also including insurance and superannuation schemes. There has also been speculation that the company would hit the acquisition trail, looking both within its existing geographical areas and, possibly, the US. The planned move into the UK life insurance and pensions industry comes at a time when over-capacity is widely recognised as a problem in the British life industry, and the regulatory regime for companies is expected to become tougher in the immediate future. But Mr Michael Wadsworth, partner in the insurance practice at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co, said that the prospect of a shake-out in the industry would not dismay newcomers confident they had a competitive advantage which would enable them to continue, and perhaps even to benefit from the inability of other offices to survive. 'Banks and building societies appear to have the potential to sell long-term products to customers at lower cost,' he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGES PROBE PROSECUTORS' CHOICES ON DRUG ARRESTS;  </P> <P> ENFORCEMENT: DEFENSE LAWYERS CLAIM POLICE TARGET MINORITIES UNDER 'SCHOOLYARD'  LAW. PROSECUTORS SAY OFFICERS GO WHERE PROBLEM IS GREATEST.  </P> <P> Three federal judges sharply questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers Monday  about claims that the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has selectively  targeted blacks and Latinos for prosecution under a 1986 federal law requiring  stiff prison terms for dealing drugs near schoolyards, playgrounds and video  arcades.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. said the judges had decided to jointly  question the lawyers because nine currently pending cases in federal court here  raise the same question. But Byrne said the judges would rule separately on  whether each case should be dismissed on grounds of selective prosecution.  </P> <P> Congress passed the so-called "schoolyard law" as part of the Controlled  Substances Act to combat drug sales within 1,000 feet of a schoolyard, or 100  feet of a playground or video arcade.  </P> <P> Local authorities have made virtually every arrest in these cases in Southern  California. They then consulted the U.S. attorney's office to determine whether  the defendant should be prosecuted in state or federal court.  </P> <P> Where these cases are prosecuted is significant, because federal sentences are  stiffer. For example, a defendant in state court could receive only a six-month  sentence for an offense that would bring 20 years in federal court.  </P> <P> Judge Byrne said the defense lawyers would have a tough task to prove selective  prosecution.  </P> <P> "We might be terribly concerned about how these cases were selected," he said,  but "the only way you can prevail on this motion is to prove that the selection  (of defendants) was made on the basis of race."  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office set up a special program to prosecute schoolyard  cases in 1987.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Mary Gibbons of North Hollywood told the judges that since  then, 91 of the 92 people charged under the law in federal court here were  either black or Latino. She said this showed that the U.S. attorney's office  was intentionally targeting minorities for prosecution.  </P> <P> "They're only looking in South-Central Los Angeles and the Hispanic areas,"  Gibbons said. "They're just not looking in white areas for schoolyard cases.  They're only looking in areas where they're going to find minorities."  </P> <P> Such enforcement, she said, raises further questions about the tactics of the  Los Angeles Police Department and the U.S. attorney's office..  </P> <P> Gibbons said the U.S. attorney's office has jurisdiction in seven Southern  California counties, but the only cases it had filed under the schoolyard law  were generated by police agencies in Los Angeles County -- primarily the Los  Angeles Police Department.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madision replied that "race was not a factor" in  the office's decisions on whom to prosecute. He said the decisions were based  on criteria set out by former U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner Jr. -- primarily the  quantity of drugs sold and whether the person had prior convictions. Persons  who did not meet the criteria were referred to the district attorney's office  for prosecution in state court.  </P> <P> However, Madison said he did not know the answer to several questions posed by  judges Byrne, Terry J. Hatter Jr. and Mariana R. Pfaelzer. They included how  many of the cases involved children, how many of the arrests were made at  night, how many of the arrests were made in public housing projects and the  racial composition of persons whose cases were referred to state court. Federal  Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. also participated in Monday's hearing, but did not  question the attorneys.  </P> <P> The judges indicated that they were wary of granting defense lawyers extensive  discovery because of what they considered the wide-ranging nature of the  requests. Judge Pfaelzer called their request for information on how officials  in the LAPD made decisions about what areas to target "very-far reaching."  </P> <P> However, the judges also indicated that they were puzzled that there were  virtually no cases involving white defendants, as it is well-known that there  is considerable drug-dealing in some white neighborhoods and in some schools  with predominantly white student bodies.  </P> <P> "Why are all these cases from minority areas?" Hatter asked Madison.  </P> <P> "The police went where they thought the problems were the greatest," the  prosecutor replied.  </P> <P> Later, Hatter said he believed the LAPD could generate cases from white schools  because "they have undercover agents" in those schools.  </P> <P> "Isn't the real problem (that) nothing was being presented to you (for  prosecution) except minority cases?" Pfaelzer asked Madison.  </P> <P> He responded that he didn't know, because "we don't keep records on race."  </P> <P> For months, several federal judges have privately expressed dismay about some  of the schoolyard cases filed in Los Angeles. The judges feel that some of  these cases are more appropriate for state court because they are generated by  local law enforcement and do not involve large-scale crimes.  </P> <P> Byrne said he had handled one case where "a 20-year-old girl" was charged and  convicted under the law after selling $25 worth of crack cocaine to an elderly  LAPD informant while in her boyfriend's apartment in a housing project within  1,000 feet of a schoolyard.  </P> <P> The woman received a five-year sentence, a mandatory minimum under current  federal law. Byrne questioned the wisdom of "the prosecutorial discretion"  involved in filing the case in federal court rather than state court.  </P> <P> "That's a separate question" from selective prosecution, Madison responded.  </P> <P> "I guess it is," Byrne said. "I hope someone is thinking about it because a  substantial number of us are deeply concerned about those decisions."  </P></p>

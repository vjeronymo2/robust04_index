			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (6 May) TURAN--The refusal by Azerbaijan to  sign the final document for the regulation of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict irritated Russian's political  circles which was the initiator of the meeting. "We were not  able to obtain from Azerbaijan official recognition of  Nagorno-Karabakh, which is a partner to the conflict side, but  attempts in this direction will continue", said a senior  officials of the Russian Parliament in his conversation with a  TURAN correspondent. The same source notes that Moscow will do  its best to achieve this purpose and "will use means not only of  a diplomatic character."    According to information made available to TURAN's  correspondent in Moscow by Russian Parliament sources, in  Bishkek's document a cease fire from midnight on 8 May is  provided for, whence after the fighting sides will cease  military actions in the region. A de-blockading of  energy-transportation communications together with the  separation of troops is also included in the provisions.    In the Bishkek document, the term "fighting sides" means  only  Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh.    In the protocol there lacks a concrete definition of the  mechanism which provides for the return of hundreds of thousands  of Azeri refugees to their homes.    In the document there is also an appeal to the CIS about  sending peace making forces of the CIS to the conflict area.    According to TURAN, Azerbaijan refused to sign the Bishkek  document because the Bishkek document does not consider the  total withdrawal by Armenian units from Azeri-occupied  territories. Rather is only the separation of sides along the  frontline.    Another reason for Azerbaijan's non-signing is because the  protocol envisages the stationing of supervisory posts of  Russian army in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan thinks that the  location of separation forces can be achieved only after the  liberation of all occupied territories.    The protocol also calls for the creation of a security zone,  which in fact spans the territory of western Azerbaijan from the  Kura River to the Araks River. Azerbaijan will have less  control over this territory, thereby forcing Baku to reconcile  its loss of control over this part of the territory, including  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Another main point raised during this meeting was the  refusal  to permit the Azeri representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to be a  separate participant in the negotiations surrounding the Bishkek  document. Neither the Russians, nor the Armenians want to allow  the Azeri representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to participate in  the negotiations as a separate entity. "If the right to sign  the document is conceded to Armenian community of  Nagorno-Karabakh, then the same right should be given to the  Azerbaijan community of Nagorno-Karabakh whose leader is  Shusha's Mayor Nizami Bakhmanov," said Afiaddin Dzhalilov, the  vice-speaker of the Azerbaijani Parliament.    The Azerbaijani delegation also stated that the proposed  document does not reflect the fact that Azeri territory is  "occupied." There is only mention that these territories have  been "captured." According to Dzhalilov, such an interpretation  is a misrepresentation of the political and legal nature of the  conflict. The next meeting for the regulation of the conflict  will be held in St Petersburg.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (3): Labour laws weigh heavily - Employment / Changes to its rigid legislation are vital if Spain is to continue to attract investment THE DECISION last month by Volkswagen, the German car producer, to close down the Barcelona plant of its Spanish subsidiary Seat sent shudders through the city. Under VW's plans, 9,000 employees will be made redundant or retired early and, unions claim, 30,000 to 50,000 indirect jobs will be affected. Some saw the writing on the wall two years ago when Akzo, the Dutch chemicals and fibres group, closed its Barcelona factory, La Seda, and added the unit's 2,600 labour force to Spain's growing legion of unemployed. Like Seat's Zona Franca plant, which was built in 1951 on the city's outskirts, La Seda, dating from the turn of the century, was an emblem of Barcelona's industrial might. 'What worries me is the whole philosophy that governs foreign investment,' says Antoni Negre, chairman of Barcelona's chamber of commerce. 'The multinational quite rightly wants a return on its outlay and it requires a proper labour market framework in order to maintain its investment.' Seat's losses - estimated to be about Dollars 770m this year - are denting VW's balance sheet and La Seda's 1990 shortfall of Dollars 26.6m contributed to a 30 per cent decline in Azko's results that year. 'The Dutch made a serious proposal to restructure La Seda, but it was not accepted and they just walked away,' Mr Negre says. VW is not walking away. It plans to step up production at a highly automated Dollars 2.2bn Seat plant which it opened earlier this year in Martorell, 35km west of Barcelona. But industrial action - prompted by the Zona Franca closedown and spilling over to the Martorell factory - will not make the German group enthusiastic about its Spanish subsidiary. Spain's labour legislation, which is bureaucratic and weighted towards rigid job classifications and fixed employment, is a problem that affects the entire domestic productive system. But it is in Barcelona that the legislation's negative effects appear to be most keenly felt. The Spanish government is seeking to change the domestic hiring and firing rules as part of a general deregulation of the labour market. It is encountering strong union resistance, not least in Barcelona's industrial belt, but business leaders insist that sweeping changes are essential if Spain is to continue to attract multinationals. Volkswagen delivered its blow last month and Nissan could deliver one later this month for it is seeking to axe at least 1,100 jobs from the 7,000 labour force that it employs at its plant close by the stricken Seat factory in the Zona Franca area. What the city's business leaders hope is that the unions will be amenable and will accept whatever cuts are necessary, as cheaply as possible, in order to salvage the investment. Nissan, which produces Vanettes and Patrols at its Barcelona plant, is the showpiece of Japanese investment in the city and it has helped to attract 117 fellow Japanese companies to the Barcelona area - a figure that represents 85 per cent of Japanese industrial investment in Spain. Just as importantly, Nissan is, with Seat, the only car producer installed in Spain with its own on-site design centre and is thus able to place orders directly with local suppliers. The manner in which Seat has been pushed to the edge could, however, be salutary. At one point VW reportedly planned to absorb the Spanish unit altogether, bury the Seat trademark, wind up the Martorell design centre and turn that plant into a mere assembly centre for imported parts. Now VW is promising to step up its purchase of Spanish-made components for Seat in order to soften the blow of the Zona Franca closedown. VW has given the go-ahead for a Dollars 230m investment which will raise the proportion of Spanish components in Seat cars from 54 per cent to 67 per cent. The hope is that most, if not all, of this additional supply will be manufactured on the same Zona Franca plant site that Seat is vacating. If this project is delivered as planned, Barcelona, for all its present shudders, will have reason to congratulate itself. The city's pride in its manufacturing muscle will remain intact for it will have lost an obsolete plant and gained a forward-looking industrial park.</p>

Saying that he had the great honor of meeting with the great  President Kim Il-song, Reverend Graham said he rejoiced over the  meeting. Noting that he is currently reading the great leader's  memoirs zealously, he said: After having learned the fact that  Christian followers actively supported the great President Kim  Il-song's revolutionary activities through his memoirs, I was as  delighted as the followers were. He added that Rev. Son Pyong-no  had helped President Kim Il-song a great deal and noted that the  reverend's family enjoyed being with President Kim Il-song. The  great leader is a strong and wise leader.    He continued to say that he is well acquainted with the dear  leader and stated that all DPRK people highly respect him.  Recalling the fact that this is his second visit, he said: New  streets are laid in Pyongyang. Pyongyang is beautiful, clean,  and brilliant. A smile is on everybody's face and I can clearly  read the DPRK people's state of mind. I can never forget my  Pyongyang visit.    Touching on the fact that the DPRK people experienced agony  and sorrow for almost half a century due to the country's  division, Rev. Graham said: I can feel their agony and sorrow  deeply. However, I cannot fully understand those feelings since  I am not a party concerned. As I said two years ago during my  Pyongyang visit, the United States and the former Soviet Union  are responsible for the Korean division. The two countries  pursued their interests in Korea, a weak power. Even nowadays,  there are many cases of big powers demanding sacrifices from  weak powers. I hope my current visit will contribute to reunify  Korea and promote DPRK-U.S. relations. I visited your country  out of responsibility that I will do my utmost for peace and  reconciliation. I would like to pray for the great President  Kim Il-song and thank the leaders [yongdoja] of the DPRK.    Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the Central Committee of the  Korean Christian Federation; and Chong Chae-chol, chairman of  the Central Committee of the Korea Catholics Association;  religious followers and residents of Pyongyang were present.</p>

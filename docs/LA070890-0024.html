			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISASTER RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES  </P> <P> During the recent heat wave, at about midnight, we were awakened by a stranger  ringing our doorbell.  </P> <P> He was driving on Rodeo Road and told us that the planting area at the rear of  our property was on fire. I called the Fire Department and was told it had  already been reported. Another stranger seeing the situation had gone to the  nearest phone and called the Fire Department. The damage was minimal.  </P> <P> Both gentlemen stayed with us until there was no longer any danger. We do not  have sufficient words to thank these two wonderful people. Our faith in  humanity has been greatly reinforced.  </P> <P> ETHEL L. BLUMBERG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

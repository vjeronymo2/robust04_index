			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / French count cost of bank's freedom MAKING the Bank of France independent is to cost the French state FFr36bn (Dollars 6.46bn). The sum is the depreciation in the value of France's foreign exchange reserves since 1982, caused by the rise of the franc, largely against the dollar. Up to now, the depreciation has appeared as a charge against an exchange rate stabilisation fund on the Bank of France's books. The state has then been responsible for settling up with the bank to cover this fund. Where it has not done so, the outstanding account has effectively been an interest-free loan by the bank to the government. Under a bill to make the bank independent, which the Balladur government is piloting through parliament, and indeed under the Maastricht treaty, the Bank of France will be forbidden to lend to the government in this way. The central bank will, instead, write the country's foreign exchange reserves into its own balance sheet, and assume the exchange risk on these reserves itself. An accompanying bill proposed by the cabinet this week would stop new advances by the central bank to the government. To wipe the slate clean, it would also require that the government start paying 5 per cent interest on the FFr36bn and repay it to the Bank of France over the next 10 years. Such revenue will help the Bank of France become financially, as well as politically, independent. Commercial banks claim to be worried by the degree to which the central bank can fund itself and its 17,000 employees. Some banks have been arguing that so inefficient is the central bank that it cannot 'break even' if it lets interest rates drop below 7 per cent. The Bank of France counters that it might only go into the red if interest rates fall, implausibly, to around 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: IBC plans to remove banks' control INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Communications (Holdings), the conference and newsletter publishing group, yesterday announced a package of proposals including a Pounds 20m placing and open offer. The proposals are designed to cut group debt by three quarters, remove the banks' controlling interest, and enable it to resume dividend payments. Shares in the company, which yesterday forecast an operating profit of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.28m) and a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 750,000 (Pounds 572,000) in the six months to June 30, jumped by 3 1/2 p to 12p after the announcement. Mr Peter Rigby, chairman and chief executive, said the proposals would 'normalise' the group, which is currently controlled by a group of seven banks which hold 62.9 per cent of the equity. The centrepiece of the proposals is the planned placing and open offer of 22.3m shares at 90p through Williams de Broe. Qualifying shareholders will be offered 11 offer shares for every 75 existing shares. Subject to subscriptions under the open offer, up to 74.3 per cent of the shares have already been firmly placed with institutional investors. The group also plans a 1-for-10 share consolidation, mainly to facilitate the placing and open offer. The bulk of the Pounds 18m net proceeds from the placing and open offer will be used to reduce the group's debt which is made up of Pounds 55m in bank term loans and Pounds 27m of debenture stock. The bank loans comprise an Pounds 18.3m interest bearing loan and Pounds 36.7m of non-interest bearing loans. Under the terms of a conditional agreement with the banks to reduce and simplify the structure of the debt, the non-interest bearing loans will be cancelled, the interest-bearing loan will be reduced by Pounds 2.8m and the debenture stock will mostly be redeemed early at a discount. Overall the measures will reduce borrowings by about Pounds 66.5m to Pounds 15.5m and will cut the banks' shareholding to about 19.6 per cent. Following the reorganisation The group expects to pay a final dividend of not less than 2p for the current year. COMMENT IBC's package of proposals makes a lot of sense and, as Mr Rigby suggests, should provide 'a sound base for growth in profits and shareholder value.' For their part the banks have probably already written off the bulk of the non-interest bearing loans and deeply discounted debenture stock. The company will end up with a single interest-bearing loan it can afford to service and shareholders, including the banks, will see dividend payments again. Meanwhile the group's 28 managers, who have invested Pounds 2m of their own money over the past few years should, should provide the impetus for the group to move forward again.</p>

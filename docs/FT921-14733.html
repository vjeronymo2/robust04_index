			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Australian retailer may float Woolworths chain ADSTEAM, the Australian retailing and manufacturing group which is being restructured by its banks, yesterday confirmed it is considering floating its Woolworths supermarket chain after the completion of a ADollars 6bn (USDollars 4.4bn) refinancing deal. 'A float of Woolworths is constantly under review. However, no decision has been made on the timing of a float, and no decision is imminent,' said Mr George Haines, the group's chief executive. Analysts say Woolworths could raise between ADollars 1.5bn and ADollars 2bn on the Australian stock exchange, which would make it Australia's second highest capitalised retailer. Woolworths is the main competitor to Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailing chain. It has continued to perform strongly in spite of Adsteam's financial problems. Woolworths made pre-tax profits of ADollars 211m in the year to June, and is expected to report profits of about ADollars 240m this year. Growth is expected to slow over the next few years following the completion of an investment programme. Mr Haines said Adsteam was able to consider Woolworths' flotation 'in an orderly manner' because of the completion of a refinancing deal for Industrial Equity (IEL), the Adsteam affiliate which owns Woolworths. IEL, jointly owned by three other Adsteam companies, has agreed credit lines of ADollars 1.45bn with a syndicate of 14 banks which replaced its previous 51 lenders. Adsteam said refinancing agreements for other companies in the group would soon be completed, and would involve a cur in the number of participating banks. Adsteam is said to have negotiated with about 80 banks. The Adsteam group, formerly run by Mr John Spalvins, reported a consolidated net loss of ADollars 1.57bn for the year to June, following interim losses of ADollars 1.2bn. Adsteam's banks stepped in to restructure it in late 1990, after the shares came under selling pressure due to concern about the group's cross-shareholding structure and extensive inter-company debt. Mr Spalvins and two other directors were fired in December 1990.</p>

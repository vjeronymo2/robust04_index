			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule incorporates lessons ACF has learned from our initial experience with the title IV-A and CCDBG programs. Our purpose is to remove barriers, promote coordination, foster higher quality care, and champion the health of our neediest children. We have evaluated State and Tribal child care program plans, conducted many child care program field reviews, sponsored two national child care conferences, held symposia for States and Tribes, and participated in many other conferences and meetings. We have listened as State representatives and others voiced desire for remedies of regulatory barriers to the operation of seamless child care delivery systems and for the ability to deliver higher quality care. This section of the preamble gives an overview of our findings and considerations. These ideas for change are developed in greater detail later in the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are four main purposes of this proposed rule. First, it is a vehicle for responding to changes needed to existing regulations to achieve consistency with recently enacted law. We thus propose changes to the CCDBG regulations required by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992 and the Older Americans Act Technical Amendments. We also propose amendments and provide guidance in the preamble on how payments for special needs children can be made under both title IV-A child care and CCDBG in light of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Public Law 101&hyph;336, enacted on July 26, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, these proposals reflect ACF's desire to help States facilitate operation of the title IV-A and CCDBG programs based on the experiences of both States and families with existing program policy. The changes will give States some immediate relief to certain regulatory barriers. Many of these proposals will permit States to coordinate the four programs better, making services more seamless for child care providers and families. Allowing for greater conformity among the sliding fee scales for title IV-A child care and CCDBG is an example of this kind of effort. Allowing States to determine physical or mental incapacity of children to be served under title IV-A consistent with CCDBG rules is another example.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, our objective in proposing these changes is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strengthen States' capacity to ensure the quality of federally-subsidized child care services by removing regulatory barriers. We believe the quality of federally-subsidized child care is important and want to promote safe and healthy environments for children that foster their development and overall well-being. We wish to further foster quality in partnership with the States. Our proposals to foster quality include eliminating the regulation in the CCDBG that limits payment differentials within categories of care to no more than 10 percent. We also propose to allow States to pay the actual charge for higher quality child care for children in title IV-A programs, without regard to the 75th percentile of the local cost of care, for child care that meets State-designated objective standards of quality that exceed the normal licensing or certification requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the health of children plays an overwhelmingly important role in their well-being and their ability to grow and develop into productive citizens. We therefore propose to amend the CCDBG health and safety standards to require that children receiving CCDBG services receive immunizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, this proposed rule goes beyond adoption of technical refinements to ACF-administered child care programs. It represents ACF's efforts to think more broadly about helping States better serve low-income families through subsidized child care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulations for the title IV-A child care programs are published under the general authority of 1102 of the Social Security Act which requires the Secretary to publish regulations that may be necessary for the efficient administration of the functions for which she is responsible under the Act. Section 658E of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act requires that the Secretary shall by rule establish the information needed in the Block Grant plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was difficult for us to determine the actual cost implications of the regulation because most of the changes are optional with States. We did not know how many States would adopt these options, or whether States would make other programmatic changes which would counteract any potential increases in costs. Therefore, we are explicitly seeking comments on the cost implications of the proposed changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing a new requirement that children be immunized in order to receive services under the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The CCDBG health and safety regulations currently require States and Tribes to include provisions about immunizations in their CCDBG plans and to provide assurances that requirements with respect to immunizations are in place. In addition, most States already include immunizations in their child care standards. We do not anticipate that our proposal will have a significant negative impact on either grantees or families, since grantees will not be required to provide immunizations directly and families who receive subsidized child care are by law eligible for free immunizations under such federally supported programs as Medicaid, the Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) Program, and the new Vaccines for Children program. The immunization provision was considered the most cost-effective and least burdensome approach because: (1) It helps ensure that vulnerable young children are immunized; (2) immunization of such children is highly cost-effective; and (3) it provides flexibility to grantees in determining how to implement the provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

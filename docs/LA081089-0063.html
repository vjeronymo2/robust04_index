			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS W.A.S.P.  </P> <P> W.A.S.P. made its local reputation in the early '80s by wearing codpieces and  chain-sawing sides of beef on stage at the Troubadour -- the band was to heavy  metal what Gallagher is to comedy. It made its international reputation with a  very tasteful song called ". . . Like a Beast" and sold out vast arenas  worldwide. Lead guitarist Chris Holmes was the guy you saw drowning himself in  vodka in front of his mom in Penelope Spheeris' rockumentary "Decline of  Western Civilization II."  </P> <P> This year, less noisy than Poison and less evil than Slayer, outflanked by real  speed-metal bands the way Playboy centerfolds were by Penthouse's, the  W.A.S.P.-ers have kind of belatedly decided to become socially conscious,  probably because they got sick of playing shows where Metallica shirts  outnumbered theirs 10 to 1. They got Metal Church, a genuine, if dorky,  political speed-metal band to doze through an opening set. They took a stand  against the neutron bomb, only a dozen or so years after the Weirdos did. And  if their on-stage denunciations of substance abuse are less than convincing,  well . . . so are their riffs.  </P> <P> W.A.S.P.'s stage set sort of resembles Peter Sellars' vision of hell in "Don  Giovanni," with cardboard flames consuming sinners, a city and a giant death's  head. And Tuesday W.A.S.P. was nothing but professional, leaping about at the  half-empty Santa Monica Civic as if it were still headlining a packed Long  Beach Arena. "Singer" Blackie Lawless growled OK, in a fluffier sort of way  than he used to, and Holmes' solo on a cover of the chestnut "I Don't Need No  Doctor" was almost as good as when Peter Frampton used to do it with Humble  Pie.JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

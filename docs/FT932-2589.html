			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: New role in prospect for cold war relic COCOM, the western watchdog on sensitive exports to Communist countries, stands to become the latest casualty of the cold war under plans for it to police non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction from both west and east. While President Boris Yeltsin continues to complain about Cocom restrictions on exports of advanced technology to Russia, the Paris-based Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls has been holding quiet consultations on a new form of co-operation with former Soviet bloc countries. Western diplomats said the two sides had agreed a procedure for gradually lifting remaining restrictions on former Soviet republics as they implement their own effective export controls modelled on the Cocom system. The idea is to prevent western and Soviet technology alike falling into the third world hands. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, the main successor republic and the biggest producer and owner of nuclear weapons, found itself without proper borders between itself and the other newly independent republics. This made it vulnerable to the dangers of illegal exports of its own sensitive technology. Its lack of controls has also stoked fears of potential trading partners that their technology could easily be passed on to third countries. The transformation is likely to pick up steam once Russia submits a long-delayed letter committing itself to a new export control system. The advantages for Russia are three-fold: it will be able to buy freely western sophisticated technology with potential military applications; it will be in a stronger position to export its own military technology; and it will learn from western countries experience in what one diplomat described 'controlling exports without stifling companies'.</p>

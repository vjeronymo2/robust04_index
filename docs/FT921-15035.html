			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Management: Backward coming forward BRITAIN, it is considered good practice to put an oil tray under a machine to collect drips, but in Germany trays are not needed because machines do not leak. This observation is contained in a new survey which confirms that corporate purchasers in the UK are a walk-over. They are least likely among those in the big four European economies - Britain, Germany, Italy and France - to fulfil the role of 'demanding customers'. The study, undertaken by London Business School researchers on behalf of Korda &amp; Company, the London-based consultants and venture capitalists, was based on responses from 37 companies in four industries: woodworking machinery, broadcasting equipment, high-technology engineering and specialty chemicals. Some 87 per cent of all respondents said they believed businesses benefited from demanding customers while a total of 76 per cent believed that they benefited from having demanding customers in their own home market. Overall the study reaches three main conclusions Just over half of all respondents agreed that customers in some countries were more demanding than in others. Where country differences were perceived, German customers were seen as the most demanding for quality, technical innovation and customer service. UK purchasers were the least likely customers to put pressure on suppliers to upgrade product quality or introduce innovative features. Both the bias against long-term relationships and the relative lack of interest in quality and innovation work against UK purchasers. The researchers say this means British suppliers need to look outside the UK to form beneficial relationships with demanding customers. 'Never Mind the Quality ..'

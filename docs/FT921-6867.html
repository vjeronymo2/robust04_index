			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / India raises rail fares by 20% THE Indian government yesterday raised passenger rail fares by about 20 per cent in a move seen as a foretaste of the austerity budget expected later this week. The sharp increase in fares reflects the pressure on the government to cut the budget deficit through reducing financial support to public sector units. The railways, the budget for which was presented to parliament yesterday, is the largest of the government-owned enterprises. The increase, which follows a 10-20 per cent increase in rail fares in July, means that the railways revenue from passenger traffic will rise by 33 per cent in 1992-93 over the original budget estimates for the current year. Mr CK Jaffer Sharief, the railways minister, told parliament the cost of running uneconomic lines had risen more than fivefold from Rs4bn (Pounds 88m) in 1980-81 to Rs22.2bn last year. In an effort to generate further financial resources, Mr Sharief said that the railways would seek to lease or sell some of the land it owns in central cities - beginning with Bombay. The armed forces, the largest landowners in the country, are to follow a similar policy as a way of raising funds. First class fares are to rise by 20 per cent and second class fares by about 17 per cent. Some season tickets will go up by 40-48 per cent. Mr LK Advani, the leader of the Hindu radical BJP party which until recently supported the government's liberalisation and restructuring programme, said the rail minister had 'not just been harsh. He has been cruel. As far as I recall such a massive hike in railway fares and freight is unprecedented.'</p>

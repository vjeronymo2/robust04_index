			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Sport: The best bows out - Tennis Just how good was she? That is the question everyone has been asking me. You know who we are talking about; Martina Navratilova, the 38-year-old Czech-born American who retired from singles on Tuesday in New York after two decades of unprecedented success that earned her more than Dollars 20m in prize money. Let us get the numbers out of the way first. Starting with a win in Orlando in 1974, she collected 167 tournament titles including 18 at the Grand Slams: two in France, three in Australia, four in America and a record nine at Wimbledon. Only Helen Wills Moody (19), the great American of the 1930s, and Australia's Margaret Court (24) have won more but 11 of Court's wins were in Australia in an era when few players travelled down under. Martina won 55 Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles and mixed, just seven short of Court's 62. What do the numbers tell us? First that Martina was not afraid to win, an affliction that assails more promising young players than you might imagine. When Martina first came to England in 1973, an athletic 17-year-old, she was representing Czechoslovakia in the BP Cup, an under-21 team event I organised for eight years during the winter. In the final the Czechs played Britain, who had beaten them 2-1 in the round robin. In that tie Martina had lost to Glynis Coles. In the second rubber of the final Martina faced Veronica Burton, four years her senior. Burton led 7-6 4-1 but Navratilova, attacking the baseliner with a fearless disregard for her accurate passing shots, won the next five games to win the second set and took the decider 6-4. Martina then had her revenge against Coles to clinch the tie. It was obvious that Martina loved competing. She had the natural serve-and-volley game so few women perfect. She was strong and fast. Her forehand and serve, both beautifully timed, were her winning weapons but her backhand was vulnerable. It was a sliced shot, rather like that of another Czech left-hander, Jaroslav Drobny. Unlike Drobny, Martina added a topspin backhand to her repertoire with the help of Renee Richards who coached her from 1981 to 1983. Ever the perfectionist, Martina realised that she needed expert help to eradicate weaknesses. One of those was a love of rich foods. On that first visit to Torquay, Dan Maskell and I drove the Czechs round to show them the sights. We thought they would like to visit Mike Sangster's sports shop. All they wanted was to sample the local ice-cream. Junk food was a problem for Martina following her defection to the US in 1975. During those first years in America Martina indulged herself. Freedom went to her head . . . and to her waistline. She became engaged in a succession of lesbian relationships that did nothing to enhance her image. To improve her fitness she turned to Nancy Lieberman, a basketball star, who made Martina aware of the sacrifices athletes must make. Martina was prepared to make them. She became one of the fittest, best trained athletes in the world. Her results proved it. For five years, between 1982 and 1986, Martina ruled the game losing only 14 matches. The match I remember as the peak of her career was the final of the French Open in 1984. On slow European clay, the surface that least favoured her game, and against her old friend and rival Chris Evert she contrived a 6-3 6-1 win that wasspellbinding in its efficiency. Aided by a succession of coaches, Martina prolonged her career with typical tenacity. Hard as she tried, a 10th title at her beloved Wimbledon eluded her this year. As she left the court to a standing ovation she knew that her decision to make this her last season of singles had been right. My lasting memory will be of that first Wimbledon win in 1978 when Martina beat Evert 7-5 in the final set. Her parents, unable to get a visa, were watching on TV at a friend's house near the German border. Martina was a lonely figure, still not sure of her place in the universe. The look of joy and relief on her face as she shook hands is etched on my mind. Martina knew at last that she was a true champion. Time to answer the question. How good was she? The best.</p>

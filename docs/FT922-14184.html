			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Letter: EC 'ignores' issues on fish conservation Sir, As reported by David Gardner ('EC urges Canada to face up to over-fishing problem', April 2), the European Commission is attempting to avoid its responsibility for the depletion of fish stocks off Newfoundland. In fact, the Commission has consistently failed to accept and abide by quotas set by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), of which the European Community is a member, in spite of its own high-minded rhetoric about supporting 'the creation of regional fisheries organisations and the strengthening of the existing ones'. The facts about European Community fishing in the NAFO area are clear and damning. For example, for the period 1986-1990, NAFO quotas for EC fleets for ground-fish totalled 96,377 tonnes. The EC reported catches by the Spanish and Portuguese fleets of 359,007 tonnes. The EC over-fished its quotas by at least 262,630 tonnes according to EC records. Canadian estimates are much higher and a considerable quantity of this catch consists of small fish taken by undersized nets before they have a chance to reproduce. The problem is clearly not one of 20,000 tonnes of fish as stated by EC Fisheries Commissioner, Mr Manuel Marin, in your article. The EC continues to ignore important NAFO conservation decisions, including a moratorium on fishing for Northern cod outside the Canadian 200-mile economic zone. During 1990, there were 130 EC vessels fishing off Newfoundland, in 1991 there were 149. On the other hand, Canada has responded to the fishery crisis by suspending the offshore fishery for Northern cod for the first six months of 1992. There are no Canadian vessels fishing for Northern cod while the EC continues to over-fish. Mr Marin asks for the same treatment as Cuba; Cuba abides by its NAFO obligations. Why doesn't Europe?

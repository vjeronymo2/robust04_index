			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Work Report of the Supreme People's Procuratorate" -- </F> delivered by Zhang Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme  People's Procuratorate, at the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress (NPC) on 15 March 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow deputies:    I would now like to deliver a report on the major situation  of procuratorial work in 1993 and the main tasks for 1994 at  this session. Please examine it.    In the past year, on the basis of the guidelines laid down  by  the 14th National Party Congress and the First Session of the  Eighth NPC, the Supreme People's Procuratorate assumed overall  responsibility for various procuratorial activities under the  principle of "strictly enforcing laws and paying close attention  to handling cases." People's procuratorates at all levels as  well as special procuratorates for the military and for railroad  transport departments strengthened their functions of legal  supervision; concentrated efforts on investigating such big,  important cases as corruption, bribery, and so forth; cracked  down on serious criminal activities; and investigated criminal  cases of infringement on the democratic rights of citizens and  dereliction of duty, thereby making positive contributions to  maintaining national and social stability and to ensuring the  establishment of a socialist market economy as well as the  smooth progress of modernization.  1. Procuratorial Organs Concentrated Efforts on  Investigating Big, Important Cases and Scored Certain  Achievements in the Anticorruption Drive.    In 1993, procuratorial organs across the country placed a  total of 56,491 criminal cases, including corruption and bribery  cases, on file for investigation. Among them 30,877 were  corruption and bribery cases; 13,148 cases of them involved  amounts between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan; 955 cases, between  100,000 and 500,000 yuan; 77 cases, between 500,000 and 1  million yuan; and 57 cases, over 1 million yuan. Embezzlement  cases numbered 13,663; 208 such cases involved amounts in excess  of 1 million yuan. There were 7,457 cases of tax evasion,  refusal to pay taxes, and obtainment of export duties drawback  from the state by fraud; 40 such cases involved amounts in  excess of 1 million yuan. There were 3,436 cases of trademark  infringement; 50 such cases involved amounts in excess of 1  million yuan. There were 1,037 cadres at the county  departmental level and above found guilty of the abovementioned  crimes and all of them were placed on file for investigation; 64  of them were cadres at departmental and bureau levels; and 1 of  them was a cadre at the vice ministerial level. Aside from  those criminal cases which are under investigation and  prosecution, misdemeanors which were absolved from prosecution,  and other misdeeds which did not constitute a crime and were  transferred to relevant departments for handling, the number of  criminals prosecuted on charges of the various crimes mentioned  above reached 19,357 as of the end of last year; 201 of them  were cadres at the county departmental level; and 16 of them  were cadres at departmental and bureau levels. Procuratorial  organs ordered the return of stolen money and goods amounting to  2.2 billion yuan to the authorities through the handling of such  criminal cases.    After Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech at  the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission on 21 August 1993, the party committees and  governments at all levels attached great importance to launching  the anticorruption drive. They adopted a resolute attitude,  took prompt actions, and did a large amount of work. Responding  to a call issued by the CPC Central Committee, the vast numbers  of cadres and the masses actively informed against and exposed  criminals guilty of corruption and bribery. Procuratorial  organs handled over 120,000 clues given by cadres and the masses  informing against criminals from September to December.  Procuratorates at all levels resolutely implemented the  guidelines of the instructions given by the CPC Central  Committee; upheld the principle -- "be sure to thoroughly and  accurately investigate criminal cases with firmness of resolve  and with care;" sorted out and investigated, one by one, the  clues given by the masses informing against criminals in big,  important cases; implemented a responsibility system for chief  procurators in handling cases; improved centralized command and  coordination; and concentrated efforts on cracking a number of  big, important cases. From September to December, procuratorial  organs placed on file for investigation a total of 8,538 big  cases of corruption and bribery involving amounts in excess of  10,000 yuan and embezzlement involving amounts in excess of  50,000 yuan, exceeding the same period of 1992 by 5,883 cases;  they placed 715 cadres at the county departmental level and  above (including 61 cadres at departmental and bureau levels) on  file for investigation and punishment for corruption and taking  bribes, more than the same period of 1992 by about 6.8 times.  From September 1993 to January 1994, procuratorial organs  prosecuted 14,649 criminals on charges of corruption and  accepting bribes; 182 of them were cadres at the county  departmental level; and 14 of them were cadres at departmental  and bureau levels. Through the cracking of big, important cases  and through the propaganda of legal policies, procuratorial  organs prompted a number of criminals to surrender to the  authorities. There were 671 criminals guilty of corruption and  other crimes who surrendered to procuratorial organs between  September and December.    1) Investigations and handling of criminal cases involving  embezzlement and bribery by staff members and leaders of party  and government organizations. Last year 6,011 cases of staff  members, including some senior leading cadres, of party and  government organizations were placed on file for investigations  of embezzlement and bribery. For example, the procuratorial  organ prosecuted, after completing its investigation, Li  Xiaoshi, vice minister in charge of the State Science and  Technology, for taking advantage of his position to support the  Beijing Great Wall Mechanical and Electrical Science,  Technology, and Industry Company's illegal fund-raising  activities, for accepting a 40,000 yuan bribe from its president  Shen Taifu and other bribes from Hong Kong businessmen, and for  embezzlement and ownership of huge assets with dubious sources.  While screening the Great Wall Company's illegal fund-raising  activities, the procuratorial organ investigated clues to  alleged embezzlement and offering and accepting of bribes by  staff members of the company and its branch offices and by its  shareholders. As of the end of last year, procuratorial organs  of Beijing Municipality and Liaoning, Guizhou, Guangdong, Gansu,  and Heilongjiang Provinces had placed on file for investigation  a total of 35 criminal cases related to the Great Wall Company  and over 20 party and government functionaries, journalists, and  accountants, who accepted bribes and facilitated the company's  illegal fund-raising activities. The Great Wall Company's  president, Shen Taifu, has been prosecuted for major  embezzlement and bribery crimes. Judging from the investigation  of the case, where principal leaders of a locality or department  are degenerate and commit embezzlement and bribery, crimes in  this locality or department will be relatively serious. The  Fujian provincial procuratorial organ cracked an extraordinary  criminal case of bribery involved the Minjiang Engineering  Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry. Five bureau-level  cadres, including the bureau director and party secretary, and  10 section-level cadres abused their powers of approving  engineering contracts, and solicited and accepted bribes  totaling more than 3 million yuan. Last September, the  procuratorial organ of Tieling city in Liaoning cracked a  shocking criminal case of embezzlement, bribery,  misappropriation of public funds, and tax evasion involving the  Changtu County Grain Bureau. Director Gui Bingquan, deputy  director Yang Maoyuan, and other bureau personnel abused their  powers to sell inferior quality equipment to grain depots in the  county, and collaborated in soliciting and accepting bribes.  After placing 43 persons on file for investigation, the  procuratorial organ decided to arrest 25 and confiscated 32  million yuan in illicit money.    2) Investigations and handling of criminal cases involving  embezzlement, solicitation and acceptance of bribes, and other  irregularities by judicial personnel. Last year the  procuratorial organs placed on file for investigation 1,840  criminal cases involving judicial personnel. Some of them  abused powers and perverted justice for bribes. For example,  Guo Zhengmin, director and party secretary of the Guozhou  Provincial Public Security Department, took advantage of his  position and power in illegally approving exit permits for other  people and accepted more than 100,000 yuan in bribes.  Procuratorate chief Chen Zhiwen of the Changping County  Procuratorate of Beijing Municipality abused power and accept  some 20,000 yuan in bribes. Li Kaifu, member of the Judicial  Committee and head of the No. 1 Criminal Court of the Hubei  Provincial Higher Court, accepted 10,000 yuan bribe from the  family of a death-row prisoner and promised to change the  verdict to a suspended death sentence. Individual judicial  personnel even colluded with criminal gangs in committing  crimes. The procuratorial organs serious investigated and  handled these criminal cases related to violations of law by  judicial personnel in the course of enforcing law, thereby  upholding the dignity and justice of the state laws.    3) Procuratorial authorities have prosecuted cases  involving administrative and law enforcing personnel soliciting  and accepting bribes. According to incomplete statistics, in  1993 procuratorial authorities investigated over 1,000 cases  concerning crimes committed by administrative and law  enforcement personnel. Abusing their authority, certain  administrative and law enforcement personnel solicited and  accepted bribes and withheld services if they were not paid.  Some even worked in collusion with felons and engaged in such  crimes as smuggling, letting in smuggled goods, and defrauding  the state on tax refunds, causing enormous losses to the state.  After being bribed by personnel of an import-export company in  Gansu, Wang Tianpeng, deputy director of the Gansu Taxation  Bureau, approved the refund of 810,000 yuan of taxes to the  company even though he knew clearly that the bills and vouchers  presented by the company for tax refund were forged. A lot of  money belonging to the state was thus swindled. Wang Youyi,  director of the Fujian Zhangzhou Custom Office, helped a  Zhanghai Company cheat the state for more than 6 million yuan  through importing 10,000 tonnes of tax- free rolled steel for  the company's consumption, in the name of 17 "foreign-funded"  enterprises. The company reaped illegitimate profits of 1.8  million yuan from business deals amounting to 34.7 million yuan.  Procuratorial authorities' prosecution of criminal cases  involving administrative and law enforcement personnel has  important significance for safeguarding the state's  administrative order as well as the establishment of a socialist  market economic system.    4) Procuratorial authorities have prosecuted corrupt and  bribe- accepting personnel of financial and economic  departments. In 1993, especially during the second half of the  year, procuratorial authorities at all levels coordinated  closely with the implementation of the CPC Central Committee and  State Council decision to strengthen macroeconomic regulation  and control, earnestly investigated crimes discovered during the  course of improving financial order and strengthening control of  the securities and real estate markets. The amounts of money  involved in the crimes committed by financial personnel -- who  extended loans against regulations, who took advantage of their  offices to solicit bribes and other personal interests, and who  embezzled public funds -- were generally quite large. Of the  number of cases investigated within financial departments last  year, 72 cases involved sums exceeding 1 million yuan. Zhao  Kai, manager of the business division of the Beijing Trust and  Investment Company under the China Agricultural Bank, extended  100 million yuan to two companies in violation of regulations  and accepted 1.3 million yuan in bribes and a "Benz 500" sedan,  which he later sold. Procuratorial authorities also  investigated many major cases in other economic departments.  Based on the clue provided by a letter, Chongqing's  procuratorial authorities cracked 28 major cases about  illegitimate loans extended between city and county (and  district) financial departments. A total of 36 people,  including six division cadres, were involved. Beijing's  procuratorial authorities prosecuted Guo Ziwen, president of the  China Coal Marketing and Delivering Company, for accepting  bribes totalling 1.9 million yuan by selling to nine enterprises  his company's quotas of foreign exchange equivalent to 19.34  million yuan. Procuratorial authorities of China's railroad  transport departments investigated 563 cases, involving 640  people who sought personal gains by means of railroad cars and  train tickets. The Guangzhou Railway Transport Procuratorate  cracked a case concerning workers of the Yangcheng Railway  Transport Company who accepted bribes through their offices for  authorizing use of railroad cars. Over 20 people were implicated  for accepting bribes and 16 people were implicated for paying  bribes. The procuratorate has set files for investigating 15  workers and held in custody cash, bank books, and stocks worth  more than 2.7 million yuan, as well as nearly 1,000 grams of  assorted gold jewelry. In the securities, stock, and real  estate markets established in recent years, some state  functionaries, for the sake of seeking personal gains, have  embezzled public funds for speculating in stocks and real  estate. Workers of departments in charge of securities  management and real estate development have taken advantage of  their offices to solicit bribes, carry out behind-the-scenes  deals, and practice fraud on the securities market. Last year,  procuratorial authorities in Shanghai, Guangdong, Guangxi,  Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Hunan prosecuted many cases in these  departments. Shanghai's procuratorial authorities prosecuted 45  cases in which 57.2 million yuan of public funds were misused  for speculation in the stock market. Guangdong's procuratorial  authorities cracked the case of Zeng Lihua, vice president of  the Shenzhen Engineering Consultative Company, who, through his  position of designating partners of real estate development,  accepted over 7 million yuan in bribes from foreign and Hong  Kong businessmen. Procuratorial authorities' prosecution of  crimes committed within financial and economic departments plays  a positive role in guaranteeing the implementation of the  state's decision to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control and improve financial order.    5) Various people's procuratorates investigated and  handled cases of smuggling activities by some organizations and  business undertakings and crimes of stealing state tax  reimbursements for exports and of imitating trademarks. In  recent years, some enterprises and business undertakings and  organizations have engaged in group smuggling, stealing state  tax reimbursements for exports, and imitating trademarks. Those  crimes happened again and again despite orders banning such  activities. A main reason was due to the support and connivance  of such activities by some local leaders. Some law enforcement  departments set fines instead of sentencing offenders to  imprisonment in handling those cases and indulged criminals.  This was a conspicuous situation of corruption in some locales.  To solve the problem of ineffectiveness in cracking down on  smuggling activities by some organizations and units, the  Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme People's Court  jointly issued a "Circular on Strictly Cracking Down on the  Crime of Smuggling Activities" last August, asking  procuratorates at various levels to follow Article 13 of the  Criminal Procedure Law of China which states that "cases that  the people's procuratorates consider necessary to directly  accept themselves are to be filed and investigated by the  people's procuratorates, which are to decide whether or not to  initiate a public prosecution" and directly place major  smuggling cases, which were only punished by fines and were not  investigated for their criminal responsibility, on file for  investigation and prosecution. Various procuratorates paid  particular attention to major cases of smuggling by  organizations and seriously handled cases of some leading  cadres' protecting and conniving with smuggling activities. In  1993, the Supreme People's Procuratorate directed and  coordinated with concerned procuratorates in handling 11 major  cases of smuggling by some organizations. Under the guidance of  and with the arrangements of concerned central departments,  procuratorates fully cooperated with other departments and  investigated and prosecuted an especially serious cigarette  smuggling case involving the Rushan City Commerce Bureau in  Shandong Province. Director of the bureau Liu Qishan  collaborated with Fan Zhanwu, political commissar of the Weihai  City Border Defense Subbureau; Liu Ning, deputy head of the  operations department of the Weihai City Defense Subbureau; and  Sun Xueping, deputy director of the Rushan City Public Security  Bureau, to engage in smuggling activities. Wang Jianshi,  secretary of the party committee of Rushan City, who bent the  law for the benefit of others, protected the smugglers and  accepted bribes totaling more than 220,000 yuan. After their  crimes were exposed, those criminals joined hands to resist  investigation. The concerned procuratorate initiated a public  prosecution of those law offenders with the local people's  court. According to a statistical report, procuratorates in the  country prosecuted 322 smugglers, including 214 people who were  involved in major smuggling of automobiles and cigarettes last  year.    Stealing state tax reimbursements for export commodities by  cheating is a new form of crime in recent years. Some law  offenders have collaborated with cadres of taxation, customs,  and foreign trade departments to steal state money by forging  vouchers, tax collection certificates, and customs declarations.  In light of the situation, various procuratorates have strictly  implemented the "supplementary provisions on punishing crimes of  evading taxes and resisting payment of taxes" adopted by the NPC  Standing Committee, and investigated and prosecuted a number of  major cases of stealing state tax money by law offenders,  including some organizations and units. Various people's  procuratorates investigated and prosecuted 81 such cases  involving 259 people. They placed the cases of taking part in  tax fraud, accepting bribes and malfeasance involving 48 state  functionaries on file for investigation and prosecution, and  recovered more than 70 million yuan of state tax money.    In recent years, the crimes of imitating trademarks and  producing and selling fake and shoddy products have been quite  serious with large volumes and dimensions and different forms.  Some serious crimes of imitating trademarks were committed by  enterprises and business undertakings. People's procuratorates  at various levels strictly implemented the provisions adopted by  the NPC Standing Committee on punishing the crimes of imitating  trademarks and of producing and selling fake and shoddy products  and took resolute measures to crack down on those crimes. In  1993, people's procuratorates placed 3,436 cases of imitating  trademarks on file for investigation and prosecution, increasing  by 10 percent as compared with the previous year. Of which, 720  cases involved organizations. Through handing those cases, some  100 million yuan was recovered. The procuratorates in Henan  Province investigated and prosecuted the case of manufacturing  and selling fake medicine by the No. 1 veterinary medicine plant  in Zhoukou Prefecture, and investigated six party and government  leading cadres and administrative staff members, who accepted  bribes and supported and connived the illegal activity, for  their criminal responsibility. Among those cadres, Shenqiu  County's Party Committee Secretary Liu Weidong and deputy county  head Cui Donghua were sentenced to eight and nine years of  fixed-term imprisonment respectively by the local people's court.    6) A number of important embezzlers and bribe-takers who  escaped with the money have been captured. In recent years,  many embezzlers and bribe-takers escaped with the money and some  of them held several foreign passports, deposited the money  abroad, and fled the country either after committing the crimes  or after their crimes were detected. In view of the situation,  the procuratorial organs have stepped up efforts to pursue the  fugitives. According to incomplete statistics, more than 600  such escapees were captured in 1993, and 19 of them committed  crimes each involving more than 1 million yuan. Those who were  captured abroad and repatriated home included Wen Shixing,  manager of Haicheng Trading Company of Shenzhen who swindled the  state of a large sum of export tax refund and fled the country  for as long as three years; Peng Jiandong, president of Yuanye  Industry Company, Ltd. of Shenzhen who embezzled a large amount  of public funds and fled the country; and Wang Jianye, chief of  the finance and trade section of the Shenzhen city planning  bureau who joined others in taking 6.77 million yuan in bribes.    7) Achievements were made in preventing such crimes as  embezzlement and bribery. Local procuratorates pay attention to  using actual cases in interpreting laws and using typical cases  in spreading legal knowledge and promoting ethical integrity  among state functionaries. They publicize state laws and party  policies through the news media to enhance the people's  awareness of the legal system. They have improved information  work and their ability in detecting embezzlement, bribery, and  other crimes. During the course of handling cases, they put  forward suggestions concerning loopholes in the management and  system of relevant organizations. They supervise the  establishment and improvement of the embezzlement and bribery  prevention mechanisms in law enforcement departments and at  workposts which have personnel, financial, and material  resources under their direct control.    The cases investigated and handled by procuratorial organs  show the following characteristics of such serious crimes as  embezzlement and bribery at present: First, the crimes involve  large amounts of money and the number of extraordinarily serious  cases has increased. Second, more cases happen in hot spots of  economic construction and in the departments which perform  important functions in the market economy; and some new forms of  crime have occurred in the stock, securities, and real estate  markets. Third, more crimes involve persons with certain  powers, most embezzlers are persons who manage money or  materials, and most bribe-takers are those who control  personnel, financial, or material resources. Fourth, a  considerably large percentage of the criminals are of the  pleasure-seeking type, and many of them spend freely, indulge in  dissipation, and engage in gambling and visiting prostitutes  after committing crimes. Fifth, more cases happen in the  departments with serious irregularities, particularly the  departments of which the principal leaders are embezzlers or  bribe-takers. Chances are the investigation of a single person  usually leads to discovering a number of criminals. Sixth, the  number of cases each involving more than one person has  increased, and many cases are characterized by collusion between  insiders and outsiders, between different departments or trades,  or between different regions.    Generally speaking, the great majority of party workers and  state functionaries are honest and self-disciplined and are  diligently working for the people. However, a small number of  bad degenerates indeed exist, and we must know sufficiently  their harmfulness and dangerousness. Just as Comrade Jiang  Zemin pointed out at the second plenary session of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection, if we lower our guard and  let them go rampant, our party, the people's regime, and the  socialist modernization drive will collapse.    The present situation of the anticorruption struggle is very  good and the struggle is deepening, but the following major  problems still exist: The anticorruption work is uneven from  place to place. The phenomena of substituting one's word for  law, putting one's power above the law, or obstructing judicial  investigation of major cases occurs now and then. Some  organizations fail to inform judicial organs of criminal clues.  Procuratorial organs have a heavy backlog of reported crimes to  investigate. Some local chief procurators lack the courage to  enforce the law impartially and to handle tough cases. A small  number of police cadres and men are unable to meet the needs of  the struggle due to poor ability, and the police force needs to  improve its overall ability of detecting and proving crimes.  These problems must be solved one by one in the days to come.  To combat corruption and punish those who commit embezzlement  or bribery is a protracted and arduous task, as well as an  important guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic  development. For this reason, procuratorial organs should  seriously perform their duties and persistently deepen the  struggle to combat such crimes as embezzlement and bribery.    2. Safeguarding the Country's Political and Social  Stability Through Cracking Down on Serious Crimes According to  Law    Last year, procuratorial authorities, under the guidance of  the party Central Committee and party committees at all levels  and implementing the policy of carrying out comprehensive  management of public security, joined public security  departments, security departments, people's courts, and judicial  authorities in safeguarding the country's political and social  stability through firmly and promptly cracking down on serious  crimes and properly handling certain unforeseen incidents with  relatively great impact.    Cracking down on serious crimes is an important aspect in  safeguarding social stability. Last year, public security and  procuratorial authorities, people's courts, and judicial  authorities worked in close coordination with one another and  launched all kinds of collective and key projects against  rampant crimes. Fairly good results were achieved in launching  special campaigns against railroad and highway robberies, theft,  and abduction of women and children, as well as prostitution in  all parts of the country; in launching struggles against  narcotics and gun trafficking in Yunnan and Guangxi; in  launching struggles against smuggling and illegal emigration in  coastal areas in Southeast China and in border provinces and  regions; in launching struggles against local hooliganism and  evil forces in Shanxi; in launching struggles against kidnapping  and abduction of women and children in Hebei; and in launching  struggles against illicit sex business in Beijing, Shanghai, and  Guangdong; as well as in launching struggles of striking against  organized crimes, pursuing fugitives, and cracking major cases  in various parts of the country.    During the course of cracking down on criminal activities,  procuratorial authorities at all levels have discharged their  responsibilities and taken prompt actions to authorize public  security organs' requests to arrest felons, and prosecute felons  arrested and transferred by public security authorities. We  have intensified procuratorial operations to ensure national  security through authorizing arrest of criminals endangering  national security and prosecuting them. By so doing we have  contributed our part in carrying out comprehensive management of  public security. In 1993, procuratorial authorities in the  country authorized the arrest of 532,394 of the 607,945 felons  of various descriptions whom public security and state security  organs requested permission to arrest; and prosecuted 479,860 --  including 129,219 felons having committed serious crimes -- of  the 574,176 felons transferred from public security organs.    During the crackdown, procuratorial authorities have given  priority to cracking down on murders, robberies, rapes,  bombings, armed robberies, and other heinous crimes and criminal  gangs with an underworld nature. In 1993, procuratorial  authorities prosecuted 137,523 of the 152,764 felons of these  categories, prosecuted 48,536 of the 63,670 felons involved in  serious larcency, prosecuted 6,830 of the 7,677 drug addicts,  and prosecuted 1,512 of the 1,634 felons -- felons who  organized, coerced, lured, and facilitated women to become  prostitutes -- and prosecuted 10,548 of the 11,706 felons who  abducted and kidnapped women and children -- felons whose arrest  was authorized by procuratorial authorities.    Last year, procuratorial authorities made railroad  transportation safer through cracking down on train and highway  robberies. In the struggles of besieging and annihilating train  and highway robberies, procutoratorial authorities of all  railroad transportation units authorized the arrest of 9,383 of  the 10,596 felons whom public security organs requested  permission to arrest. To deal with the serious robberies  occurring on the Nos. 3 and 4 international expresses, the  Beijing railroad transport procuratorial branch moved quickly  and involved itself in public security organs' investigation and  authorized the arrest of 103 felons.    Many plane hijacking incidents occurred last year. The  criminal acts which seriously jeopardized public safety were  subjected to harsh and prompt crackdown according to law.  Procuratorial authorities promptly authorized the apprehension  of the hijackers; and promptly prosecuted those who did not  succeed in fleeing the country on the planes they hijacked.    Protecting political stability and public security in the  country is an important guarantee for deepening reform, opening  up wider, and promoting economic development. At present,  public security in our country is generally stable, but the  situation is still quite grim. Hostile forces and elements at  home and abroad have never stopped their activities to split,  subvert, infiltrate, and sabotage our country and to steal  secrets from our country. The situation of sabotage by national  splittists at home and illegal activities in the name of  religion is quite conspicuous. The number of major vile  criminal cases and violent crimes have increased by a big  margin. Public security in many rural areas is not good and the  situation of crimes committed by groups in towns is also quite  serious. The masses lack a sense of security. Stealing and  damaging important state production facilities, robbing state  properties in an uproar, and fights with weapons between groups  of people happen frequently. In the wake of continuous  deepening of reform and adjustment of interests, there will be  new contradictions and problems. In our work, the problem of  ineffectiveness in striking blows against criminal activities  still exists in some places. Therefore, the people's  procuratorates have a very heavy task of striking relentless  blows against criminals in a prompt manner to protect political  stability and public security.    3. Strengthen Supervision Over Enforcement of Law, New  Progress Has Been Made in Promoting Strict Implementation of Law    Since last year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has  stressed the issue of taking vigorous measures to strictly  enforce the law. The people's procuratorates at various levels  have adopted specific measures to vigorously enforce the law,  and strengthened the work of directly placing criminal cases on  file for investigation and prosecution. On the other hand, it  has seriously carried out its duty entrusted by the Constitution  and laws and strengthened supervision over the enforcement of  law by concerned departments.    1) Strengthen supervision over investigation and stress  solving the problem of not punishing crimes or levying fines to  replace other punishment. People's procuratorates at various  levels have strictly carried out their duty of supervision over  investigation activities by public security organizations. The  people's procuratorates in some locales have supervised the  trials of major criminal cases. They have corrected the  situation of not punishing crimes or levying fines to replace  other punishment by some departments. On some occasions when  which criminal cases were not filed for investigation and  prosecution or not transferred to judicial organs after being  suggested for prosecution by people's procuratorates, the  people's procuratorates directly accepted those cases and filed  those cases for investigation and prosecution. The people's  procuratorates in Hunan Province directly filed 12 major cases  involving 29 people for prosecution when concerned departments  failed to investigate and handle those cases or levied fines to  replace other punishment. This has received good reaction in  society. In supervising investigations, various people's  procuratorates have corrected the situation of not investigating  and prosecuting criminal activities and the situation of  investigating and prosecuting innocent people. In 1993, various  people's procuratorates pursued and arrested 6,534 people in  examining many cases, and prosecuted 2,720 people. The people's  procuratorates rejected the arrest of 40,439 people whose  activities could not be considered crimes and who should not be  arrested, and put forward 8,596 suggestions for correcting the  investigation activities which were in violation of the law.    2) Strengthen supervision over the trial of criminal cases  and attach importance to serving protests against erroneous  judgment on criminal cases, such as the court's not guilty  decision for those who actually committed crimes or the court's  passing a light sentence for serious crimes. People's  procuratorates at various levels lodged 1,879 protests against  erroneous judgment on criminal cases by courts and 1,765  suggestions to correct the situation of violation of the law in  the course of prosecution. The Beijing Municipal People's  Procuratorate lodged a protest with the Beijing People's Higher  Court against the judgment in the case of taking bribes by Wei  Guofan, former assistant director of the Transportation Bureau  of the Ministry of Railways. When he was an assistant director,  Wei Guofan accepted a bribe of 3,000 yuan and a refrigerator  which was worth more than 2,300 yuan. In March 1991, Wei Guifan  was sentenced to one year fixed-term imprisonment with temporary  stay of the jail sentence for one year by the court in the first  instance. Wei Guofan made an appeal and was cleared of his  crime in November 1992 by the Beijing Municipal Intermediate  Court. The people's procuratorate considered the turnabout as  inappropriate and violating the law, because there was proof of  the defendent's taking a bribe and lodged a protest with the  higher court. After trial, the Beijing Higher People's Court  revoked the not guilty judgment and maintained the judgment of  guilty in the first instance.    3) Progress was made in supervising the enforcement of law  and discipline and giving high priority to investigating and  handling criminal cases involving state functionaries who abused  power by violating citizens' rights and interests and those who  were charged with dereliction of duty. In 1993, the cases of  207 judicial personnel charged with favoritism and fraud and 378  state functionaries charged with inquisition by torture to  extort confessions were placed on file for investigation and  prosecution. A total of 4,363 cases of illegal detention were  investigated and handled. Of them, more than 90 percent were  illegal detention of people involved in economic or civil  lawsuits between citizens or between legal persons; and a small  number of them were due to abuse of power by judicial personnel  or grass-roots-level cadres. Tianjin City's procuratorial  organs investigated and handled the Daqiuzhuang case of a death  caused by illegal detention. The prime culprit, Yu Zuomin, has  been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment on charge of illegal  detention and bribery. During the 1993 election of people's  congress deputies at various levels, the procuratorial organs  placed 110 cases of disrupting elections on file for  investigation. They also investigated and handled 1,949 cases  of illegal search, illegal entry into another's house, and  illegal control of others; 133 cases of obstructing postal and  telecommunications services and violating citizen's freedom of  correspondence; and 29 framed cases of reprisal. To investigate  and handle according to law the criminal cases of violating  citizen's rights and interests is an important aspect of the  protection of human rights. China has achieved remarkable  success in protecting human rights and in waging a struggle  against the violation of citizen's rights and interests, and the  situation of human rights in China is good.    In 1993, the procuratorial organs placed on file for  investigation 3,098 cases of dereliction of duty and 4,605 cases  of major accident responsibility.    4) Progress was made in legal supervision over civil trials  and administrative lawsuits, with special attention paid to  protests against wrong decisions and orders in civil, economic  and administrative lawsuits, and to cases of wrong judgment  during civil and administrative lawsuits due to the judges'  self-seeking misconduct or their asking for or accepting bribes.  In 1993, the procuratorial organs lodged protests against wrong  trial decisions in 310 civil, economic, and administrative  cases. By examining evidently partial court decisions and  orders, the procuratorial organs placed the cases of 44 judges  on file for investigation after discovering their self-seeking  misconduct.    5) The procuratorial organs stepped up supervision and  inspection of prisons and paid special attention to  investigating and handling cases of illegal reduction of  sentence, parole, and medical parole involving bribery, as well  as the cases of self-seeking misconduct involving unauthorized  release of inmates. A total 599 such cases were investigated  and handled. They involved prison staff members who embezzled  public funds, sought or accepted bribes, practiced favoritism  and fraud, set inmates free without proper authorization, or  tortured inmates. Zhu Wenjia, deputy political officer of the  first brigade of Changchun Prison in Jilin Province accepted  30,000 yuan in bribes from 29 inmates and their relatives, and  abused his power in obtaining sentence reduction, parole, or  medical parole for those inmates. Zhu has been sentenced to 12  years of imprisonment for the crime according to law. The  procuratorial organs also made timely inspection and correction  of such law violations in prisons as detention without proper  legal papers, keeping inmates from reform through labor in  violation of court orders, and delay the release of inmates in  violation of court orders. The procuratorial organs made  suggestions on correcting 39,342 law violations in prisons, and  17,823 of them have been corrected by the departments concerned.  The procuratorial organs made fairly great achievements in  correcting the problem of overdue detention and suggested the  correction of 73,416 such cases, and 34,432 of them have been  corrected by the departments concerned.    6) Procuratorial work in handling appeals and complaints  has been strengthened. Procuratorial organs devoted greater  efforts to reinvestigation of cases in accordance with appeals  filed against courts' decisions as well as complaints against  procuratorial organs' decisions on exemption from prosecution.  In line with the principle of seeking truth from facts and that  every wrong should be righted, procuratorial organs, whenever  mistakes were found, filed protests or otherwise redressed the  mistakes in accordance with the law. A total of 485,851 appeals  and complaints were handled in 1993 by procuratorial organs at  all levels. Of the 63 appeals against arrest that were  re-examined, the earlier decisions in 12 of them were rescinded.  Of the 1,995 complaints against exemption from prosecution that  were re-examined, the earlier decisions in 776 of them were  reversed. Of the 217 appeals against the courts' sentences of  criminal punishment that were reinvestigated, 21 were presented  to the court for retrial and the original sentences revised in  accordance with the procedure for adjudication supervision. Li  Zhongyu, former deputy commander of the Mengzui Public Security  Force, was sentenced to death with a stay of execution in 1953  on charges of murder out of revenge. The sentence was later  commuted to 10-years imprisonment. Li refused to accept the  sentence and appealed many times. The Supreme People's  Procuratorate, after clarifying the principal facts of the case  with a thorough reinvestigation, presented the case to the  Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court directed the  relevant court to readjudicate the case and a decision of not  guilty was announced, redressing a miscarriage of justice that  lasted 40 years.    By reinforcing supervision over law enforcement,  procuratorial organs played a positive role in motivating  relevant departments to strictly enforce the law, in  guaranteeing unified and correct enforcement of state laws, and  in protecting the citizens' democratic rights and rights of the  person. Nonobservance and lax implementation of laws remains a  prominent problem in China's judicial and administrative law  enforcement work. Further efforts should be made to improve the  environment and conditions for strict law enforcement. The new  situation -- that is, the establishment of a socialist market  economic system -- cries out for reinforced supervision over law  enforcement and respect for the authority of state laws. For  this reason, we must further enhance supervision over law  enforcement.    4. Strengthen Procuratorial Organs in Accordance With  the Law, Enforce Strict Discipline Among Procuratorial  Personnel, and Reinforce the Procuratorial Ranks    In the past year, procuratorial organs at all levels have  built themselves up in accordance with law and enforced strict  discipline among their personnel. Both the political and  professional qualifications of procuratorial personnel have  risen to new levels.    Efforts were made to improve the style of work and to go  deeply into reality to see how things really are. Leaders of  procuratorial organs at all levels took the lead in going deeply  into the realities of life, in going down to the grass-roots  level, and in conducting research and investigations in key  areas, knotty problems, and weak links of procuratorial work and  the new situation and new problems procuratorial departments  have encountered in the process of establishing a market  economic system. The fruitful efforts in this regard have  improved our understanding of reality and enabled us to  formulate more appropriate measures for our work.    Leading bodies of procuratorial organs at all levels have  been strengthened. As a new term started in 1993, most of the  nation's procuratorial organs readjusted or reinforced their  leading bodies. Many fine and experienced young and middle-aged  cadres with both professional ability and political integrity  were promoted to leading posts, making the ranks of cadres more  revolutionary, younger, better educated and more professionally  competent.    Ideological and political work was strengthened. By studying  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and  arming themselves ideological with the theory on building  socialism with Chinese Characteristics, cadres and police have  enhanced their steadfastness and consciousness of implementing  the party's basic line. All procuratorial organs conducted  education on strict law- enforcement, on serving the people  wholeheartedly as their objective, and on the need to be honest  and hardworking.    Earnest efforts were made to fight corruption among  procuratorial organs themselves. Leading cadres in  procuratorial organs at all levels conducted self-investigation  based on the regulations on clean standards and self-discipline  issued by the party central committee and made amends  accordingly. Resolute steps were taken to put a stop to abuse  of procuratorial powers to collect fees by a handful of  grass-roots units. Procuratorial cadres and policemen guilty of  violating the law or discipline were investigated and prosecuted  to the full force of the law. In 1993, 568 procuratorial  personnel were investigated for violations of the law and  discipline, of which 87 were prosecuted on criminal charges. A  total of 987 procuratorial personnel were found unsuitable and  reassigned. Procuratorial organs at all levels reinforced rules  and regulations and amplified internal supervision mechanisms to  keep their personnel honest and hardworking, thereby ensuring,  by way of instituting a system, that procuratorial personnel  will be clean, honest, and enforce the law impartially.    In recent years, we have consistently attended to the  education and training of procuratorial personnel as a strategic  task. The focus of training in 1993 was on job qualifications,  upgrading of vocational skills, and knowledge renewal. The  Central College for Procuratorial Management trained 78 newly  appointed chief and deputy procurators of the provincial,  autonomous regional, and municipal, prefectural, and city  procuratorates. A total of 202 chief and deputy procurators of  the prefectural and city procuratorates underwent knowledge  renewal training. Local procuratorial training institutes  trained 9,000 chief procurators and other key functionaries of  the grass-roots procuratorates.    The "Regulations on Procuratorial Organs Receiving  Supervision From the People's Congress and Its Standing  Committee," which were drawn up by the Supreme People's  Procuratorate last June, have further standardized procedures  for procuratorial organs to receive supervision from the  people's congress and its standing committee. Procuratorates at  all levels regularly reported their work to the people's  congress and its standing committee at the corresponding level.  They earnestly implemented resolutions passed by the people's  congress and its standing committee and accepted the standing  committee's supervision over their procuratorial activities.  They earnestly and responsibly handled matters assigned to them  by the people's congress and motions and proposals by people's  deputies. They strengthened ties with people's deputies;  invited them to inspect their work; listened to their criticism,  viewpoints, and suggestions with an open mind; and sought  constantly to improve their work.    During the past year, vast numbers of procuratorial  personnel  displayed a fine mental outlook despite their arduous tasks and  difficult conditions for waging struggle. A large number of  advanced collectives and individuals have tempered themselves  and emerged in the struggle against corruption. The Supreme  People's Procuratorate and local people's procuratorates at  different levels commended 4,318 advanced collectives and 15,550  advanced individuals.    While there were achievements in procuratorial work last  year, there were also problems and shortcomings. The main  problems and shortcomings were: The law enforcement standards  and concept of our procuratorial personnel were not able to  completely satisfy the needs of the new situation for developing  a socialist market economy; some localities did not strictly  enforce the law by failing to bring for prosecution to the  people's court cases that ought to be prosecuted; a few  grass-roots procuratorates engaged in local protectionism by  illegally interfering in economic disputes and handling cases  outside their jurisdiction or in violation of the law; and some  procuratorial personnel even used their power to extort or  accept bribes or resorted to fraud to benefit their relatives or  friends. In addition, procuratorates in many localities lacked  the budget to handle cases, and their means of transportation  and technical equipment were obsolete, affecting the smooth  progress of their investigation into major and important cases.    Deputies:    The year 1994 is crucial to China's reform. Seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability represent the overall  interests of this year's work for the entire party and nation.  Procuratorial organs must center on these overall interests in  conducting their work and must consciously subordinate  themselves to and serve these overall interests. At the  national conference of chief procurators held toward the end of  last year, we put forward, after analyzing the situation of our  procuratorial work, "Views on Further Strengthening Legal  Supervisory Functions and Safeguarding the Establishment and  Development of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" which  establishes the primary task of the procuratorate at present and  for some time to come as: To uphold the use of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide;  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee;  adhere to the principle of "grasping two links at the same time,  attaching equal importance to both," strengthening legal  supervisory functions; strictly enforce laws; vigorously handle  cases; concentrate efforts on investigating and punishing  embezzlement, bribery, and other major criminal cases; and crack  down on all kinds of criminal activities to safeguard national  interests against infringement, to protect the legitimate rights  and interests of citizens and legal persons, to safeguard  political and social stability, to create a good legal  environment for reform, opening up, and modernization, and  promote the establishment and development of a socialist market  economic structure.    In 1994, procuratorial organs across the country must focus  attention on successfully handling the following tasks:    First, in the course of the anticorruption drive, they must  concentrate efforts on investigating big, important cases; they  must persist in treating the investigation of criminal cases  involving leading bodies and leading cadres of the party and  government, judicial departments, administrative law enforcement  departments, economic management departments, and their working  personnel as the major work; and they must pay special attention  to investigating cases of leading cadres' crimes of corruption  and taking bribes, cases of judicial and administrative law  enforcement personnel practicing favoritism, committing  irregularities, taking bribes, bending the law, and covering up  crimes, and legal persons' criminal cases. No matter who is  implicated in a criminal case, they must resolutely conduct a  thorough investigation and must not be softhearted. The Supreme  People's Procuratorate and provincial, autonomous regional, and  municipal procuratorates must further improve the organization,  command, supervision, and examination of the investigation of  big, important cases, and promptly sort out and investigate the  clues which are given by the masses and lead to big, important  cases to bring about a change in the situation of accumulated  clues piling up unattended. Procuratorates at the higher level  must supervise and assist those at the lower level; they must  eliminate interference and resistance and expedite the progress  of the drive to develop in depth step by step.    Second, procuratorial organs across the country must uphold  the principle of dealing swift and heavy blows to criminals  according to the law and crack down on grave criminal  activities. According to law, they must take prompt action in  arresting and prosecuting criminals, gangsters, and particularly  crime syndicates that committed murder, robbery, rape, bombing,  and theft and robbery of guns; they must coordinate with  relevant departments to hand down severe punishment to these  criminals. They must actively participate in surrounding and  annihilating train robbers and highway bandits and in such  special drives as fighting robbers and thieves, cracking down on  "pornography," and eliminating the six evils [prostitution,  pornography, abduction and trading of women and children, drug  trafficking, gambling, and profiteering from superstition].  They must improve national security-related procuratorial work  and crack down on various criminals imperiling social and  political stability.    Third, procuratorial organs across the country must  strengthen supervision over law enforcement; when they handle  cases, they must pay attention to discovering various  irregularities in the handling of cases and lax law enforcement;  and they must promptly make suggestions for rectification. If  the working personnel of judicial departments and administrative  law enforcement departments abuse power to seek personal gain,  are guilty of corruption, take bribes, practice favoritism,  commit irregularities, illicitly release criminals, extort a  confession by torture, unlawfully detain suspects, maltreat and  give corporal punishment to detainees, neglect their duties and  connive in crimes, harbor evildoers, conceal what they know  about a criminal case, and commit perjury, and if any of the  above acts constitutes a crime, procuratorial organs must  resolutely investigate such cases according to law to fix the  responsibility for the crime and ask relevant departments to  strictly enforce the law.    Fourth, more efforts must be made to build up contingents of  procuratorial personnel, to improve their quality, and to  enhance their level of law enforcement. Procuratorial organs  must persist in improving themselves according to law; they must  abide by the provisions of the Constitution; they must adhere to  the principle of formulating a law first before proceeding to  vigorously promote reform of the procuratorial system; they must  strengthen their function of legal supervision; they must  guarantee the independent exercise of procuratorial power  according to law; and they must establish a socialist  procuratorial system with Chinese characteristics that meets the  needs of a socialist market economy. Based on the NPC Standing  Committee's plan for legislation, they must fulfill the tasks of  drafting the "Organic Law (Draft Revision) on People's  Procuratorates," "Law on Public Procurators," "Law on Punishment  for Corruption and Bribery," and "Supplemental Regulations on  the Guilt of Dereliction of Duty;" and they must actively  participate in amending the "Criminal Law" and "Criminal  Procedural Law."    Fellow deputies, in the new year, the Supreme People's  Procuratorate will lead the local people's procuratorates at all  levels, the special people's procuratorates, and all  procuratorial personnel to uphold the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, to closely rally  around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core, to add to our achievements, to surmount difficulties, to  blaze new trails and forge ahead, and to make new contributions  to establishing a socialist market economic system and to  improving socialist democracy and the legal system.</p>

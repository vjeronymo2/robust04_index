The Ministry will form a pan-governmental promotion  committee, a working-level committee and a planning and  management team to implement the scheme.    The prime minister will be appointed as chairman of the  pan-governmental promotion committee and the Economic Planning  Board minister as vice chairman.    Another 23 figures from the presidential secretariat, prime  minister's office and private companies are to participate in  the committee.    The vice communications minister will be named chairman of  the working-level committee and 24 director-general-level  officials from other ministries will join the panel.    The new planning and management team will be set up within  the Communications Ministry as a separate organ and in order to  secure enough funds, an independent management foundation is to  be formed.    The plan is due to be approved by the cabinet late this  month  or in early April.    It will be carried out in three stages at a cost of 44.77  trillion won (55.47 U.S. billion dollars).</p>

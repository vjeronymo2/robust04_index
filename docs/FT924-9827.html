			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Italian unemployent reaches 11 per cent The number of unemployed in Italy has reached 2.66m, equivalent to 11 per cent of the active workforce, according to the latest quarterly figures published by Istat, the national statistics office, writes Robert Graham. This compares with a 10.5 per cent jobless rate 12 months ago. However, the figures cover the year to last July, and union officials believe the number of jobless has accelerated this autumn. As many as 71 per cent of the unemployed are aged 29 and below, mostly first-time job seekers. This confirms the reluctance of employers to take on new labour in the recession and while employment laws remain so rigid. Meanwhile, industry shed 148,000 in the same period. Among the worst affected areas are Lombardy and Piedmont, Italy's industrial heartland.</p>

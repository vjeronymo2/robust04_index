			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> LAGUNA LAUREL TO BE CITY-IRVINE CO. TOPIC  </P> <P> City leaders will meet with Irvine Co. officials Friday to discuss a new  proposal for the hotly contested Laguna Laurel housing project.  </P> <P> "The council doesn't want it (the offer) discussed until it's presented to the  Irvine Co.," Mayor Robert F. Gentry said. "But I think it's extremely  reasonable, and we're serious."  </P> <P> An Irvine Co. spokeswoman also declined to comment until after Friday's  meeting.  </P> <P> The city's proposal will counter a previous Irvine Co. offer to sell 276 acres,  including the planned golf course portion, of the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel site  for about $38 million, Gentry said.  </P> <P> "In return, we'd have to agree to support the remainder of the project," he  said.  </P> <P> The remainder includes construction of about 3,000 homes, a number that  environmentalists say would damage the sensitive Laguna Canyon ecosystem,  increase traffic, destroy Indian burial sites and produce harmful storm drain  runoff.  </P> <P> Council members prepared the counteroffer in a special closed session Tuesday  night after hearing testimony from angry residents and groups, including  Village Laguna, Laguna Canyon Property Owners, Laguna Canyon Conservancy and  Laguna Greenbelt.  </P> <P> "We felt the item must be placed on the (City Council) agenda," Gentry said.  "The people must have some say."  </P> <P> Several residents at the meeting urged rejection of the Irvine Co. proposal,  saying acceptance would do nothing to mitigate damage to the canyon or the  city.  </P> <P> "We would buy the liability for downstream damage (from the project)," said a  Laguna Canyon property owner. "It would be a condemnation of downtown."  </P> <P> A highlight of the emotional meeting was the playing of a recording which had  just arrived from singer Jose Feliciano. Against a guitar background, the  Orange County resident urged community support of a protest march through the  canyon scheduled for Saturday. LESLIE HERZOG  </P></p>

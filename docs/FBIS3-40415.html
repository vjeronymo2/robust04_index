Aerospatiale and Eurosam have just made the very first  flight  test launch of an Aster 30 surface-to-air missile. The missile  was also launched for the first time from the Aster 30 ground  missile launcher that will make up the future anti-aircraft and  antimissile weapon system known as the Medium-Range  Surface-to-Air Ground Missile (SAMP/T). The launch took place on  1 December under the responsibility of Aerospatiale, the prime  contractor for Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles, at the Landes  Testing Center (CEL) operated by the General Delegation for  Weapons (DGA).    The two-stage solid-fuel missile--using the same  Aerospatiale  terminal delivery system (in the second stage), but with a  booster from Italy's BPD (in the first stage) that is larger in  the Aster 30 version than in Aster 15--was launched from one of  the eight canister tubes of the missile launcher developed by  Alenia in cooperation with OTO Melara (Italy). The Aster 30 in  that configuration is five meters long and weighs 460 kg.    The test, which was conducted using the unguided missile,  made it possible to validate the vertical launch procedure for  the Aster 30 (the procedure for the Aster 15 had already been  validated). Earlier, Aerospatiale had validated the performance  of the terminal missile with maximum-range launchings in  particular and had also conducted flight tests making it  possible to test trajectory formatting and the performance of  the direct-force and aerodynamic control system (PIF-PAF). In  all, according to Eurosam, there had already been a dozen or so  launchings of propelled and/or guided missiles (but without  Dassault Electronics' electromagnetic homing head) as well as  firings from the naval launcher during flight tests conducted  between 1987 and 1992.    The test just completed also made it possible to test the  various subassemblies--missile, canister-launch tube, and ground  launch ramp--in the SAMP/T's operational configuration. The only  difference was that the missile launcher was not mounted on a  truck but simply placed on the ground on a firing range at the  Landes Testing Center in Biscarosse. But the Aster 30 will be  launched from a launcher mounted on a ground vehicle during the  next two scheduled launchings--also at the CEL--in 1994.    In another connection, Eurosam has announced that the first  prototype (P01) of the Arabel fire control radar was accepted at  the Bagneux plant of the manufacturer, Thomson-CSF, in November.  That electronic scanning radar will be used in a series of  technical tests in a marine environment that are scheduled for  1994 at the SESDA in Saint-Mandrier near Toulon.    The Arabel will then be combined with the Alenia missile  launcher for sea trials involving launchings from the  experimental ship Ile d'Oleron. Those tests will be conducted  with the Aster 15 in the configuration adopted for the future  SAAM [surface-to-air antimissile] naval weapon that will be used  by the French and Italian Navies. According to Eurosam, the SAAM  will first be used in actual service on the French aircraft  carrier Charles de Gaulle, whose sea trials are scheduled for  1999. The Aster 30 will be used by those same navies as well as  the French Air Force (replacing its Hawks), with the SAMP/T that  will be delivered for tests in 1998. Both missiles--the Aster 15  and the Aster 30--will also be used with new radars in the  future naval PAMS system scheduled for 2002.</p>

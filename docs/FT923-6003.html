			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / People: Smooth passage of command at Thomas Cook 'If we do it right it will be like one of the better Olympic baton passes' is how the new chief executive of Thomas Cook, Christopher Rodrigues, 42, describes the succession at the top of the travel and financial services group that is being sold to Westdeutsche Landesbank and German package tour operator LTU. His predecessor Peter Middleton, tipped as the next chief executive of Lloyd's, stepped down yesterday, but refused to divulge his next destination. A former diplomat who has headed Thomas Cook for five years, Middleton hand-picked fellow Englishman and marketing expert Rodrigues from American Express back in 1988 - initially to serve as Cook's chief operating officer, more recently as managing director. Rodrigues, then poised to take up a quite different job, had agreed at the suggestion of a headhunter to have lunch with Middleton - but 'as a competitor' since he thought the description of the Cook vacancy looked to be 'boloney'. Middleton, whom he calls 'a charismatic recruiter', simply informed his lunch guest he was joining Cooks and so had better start writing his own job description. They have been a partnership of 'human change agents' ever since, according to Rodrigues - turning round an organisation at first seemingly staffed with 'message takers, instruction issuers and administrators'. Cooks suffered years of neglect, including under Midland's stewardship since 1972. Middleton adds: 'what we had to do - and Christopher was central to that - was rehabilitate the brand and put it back where it was in its colourful past'. Well on the way towards that goal, Rodrigues stresses that the new German ownership (effective October) will not cramp his style. On the contrary, 'they have very stretching aspirations for us'. A Cambridge rowing blue, and Harvard MBA, the new Cook boss spent four years at McKinsey, whence one of his clients Lou Gerstner, then of American Express Travel Related Services, hired him, explaining 'it will be cheaper for us and more profitable for you'. He spent nine years at American Express, progressing to managing director of travel and travel management services for the UK and USSR.</p>

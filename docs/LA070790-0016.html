			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 4-HOUR SIEGE ENDS WITH MURDER SUSPECT'S ARREST  </P> <P> A man sought by Escondido police on suspicion of murder was arrested Thursday  night in Covina after a four-hour siege involving a special weapons and tactics  squad from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> It took Escondido homicide Detective Hal Espy more than 2 1/2 months to locate  Mario Martinez Preza, and it took 20 members of the SWAT team to bring him out  of an apartment at 10:30 p.m. Thursday.  </P> <P> Preza, 34, who counts Highland Street in San Diego as one of his addresses, was  booked into the Vista jail on a murder charge and two counts of attempted  murder, after being arrested in Covina, which is about 20 miles east of  downtown Los Angeles, said Escondido police Sgt. Dan Starr.  </P> <P> He is charged with the shooting death of John Albert Duvall, 35, who owned  Duvall Janitorial Service, and with the attempted murder of two others who were  at the slaying scene.  </P> <P> Duvall was shot at his residence in the 300 block of West 10th Avenue in  Escondido on April 18. Duvall had taken over his father's business. "His dad  had a respectable business for many, many years here," Starr said.  </P> <P> According to police, Duvall was shot because of an argument about a drug debt  to Preza. Starr said Preza claimed he was owed $700, while Duvall maintained  that the proper amount was $400. Starr said Preza was "a supplier of drugs" who  dealt mainly in marijuana and methamphetamine.  </P> <P> Witnesses to the slaying identified Preza, police said.  </P> <P> Investigators said Preza moved around a lot. "Staying in one place for very  long is not part of his lifestyle," said Starr, who added that Preza has had  several addresses in recent months.  </P> <P> Late Thursday afternoon, Espy and police officers from Escondido, Covina, and  West Covina converged on an apartment complex in the 100 block of Vecino  Street. After Preza refused to communicate with the officers, who threw a phone  in to him, police called in the 20-member SWAT team, which apprehended him  without trouble.  </P> <P> Preza's son was put in the care of an uncle who lives nearby.  </P></p>

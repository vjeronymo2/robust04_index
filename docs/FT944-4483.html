			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Major ebullient despite reverse For a prime minister who only a few hours earlier had lost such an important vote in the House of Commons Mr John Major was on remarkably ebullient form. Fulfilling a longstanding engagement to breakfast yesterday with a group of businessmen at a London hotel he looked tired but spoke from notes with passion and some humour. Mr Major talked optimistically about the recovery, defended his decision to suspend from the Tory party eight Eurosceptic MPs who had voted against the government on a confidence motion, and called for a more rational debate on Europe. He said the previous night's rejection by the House of Commons of the second stage of value added tax on domestic fuel had been a mistake. He did not know of any tax measure that had been so misrepresented. The Opposition's comments had been travesties. The great beneficiaries of the vote to hold valued added tax on domestic fuel at 8 per cent would not be the old and the sick, but the reasonably well-off middle class - people in the room. The chancellor would be taking the necessary steps to repair the financial damage. 'There should be no shred of doubt about this - we are going to take no risks with the economy.' Time and time again since the 1950s the economy had been driven off course by inflation and he was 'sick and tired' of it. This time it would be different, he said. 'That is the bedrock on which our economic policy is built, a bedrock of low inflation. I hope no one doubts the determination of this government to pursue an anti-inflation strategy.' Recent growth rates were unsustainable but there was an unprecedented opportunity for sustained long-term growth. He said: 'We will take no risks with the recovery.' He was determined to pursue policies that would lead to lower unemployment and less regulation. He said: 'We may be on the way to crushing the inflationary psychology . . . the opportunity is there to be taken (but) it can be blown away.' Mr Major said British industry - British Steel and the motor manufacturers were examples - had been transformed in recent years. 'Is this just a normal cyclical recovery? I don't think so.' Everyone had told him that by now there would be a balance of payments crisis, an inflationary spiral, wage inflation. None of this had come about. He then moved on to Europe, remarking how frustrated he was that the argument was only being heard from the extreme positions on either side. Britain's interests lay in the heart of Europe, and it was about time that industry stood up and supported that view. He warmed to a recent, less-than-federalist newspaper article delivered by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister and presidential candidate: 'Mr Balladur's grand new gesture sounds remarkably like my Leyden speech a few months ago.' A European single currency would remain impractical for 'many, many years to come'. The energy-saving industry reacted with anger and disappointment to Tuesday night's VAT vote, David Lascelles writes. Mr Andrew Warren of the Association for the Conservation of Energy said that energy would now be taxed at 8 per cent while energy-saving equipment would carry VAT of 17.5 per cent. This meant consumers had an incentive to pollute, he said.</p>

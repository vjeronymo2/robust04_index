			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADITION WINS AS MOSCOW PUTS CATHEDRAL DESIGN TO VOTE;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: IT WILL BE THE FIRST NEW RUSSIAN ORTHODOX EDIFICE IN 70 YEARS.  AND THE PUBLIC WANTS CUPOLAS.  </P> <P> One design looked like the Taj Mahal. Another, sporting a minaret-like tower,  could have been a mosque. And a third might have been an import from Disney's  "Magic Kingdom."  </P> <P> Interesting, perhaps, exotic even, but clearly not what the thousands who  thronged an exhibition hall on the Moscow River on Sunday had in mind for Holy  Trinity Cathedral, the first new Russian Orthodox church to be built in this  country in 70 years.  </P> <P> It was a traditional crowd, and they wanted a traditional design for the  edifice that is to commemorate 1,000 years of Russian Christianity.  </P> <P> "The cathedral should exemplify the magnificance of the Russian Orthodox  Church, its connection with the history of the great Russian people, its  activity, full of hardship, aimed at creating a united, multinational, strong  state," wrote an anonymous 64-year-old on his ballot. "That is why a modernist  project, to my mind, cannot reflect the significance of Christianity in  Russia."  </P> <P> The votes of these ordinary Russians will help a church panel narrow the design  choice to eight finalists by the end of the month, with the winning entry to be  selected in July.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, both the exhibition itself and the extraordinary attendance are  testimony to the enormous change in church-state relations under President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika program of reforms.  </P> <P> It is symbolic that one of the two favorite designs submitted for the new  church is an exact image of Christ the Savior Cathedral. Built in the 19th  Century to commemorate Russia's defeat of Napoleon, the central Moscow  cathedral was one of the largest in Europe until the late dictator Josef Stalin  ordered it razed in 1931, to be replaced eventually by a heated, year-round  outdoor swimming pool.  </P> <P> That was one of at least 40,000 Russian Orthodox churches destroyed here after  the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution made atheism the official dogma. Thousands more  were confiscated and turned into warehouses.  </P> <P> Under Gorbachev, 1,000 churches have reportedly been given back to the  Patriarchate, and last fall the leadership permitted the first religious  service since 1918 within the Kremlin walls at Uspensky Cathedral, where czars  were once crowned and church leaders buried.  </P> <P> "This is the first time (since the revolution) that the Russian Orthodox Church  has gotten so much freedom," said Valentin V. Solodovnikov, a construction  engineer formerly employed by the Foreign Ministry to build Soviet embassies  abroad but now working for the Patriarchate on the cathedral project.  </P> <P> "If you visit any church you'll see crowds. There are many young people. Lots  of baptisms and weddings. In today's unquiet times, people tend to go to church  and find peace there," added Solodovnikov, himself a professed non-believer.  </P> <P> "The policy today gives ground for a revival of people's interest in the  church," agreed Elena Yegorova, who came to look at the competing designs with  her husband. "People feel freer."  </P> <P> So many came Sunday -- young and old, believers and atheists, men and women --  that the biggest problem was finding paper for them to write down their  impressions. Exhibition workers ran out of pre-printed questionnaires by noon,  with five more hours of crowds to come.  </P> <P> One teen-age boy had a small silver cross dangling from his pierced left ear.  Many visitors had learned of the exhibition from a lengthy segment about it on  the main television news program Saturday night.  </P> <P> It was first announced in 1988, during the church's millennial celebrations,  that a new cathedral would be built, and last year, Moscow Patriarch Pimen  announced an open contest to come up with the best design.  </P> <P> A wooded hilltop site overlooking the scenic Tsaritsyn Ponds in southeast  Moscow has already been set aside for the cathedral, and completion is targeted  for the year 2000. The church, to be financed entirely from contributions, is  to hold up to 10,000 people, have underground parking for 700 cars and be  surrounded by a park "with fountains, decorative ponds and exotic plants."  </P> <P> By last Dec. 1, about 320 designs had been received from architects and a few  amateurs in more than 50 cities. Many submitted not only drawings but colorful  architects' renderings of their designs, and even scale models. Those were the  materials put on public exhibition here.  </P> <P> Most -- but not all -- featured at least a few traditional Russian Orthodox  cupolas, or "onion domes," and one proposal had 45. But beyond that, the  architects clearly let their minds roam. There were many modernistic designs,  which drew large but mostly critical crowds Sunday.  </P> <P> "Take the cupolas off and it looks like a railroad station to me," grumbled one  young man about one design.  </P></p>

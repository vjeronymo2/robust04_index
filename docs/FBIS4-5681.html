			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Japan will present details  of a full tax reform in June, as originally promised in a  market- opening package in March, a top Finance Ministry  official said Monday [11 April].    Both ruling and opposition parties have "indicated clearly"  the direction the full tax reform should take, Vice Finance  Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting, brushing aside  the notion that the current political uncertainty could retard  the process.    He was referring to a provision attached by legislators from  the coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party when enacting a single-year tax cut bill in March. It  calls for inclusion of a permanent tax cut in a reform to be  enacted by the end of the year.    Saito also said he "hopes for some conclusion on funding" in  reference to deficit-covering bonds to be issued to offset the  income tax cut, limited to fiscal 1994.    The Finance Ministry has been calling for a consumption tax  hike to offset tax cuts.    Concerning the impact of political uncertainty on the  economy, Saito said the stock and currency exchange markets  "held relatively steady despite my earlier concerns."    Saying he would watch developments, Saito repeated his wish  for Diet passage "as soon as possible" of the fiscal 1994  budget, and said Japanese officials are working "through  diplomatic channels" to seek a breakthrough in the stalled  Japan-U.S. framework trade talks.</p>

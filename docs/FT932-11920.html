			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / GM in the black at Dollars 513m GENERAL Motors, the US carmaker in the throes of a big restructuring, yesterday reported better-than-expected first quarter income of Dollars 513m (Pounds 333m), but acknowledged its results had a long way to go to be satisfactory. Earnings improved Dollars 680m from the first quarter of last year, when GM lost Dollars 167m, while sales and revenues rose 8.4 per cent from Dollars 32.3bn to Dollars 34.9bn. A key element was less red ink in its North American automobile operations - the main source of the group's difficulties - which produced an attributable loss of Dollars 194m, against a loss of Dollars 1.2bn a year ago. Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said North America was on track to achieve its 1993 target of break-even before interest, taxes and accounting for retirees' health benefits. It earned Dollars 525m on this basis in the first quarter, a Dollars 1.5bn improvement. Cashflow was also continuing to improve, with cash and marketable securities totalling Dollars 8.4bn on March 31, up from Dollars 8bn at December 31. Detroit rivals Ford and Chrysler have also announced better-than-expected first quarter figures, helped by the gradual US economic recovery, lower rebates on American model sales and a loss of US market share by Japanese rivals. Mr Smith said GM's improvement in North America showed the company was succeeding in implementing a lean manufacturing system, streamlining its business practices, improving productivity and executing its new global purchasing strategy. He noted that rationalisation efforts at GM's large components business were generating improved operating results. However, he added: 'We still have much to do to achieve competitive levels of cost and productivity in North America.' GM's international automotive operations earned Dollars 165m, down from Dollars 482m, due to market weakness in Europe and the start-up of manufacturing the company's new Corsa models. Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said the European market had been 'far weaker than any of us had expected' and was likely to remain weak until a modest pick-up in 1994. Group net income translated into earnings per share of 42 cents, against last year's Dollars 33.96 loss on a Dollars 21bn non-cash charge.</p>

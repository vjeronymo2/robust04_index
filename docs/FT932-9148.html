			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck sells property arm A MANAGEMENT-led investment consortium will buy Coldwell Banker Residential Group, the residential property arm of US retailing group Sears, Roebuck, Mr Edward Brennan, Sears chairman, announced at the annual meeting yesterday. The sale represents a further step in Sears' strategy to scale down its involvement in financial services and focus on its core retailing business. The Fremont Group, formerly Bechtel Investments, will purchase the Coldwell Banker Residential Group, with senior management executives at Coldwell Banker, led by Mr Chandler Barton, chairman, participating in the deal. Sears did not disclose the sale price, but there were indications yesterday that the proceeds, together with the Dollars 328m obtained for Sears' mortgage banking unit, would reach approximately Dollars 500m. Sears announced the sale of Sears Mortgage Banking Group, previously part of the Coldwell Banker division, to PNC Bank earlier this week. Coldwell Banker, which has more than 2,100 residential real estate offices in North America, made a net loss of Dollars 7.7m in the first quarter. It was founded in 1906 and acquired by Sears, Roebuck in 1981, when the Chicago-based group started to expand into financial services. The Fremont Group is a private investment corporation that manages more than Dollars 3.5bn in assets worldwide. Through Fremont Investment Advisers, the company manages more than Dollars 2.5bn in securities portfolios and mutual funds. Mr Brennan told shareholders that 'the successful completion of this transaction, plus the sale of Sears Mortgage Corp announced earlier this week are initial steps in our repositioning programme which will continue to enhance shareholder value.' Sears has already announced plans to float a 20 per cent interest in its Allstate insurance unit next month. Mr Brennan said Allstate would be the largest publicly-traded 'personal lines' insurance company in the US. After the offering, the remaining 80 per cent of Allstate's equity will be owned by Sears.</p>

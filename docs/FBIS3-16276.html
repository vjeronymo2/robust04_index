			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Samoylov, deputy chief of the </F> Administration for Work With Territories of the Russian  President's Administration, by Nikolay Dorofeyev; date and place  not given: "Russia Continues To Choose" -- first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] In accordance with the Russian Federation  president's edict "On Stage-By-Stage Constitutional Reform"  elections were held 12 December to the country's new supreme  legislative organ -- the Federal Assembly. Thereby began the  process of forming a representative branch of power in Russia,  and this process is now moving to the regions. TRUD's  correspondent discusses what is happening now as regards  elections in the federation components with Sergey Samoylov,  deputy chief of the Administration for Work With Territories of  the Russian Federation President's Administration.    [Dorofeyev] Let us begin our conversation, Sergey  Nikolayevich, at the end. Where, in your view, do the greatest  difficulties now lie as regards the elections to the new  representative organs of the Russian Federation components?    [Samoylov] Elections will be held in the majority of regions  20 and 27 March 1994. As far as the significance of the  elections is concerned, the problem is the public's poor  understanding of the new quality of the representative organs.  Very little purposeful explanatory work is being carried out in  this area, and far from everyone understands that they will not  be a reproduction of the system of soviets, but fundamentally  different representative organs. There are also difficulties of  a purely political character. After all, these organs are to be  formed in the absence of currently existing representative power  in the localities, with virtually all organizational questions  being "farmed out" to executive structures. Now the executive  organs, tired of fighting after several years of confrontation  with the soviets, want to obtain ineffectual representative  organs. The Russian president, however, is committed to seeing  that the principle of the separation of powers and the principle  of people's power which are enshrined in the mechanism of these  elections finally begin to operate.    A cause of unease is the high activity of opposition  political forces seeking at any cost to seize a dominant  position in the organs of power by exploiting the election  campaign for the purposes of discrediting the president's reform  policy. In the majority of regions the sociopolitical situation  is pretty tense, which will undoubtedly have an impact on voter  turnout, putting in doubt the possibility of holding elections  in a number of regions on the dates established by edicts, or  affect the quality of these elections. This applies to regions  of the Far North and to Magadan Oblast. There is no experience  of legislative activity in the regions.    [Dorofeyev] If I understand you correctly, the creation of  norms governing the formation of the representative organs of  power in the regions has been entirely transferred to the local  executive power. But does it have some kind of coherent legal  basis for this activity?    [Samoylov] Yes, undoubtedly. A series of edicts of the  Russian Federation president on stage-by-stage constitutional  reform were elaborated. These edicts concerned the general  principles of the organization of state power in the federation  components and of the reform of the organs of local  self-government, the timetable for holding elections, the role  of administrations in holding them, and the powers of the  representative organs.    In addition there are individual articles in the Russian  Constitution which define the level of the organs of  self-government and the character of their activity, although  the details are certainly not spelled out in the Fundamental Law.    At the moment a legal basis incorporating national, local,  and historical features is being created in the regions on the  basis of the president's edicts. But, insofar as the  president's edicts are the basis of the election campaign, we do  not want them to be discredited. Therefore, normative documents  elaborated in the regions undergo mandatory expert analysis  here, in the president's administration, and are invariably  coordinated with the Central Electoral Commission. True, the  federation components approach the creation of this legal basis  in different ways. In Yaroslavl and Penza Oblasts and Stavropol  Kray the matter has even gone before the courts.    The documents that have been adopted contain gaps, errors,  and even deviations from juridical norms. These flaws from both  the legal and organizational points of view are, incidentally,  common to the majority of regions.    [Dorofeyev] Could you name the basic ones?    [Samoylov] There are several. First, as before, there is a  noticeable gravitation toward the principle of nominating  candidates according to the territorial administration  principle. Thus there can be a five to sixfold difference in the  size of the population of the various rayons of an oblast or  kray, but there were proposals to elect an equal number of  deputies from each. But this is a violation of the  constitutional principle of citizens' equal suffrage. Second,  there is the mandatory allocation of guaranteed seats for  various national groups. Nowadays this is an unconstitutional  norm.    There is so far no uniform position on the participation of  representatives of the executive organs of power in the  elections either. The range of opinions runs from a total ban,  as in St. Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod, for example, to, in  effect, total authorization of such participation. Thus  following the 30 January elections in Penza Oblast, 20 of the 45  deputies are heads of administrations or their deputies.    Article 66 of the the Russian Federation Constitution  assigns  the right to adopt the charter of a kray or oblast to the  region's representative organ of power; however, the  administrations of Vladimir, Vologda, and a number of other  oblasts are trying to submit charters to local referenda. But  the documents are crude from the legal point of view, and  moreover, there is no law on local referenda. Thus the basis is  laid for future conflict.    [Dorofeyev] However, elections have already been held in 15  regions of Russia. Can the executive branch of power be  considered satisfied with the outcome of these elections?    [Samoylov] It is mainly people of the old so-called party  and economic aktiv who have been voted on to all the newly  elected organs. And now, when a significant part of the budget  will be formed at local level, the expenditure part could be  based, not on the interest of the region, but on the collective  or private interests of the local political or economic elite.  This is alarming. Given such a makeup the representative  organs of power will continue to direct their activity toward  resolving day-to-day economic questions, although these have now  been withdrawn from their jurisdiction.    A worrying trend is the virtual absence of lawyers in the  new  representative organs. After all, the legislative function is  to become the basic activity of these organs. Nor are there any  economists in the classical sense of the word. Though it is  possible to look at these problems from another point of view.  Voters have entrusted mandates to the people who control the  real levers of power, and who therefore will be able to do  something for them.    [Dorofeyev] Does this apply to all the federation  components?    [Samoylov] In principle -- yes. There is no serious reform  of the new organs of power even in the republics. As a result  of elections here even the leaders have on the whole stayed the  same, as, for example, in Aldygey, Altay, Tuva... True, reform  has been carried out thoughtfully and effectively in  Kabardino-Balkaria, Mariy El, and the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia).    [Dorofeyev] And are there regions where elections have taken  place without coordination with the Central Electoral Commission?    [Samoylov] No, there are no such cases, but a number of  territories have put well-argued requests to the Central  Electoral Commission and the President's Administration to  postpone elections to later dates. The requests of Sverdlovsk,  Chelyabinsk, Saratov, and Krasnodar Administrations have been  granted. Nor are objections being made to the decisions of a  number of republics where elections will be held in summer or  fall 1994.    [Dorofeyev] What forecasts can be made on the basis of the  results of the elections which have been held in 15 regions?    [Samoylov] Some conclusions can be drawn already.  Evidently, the voter turnout will be considerably lower than  for the elections to the Federal Assembly. On the other hand,  the competition for deputies' seats is high: between five and  15 candidates. All parties and movements are displaying the most  energetic and committed attention to the election campaign, but  their leaders will not, as a rule, be elected to the local  dumas. Therefore candidates are mainly trying to distance  themselves from political parties (although they have a definite  political "complexion") and prefer to stand as independent  candidates or as representatives of groups of voters. I suggest  that between 40 and 50 percent of deputies will turn out to be  heads of administrations at all levels.    Speaking of the results as a whole, in my view it will be  mainly people who want to be involved in practical business, and  not in politics, who will succeed. And this will probably  enable political disputes to be somehow avoided. God grant, as  the saying goes, that this mood continues among deputies and  voters alike....    [Dorofeyev] And finally, Sergey Nikolayevich, a question  which nowadays concerns many people -- the timetable for holding  the elections. There is a very wide range of opinions here, and  only quite recently the Russian Federation president's Public  Chamber actually recommended that the process of holding  elections to the representative organs of power be extended  until June 1994. What is your opinion on this subject?    [Samoylov] This concerns the organs of local  self-government. Indeed, elections were planned in 48 regions  of Russia from January through March, but the quality of the  legal basis raises doubts in many political forces.    The executive at the local level proceeds on the premise  that  simultaneous elections will help to increase voter turnout and  save money. The president's administration shares the concern  of the Public Chamber.    From our point of view, it more correct to hold elections to  the regional representative organ of power first. It elaborates  and ratifies the normative basis for the organs of local  self-government, using the existing administration documents and  the edicts of the Russian Federation president.    Though I have already said that there is no strict  regulation  as to the timeframes...</p>

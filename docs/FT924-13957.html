			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UN gives action plan for Somalia THE United Nations yesterday presented to donor nations a 100-day action plan for Somalia intended to strengthen UN relief operations in the war and famine-ravaged country. This follows strong criticism that the UN aid effort has been feeble and badly co-ordinated. Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, UN special representative for Somalia, said at least 300,000 Somalis, mostly children, might have died over the past 18 months 'whilst the UN and (most of) the international community . . . watched Somalia descend into this hell'. The UN said almost 1m Somalis were on the brink of death from starvation and disease, and millions more might die if urgent assistance was not forthcoming. It is appealing for Dollars 82.7m (Pounds 46.4m) to implement its plan for a massive infusion of food aid, alongside provision of shelter materials and medical supplies, a mass measles immunisation campaign and the start of a longer-term programme of recovery and rehabilitation, including delivery of seeds and tools. Baroness Chalker, Britain's overseas aid minister, yesterday urged Mr Sahnoun to make security his highest priority. 'We have a duty to the starving to make clear to those who are using violence to frustrate the relief effort that the international community will no longer stand by and see the poor and sick held to ransom,' she said. The precarious security in Somalia, which has led to widespread looting of food supplies, preoccupied delegates on the first day of the two-day donors' meeting.</p>

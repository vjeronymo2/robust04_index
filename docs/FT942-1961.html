			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Taiwan ready for N-power showdown: Laura Tyson on a debate over a fourth nuclear facility Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party is marshalling its forces for a parliamentary showdown with the opposition over the budget for the government's planned Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 4.1bn) nuclear power plant. Lawmakers will tomorrow review the state power monopoly Taiwan Power Company's proposed Dollars 4.2bn fiscal 1995 budget for the country's controversial fourth nuclear facility, slated to be ready for production in 2001. Debate over the plant's budget last year sparked a full-scale melee outside the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament). Feuding legislators' supporters battled for hours before police were able to overwhelm them. In a bid to mollify public concerns over safety and costs, Taipower yesterday released a white paper outlining the country's energy requirements and emphasising the need for the plant. Funding for the project had been frozen following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 until 1992, when parliament released enough money to restart the project and get the bidding process going. Taiwan's demand for power is growing at 6 per cent a year. The margin of surplus has been running at between 4 and 8 per cent, against a recommended ratio of 20-30 per cent. Taipower has been forced to ration electricity to industrial users during the summer months for the past several years. Taipower's existing power generation capacity stood at 19,355MW at the end of 1993. Of total capacity, 13.3 per cent is hydroelectric, 60.1 per cent thermal and 26.6 per cent nuclear. By 2001, assuming construction proceeds as scheduled, installed capacity is projected to nearly double to 34,000MW for a reserve margin of 20 per cent. It is far from clear whether the Nationalist party can muster enough support to push the budget through, despite holding two-thirds of parliamentary seats. 'The major difference between national energy policy in the 1980s and energy policy in the 1990s is now you have to take the public's views into consideration,' observed a senior researcher at a government-backed think-tank, the Chung Hwa Institution for Economic Research. Residents living near the proposed site in Kungliao township near Taipei are fighting the project. Some 10,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest march in the capital on May 29. Critics of the plant say that, apart from safety concerns, waste disposal will be problematic in crowded Taiwan. Opponents say that adding coal- or gas-fired thermal plants would address the energy supply problem without creating the public uproar fomented by nuclear power. Meanwhile, contractor bidding on the project remain in limbo pending the outcome of the legislative session. Three companies - ABB, the Swiss-Swedish concern, through its US entity Combustion Engineering, Westinghouse in partnership with Nuclear Electric, the UK public utility and France's state-run Framatome - are in the running for the nuclear reactor contract, set to cost Dollars 2.2bn. If MPs pass the budget, contracts are should be awarded late next month or in August. Bidding for the plant's turbine generators, set to cost Dollars 1.9bn, is still in the pre-qualification stages. Further down the road, the government has drafted regulatory changes which would break Taipower's monopoly on the power industry by allowing private sector companies to own and run power plants. The proposed changes were in response to an application by Formosa Plastics, Taiwan's largest private conglomerate, to build a coal-fired plant. Taipower is discussing the logistics and technicalities of such changes with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is unlikely that a result will emerge for at least one or two years, Taipower officials say. Mr Gordon Wu, head of Hong Kong conglomerate Hopewell Holdings, came to Taiwan on a reconnaissance trip in March. Hopewell is credited with alleviating chronic power shortages in the Philippines. But Taiwan has many battles to fight before Mr Wu can begin to hope for a piece of the action.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NURSES, PATIENTS FEEL THE PAIN OF SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET CUTS;  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE: WITH THE RANKS OF PROFESSIONALS REDUCED, SOME MINOR MEDICAL  EMERGENCIES AT SCHOOLS ARE BEING HANDLED BY SECRETARIES AND CLERKS.  </P> <P> Patricia Contini, the only staff nurse in the 3,500-student Fillmore Unified  School District, was at her office recently when she got a call about an  injured student at a school eight miles away.  </P> <P> The elementary school student had run into a wall during recess and was  complaining that her shoulder hurt.  </P> <P> School officials called Contini, who advised that the girl's arms be put in  slings while help was sought. But officials at the school didn't have the  training or equipment to do it, she said.  </P> <P> "That would have been the more practical response, but because I wasn't there  it wasn't done," Contini said.  </P> <P> The student, whom Contini declined to identify, walked out of the school  holding her arms to support her injured shoulders. She was taken to a doctor by  her mother and later diagnosed with two fractured shoulder blades.  </P> <P> Contini said the incident demonstrates the need for more school nurses. "That  was one of several scenarios when I wished to heck I was at that school," she  said.  </P> <P> Countywide, about 50 school nurses serve more than 110,000 students in 20  school districts, according to the Ventura County School Nurses Assn.  </P> <P> And the nurses' ranks are shrinking as public school funding dries up.  </P> <P> Like nurses in other school districts in the county, Contini says she cannot  treat all of the students she is supposed to serve. But at least most districts  have at least one nurse on staff. Two districts, Santa Paula Elementary and  Ojai Unified, have none.  </P> <P> Instead, minor medical emergencies are handled by school secretaries or clerks,  usually trained in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Their  duties also include notifying parents when their children are hurt.  </P> <P> Edward Kessler, Santa Paula's director of special services, said that the  district has three CPR-trained health aides who serve seven schools and that  each has at least six years of experience.  </P> <P> Andrew Smidt, superintendent of the Ojai Unified district, said the district  has tried to provide emergency training to as many employees as possible.  </P> <P> "We feel we're really providing a good response in terms of emergencies," Smidt  said. "It's working well, and one of the reasons it's working well is we have a  lot of folks alert to any particular problems."  </P> <P> In districts with no nurses on staff, medical duties sometimes are performed by  nurses on contract from the county school superintendent's office and paperwork  is done by clerical aides.  </P> <P> In the Simi Valley Unified School District, whose 11-member nursing program was  considered a model and used as a training ground for new school nurses from Cal  State Northridge, five nurses were laid off last spring as a result of $8  million in budget cuts.  </P> <P> Until this year, Camarillo's Pleasant Valley School District had only one  school nurse, district Health Supervisor Jacqui Pease, who made the rounds at  13 schools housing the district's 6,500 students. The district hired another  full-time nurse this fall, Pease said.  </P> <P> School nurses are required by the state to test vision and hearing and check  for scoliosis, a disease that curves the spine and sometimes affects teen-age  girls.  </P> <P> Nurses or their assistants must also keep track of student immunization  records, said Wana Klasen, school nurse at Channel Islands High School and  co-president of the county school nurses group.  </P> <P> In addition to the demands of school nursing, the education requirements are  high, Klasen said. Registered nurses who work in hospitals are not required to  have college degrees, but school nurses must have bachelor's degrees, be RNs  and have credentials from the state Department of Education, she said.  </P> <P> "The whole image of the school nurse as someone who sits there and hands out  Band-Aids has really, really changed," said Klasen, who sees between 35 and 40  students a day at the 2,800-student school. "That's a heavy caseload. They come  in for everything you can think of -- health counseling, emotional counseling,  first aid of course. Or they may be ill with the flu and need to be sent home."  </P> <P> Klasen's district, the six-school Oxnard Union High School District, is one of  the few in the county with a nurse at every school, she said.  </P> <P> Most districts require parents to sign forms indicating how they can be reached  in an emergency. Or, if a parent can't be reached, the form gives medical  authorities permission to perform emergency procedures.  </P> <P> In rare cases, a hospital might not accept the district's parental consent form  but require a parent to be present when emergency treatment is given. In those  instances, a court order would be obtained to treat the child, officials at  several districts said.  </P> <P> Sandy Everhart, a secretary at Santa Paula's Barbara Webster Elementary School,  said she takes care of students' minor cuts and scrapes almost daily; less  frequently, she must seek treatment for students with more serious injuries,  such as fractures.  </P> <P> "I feel qualified to handle all of the emergencies I've had thus far, and thank  goodness we haven't had anything of a life-threatening nature," said Everhart.  </P> <P> Everhart said she has authority to administer medication to children with  written permission from their parents and permission and instructions from the  family doctor. However, she said some secretaries are uneasy about  administering injections to students allergic to bee stings because they have  not been trained to use syringes.  </P> <P> "However, in most cases if this should happen you would have a child's life in  your hands. . . ," Everhart said. "They could die within 10 minutes or stop  breathing. It really bothers me."  </P> <P> In Simi Valley, as a result of $8 million in cutbacks, all of the nurses at the  elementary level have been eliminated, said Assistant Supt. Allan Jacobs.  However, the district's other five nurses still provide the same coverage to  other schools, he said.  </P> <P> In addition, the district's nurses are on call to respond to emergencies at  elementary schools, Jacobs said. Minor elementary school injuries are handled  by principals or secretaries, he said.  </P> <P> "All of us were very sorry we had to do away with a nursing program that was  outstanding," Jacobs said. "Obviously, it would be better to have a nurse full  time on each campus, and it would be better to have more nurses, but in the  scheme of things we have to do what we can to meet our budget."  </P> <P> The district has rehired two of the laid-off nurses under special anti-drug  grant programs, and two others are doing part-time vision testing in the  district.  </P> <P> Another former Simi Valley school nurse, Sandra Holmgren, is program specialist  for health services and education in the Ventura Unified School District.  </P> <P> "The feeling when the layoffs took place in Simi was that the children were  being given short shrift," Holmgren said. "It was just a very good program and  all of that was lost."  </P> <P> In Ventura, Holmgren supervises five nurses, including full-time nurses at both  Buena and Ventura high schools.  </P> <P> During a typical, recent workday, Fillmore's Contini visited three schools for  consultations and made three home visits, including two trips to deliver  clothing that she purchased from the Salvation Army for needy students.  </P> <P> "Our role as nurses is extremely vast," Contini said. "It's a lot like being a  social worker. I don't spend a lot of time on first aid."  </P> <P> But Contini, who, like several other county school nurses, gave up hospital  work for school nursing, said she has no regrets about the trade-off.  </P> <P> "I love what I do," Contini said. "I like this environment. I have a lot of  autonomy. I have great ability to impact a lot of people, and I think that's  wonderful."  </P></p>

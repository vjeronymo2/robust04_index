			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Unisys returns to the black despite downturn in sales UNISYS reported its first profitable quarter in three years, buoying confidence that the struggling US computer manufacturer is on the road to recovery. Although sales revenues dipped, the company said US orders booked during the quarter showed the strongest gain in five years. For the fourth quarter, the computer manufacturer reported net income of Dollars 80.5m, or 31 cents a share, well above Wall Street expectations and a strong recovery from 1990 fourth-quarter losses of Dollars 88.5m, or 74 cents. Revenues declined sharply, however, to Dollars 2.46bn for the quarter, compared with Dollars 2.93bn in the same period a year ago. Unisys said the drop reflected 'continuing market weakness, lower shipments at the end of product cycles and the sale of its Timeplex subsidiary in June 1991'. Unisys said strong demand in Pacific Rim markets and improvement in the US were offset by continued weakness in Europe during the fourth quarter. Over the past two years, Unisys has restructured its operations to cut costs and reduce its heavy debt load. Debt declined around Dollars 150m in the fourth quarter, Unisys said. At the end of the third quarter, the company's debt load was just under Dollars 3bn. 'Our programme to reshape the company is on schedule in terms of both lowering our cost structure in line with market conditions and focusing our strategic product, technology, service and market initiatives,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. For 1991, Unisys recorded a net loss of Dollars 1.4bn, including a special charge of Dollars 1.2bn in the second quarter, on revenues of Dollars 8.7bn. This compares with a 1990 loss of Dollars 436.7m, including a special charge of Dollars 181m, on revenue of Dollars 10.1bn. Mr Unruh said: 'We do not expect early improvement in general economic conditions or a lessening of competitive pressures in our information systems business. However, we did start the year with a stronger base of business. . . and we remain committed to profitability for the year.' Unisys stock rose to Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 7 at close of trade, from a Wednesday close of Dollars 5 3/4 , on news of its higher-than-expected earnings.</p>

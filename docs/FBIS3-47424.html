			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will be  acquiring additional F-5 fighter aircraft to replace some of its  older planes.    Mr. Teo Ming Kian, the Defence Ministry's permanent  secretary  (Defence Development), said Singapore Aerospace (SAe), which is  now upgrading the RSAF's existing fleet of F-5 aircraft, will be  sourcing for additional F-5s to replace some of the older A4-S  Skyhawks and J65 Hawker Hunters.    These aircraft will be phased out in the near future, said  Mr. Teo in a report in the latest issue of PIONEER magazine.    As the United States manufacturer of F-5s, Northrop, has  stopped production of the aircraft, SAe will source for the  additional planes from other countries that are planning to  phase out their own F-5s.    Mr. Teo said this during a visit to SAe last month, where he  was given an update of the progress of the F-5 upgrade project.    Apart from its use by the RSAF, the F-5 is still one of the  front-line interceptors for the air forces of Indonesia,  Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.    These air forces are reported to operate some 400 such  aircraft.    Under the RSAF's upgrading project, which started more than  four years ago, the first prototype of the upgraded F-5 is  expected to take to the sky early this year.    During his visit, Mr. Teo viewed the prototype with its new  radar and avionic systems.    The new air-intercept radar system gives the aircraft the  ability to "look down" and detect low-flying targets against a  stationary background.    The avionic systems will be fully computerised. With just  small finger movements on the throttle, the pilot will be able  to control all aircraft functions, from the weapons to the radar  and communication systems.    The upgrading of the F-5s, which entered service with the  air  force in 1979, is one of Mindef's [Ministry of Defense's] life  extension programmes, which give older weapon systems a new  lease of life at a fraction of the cost of acquiring new systems.    Work on the F-5 is being jointly undertaken by the Defence  Technology Group, SAe, and the Defence Ministry's Air Logistics  Department.</p>

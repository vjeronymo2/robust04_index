			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG FIGHT RESOLVED;  </P> <P> FEUDING COUPLE WORK OUT PLAN FOR FUTURE OF ESPRIT  </P> <P> The estranged husband and wife team that owns Esprit de Corp. -- known for its  line of trendy womens' apparel and its former egalitarian corporate culture --  on Monday announced a plan aimed at ending the couple's long and bitter feud  over control of the company.  </P> <P> The plan could result in the eventual sale of the San Francisco-based fashion  and retailing firm founded by Doug and Susie Tompkins. The Tompkinses, who  filed for divorce earlier this year, each have fought to become the sole owner  of Esprit.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Doug Tompkins will have the option to buy out Susie Tompkins'  50% interest in the business. If Doug Tompkins fails to purchase his wife's 50%  stake in 120 days, his half of the company as well as hers will be put up for  sale at auction, the company said. At that time, Susie Tompkins or anyone else  could bid for the entire company.  </P> <P> "We are pleased with this major step forward in resolving the ownership of the  company," said Esprit President Corrado Federico in a prepared statement. "This  will allow us to continue our programs that have increased the company's  profitability and financial strength."  </P> <P> Neither Federico nor the Tompkinses were available for further comment.  </P> <P> Monday's agreement is the latest chapter in the stormy personal and business  relationship between the Tompkinses, who have been estranged for several years.  </P> <P> The Tompkinses began selling Esprit clothing in the late 1960s through  catalogues mailed to affluent households. Susie Tompkins was responsible for  designing the company's line of colorful and loose-fitting clothing. Her  husband was responsible for the marketing and business operations. By 1987,  profits reportedly had grown to $80 million on sales of $1 billion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tensions Grew  </P> <P> Esprit's corporate culture was almost as colorful as its clothing. Employees at  the firm's 10-acre San Francisco complex attended free language classes and  could sign up for free tennis lessons on Esprit's grass court. Employees were  also given tickets to cultural events as well as use of a company-owned Lake  Tahoe ski cabin.  </P> <P> As Esprit's sales and fame grew, so did tensions between the Tompkinses. The  couple disagreed on what direction Esprit's clothing line would take. According  to a March, 1988, story in the Wall Street Journal, company employees said Doug  Tompkins had extramarital affairs with Esprit workers.  </P> <P> "There are emotional relationships in any business," said Doug Tompkins in an  interview with the Journal. "Whether they end up in bed or not, that's  irrelevant. I don't know any such relationship that has caused adverse effects  within this company."  </P> <P> The Tompkinses' conflict over company strategy apparently hurt sales and  profits, according to industry analysts. Esprit's move to build a chain of  company-owned and franchised stores also proved costly. About 70 Esprit stores  are in operation nationwide.  </P> <P> In the past two years, Esprit cut its staff and perks, and new managers from  rival apparel firms were hired. As a result, industry officials said the  company's bottom line has improved.  </P> <P> But relations between the Tompkinses remained rocky. In 1988, three new  directors joined Esprit's board as a result of a lawsuit filed by Susie  Tompkins. Later, both Tompkinses abandoned most of their operational control  over the company.  </P></p>

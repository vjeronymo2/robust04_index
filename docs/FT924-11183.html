			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Strike depresses Fletcher Challenge Canada results FLETCHER Challenge Canada suffered a net loss of CDollars 18.8m (USDollars 15.08m) for the three months to September 30, compared with a loss of CDollars 16.3m for the same period last year. Mr Doug Whitehead, the president and chief executive officer for Canadian operations, said the result was marginally better than expected and was an improvement on the net loss of CDollars 20.1m recorded in the preceding quarter to June 30. Sales for the September quarter declined to CDollars 207m from CDollars 252m a year ago. The decline resulted mainly from production lost during a month-long strike in the British Columbia pulp and paper industry, lower newsprint prices, and the absence of lumber production from the Hammond sawmill which was sold in December 1991. Mr Whitehead said the improvement in the June quarter was encouraging as it was achieved in spite of the strike.</p>

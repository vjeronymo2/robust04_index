			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Age of innocence - Is the concept of childhood a modern invention? Patricia Morision looks at the artists' approach as in literature - essentially a modern invention brought about by the rise of the bourgeois family? It was the French historian Philipe Aries who first suggested this idea 30 years ago, in the English edition of Centuries of Childhood. His brilliant and profoundly influential - albeit flawed - thesis sought to answer two fundamental questions: were children treated differently in the past? Did the concept of childhood exist in premodern Europe and if not, when did it emerge? Innocence and Experience at the City Art Gallery in Manchester, is a lineal descendant of Aries's project. An exhibition of paintings of children by British artists from 1600 to the present day, it shows the great variation during those centuries of artists' approach to children. At one end of the period is a portrait by an anonymous artist, dated 1611, of a little boy dressed in petticoats and holding a teething-rattle. For all that, with his impassive stare and stiffly formal pose, the child is every inch the heir to the mighty Norfolk family. Contrast that with one of the most recent works, a charcoal sketch made in 1983 by Dennis Creffield. Here is the disturbing image of a newborn baby son, wailing and ugly except (are we right to assume?) in the eyes of his loving father. The hang of the exhibition is not chronological. Paul Van Somers (as the Elizabethan artist has been identified) appears in the same section as Creffield, and as Augustus John's portrait of his son Robin, Peter Blake's painting of himself and his sister reading comics, and paintings by Sonia Boyce and Eileen Cooper. In just this section, titled 'A Sense of Identity', our attention is drawn to such concerns, whether acknowledged or not by the artist, as racism, exile, childhood nostalgia, adolescent sexuality, paternal tyranny and maternal fear of her son's sexuality. All very interesting but for my taste, in the context of an exhibition, this is all far too much. What we see in the gallery is a large group of some 60 paintings and a few sculptures. Of very mixed quality, they are in many cases both interesting and unfamiliar. The exhibition has been mounted with the eternally praiseworthy intention of being popular and accessible, children being a theme to pull in the punters much as an exhibition of horses or cats might do. But then, because Innocence and Experience is a serious show put on by researchers committed to art in the service of social history (Joan Crossley created the interesting if flawed exhibition, Images of the Army a few years ago at the Whitworth), it swerves violently towards the kind of stodgy didacticism which surely risks putting up a barrier between the public and the paintings. The images are being made to work too hard to serve as documents. In a book, it works fine (the well-produced catalogue makes a stimulating read); whereas confronted with the actual paintings, the voice of the social historian becomes tiresomely strident. There is too much loaded onto these walls, all manner of social and psychological insights seething beneath the surface to emerge as oddly random snippets of accompanying text. Predictably, the show includes the darker side of images of children art, namely their sexual appeal. That said, courage runs out some way short of investigating child pornography. In the concluding section entitled 'The End of Innocence', we are directed towards male artists' voyeuristic representations of the adolescent girl by Gerald Brockhurst's remarkable image of his lover Dorette. Although he called it Adolescence, he was actually representing a woman in her twenties but the point is valid enough if we think of Balthus. The eternal appeal of the ephebe surfaces in a dreadful drawing, 'Love Among the Schoolboys' (once possibly owned by Oscar Wilde) by the scandalous Edwardian artist Simeon Solomon, and 'Berryboy' by the no less scandalous Gilbert and George. To be sure, ever since antiquity images of young boys have been used to convey an overt sexual message. But what extraordinary mental gymnastics are required of the visitor to see why such images belong in the same section as Alan Ramsay's little sketch of his dead son and Millais's famous 'Autumn Leaves'. In the end, this exhibition is too ambitious for its own good, too knowing. It might have been better to stick to a chronological hang and follow through Aries's perceptions, taking issue with the master where he needs correction. It would have been nice to have started in the middle ages because of the opportunity to correct Aries who, in flagrant disregard of the evidence, stated that there were no artistic representations of children because le sentiment de l'enfance did not exist. Apart from that omission, there are the paintings here which could have given the exhibition a clearer structure. Family portraits by Zoffany, Hogarth and Joseph Wright of Derby make abundantly clear the influence of Romantic ideas on children's dress and demeanour. So does this exhibition support Aries's view that childhood is a modern idea? Unfortunately it is too confused and too overstuffed. It is an intelligent and commendable venture which needed to be physicked, given a purge. With the courage of greater simplicity, it would have led to greater wisdom and pleasure. Innocence and Experience will be toured by the South Bank Centre; the sponsor is BT.

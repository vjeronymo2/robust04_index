			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gojko Marinkovic: "Does Mesic Like Skiing?"] </F>   [Text] No sooner had the fuss abated about GLOBUS releasing  top secret information on war crimes committed by the so-called  Mercep's unit than the [Croatian] weekly again came into  conflict with the ruling Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ]. This  time it was over the article "Are Stipe Mesic, Josip Manolic,  and Gojko Susak Leaving Office?," which analyzes the dramatic  crescendo in the second round of conflicts in the leadership of  the HDZ. Supporting its story with a top-level source (in the  previous case the regime's newspapers accused Josip Manolic of  leaking state secrets), GLOBUS explicitly claims that 20 days  ago President Tudjman proposed that Mesic, chairman of the  parliament, resign, which Mesic refused. GLOBUS's source further  claims that, with regard to Mesic's reluctance to resign, the  change is not certain for the time being, because the power  structure in parliament is such that Mesic has the full support  of HDZ deputies, and most probably among the opposition.  <H5>  Strategic Differences in Opinions </H5>   As for Manolic, the chairman of the parliament's Chamber of  Counties, Tudjman has not yet recommended that he resign, which  does not mean that such a request might not be made soon.  Manolic, at one time a very close Tudjman aide and the second  most powerful man in Croatia, today disagrees with the president  over the majority of strategic issues. Everything that they  argued about before the 2d General Convention of the HDZ has  recently escalated: in the first place on the policy on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the attitude toward that legal state.  Furthermore, they disagree about the further political  orientation of the HDZ, as well as about the choice of the  party's leadership. The depth of that breach is clearly shown  in an interview with Manolic, where he asks: "And why should  the HDZ exist at all?" Manolic's view is that the HDZ's work  is, actually, at an end, that is to say, it took power from the  communists, but he obviously disagrees that the HDZ should  remain in power at any price, particularly not by straying into  a dangerous, right-wing direction, to put it mildly. Similar  views are also held by Mesic, who at this moment has been pushed  to the margins, just like the entire parliament after all.  However, since he, according to the Constitution, potentially  holds the second most important position in Croatia, because as  the chairman of parliament he is also the president's deputy, it  is quite logical for pressures to be put on him to resign, but  he is also doing everything to avoid that.    As for the strongest representative of the right wing,  Defense Minister Gojko Susak, who is very close to President  Tudjman, but also has strong connections with Herceg-Bosna,  actually his real base, he can also no longer boast of Tudjman's  trust as much as he was able to until recently. There are two  major charges against him: Susak is reproached for the  catastrophic situation in Herceg-Bosna, and blamed for the  tragedy of the Croats in central Bosnia, while he is also  considered responsible for the underdevelopment of the Croatian  military-industrial complex. Of course, Susak's name is  inseparable from Mate Boban, who again failed to appear in  Geneva, sending Mile Akmadzic as a replacement, who actually  signed the agreement with [Bosnian Serb] Nikola Koljevic.  Tudjman had already explained earlier that Boban had not been  suspended, but the issue has to do with a concession to the  Muslims, who directly accuse Boban of initiating the  Croat-Muslim war.  <H5>  The Time Factor </H5>   Manolic, who again gave an interview to GLOBUS, says,  commenting on Tudjman's explanation: "Perhaps that answer may  satisfy some people, but not necessarily all people." However,  he has also gone a step further in making accusations at the  expense of Boban and Susak. He claims that "Boban called on the  citizens of central Bosnia many times to leave their homes,  offering them vast and fertile pieces of land on the Adriatic  coast, in Istria, and on the islands. This was a strategic  error of Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the  Croats were being called on to leave the land where their roots  are. Such a policy would mean the Serbs crossing the Drina  River and joining Knin to greater Serbia. The architects of  Croatian policy in Bosnia, who are largely influenced by  Herzegovinian reality, are unacceptably sensitive to any  critical view, still considering their policy to be the best.  However, the results have invalidated their view and led them  into ever greater isolation."    Manolic disagrees with Susak that Croatia should intervene  militarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because "anybody who makes  such statements must know what they mean for the Croatian  state." Manolic does not even try to hide the fact that he is  in open conflict with the defense minister, but he is uncertain  what the conclusion will be: Whether one of them will have to  leave, or if the entire issue will be left to the drift of time.  However, what he most frequently argues about with his  opponents, who call him a former agent of UDBA [State Security  Administration, the former Yugoslav secret police] and a  communist, is his assessment in one word of the effectiveness of  the lawful state: Catastrophic! "Murders, violence, evictions,  frame-ups, smuggling -- all these have become everyday  occurrences. Still, the worst thing is that a very small number  of cases are investigated, and a very small number come to  court. The war explains the increased violence, but  independently of the war, the authorities must not tolerate  murder, or let the murderers get away with it."    However, that something is going on has been confirmed by an  article by a minor journalist (Ante Gugo) in SLOBODNA DALMACIJA,  which should be read only because that newspaper customarily  expresses the attitudes of the authorities. Which is to say,  this journalistic apprentice, who became the chief of NEDJELJNA  DALMACIJA correspondent's bureau overnight, claims that the  story about Mesic's suspension has been carefully safeguarded,  and that is only 45 days old. According to Gugo, the removal of  Vice Vukojevic, "the man who most openly opposed the desired and  badly needed reconciliation of the Croatian people within  itself," demanded a sacrifice to be made by the other side as  well. A scapegoat was found in Mesic, because his open  confrontation with Tudjman's policy makes his departure even  less curious, whereas the chances that Manolic will be  suspended, as well as that Susak's position as defense minister  will be taken over by Franjo Greguric, are less likely.  According to this interpretation, Manolic is one of the most  active cofounders of the party, a relentlessly cunning and lucid  man, who can be counted upon in critical situations, while  representing no danger, because he has only a honorary function.  As for Susak, he is to be given the greatest credit "for the  implementation of many things in the army and the system of  defense," and thanks to him, Croatian soldiers "are eating the  same food as NATO soldiers, and smoking Marlboro cigarettes in  crush-proof packs."  <H5>  Disagreements </H5>   Although it is completely clear that the conflict within the  HDZ is still not over, and that all the disagreements and  differences of concepts have only now come to light (it was  noticed that at the latest session of the Presidential Defense  Council Manolic, Mesic, and Vrdoljak were all absent, while at  the same time Ivan Bobetko stated that he would be extending his  membership in the HDZ, because the stream of former UDBA agents  had definitely lost the battle; he also said that if they had  won power, it would have completely ruined Croatia, which it is  still doing under the wing of Glavas in Osijek), the party's  Council states that "the misinformation about the rifts in the  leadership are not true and quite malicious. Furthermore,  speculation about the suspensions of some top officials,  particularly Mssrs. Mesic, Manolic, and Susak is also false. It  is not true that the president of the republic has demanded  Mesic's resignation, while the only truth is that Mesic is  having his annual vacation, and he will be staying abroad for a  while."    (By the way, to journalists who asked why Mesic took a  month's vacation in the middle of winter and on the eve of the  parliamentary session scheduled for 25 January, Manolic wittily  answered: "Well, he probably likes skiing!")    However, the HDZ Council has not remained on the defensive,  as it also says that "some moves and demands by some opposition  parties aimed at causing a constitutional crisis and prompting  early elections obviously do not contribute to the consolidation  of internal stability and the international status of Croatia,  but are quite probably aimed at the destabilization of the  democratic process. Their goal is to stir up dissatisfaction  among the people, even social disorder by encouraging strikes,  and also, as they themselves say, cooperation with a sane part  of the HDZ, in order to cause a constitutional crisis and a  change of administration."   <H5>    Where The Problem Lies </H5>   And then there comes probably the most significant part of  the statement, that sounds as if it had been rewritten from not  so old [Communist] Party documents: "All of this is to be  viewed in the context of speculations disseminated by the  opposition and certain foreign circles about the need to find  acceptable successors to the current leaders in Croatia, as well  as in other states that came about with the collapse of former  Yugoslavia."    In addition to the fact that it was the first time that the  HDZ, although indirectly, had defended its greatest enemy,  namely Milosevic, the further course of events has shown where  the problem lies. The government has passed the Law on Internal  Affairs, where one clause says that "the president of the  Republic of Croatia is the supreme commander of all units of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs." If we connect this with the  statement made by the Council of the HDZ, and thereafter with  the statement of Jure Radic, HDZ secretary general and head of  the Cabinet of the President of the Republic, that "papers have  already been circulating throughout Croatia for many months,  which actually come from abroad, containing instructions on how  to destabilize the authorities," then it is clear that more and  more arguments are being invented for the current  semipresidential system, called superpresidential by many  people, to strengthen itself even further.    Under the pretext of conspiracies at home and abroad,  Tudjman  is trying to strengthen and legalize his self-governing even  more, which is made through the ever greater marginalization of  the parliament, as well as of the HDZ, which has been reduced to  a bureaucratic apparatus full of anonymous people. It seems  that Tudjman, as well as Manolic, understand that the HDZ has  played out its role -- it won the elections and came to power --  but since it is gradually turning into something like the former  Socialist Association, that supports only one policy, it will be  used merely as a voting machine for as long as possible. The  question is how long things will work that way, and whether the  steps like the Geneva agreement with the FRY will help the plan  or frustrate it. When, and if, it comes to disorder, one knows  what ought to be done.    Of course, there is no chance that early elections might be  announced, because, according to the opinion polls, a third of  the population supports early elections. The reason is that,  although the HDZ still leads with 33.8 percent, with the  Croatian Social Liberal Party led by Drazen Budisa are at its  heels with 33.1 percent, in early elections the HDZ could hardly  win such a large parliamentary majority as it has now. Which is  to say, all this has to do with the most typical power struggle,  and now one can see how truthful the statement by one of the  more prominent HDZ officials was: "Now it is our turn to rule  for the next 45 years!" Only then might it happen that the  ruling party changes its name into HDZ -- the Party of  Democratic Changes.</p>

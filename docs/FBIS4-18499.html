			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the National Alliance, Gianfranco  Fini, has said that he is satisfied with the decision of Silvio  Berlusconi to break off talks with the Northern League: "Other  than a four-sided agreement which comprises the Forza Italia,  the Northern League, the National Alliance and the Christian  Democrat Center party, said Fini, there is room for nothing but  an election. The only other possibility is a government made up  of the League, the Party of the Democratic Left and the Italian  Popular Party. If we returned to the polls, not a single  representative of the League would be elected to parliament".    Berlusconi is right when he says that he cannot take  anymore,  continued Fini. " How can one carry on negotiations with someone  who goes back on what they said the day before".</p>

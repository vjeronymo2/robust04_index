			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking to reporters at Bangkok airport this  afternoon on his return from an inspection tour of the south,  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the repatriation of Cambodian  refugees could be made after the situation in that country  returns to normal. The prime minister said:    [Begin recording] [Chuan] As a matter of fact, we can bar  them from entering our country. We must look after them for  humanitarian reasons. Those carrying arms must be disarmed  before their entry.    [Unidentified reporter] After the situation is safe, do we  simply send them back?    [Chuan] This means allowing them tp cross the border into  their country. We will not put them on buses and send them home  because they came here without an invitation.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Chuan] These Cambodians are not permanent refugees. If the  problem drags on, however, we should coordinate with the UNHCR  [United Nations High Commission for Refugees] because we might  be accused of supporting the Khmer Rouge. It is better to have  outsiders come here to see the problem themselves. The problem  is not that bad at this point. The refugees will not remain  here for a long period of time. After the situation is safe,  they must go.    [Reporter] It appears that the Cambodian Government is  rather  unhappy with the sudden repatriation of refugees without being  contacted. The refugees reportedly returned to the areas under  Khmer Rouge control.    [Chuan] We have no right to tell them where to resettle.  They came here themselves. They have the right to go where  they want. They are not permanent refugees. If that were the  case, they would have been taken care of by international  agencies from the very beginning. If they are going to be here  for a long time, however, we will have to seek help from  international organizations. The presence of Cambodian refugees  has already caused a financial burden to the agencies involved.  I heard complaints about this last Tuesday.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Chuan] The food supplies they carried with them will last  only a short time. We will have to feed them later.    [Reporter] [Wordsindistinct]    [Chuan] They can choose where they want to stay after  crossing the border. We will not force them to leave.    [Reporter] If the UNHCR asks Thailand to keep the refugees  for an unspecified period, will we...    [Chuan, interrupting] We must decide if this is necessary or  not. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Excerpts] The Government today admitted there was a  three-month-long "incorrect entanglement" between arms sales and  aid to Malaysia in 1988. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said  aid to Malaysia and 1 billion pounds in defence sales were  linked between March and June 1988 under a protocol signed by  the then Defence Secretary George Younger.    Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee:  "There was a temporary, incorrect entanglement, but there is now  no link."    And the Government accused Malaysia of being "short-sighted"  in imposing its trade ban last week in response to British press  allegations surrounding the Pergau dam project and arms sales to  the former colony.    Labour later claimed Mr Hurd's evidence, during a grilling  by  MPs which lasted almost three hours, was "incredible" and that  the link between aid and arms sales must have continued after  June 1988.    Britain contributed 234 million pounds to the dam  construction, believed to be the largest amount of overseas aid  for a single project in British history, while the Ministry of  Defence discussed a 1 billion pound defence with Malaysia [as  received].    Premier Mahathir Mohamad, angered by reports on the affair  in  Britain which included corruption accusations, has banned UK  firms from applying for contracts for Malaysian Government  business in a return to its Buy British Last policy. [passage  omitted]    Earlier, John Major accused the Malaysian Government of  being  "short-sighted" for freezing out British firms. In a radio  interview, the Prime Minister said Malaysia owed much of its  economic development to British trade and investment and its  interests would be equally badly affected.    He told BBC Radio 4's "Today" programme: "I don't believe  that what the Malaysian Government has done to British companies  is remotely justified." Malaysia was "within striking distance"  of achieving its ambition to become an industrialised country.  He added: "I believe it is short-sighted to have acted as they  have done, and I believe that over time they may be seen to have  damaged the Malaysian interest as much as the British."    Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad drummed home the  message later in a speech to businessmen from the Asia-Pacific  advisory group in which he warned that Malaysia had missed its  target and was hurting "its friends." Mr Goodlad said British  exports to Malaysia were worth almost 1 billion pounds last year  alone but added: "Trade benefits both partners. It should be  encouraged, not blocked." [passage omitted]    In his appearance before the committee, Mr Hurd criticised  the "swirl of speculative allegations" about the dam project,  adding: "To the best of my knowledge, most of these stories are  creatures of fancy." He said Britain was keen to increase trade  with Malaysia in 1988 and the Ministry of Defence had been  negotiating a 1 billion pound defence deal.    A protocol signed by Mr Younger, now Lord Younger,  "reflected  the Malaysian wish" for British aid equivalent to 20 percent of  the defence deal, Mr Hurd said. The link was broken three  months later when the Ministry of Defence realised it was  incorrect.    The Malaysians were informed in a letter from Mr Younger but  the committee heard that Malaysia was given a commitment for 200  million pounds in British aid in a different letter on the same  day.    Labour's Dennis Canavan asked Mr Hurd how he thought the  Malaysians would have viewed this. "Would you not even have the  tiniest bit of suspicion there was a link between these two  messages, or would you just think it was Christmas?" he asked.    Mr Hurd stressed the Government had "learned from the Pergau  experience" and procedures were tightened. But shadow foreign  secretary Jack Cunningham dismissed his evidence as "inadequate,  contradictory and incredible."    He said: "There can only be one explanation for the fact  that  the Prime Minister John Major and the Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd ignored the clear advice of their accounting officer that  the dam project was `an abuse of the aid system.' That is that  the two projects continued to be linked, despite the denial by  Conservative ministers to the House of Commons, the Public  Accounts Committee and now the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.    ``The fact that British trade and British jobs are now at  risk is entirely the fault of the Conservative Government and  Conservative ministers and their disreputable deals.''</p>

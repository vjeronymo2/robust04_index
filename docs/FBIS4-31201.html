			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emil Bajanek: "Who Prevents Martin Engineering </F> Works From Filling State Coffers? Incredible but True--the  State Itself"]    [Text] Martin, the slimmed-down ZTS [Heavy Engineering  Works] TEES Martin state enterprise, employs more than 4,800  people today. After 1990, the company extended its civilian  production program, in cooperation with the German Hanomag  company, with bulldozers and belt loaders and introduced the  production of Lombardini diesel engines under license.  Nevertheless, the production of special technology still  represents more than 50 percent of the engineering company's  output. But let Engineer Jan Segla, the company's director, do  the talking:    "In drafting our entrepreneurial plan for this year, we  reckoned with two key matters--that we succeed in obtaining a  government guarantee for the `India' contract and that we obtain  a credit of 200 million korunas [Sk] to set the production of  tractors in motion. So far, the government has not extended to  us the guarantee for the contract, which involves the delivery  of VT-72B retriever tanks worth $28 million for the Indian Army,  and we also have not obtained credit to purchase material for  the production of tractors, although the marketing of these  tractors has been secured. These are exceptionally serious  matters, the solution of which would permit us to make profit  this year and to start properly fulfilling our duties toward the  banks and internal revenue authorities. We had a singular  chance to get out of the red, and about 20 percent of the  company's employees would not have to be at home and collecting  only a part of their wages, according to the Labor Code, as has  been the case over the past few months."  <H5>  Government's Sad Calling Card </H5>   The contract for the delivery of 50 retriever tanks for  India  was signed in November 1993. Under the contract, the last tanks  were to be delivered to India in January 1995. In keeping with  the contract, by the end of January of this year, the Indian  side deposited with Ceskoslovenska Obchodna Banka [Czechoslovak  Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB] an advance payment of $5.6 million.  Without a government guarantee, however, the bank cannot  release the money for the ZTS TEES Martin state enterprise.  After all, it is a state enterprise and not a private one. The  Martin engineering company has Sk187 million deposited with the  CSOB, which it badly needs to fulfill the contract. It is  evident who benefits from this money. The previous government's  promises about support for companies' export activities sound  more or less grotesque in the face of this. Also, the new  government is in no hurry to extend the guarantee. "If the  government does not extend the guarantee soon, we are determined  to stage protest actions," Frantisek Ladnak, chairman of the  Kovo [metal workers] primary trade union organization in the ZTS  TEES state enterprise, told us, and we could sense from his  words that he meant it.    The people from Martin are honoring the contract, at the  price of considerable sacrifice, and intend to fulfill it by the  end of this year. Its total value is more than $28 million,  and, so far, the company has invested more than Sk500 million  from its own resources in its realization. Logically, it is  short of this money when it comes to purchasing materials for  civilian production. Incidentally, the Indian side is  considering a fourfold expansion of the contract.  <H5>  Invitation to Brno </H5>   The specialized IDET exhibition [of defense industries] will  be held in Brno this week. ZTS TEES Martin will display there  the modernized version of the medium T-72 MI tank. It is  equipped with a stronger engine, a reactive [reaktivna]  protection of the turret, and installed aggregates [instalovane  agregaty] that substantially improve its quality and combat  specifications. Experts from NATO countries cooperated in the  tank's modernization. Its selling price is $2-2.5 million. The  production capacity enables the production of 120 of these tanks  a year. Several armies of countries from so-called  conflict-free regions have shown interest in purchasing the  tank. The modernized tank will undoubtedly attract the interest  of experts who will come to the Brno exhibition.    "We reckon with the production of special technology also in  the future. However, it will not exceed one-half of the  company's output," says director Jan Segla. During the visit to  ZTS TEES Martin, we also learned that a new heavy tank is being  developed, as well as a rapid-deployment small-armored vehicle,  the Aligator, for army and police needs.    The development of civilian-production programs plays an  equally important role in the company, however. The Martin  company will continue expanding the production of diesel  engines, road-building machinery, tractors, and other  engineering products. Several foreign partners are contemplating  establishing joint ventures with the Turec [region in north  Slovakia, of which Martin is the center] engineering works. The  company's privatization is becoming topical. Let us hope that  the government will have a lucky hand in this case and, in view  of the company's strategic importance, will not permit excessive  fragmentation of its property. Foreign partners are following  this with meticulous care. Only a smaller part of the factory's  property should be privatized by means of coupons. The company  should be gradually transformed into an employee-stockholding  company and reorganized into the standard structure of a holding.    The ZTS TEES Martin state enterprise is going through a  difficult period of its existence. It is owed some Sk3 billion  by its customers; the Czech Motokov company alone owes it Sk900  million. Following the federation's partition, some of the  claims belong to the category of irrecoverable ones. One can  identify with Engineer Jan Segla's view that, if the Slovak  Government extended the aforementioned guarantee to the company,  implemented the promised write-off of credit interest rates  (Sk265 million), granted it a subsidy for conversion programs  (Sk79 million), which had also been promised already, and  allowed the company to sell off unnecessary property (Sk175  million) by granting it an exception from the law, and if the  company succeeded in obtaining from the bank a one-year loan of  Sk250 million, ZTS TEES Martin could, as of next year, again  contribute vitally needed resources to the state budget. The  company does not need words about the protection of the domestic  market and proexport policy. It needs the realization of  systemic measures, the state's wise subsidy policy aimed at  developmental programs, the alleviation of restrictive measures  in the sphere of provision of financial resources, and an  acceleration of the privatization process. In other words, it  needs action from a government that cannot be indifferent to the  prosperity of an enterprise that still belongs to the state.  And someone should also seriously ponder the warning from the  company's trade unionists.</p>

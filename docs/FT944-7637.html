			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Italian coalition partners call for crisis meeting Key partners in Italy's right-wing coalition government last night called for a crisis meeting to assess its chances of survival in the wake of the decision by magistrates to investigate corruption allegations against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The move highlighted the division within the Berlusconi government pitting the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi against its partners. It raised fears whether the government would last long enough to ensure the 1995 budget passed its last and hardest phase in the senate. Yesterday, concern over Italy's political instability forced the lira to another historic low against the D-Mark, being quoted at L1,035 against the German currency. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro urged the passing of the 1995 budget. This came after he met the speakers of the two houses, Mr Carlo Scognamiglio and Ms Irene Pivetti, two people likely to play a vital role in the coming days. The statement pointed out the present government could be changed only by a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Tensions within the government have been heightened in the wake of Tuesday's decision by Milan magistrates to place Mr Berlusconi under investigation for alleged corruption while running his Fininvest business empire. Mr Bossi said the government should only survive until the budget is approved. But yesterday the League leader and other members of his party were absent from a meeting of the coalition. This was attended by Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and chief co-ordinator of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, and Mr Pierfernando Casini, head of the small Christian Democrat Centre. Their call for an immediate clarification of where each coalition partner stood appeared aimed at forcing Mr Bossi's hand as well as assessing survival tactics. Mr Berlusconi yesterday stood by his claim of innocence. But Milan magistrates indicated they had taken evidence against him from 16 sources. Today, talks are due between government and unions in an attempt to head off the planned general strike on December 2 to protest at the budget and plans to cut pensions. Observer, Page 23</p>

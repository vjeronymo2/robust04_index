			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chances of `Purple' Coalition </F> Enhanced After Ministers' Resignation"]    [Text] The Hague -- The chances of a "purple" coalition of  the PvdA [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] have increased now that the  ministers of justice and the interior have resigned and the VVD  has emerged unscathed from its first confrontation with its  party members. Last weekend, the three main players in the  negotiations, the party leaders Kok (PvdA), Bolkestein (VVD),  and Van Mierlo (D66) said they were optimistic about the  possibility of forming a government together.    Last weekend, during the general meeting of the members of  his party in Breda, VVD leader Bolkestein had to justify the  attempt to work together with the party's former "archenemy,"  the PvdA. However, the letter by F. van der Vorm, a member of  the VVD branch in The Hague, which was full of concern regarding  the dangers of a "purple" coalition, did not send the slightest  ripple through the party. Previously, F. van der Form had made  a name for himself as the initiator of a an action collecting  signatures for the return to national politics of prominent VVD  politician Wiegel.    The atmosphere was excellent, primarily because of the  nine-seat victory scored by the liberals on 3 May, but also  because word was going around that the three intended coalition  partners were doing well in the opinion polls, at the cost of  the CDA, which has suffered further losses following the  elections. To loud applause, Bolkestein pointed out to his  members that at the end of the 1980's the VVD had unanimously  adopted the "Unbroken Lines" report which stated that the  liberals did not a priori rule out cooperation with any party.    The VVD leader also reminded his party members of his slogan  from the last four years: "No blockades, no flirting." "If we  now say we are not available, then we will actually cause a  blockade," said Bolkestein.    At the same time, he assured members of the VVD by promising  that their party would not bargain its viewpoints away. "The  days when the PvdA had 27 seats more than us are over. Now  there are only six seats between us. This means that no party  whatsoever can ignore what we have to say. We will not sign any  government pact in which our three main concerns have not  clearly been taken into consideration: substantial easing of  the fiscal burden, modernization of the social security system,  and extensive reorganization. We did not enter into the  negotiations merely with the intention of watching from the  sidelines. Have no fear: We were not born yesterday, and we  are looking after all your interests."    On Saturday, at the launch of his party's European election  campaign, PvdA leader Kok also had positive words to spare for  the "purple" coalition. "Step by step we are coming closer.  There is a real chance that it will succeed," he said. Kok also  pleaded to maintain the momentum of the process. The PvdA  leader and finance minister believes it is important that the  new government be able to draw up the 1995 budget. To enable  this, the government must be sworn in by mid-July at the latest.    D66 leader Van Mierlo, whose party also launched its  European  election campaign last Saturday, is of the opinion that the  resignation last Friday of the two police ministers Hirsch  Ballin of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and Van Thijn of  the PvdA could have a positive effect on the coalition  negotiations. Already back in April, in the first debate in the  Second Chamber on the decomposition of the Inter-Regional  Investigative Team, D66 and the VVD had called for the  resignation of the two government ministers responsible for the  proposal. Van Mierlo said: "The Lubbers III government is  finished, and that will certainly not work against the purple  coalition. Indeed, I regard it rather as a shove in the right  direction."</p>

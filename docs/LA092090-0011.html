			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL FUNDS  </P> <P> In response to "Deukmejian Gets Dunce Cap for Spiking Innovative School  Assessment Program," Opinion, Aug. 19:  </P> <P> I was both amazed and annoyed by this article. To read it, one would think that  the California Assessment Program was the best thing since sliced salami.  </P> <P> It was not. It was a waste of time for students, a waste of energy for teachers  and a waste of taxpayers' money.  </P> <P> Since no student's name was on the test, students were not accountable, so they  took a "who-cares" attitude. No teacher saw the results of his students' tests,  so they were not diagnostic.  </P> <P> CAP was sold to us by Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig as the  accountability for the extra millions of dollars that Gov. Deukmejian poured  into public schools by signing SB 813. When teachers and administrators heard  that Deukmejian cut CAP, they were dancing in the halls.  </P> <P> ANGIE PAPADAKIS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

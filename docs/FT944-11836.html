			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Gaz de France pulls out staff The French state gas company Gaz de France has withdrawn nearly all 200 of its expatriate staff from Algeria after Islamic fundamentalists murdered two foreign drilling experts, the newspaper Le Monde reported yesterday. A Gaz de France official declined to comment except to say: 'We are still present in Algeria and gas deliveries continue.' Le Monde said the decision to pull out Gaz de France expatriates was taken after the killing of a French and Italian technician employed by a French company in the Aures mountains of north-east Algeria on October 18. A senior French military official said last week that Paris was concerned by the attack, since it could signal an offensive by rebels against Algeria's gas and oil industries, the country's main currency earners. Gaz de France has been active in Algeria virtually since independence in 1962.</p>

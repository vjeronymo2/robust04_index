The number of projects launched this year is not likely to be  much more than last year's 129, according to Chaiyot Santiwong,  director of the Northern Region Investment Promotion Office.  This is because of government policy, particularly  decentralisation of growth to the provinces, and promotional  privileges for the rural zone three.    "Low interest rates, the plan to set up a new industrial  estate in Phichit, economic cooperation with Thailand's  neighbouring countries and low labour costs have boosted the  economy," he said.    Interest-rate levels and government stability have made the  country more attractive to international investors, he said.    The global economy is improving slightly, especially in the  United States, and the economic and trade policies of former  socialist countries have changed positively: Mr Chaiyot sees  opportunities for public service infrastructure, hotel,  residential building and environmental preservation projects in  Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lamphun and Lampang.    In the lower northern provinces, promotional privileges will  assist machinery, metal and other industries.    "The establishment of a new industrial estate in Phichit is  intended to stimulate competition in the lower North," he said.    The Board of Investment's [BoI's] northern office forecast  about 8 percent growth for the northern region this year,  compared to 1993's 7.8-7.9 percent.    Last year was seen as a golden time for investment in the  North he said. The BoI-approved plans involved total investment  of about 1,000 million baht. These created 25,038 jobs.    In 1989, which was seen as a good year, there were 73  projects worth a total of 11,273 million baht. These created  18,208 jobs.    In 1992, only 32 schemes were approved with a total  investment of 4,267 million baht. These created 8,749 jobs.    Last year, 100 projects (77.5 percent) were located in the  upper North and 29 (22.5 percent) were in the lower North.  Thirty-four projects were in Chiang Mai, 30 in Lamphun, 15 in  Tak, 10 in Lampang and eight in Chiang Rai. Seven projects were  in Nakhon Sawan and five in Phetchabun.    Mr Chaiyot said 35 industrial projects, mostly involving  mines, ceramics and metal production, had a combined cost of  2,688 million baht and created 4,388 jobs. These factories are  in Tak, Chiang Mai and Lampang.    Twenty-seven projects involved garments, textiles, shoes and  ornaments with a combined cost of 597 million baht. These  created 7,886 jobs and are mostly in Chiang Mai, Lamphun or  Chiang Rai.    Twenty-one projects were related to infrastructure and  services, 19 were agro-industrial factories, 15 were electronics  factories, nine involved metal production, machinery, equipment  and tools, and three involved petrochemical industries paper and  plastics.    Promotional privileges were granted for projects costing a  total of 1,795 million baht aimed at the export markets. These  created 5,583 jobs.    Mr Chaiyot said Thais spent a total of 7,138 million baht on  92 projects in the North last year. These created 18,777 jobs.    Twelve projects involving foreigners cost a total of 753  million baht and employed 1,768 people. These factories were  owned by Japanese, European, US, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korean  interests.    Twenty-five projects were joint ventures between Thais and  foreigners. These cost 1480 million baht and created 4,513  jobs, Mr Chaiyot said.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Belgium to seek air passenger quotas BELGIUM will today seek at a meeting of EC aviation ministers in Brussels the re-introduction of passenger capacity quotas to help financially strapped European airlines. The move will be firmly opposed by the UK. The meeting has been called by Belgium, which currently holds the EC presidency, and whose government has come under increasing pressure to support Sabena, the financially troubled Belgian flag carrier. Belgium is expected to present a paper at the meeting which raises the possibility not only of re-introducing capacity-sharing arrangements between airlines, but also floats the idea of EC funding for airlines in trouble. In response, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, is expected to make a strong plea against further government subsidies to support the EC's state-owned flag carriers. The UK is particularly concerned that the EC does not backtrack on its air transport liberalisation policy because of the current difficulties faced by the airline industry. However, a number of other EC countries, led by France, consider the UK position as 'hypocritical. Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman of Air France, argued that UK carriers were the 'most protected' in the world through the existing bilateral aviation agreement between the UK and the US. 'Apostles of British liberalism carefully close the doors to London Heathrow and continue to reap the easy profits of the Anglo-American air traffic agreement, Bermuda 2, signed in 1977,' he said. The agreement was tantamount to a state subsidy, he claimed. The meeting of aviation ministers also coincides with a series of hearings held this month by an EC group of 'wise men' set up to analyse and propose cures for the European airline industry which lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 466m) last year. Several EC countries and their national carriers have argued for the re-introduction of some capacity controls scrapped under the EC airline liberalisation package in the face of continuing over capacity in the airline market. At the same time, a number of state carriers, including Aer Lingus, Air France, Sabena and Iberia, have been seeking additional cash injections from their governments to support them during the current, prolonged industry recession. But the UK government and UK airlines argue that additional government financial support would simply distort even more competition in the market and that troubled airlines must launch restructuring programmes to make themselves more efficient by sharply reducing their heavy level of unit costs.

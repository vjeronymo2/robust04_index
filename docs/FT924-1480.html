			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Palestinians brace for Israeli reprisals PALESTINIANS in the occupied territories were last night braced for tough reprisals by the Israeli government for the kidnap and killing of a paramilitary border police officer by Islamic fundamentalists. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, chaired a cabinet meeting yesterday which discussed what ministers described as a list of options for retaliation for the killing of Sgt-Major Nissim Toledano by guerrillas of the Hamas Islamic movement on Tuesday. Mr Rabin said the world should expect harsh action by Israel. Palestinians feared that Mr Rabin, who has pledged a merciless response to the kidnapping, would resort to mass deportations of some of the 1,200 Hamas leaders and sympathisers rounded up in the West Bank and Gaza Strip following Sgt-Major Toledano's kidnapping on Sunday. Such a move was called for by a range of Israeli politicians yesterday, despite strong international condemnation of previous deportations. The Israeli government yesterday agreed to bail out the financially stricken Israel Military Industries in an attempt to keep afloat one of the mainstays of the country's big state-owned defence industry, which has been hard hit by falling world demand for military products.</p>

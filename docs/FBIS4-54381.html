			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By YONHAP from Washington] </F>   [Text] The United States and North Korea held a  working-level contact in New York this morning, Korean time, and  discussed a date for the third round of talks.    During the contact held upon the request of North Korea,  North Korea is likely to respond to a U.S. proposal on holding  the third round of talks in Geneva next month.    A source in Washington said that even though North Korea's  response is not known yet, chances are high that the third round  of U.S.-North Korea talks will be held in Geneva early next  month. In the event the current New York contact proceeds  smoothly, it is likely that a date for the third round of  U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be officially announced,  the source added.    In the contact, (Seymour), deputy chief of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Bureau of the U.S. State Department, and  Quinones, the State Department's North Korea desk officer,  participated as representatives of the U.S. side while Han  Song-yol, counselor of the North Korean mission to the United  Nations, represented the North side.</p>

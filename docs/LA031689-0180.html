			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUROR OVER FRUIT FROM CHILE;  </P> <P> PRICES;  </P> <P> STABILITY NOW -- BUT WHOLESALERS ARE WORRIED  </P> <P> Supermarket fruit prices remained relatively stable Wednesday despite the  controversies surrounding the safety of fresh fruit, but on the wholesale  market there were ominous signs of change because of altered supply and demand.  Prices of fresh Central American bananas and California-Arizona oranges were  sharply higher in wholesale markets on Wednesday while apple prices slumped.  </P> <P> The Federal-State Market News Service in Los Angeles reported that a 40-pound  carton of bananas from Central America fetched more than $13, compared to  $11-$12 a week earlier. Navel oranges from California and Arizona sold for an  average price of $9.50 to $10 per 38-pound box, up from $8.50.  </P> <P> Bananas and navel oranges have commanded relatively strong prices so far this  season, said Terry Long of the price-monitoring service. But the voluntary  recall of Chilean grapes and other fruits that offer June-in-January shopping  for North American consumers can only push the prices of remaining available  fresh fruits higher.  </P> <P> Steven Koff, president of the Southern California Grocers Assn., said little  change has shown up in retail prices of either fresh produce or canned fruits,  but added: "As Day 3 goes by we're getting a little anxious about how long it  will be before the government starts to release fruit that's already been  cleared."  </P> <P> Even assuming that Chilean fruit returns to supermarket produce departments,  however, "there's the question of consumer confidence, too," Koff said. "That's  going to have to be restored."  </P> <P> According to the marketing news service, which is jointly run by the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and  Agriculture, apple prices are showing the effects of reduced demand. Scores of  school districts -- including Los Angeles Unified and others in New York,  Chicago and San Francisco -- have removed the fruit and apple products from  lunch menus. School officials are concerned that children might be harmed by  residues of a chemical, daminozide, which was used on about 5% of the nation's  apple crop to slow ripening and improve crispness and color.  </P> <P> Extra fancy Washington State Red Delicious apples apparently felt the effect of  those bans: Crates that sold for up to $20 on March 7 fell to $18-$20 this week  "with a few as low as $14 to $16," Long reported. "Business definitely is  slower on apples."  </P> <P> Between Chile's fruit holdup and the schools' apple bans, organic produce  markets across California reported dramatic increases in produce sales. In  Southern California, the six outlets of Sherman Oaks-based Mrs. Gooch's Natural  Food Stores reported record sales. And Ted McCaskey, manager of Erewhon Natural  Foods in Los Angeles, estimated a 5% increase in customers.  </P> <P> "We absolutely have more people coming in," said Jimmy Ilson, a produce worker  with Real Food Co., a chain of six markets in San Francisco and Marin County.  "A lot of more mainstream people are coming in -- people who would be shopping  at Safeway."  </P> <P> The Good Nature Grocery store in Walnut Creek, a 20-year-old natural foods  store, reported that vegetable sales have jumped by more than 30% while sales  of organic juices increased sixfold.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, more apples are on the way -- from Chile.  </P> <P> The refrigerated freighter Creole unloaded the first dribble of apples -- 960  boxes -- in Los Angeles on Wednesday, but the Canadian Reefer is expected to  unload 20,000 more cases, along with other Chilean fruits, in Long Beach today.  On the East Coast, Philadelphia awaits the Choapa Reefer with 31,000 cases of  Granny Smiths and the Jambu with 23,000; the Bongo Reefer is due to call at  Tampa, Fla., with another 14,000 cases.  </P> <P> As the imported fruit begins to pile up in warehouses, liability for any lost  sales sharply increases, observed Curtis W. Keyes, president of Marine  Management Insurance Brokers in Newport Beach. Keyes' 6-year-old company  specializes in what he called "cargo-rejection" insurance.  </P> <P> "Usually the last fellow who paid the bill winds up with the liability of the  loss," Keyes said. "And it depends upon the purchasing power of the customer on  what sort of adjustment might be made against future purchases."  </P> <P> But, he added, few fruit importers carry protection against cargo-rejection by  regulatory action -- coverage that is more common in the higher-risk seafood  industry.  </P> <P> "They might have coverage for, say, an infestation, picking up the fumigation  costs," Keyes said. "But ultimately, the liability will probably be passed down  the line, perhaps to the suppliers.  </P> <P> "Or, if the condition is found to be so localized that a good deal of this  fruit can be released, those in the distribution chain will perhaps agree to  some kind of sharing of the costs," he suggested.  </P></p>

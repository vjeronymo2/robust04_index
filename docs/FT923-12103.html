			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / EC seeks to expel Serbs from UN THE European Community decided yesterday to push for the expulsion of the rump Yugoslavia from the United Nations and all other world bodies after renewed fighting forced the suspension of relief flights to Sarajevo. EC foreign ministers also appealed to the warring parties in Bosnia to comply at once with the July 17 ceasefire negotiated by Lord Carrington, whose EC peace conference, they suggested, should be broadened to involve the UN and neighbouring countries. But, as the fighting worsened again in Bosnia, EC ministers were clearly unable to bring much new pressure to bear on Serbia as the chief malefactor in the Balkan civil war. 'The news from Sarajevo, and the rest of Bosnia, is bad,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary of the UK which holds the EC presidency. 'However, we cannot allow disappointment to deter us, or to make us give up,' he added. The joint Serb-Montenegrin state could not be allowed to sit as 'Yugoslavia' in the UN or other world bodies, Mr Hurd said. In a statement, EC ministers said they would make 'early arrangements' to exert pressure in the UN to shut Serbia out. The EC's legal view has long been that Serbia and Montenegro should be denied the status of sole successor to the old Yugoslavia. But Mr Hurd said yesterday it was the first time this view had been formally endorsed by ministers. Some ministers, notably Mr Klaus Kinkel of Germany, would have preferred a more forthright statement that Serbia should be expelled from the UN. By contrast, Mr Hurd said that Serb-Montenegrin federation would be free to join the UN like any other new entity, though he made clear this would be unlikely under present circumstances. EC ministers pledged themselves ready to cut through Community red tape to speed the delivery of Ecu120m (Pounds 85m) worth of promised humanitarian aid. They also promised, in the light of the July 29 UN conference on refugees, to 'consider urgently an equitable solution to the problems caused by the potential inflow of refugees into neighbouring countries'. But they failed to endorse specifically a request by Mr Kinkel, who said his country had already taken in 100,000 refugees from Yugoslavia, to establish a quota system to share the refugee in-take among all EC states. Canadian General Lewis Mackenzie, the commander of UN forces in Sarajevo, said yesterday that aid flights would only be resumed when the airport was made safe. The UN had hoped to bring in 22 flights, carrying food and medical supplies to the 380,000 people trapped in Sarajevo. At least five people were reported killed and 14 wounded in a grenade attack on the city centre yesterday. There was also heavy fighting in the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde.</p>

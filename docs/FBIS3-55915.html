			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Interfax Baltic News Service reports that Justas  Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy adviser,  told an INTERFAX correspondent that the decisions made by the  NATO summit in Brussels on cooperation of this organization with  Central and East European countries met the expectations of  realistically thinking politicians.    According to him, following the approval in Brussels of the  Partnership for Peace NATO program, the rapprochement of  Lithuania with this organization would depend on the opening  possibilities: political stability, the economic potential of  Lithuania, the ability to organize and improve military  structures according to European standards, and the ability to  cooperate both with NATO and other Baltic states.    Justas Paleckis thinks that a strong incentive to start  implementing the Partnership for Peace NATO program will be the  visit to Brussels by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas,  due to take place on 27 January.    According to the president's adviser, the main objective of  the visit to Brussels will be to convince NATO leadership that  Lithuania's commitment to rapprochement with NATO is not  directed against Russia or other neighboring states.</p>

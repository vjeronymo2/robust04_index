			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets focus on dollar under pressure - Currency Markets Foreign exchange markets will continue to focus attention on the dollar, which was under severe pressure last week as US Treasuries fell and the outlook for recovery in Europe improved. In the absence of concerted central bank intervention after the dollar plunged below significant technical lows against the D-Mark last Friday, analysts expect the markets to push down the US currency in an effort to test the resolve of central banks to take action. Traders will be watching for changes in the US and European bond markets for clues on how currencies will perform. Some observers say bearish sentiment will dominate global bond markets with inflationary concerns causing jitters in US Treasuries and worries about excessively strong growth in Germany hitting the bund market. In recent weeks the dollar has been linked to US Treasuries. Although the US currency showed an upward trend last Friday as falling commodity prices gave US bonds a lift, the Fed has not eased inflationary concerns and Treasuries are likely to remain vulnerable next week, bringing the dollar down with them. In Europe, where the link between currencies and bond markets is reversed, the D-Mark and the Swiss franc are likely to benefit from the fall in European bonds. Without any key statistics to guide the market this week, foreign exchange traders will look to the release of the Fed's tan book on Wednesday, which helps it evaluate the US economy in advance of the July 5-6 FOMC meeting. Although figures which emerged from the US last week suggested a moderation in the pace of expansion, officials are still worried about inflation and analysts expect the tan book will do nothing to dampen expectations of further tightening by the Fed during the summer months. The markets will also be watching Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony before the House Budget Committee next Wednesday. Mr Greenspan will be discussing inflation and interest rates, giving currency traders an indication of US monetary policy. In Germany, analysts are expecting data next week to show further strong growth in the M3 money supply measure for the month of May. M3 growth rates have this year far exceeded the target range of 4 to 6 per cent. Increasing optimism about German recovery have caused expectations of a German interest rate cut to recede, giving strength to the D-Mark. Sterling may have trouble rising above Dollars 1.52 as markets have been reluctant to buy the pound above that level. This trend is also keeping sterling down against the D-Mark.</p>

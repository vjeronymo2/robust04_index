Allowable Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant funds awarded under this demonstration may be used to provide basic readjustment and retraining services. These services are described in JTPA Section 314(c) and Section 314(d). Skills training to eligible workers to qualify for new jobs with their current employer or for new jobs in the health care system is an allowable activity under these grants. Employers must agree to hire workers who successfully compete training under this project into new or different positions, and the old positions must be eliminated. Training to upgrade the skills of incumbent workers to maintain their current jobs, or training for workers whose jobs are not scheduled for elimination is not authorized under current legislation or under these grants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part IV. Evaluation Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prospective offerors are advised that the selection of grantee(s) for award is to be made after careful evaluation of proposals by a panel of specialists selected by DOL. Panelists will evaluate the proposals for acceptability based on the various factors enumerated below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluations will be made on the basis of both what the proposed offeror intends to do during the grant period, and on the usefulness of the demonstration after the end of the grant period. Special consideration will be given to applicants who demonstrate coordination efforts between employer(s) and workers, such as a labor-management committee to oversee the implementation of the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department relies on applicants for grants to comply with all Federal and State laws in setting up their programs. For example, we expect that grantees shall comply with requirements for licensing and that they shall obtain necessary union concurrence when working within a labor agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

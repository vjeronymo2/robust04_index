			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pru-Bache Says It Expects Big Loss: Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. will lose  $250 million this year as it gets out of several costly businesses, according  to its parent company.  </P> <P> Analysts said the loss was bigger than expected. Perrin Long, a brokerage  analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities, noted that part of the loss was  because of a restructuring charge, which Prudential did not specify. He said  the brokerage had lost $250 million in two problem areas: merchant banking and  risk arbitrage. Any other profits were wiped out by the restructuring charge,  he said.  </P></p>

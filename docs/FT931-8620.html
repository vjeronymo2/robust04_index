			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Bellway issues Pounds 33.6m cash call BELLWAY yesterday became the first UK housebuilder to take advantage of the recent revival in house sales to announce a rights issue. It is seeking to raise Pounds 33.6m from a two-for-seven issue at 320p. Bellway's share price fell 2p to 394p on the news. The last round of cash calls by housebuilders was in 1991, when many companies took advantage of a short-lived improvement in house sales to strengthen their balance sheets. Mr Amarjit Chhina, construction analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said yesterday that further rights issues for builders were likely. 'Some companies still need desperately to reduce debt and bolster balance sheets. Others, like Bellway, will seek opportunistically to exploit the recent rise in construction share prices on the back of a perceived revival in the housing market,' he said. Bellway, which raised Pounds 25m in a five-for-eleven issue at 220p in March 1991, said yesterday that it needed the money to expand output from an expected 2,200 homes during the 12 months to the end of July, to 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s, which would make it one of the six largest housebuilders in the country. Bellway said that the number of house sales agreed by the company had risen by 50 per cent since the beginning of this year, compared with the corresponding period in 1992. It forecast that pre-tax profit in the year to the end of July would be not less than Pounds 16m, compared with Pounds 13.02m in 1991-92. Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said total dividends should be at least maintained, on the increased share capital, at last year's level of 11.5p. He said the group had net cash of about Pounds 15m on shareholders' funds of approaching Pounds 100m. He expected gearing to reach 10 per cent by 1994 as the group expanded. Cash raised in the 1991 rights issue had been used to expand the group's regional operations and increase its land holdings from 5,500 plots with planning permission to 7,000, said Mr Robson. The number of homes built by the group has risen from 1,500 in 1990-91 to 1,841 last year and 2,200 in the current year. Bellway said that its latest issue has been fully underwritten by Charterhouse Bank. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Military Industrialization Organization [MIO] teams  in "17 April Factory" have succeeded in producing industrial  equipment to help beat the unjust blockade on our people.    The teams produced two electric boilers with capacities of  100 and 80 liters. The boilers are useful in the production of  silica glue, which requires heating for higher concentration.  Silica glue is used in basic materials that go into the  production of ceramic moulds and also in textile and paper  industries.    The teams have also produced a mill for grinding (malachite)  which is used in production of ceramic moulds, refractory  cement, furnaces, and heat-resistant moulds. The designed  production capacity of the mill is 480 kg during a 24-hour  operational period.    MIO teams in "17 April Factory" have succeeded for the first  time in producing induction coil for melting and casting  furnaces. This equipment, which is essential in induction  furnaces to transform electric power into thermal power, is used  in melting such metals as brass and aluminum. The induction  coil used to be imported with hard currencies from abroad.</p>

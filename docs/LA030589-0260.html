			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION SAVINGS  </P> <P> At the last Huntington Beach Union High School District board meeting, agenda  item 6B went by without a vote or even a mention from the board members. Item  6B, consolidating the elections, would save the district up to $50,000 every 2  years. Yet our elected officials saw right through that. They knew this was a  bad plan for saving some of the pending budget cuts.  </P> <P> Consolidating the elections was called a partisan move. People were afraid of  teachers going on strike. They claimed that voters would be uninformed. After  all is said and done, I guess they're right, because informed voters would have  never elected such narrow-minded individuals. Except maybe at a private  election with a sad 9.2% turnout.  </P> <P> BOB HOXSIE  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

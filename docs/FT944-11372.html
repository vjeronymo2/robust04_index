			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Lib Dems to be cast as party of business Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, will use a keynote speech to the Confederation of British Industry tomorrow to urge business leaders to reassess their traditional support for the Tories. In an attempt to set out common ground between the Liberal Democrats and the business community Mr Ashdown will warn industrialists of the dangers to business from pressure on the government by its nationalistic right wing. He will stress the Liberal Democrats' commitments to free markets and European integration, and challenge industrialists to use their influence with ministers to counter rightwing hostility to the European Union. The speech is intended to cast the Liberal Democrats as an alternative party of business. Mr Ashdown is to mix attacks on the Tories' economic record with praise for their deregulation of the labour market and industry. He will urge industrialists to follow the lead set by the Trades Union Congress, which has opted for links with the Tories and the Liberal Democrats as well as Labour. Observer, Page 19</p>

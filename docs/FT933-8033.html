			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Campaign to fell pulp producer  -Lobbyists are urging the City not to invest in Barito Pacific The City of London had its first taste of co-ordinated environmental lobbying last week when 275 fund managers received a letter urging them not to invest in an Indonesian wood products company, Barito Pacific. Barito is planning a Dollars 250m (Pounds 179m) flotation on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. 'I've been in the business over 10 years and this is the first time I've been confronted with a situation like this. It's difficult to know how to react,' says Simon Fraser, investment director at Fidelity Investment Services. The flotation, announced in early July, ran into trouble two weeks later when Salomon Brothers withdrew as lead underwriter. Salomon's decision was believed to be based on its concern about a lack of management information which it is obliged to supply to the US regulatory authorities. Environmentalists and human rights groups want to stop the proposed expansion of Barito, one of the world's largest makers of plywood, pulp and paper. Funds from the flotation will be used to increase the company's pulp production and expand the area planted with industrial forests. 'The expansion is not in the interests of the environment, large numbers of local and indigenous people whose lands have been logged by the company without consent, or, in the longer term, the process of sustainable development of the Indonesian economy,' says the briefing document produced by the environmental campaigners. The covering letter is signed by 13 groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Japan Tropical Forest Action Network. Barito and its financial advisers presented its flotation proposal at a meeting in the Savoy Hotel last month. Over 200 fund managers attended and they, plus other potential City investors were subsequently sent the campaigners' alternative analysis of Barito. The campaigners make specific allegations about Barito's logging, financial, social and political activities. Simon Counsell, a forests campaigner at Friends of the Earth, says legal restrictions prevented the groups from printing stronger claims. One leading fund manager - who did not want to be named - was impressed with the environmental arguments and said he believed most of the allegations. He would not be subscribing. 'If there is an environmental cloud hanging over this issue then I think it will sink it. This campaign could be quite effective.' Michael Hanson-Lawson, managing director of Crosby Securities UK, the flotation's international co-ordinator, said the project was environmentally sound and he would not be swayed by the campaigners' arguments. He was, however, impressed with the efficiency of the campaign. 'They targeted the fund managers very well - this could be an inside job.' Environmental issues were significant in the flotation. He was sure that his clients would read the document and take the arguments into account. But he considered the environmental campaign to be nothing more than a 'minor irritant'. James Robinson of Henderson Administration found the campaigners' document too emotive. 'They would do their cause more good if the language was less emotive. They use phrases like 'unacceptable political connections'. Unacceptable to whom?' He said this was one of the first times he had been approached by a group of environmental campaigners. In future he would pay more attention to similar approaches if their arguments were presented in a better way. Henderson would not subscribe to the Barito issue because there was insufficient international backing. 'We have not been swayed by the environmental arguments,' he said. Counsell said campaigners would continue to target fund managers and would attempt to use the City as a lever in bringing about change. He admitted the campaigners had much to learn in dealing with the City. 'In the past we have, for example, successfully persuaded investors away from Fisons over their policy on peat extraction. We are relative novices in the use of City language, but we intend to improve,' he said.</p>

Results are submitted of solving problems of  control of combat operations of the system of guiding  antimissile missiles [AMM] toward targets and evaluation of  firing effectiveness are discussed. There is a brief description  of the qualities of solutions, which were obtained from the  results of full-scale tests.    Introduction. Problems of control and  effectiveness of PRO systems were further developed in  connection with establishment of the PRO system in Moscow. It  conformed to the increased requirements of the system due to  refinement of an enemy's attack equipment. Development of this  system and of its experimental firing range prototype (Aldan  system) was ordered by decree of the USSR government in 1960,  and subsequent updating of the system was done in accordance  with decrees adopted in 1963, 1971 and 1975. By that time, the  team of developers of of the PRO system left the KB-1 [design  office] and formed the Vympel experimental design office  enterprise, subsequently renamed the Research Institute of  Radio-Instrument Building. The system was developed with the  same cooperation as system A, under the supervision of general  designer G. V. Kisunko, corresponding member of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, and at the updating stage, under the  supervision of chief designer I. D. Omelchenko.    The chief complex of the system (incomplete complement of  firing complexes) with the A-350Zh AMM was approved for  experimental operation on the basis of the results of testing  the first stage, and the updated system A-35M with A-350R AMM  was received to arm the Soviet Army on the basis of the results  of the second stage.    1. Composition and structure of system. At the  first designing stage, the system was built on the same  principles as experimental system A. A range finder method was  used to determine the coordinates of ballistic targets and AMM,  that provided remote-controlled high guidance precision. In this  regard, it was planned to use a relatively low-power nuclear  warhead to destruct target heads. The purpose of the system was  to intercept ballistic missiles equipped with solid heads  (paired targets).    As established in the course of designing them, the  feasibility of enhancing appreciably the destructive action of  nuclear warheads, virtually without increasing their weight and  dimensions and, consequently, without changing the appearance  and characteristics of the designed A-350Zh AMM, made it  possible to turn to a simple single-station method of  determining target and AMM coordinates at the second stage of  designing. This increased appreciably the channel features of  the system with the same amount of information equipment, while  the diminished guidance precision was compensated by the  destructive action of the more powerful nuclear warhead.    The new PRO equipment that was developed and built conformed  to the increased requirements of the zone of target interception  according to its top and distant boundaries and higher  characteristics of ballistic targets. The system included the  following: main computer command center of the system consisting  of the main command post and 5E92-B computer complex; radar  center of early warning stations, Dunay-3; eight firing  complexes each part of the command post of the complex, one  radar for the target, two for AMM radar, two firing positions  with ground-based launchers; A-350Zh AMM; system for  transmitting data.    The developed system was subsequently updated and improved.    At the first stage of modernization, conditions for  organizing interception of several ballistic missiles attaacking  a defended object simultaneously by the AMM detail were  substantially improved.    Development of strategic offense capabilities (development  of  separating warheads and equipment to overcome PRO) put a new  task to PRO: to assure interception of complex ballistic  targets. As a result, in 1975-1977 an updated system was  developed aimed at assuring destruction of single complex  ballistic targets, which consisted of a solid or separating  warhead, and means of overcoming PRO. The task was accomplished  mainly by combining with algorithms the channels for measuring  target coordinates into a single information system and  developing a new algorithm for centralized control of combat  operations. Concurrently, there was expansion of the range of  early warning by adding to the system two new radar stations for  early warning of targets.    Subsequent refinement of the A-35M system was aimed at  providing for interception of ballistic missiles attacking  Moscow, in the broader sector of responsibility with use of  radar plots from the SPRN [missile attack warning system], as  well as interception of targets of the Pershing-2 type.    2. Control of system A-35 combat operations. A new  technical problem that developers encountered was the problem of  organizing the system's combat operations in the course of using  AMM with special firing equipment to strike at several ballistic  missiles in the case of a dense raid by a group of them. The  consequences of a nuclear explosion could blind the radar  resources on the one hand and, mutual destruction of AMM, on the  other. The question arose of organizing ballistic missile  strikes in such a way as to minimize the negative effect of  nuclear explosions on operation of the system's equipment. This  task was resolved by an algorithm for target distribution, as  part of the general combat algorithm for centralized system  control, which consisted of a set of problems of organizing  combat operations of equipment and the system as a whole, aimed  at achieving the highest effectiveness.    The main purpose of the algorithm for organization of combat  operations was to assign firing channels for the targets with  provisions of conditions for intercepting them, under which the  probability of destructing each target earmarked for  interception would be close to maximum. Provisions for organized  interception of targets by means of orderly assignment of points  of impact of AMM and targets also took into consideration the  time of possible ``blinding'' of radar equipment.    An original method of interception was developed to organize  interception of ``compact'' groups of ballistic missiles, which  rendered the final stage of interception independent of  ground-based equipment and thus more resistant to external  interference from the nuclear explosion.    The task of organizing combat operations of the system,  which  is related to the need to search through a large number of  combinations, was formalized as a mathematical programming  problem, and it was solved in the system using the ``Hungarian  method,'' so that it could conform to the available performance  of computer resources of the main computer control center.    3. Anti-missile missile guidance system. The main  requirement of the guidance system was precision, which was  determined as a result of predesign integration of the obtained  precision of radar measurement of target and AMM coordinates  with dimensions of the strike region of nuclear warheads with  the required high firing effectiveness. The other requirements  of the guidance system were governed by the chief goal, and  aimed at having it function normally in real combat use of  firing complexes. The most important of these, which were new as  compared to requirements imposed on system A, were: need to use  AMM in the guidance system that had considerably greater strike  distances and altitudes than the V-1000, including ranges beyond  the atmosphere; the need for simultaneous guidance of a large  number of AMM toward the firing units of complex ballistic  targets with the time of impact with targets preset in the  course of preparation of the firing cycle; feasibility of  re-aiming the AMM while in flight.    The use of long-range AMM was motivated by the desire to  move  firing positions beyond the limits of a defended object of great  length, and use of high strike altitudes is needed for the  safety of the defended object against the harmful factors of  explosions of the firing unit nuclear warheads of targets and  our own AMM. A preset time of impact between the AMM and targets  of a given raid is needed because of the above-mentioned method  of intercepting compact ballistic missile groups, and it is  required to assure stable interception. Feasibility of re-aiming  the AMM in flight is necessary due to the dynamics of  identifying firing units of ballistic missiles in the presence  of false targets.    These requirements put basically new scientific-engineering  tasks to the guidance system, which had no analogs in previously  developed systems for control of different classes of  interceptors -- use in the guidance system of the principle of  jet control of AMM and development of a means of controlling its  longitudinal movement.    Use of firing equipment in this system that was considerably  more effective than in system A made it possible to obtain  contact of AMM with targets on a head-on or intersecting course  and thereby have a rather large interception zone. Under such  conditions, it became desirable to guide the AMM toward a  predicted point of impact, calculated on the basis of predicted  trajectories of the target and AMM. It first became possible to  apply this method because of existence of a control computer in  the ground-based part of the guidance system. A ballistic  trajectory, being energetically the most advantageous, was  chosen as the kinematic AMM trajectory traversing the predicted  point of impact.    Processing of current data about the target and AMM was  carried out on the basis of Kalman's filtration theory.  Forecasting the trajectory of a ballistic target was made as it  was in system A. To estimate parameters of AMM motion a new  method was developed, which is based on including in the  guidance algorithm of a model of controlled AMM motion that  responds to the same control commands as an actual AMM. The  information obtained with the model about the regular (expected)  motion of AMM, in particular about the vector of its  acceleration, was taken into consideration along with  information about its true (observed) motion. This permitted  data processing with a lower-order filter and thereby reducing  the filtration error component due to fluctuations of the signal  at the filter input.    The wide range of parameters of target trajectories as  related to the AMM launch point, with the long range of its  flight and the chosen guidance method increased appreciably the  range of AMM approach aspects to the target, as compared to the  range of system A. Under such conditions, in developing  principles for AMM control, it became desirable to reject the  use of a fixed plane of AMM roll stabilization, as well as  control on the principle of plane turns. Instead, a new  three-command method of AMM control was developed, that  permitted orientation of the vector of control acceleration in  any direction, i.e., a complete sphere. Joint work with the  staff of the KB-1 SKB-36 [special design office] (now called the  Almaz Central Design Office) resulted in development of  principles for forming the AMM stabilization circuit and choice  of autopilot structure and parameters consistent with this  method of control. Since this control method was based on  controlling the AMM in relation to three (rather than two, as it  was in conventional GAAM [guided antiaircraft missiles] linked  axes, a master gyroscope was chosen as the main sensitive unit  in the AMM. The angles measured by this gyroscope were used at  the first autonomous stage of flight and during flight of the  second stage AMM in rarefied layers of the atmosphere in order  to monitor responses to control commands. In addition, these  data from the master gyroscope were used throughout the flight  of the AMM to control its angle of roll. Linear acceleration  sensors were used as sensitive elements to control response to  AMM control commands during flight in dense layers of the  atmosphere. To reduce AMM oscillation about the center of  gravity, feedback was used, as it is ordinarily, in the circuit  for AMM stabilization upon signals of damping gyroscopes. An  algorithm for generation of control commands programmed into the  computer of the main computer control center, which conformed to  the three-command control method and chosen autopilot system,  was obtained on the basis of methods developed in optimum  control theory and refined on technological and complex  mathematical models.    In order to execute the concept of interception adopted and  described above, it was necessary to solve a problem that was  new for this class of systems: assure arrival of the AMM to the  point of impact with the target within the time set in a given  firing cycle, which led to development of a special circuit to  regulate thrust of the second stage AMM engine. Since thrust at  the boost and throttling stages could not be changed by design  in the A-350Zh AMM, it was the moments of change from these  engine modes that were regulated. The method and corresponding  algorithm to control longitudinal AMM movement were based on  juxtaposition of the estimated predicted path that could be  traveled by an AMM with this profile of engine thrust in the  time remaining before impact, to the nominal path which is the  distance between the AMM and estimated point of impact with the  target. In the event of discrepancy between these parameters,  the previously estimated times of switching engine running modes  were corrected in the required direction. The choice of  parameters of this algorithm, which was programmed in the  computer of the main computer control center, was made  analytically with subsequent refinement on a mathemtical model  of the system of AMM guidance. Altogether, the different  algorithms, the principles of design of which have been  discussed above, were mutually integrated with the special  control algorithm and made up the general combat algorithm for  AMM control, which is one of the most important and large parts  of the general combat algorithm of the system.    There was further development of ideas and principles, which  had been advanced and applied in developing the guidance system  for V-1000 AMM in system A, in the course of refinement and  testing of the guidance system (as the aggregate of information  resources, general combat algorithm of AMM control programmed in  the computer of the main computer control center, and the  anti-missile missile that carried radio equipment and an  autopilot). The chief one was the use of a real-time  mathematical model, which was executed on standard computers in  the system of the main computer control center, as the principal  tool for refining the guidance system. A set of software of  system equipment simulators and characteristics of the ballistic  target were used on one of the computers and the programmed  algorithm for AMM control on another, in the standard execution.  At a certain stage of system refinement, registration documents  were prepared for the equipment simulators on the basis of  results of full-scale testing of this equipment. Development of  this model made it possible to use the experimental-theoretical  method extensively in assessing the characteristics obtained in  the AMM guidance system.    Full-scale testing of the guidance system with AMM launches  was carried out on the Aldan system firing range complex  organized in the same place as the system A experimental  complex. It was carried out in two stages: up to 1971 with the  A-350Zh AMM, and after 1971 with the A-350Zh and  A350R[.sup]2[/]. The methodology of full-scale guidance  system tests was essentially the same as in testing guidance  systems of the V-1000 AMM: testing conditions were increasingly  complicated in stages: from launches of AMM in an open circuit  by stepped control commands to launches of AMM in a closed  circuit with real ballistic targets. At the final stage of  system testing in 1976-1977, there were 7 AMM launches (2 of  which were A-350R) with reference targets of the 8K63 and 8K65  types, including some with false targets, as well as 3 A-350Zh  AMM launches with real type 8K63 ballistic targets.    The results of trials of the A-35 system revealed that the  AMM guidance system met the imposed requirements and specified  operating conditions.    4. Firing equipment of AMM, control of its use,  assessment of AMM firing effectiveness. All three problems  mentioned in this heading were solved of necessity concurrently  and in close relationship to problems of control of AMM and the  system as a whole. However, in the course of development, it was  necessary to solve some problems in the first approximation,  rather than in full, with consideration of their link, as is the  case when developing real systems that are complex. For the sake  of convenience, we shall first discuss these problems separately  in this article.    The choice of type of firing equipment to arm AMM in the  A-35  system was determined by the results of firing in the A system,  which revealed that firing had relatively low effectiveness and  the effects of fragmentation striking elements on the warheads  of the AMM were ambiguous. To defend Moscow it was necessary to  obtain warhead damage that would virtually preclude the standard  action of a nuclear charge in the warhead, as well as premature  action of the nuclear charge caused by AMM firing equipment over  the entire zone of its use. The latter was needed to minimize  the effects of nuclear explosions on system elements and the  environment. Thus, even with the guidance precision that could  be achieved by the three-range method, it was necessary to use a  nuclear warhead on the AMM. This became doubly necessary with  the change from the three-range method to the usual one for  measurement of coordinates with radar (two angles and range).  Use of nuclear warheads was also desirable because the  effectiveness of modern nuclear warheads depends substantially  less on their weight than does the effectiveness of  fragmentation warheads, so that it was possible, as noted in  Section 1, to leave the AMM payload virtually unchanged with  change in precision of its guidance and detonation. Plans were  made for full-scale experiments and for several years they were  carried out, enabling us to obtain rather reliable data on  effects of nuclear explosions on the AMM warheads, AMM and its  instruments, on ground-based PRO equipment, on the environment,  including space and the top layers of the atmosphere. It was  found necessary to take these physical phenomena into  consideration in designing equipment and the PRO system as a  whole, and in a number of instances substantial additional work  was required (see sections 1-3).    Of course, substantially new approaches were also needed to  the choice of judicious characteristics for the firing  equipment, methods of controlling it and assessment of firing  effectiveness. The first steps were developed of a new  methodology for optimization of AMM firing equipment, which  differed considerably from approaches inherent in the choice of  ordinary firing equipment of GAAM. At this stage, in-depth work  was done on different problems, and full synthesis of methods  was achieved only with the design of the second generation PRO  system of Moscow. We should include, among these important  methodological problems, development of methods of assessing  firing effectiveness of AMM with nuclear warheads targeting the  warheads of ballistic missiles. Use was made of data from the  above-mentioned experiments and more detailed studies of the  physics of nuclear explosions on ballistic missile warheads,  with consideration of the complex effect of nuclear explosions  on warheads and design features of nuclear warheads, AMM and  warheads, which required close interaction among developers of  the different items and theoretical physicists. The results of  their work were formalized in relevant manuals and  methodological publications approved by supervisors of the work  in different agencies, including the customer. The results of  the physical studies and their processing made it possible to  obtain ``laws of target strike.'' At that time, coordinate  target strike laws were used, i.e., probability of target strike  as a function of coordinates of point of AMM explosion relative  to the target. These coordinate laws were arbitrary, i.e., they  depended on impact conditions such as altitude of strike, angles  of attack of AMM and warheads. Since the complete probability of  striking the target W was described by a  multidimensional integral, it was impossible to calculate it  under real conditions. Analytical methods were developed to  calculate W for a number of simplified cases;  however, statistical simulation modeling on a computer turned  out to be the most accurate and convenient method. The results  of calculating W were used at the first stage of  designing the system in order to coordinate the characteristics  of the destructive effect of possible variants of nuclear  warheads of AMM with the requirements of precision of guidance  system and AMM detonation. In developing algorithms for  organizing combat operations, the results of more accurate  design estimates of W, calculations of W  were used to select optimum conditions for AMM impact with  targets. Finally, calculations of W were used to  carry out State testing of the system to assess overall  effectiveness on complex system models.    The results of developing methods of calculating W  were generalized in research carried out by several civil and  military institutes under the supervision of one of these  authors.    The method of command control of detonation, which was  proposed and developed for system A, had to be enlarged and  elaborated for system A-35. In the first place, in a combat  system the conditions of AMM and target impact expanded  considerably, and or this reason it was necessary to develop a  universal method of optimum precision to detonate nuclear  warheads of anti-missile missiles. In addition to conditions of  impact in the case of a particular launch, this method also took  into consideration statistical characteristics of processed  coordinates of the target and AMM (different processing  algorithms were used in the channels for AMM guidance and  nuclear warhead detonation), presence of dynamic AMM guidance  errors and some other factors. With this method, determination  was made of optimum detonation time for effective firing. In the  second place, as noted above (see Section 2), for the first time  in design practice and development of interceptor missiles,  engine cutoff was used in the A-350R AMM in order to hold to the  preset time of impact. In the third place, in determining the  time of transmission of the ``main command'' with information  about detonation of a nuclear warhead, consideration was given  to the special importance of this command, and it was relayed by  algorithm in the intervals without noise related to nuclear  explosions of AMM in both the environment and in the AMM BRA  [expansion unknown]. For this purpose, predicted times of impact  of all AMM with targets (i.e., estimated times of nuclear  explosion of AMM) were input in the detonation algorithm of a  given firing complex. Thus, it was necessary to use data on the  level of the entire system for algorithmic protection of the  channel for AMM detonation. All of the described problems tasks  were performed by a combination of the algorithm for detonation  of SBCh [expansion unknown, could be typo for nuclear warhead]  with the algorithm for generating the command to cut off the  power plant of the AMM. The combined programmed algorithm was  checked on the firing complexes of the main computer control  center system. The entire system of detonation of nuclear  warheads and power plant cut-off was tested on the range in  actual launches.    System trials revealed the high effectiveness and  reliability  of command detonation of nuclear warheads under conditions of  actions simulated with algorithms of multiple nuclear explosions  of AMM.    5. Designs for Taran and Avrora PRO systems. These  systems have not been built, so that we shall mention here only  the basic distinctive features in their design. At the first  stage of development of system A-35 (in 1963), the well-known  ballistic missile designer, Academician V. N. Chelomey suggested  that the UR-100 ballistic missile be used for PRO purposes. It  was proposed to launch the UR-100 toward points of impact with  an enemy's ballistic missile far from the defended territory and  to destruct them by nuclear explosions of the warheads of  UR-100, in response to reports from the missile attack warning  system. N. S. Khrushchev liked this idea very much because in  building up the arsenal of ballistic missiles we were also  developing PRO. The inconsistency of this idea was apparent to  specialists in PRO and missile attack warning systems who  participated in its discussion; however, development of the  Taran system, as V. N. Chelomey called it, stopped only after N.  S. Khrushchev's retirement.    At approximately the same time, the design for the  territorial Aurora system was being developed under the  supervision of G. V. Kisunko. The design proposed several  interesting solutions concerning radar (radar stations with  phased array), rockets (A-351 AMM with a wide range of combat  altitudes, A-900 long-range antimissile missile), variable power  nuclear warheads for different combat altitudes, and others.  However, the main flaw of this design was that it did not take  into full consideration all the problems arising at a PRO if an  enemy would use modern equipment to overcome PRO. For this  reason, the commission that reviewed the preliminary design of  the Avrora project did not recommend continued development of  its experimental design.  Footnotes  1. Continuation.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Maryukha report: "Northern Fleet Seamen Write a </F> Letter to `Pan [Ukrainian equivalent of `Mr.'] Admiral.'  Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy's Former Colleagues Would Like To Know  When He Was Honest"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The submariners of the  Northern Fleet relate the illegal actions against Black Sea  Fleet personnel directly to their former colleague, Vice Admiral  Vladimir Bezkorokaynyy, currently commander in chief of the  Ukraine Navy. More than 30 admirals and senior officers of the  unit, which in the past was under Vladimir Gerasimovich's  command, signed an open letter to "Pan Admiral" with the only  aim: to understand when their former colleague was honest with  them and himself. Either on the day the State Committee for the  State of Emergency was formed, when he "solemnly announced  before servicemen in formation the long-awaited eclipse of  democracy," or four days later, when he "swore loyalty to the  new ruling authority." Or maybe when he called: "Let us stand  up for Russia! We shall not allow the union of fraternal  peoples welded by blood to be destroyed." Or when guys in  camouflage uniform committed acts of arbitrariness with respect  to the families of those who only a few months ago "you called  Black Sea Fleet heroes." [passage omitted]</p>

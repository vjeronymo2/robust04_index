Details of the statement from my colleague Nacera  Bouzid:    [Bouzid] The statement by the General Staff of the People's  National Army says that however legitimate the preoccupations of  public opinion on this subject, such calculations are mistaken  and it will once more be impossible for the People's National  Army to fail again in its duty of reiterating, without  ambiguity, the spirit of responsibility with which it is  endowed.    The People's National Army, which is not unaware that these  imaginary differences are intentionally propagated and  circulated by certain sources and circles with the aim of  causing harm, insists on reassuring public opinion and the vital  national forces that the Army will fulfill the obligations  already announced toward the institutions of the state, the  Constitution, the options, and the recommendations sanctioned by  the National Conference.    The Armed Forces' public role, the statement added, is to  remain under the orders of the state authority, which exercises  political power.    As far as speculations, which were the outcome of the  political initiative [dialogue with other forces] were  concerned, the People's National Army, with all its formations,  cannot but reiterate its confidence in the head of state  performing his sensitive task.    Concerning the criminal acts of terrorism and sabotage that  the country and the population have been suffering daily, it is  clear, the statement pointed out, that they are two diseases  that cannot under any circumstances be accepted by the Algerian  state. The People's National Army will, therefore, continue,  together with all other security services, forces, and the  population to fight them regardless of the price in order to  restore security, stability, and tranquillity and to protect a  republican, democratic, pluralist state that guarantees basic  national values, as well as individual and collective rights and  freedoms.</p>

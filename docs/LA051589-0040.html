			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CHOLESTEROL DATA QUESTIONED  </P> <P> A team of Stanford University researchers said last week that evidence  regarding the value of reducing cholesterol is "incomplete," adding that low  cholesterol may actually be associated with a higher death rate in the elderly.  </P> <P> Dr. Benjamin Littenberg, a clinical scholar, and two other doctors said they  reviewed more than 100 published papers about cholesterol screening. They  concluded that the value of such tests is questionable for adults with no  symptoms of heart disease.  </P> <P> Their recommendations, published in the April 15 volume of the Annals of  Internal Medicine, fly in the face of recent campaigns by the National  Institutes of Health and the American Medical Assn. The groups and other  organizations encourage reduction of cholesterol, the fatty deposits that clog  arteries and are generally believed to be linked to heart disease.  </P> <P> Dr. Alan Garber noted that for middle-aged men who have "marked" cholesterol  elevation, "in the top 5 or 10%," treatment with drugs to bring the cholesterol  levels down will reduce the heart attack rate.  </P></p>

Organised by Umm al-Ma'arik research centre at al-Rashid  Hotel, the symposium was attended by a large number of Arab and  foreign writers and media men. More than 30 research papers in  Arabic and foreign languages were discussed during the symposium.    The discussions were mainly focused on three main topics  namely political and economic hegemony, and facts distortion and  lies discrimination by Western media to manipulate the world  public opinion.    Addressing the opening session, head of Umm al-Ma'arik  research centre Dr. Muhammad Mudhaffar al-Adhami said the  symposium aims at exchanging views to reach scientific analyses  and conclusions away from effects of the world super powers.    Chaired by Arab thinker Muta' al-Safadi, the first session  discussed political hegemony.    In his speech, Mr. al-Safadi said the symposium helps bring  together Arab and foreign writers who wrote about Umm al-Ma'arik  battle and who had not the chance to meet before, adding that  the symposium will help expose facts and reveal the real  intentions of the U.S.-led aggression against Iraq.    During the said session a large number of research papers  were discussed, among them were papers on various books written  on the Gulf war. They include Jeff Archer's "The Sledge Hammer  and the Ant;" Muhammad Ahfood's "The Gulf War, a Test for  International Legitimacy;" 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Jawhari's "The Arab  Gulf and the Allies War on Iraq;" Noam Chomsky's "On U.S. Gulf  Policy;" Pierre Salinger and Arabic Loran's "The Secret Dossier  of the Gulf War;" Dr. 'Awad Butrus' "Gulf War, Who Is  Responsible;" and Colin Edwards' "Turning Ploughshares Into  Swords in U.N."    Research papers on Ramsey Clark's book "The Fire this Time"  and Michel Jobert's "Journal Du Golf" were also discussed.    The second session, held on Thursday, was dedicated to  economic hegemony. Speaking at the session, Dr. 'Abd-al-Illah  Beliqzeez (Tunisia) said goals behind the U.S.-led aggression on  Iraq are clear and well known, saying that the United States  aimed at controlling wealth sources.    He added that the U.S. tried to hit Iraq as it represents a  power in the region that threatens its interests.    Dr. Beliqzeez went on to say that the U.S. and its allies  are currently heading towards dismembering the Arab region.    A number of papers on economic hegemony were presented  during  the session. They included among others papers on "The  Palestinian Intifadah and Gulf Convulsion" by Ahmad Sidqi  al-Dajani, "America and the Secrets of the Gulf War From Carter  to Bush" by Dr. Nabil al-Samman, and "America Invades the Gulf"  studies of the American Congress translated by Wajih Radi.    The third session was devoted mainly to the misinformation  and fact distortion and lies disseminated by Western media.    During the session chapters from Michel Collon's book  "Attention Medias" were reviewed and discussed. The book  reveals and exposes America's immoral practices and big lies  disseminated by Bush administration to promote its war policy.  The book also made it clear that prior to the military  aggression against Iraq, Bush administration launched a smear  media campaign to distort Iraq's image.    The researcher from Belgium shed light on the mechanism and  status of the Western media saying that four factors determine  the functioning of the Western media organs, chief among which  is the financial control of the multi-national firms on Western  media and the subordination of the media organs to the said  firms and the authority, noting that media organs were obliged  to beautify the image of the government to maintain good  relations with the said firms and the government which supported  them financially.    The participants on Wednesday visited al-'Amiriyah shelter  which was bombed by specially designed bombs to rip through  shelters. On Thursday, the participants visited a museum that  documents the scale of damage inflicted upon Iraq's  infrastructure by U.S.-led war and outcome of the postwar  nationwide reconstruction drive. In the evening, the  participants listened to lecture delivered by Dr. Muhammad  Mudhaffar al-Adhami on the origin of Kuwait.</p>

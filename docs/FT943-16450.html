			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Competition urged on Enel Privatisation of Italy's Enel state electricity corporation must aim to liberalise the sector if it is to safeguard and promote competition, the country's anti-trust authority said. Mr Francesco Saja, the authority's chairman, has written to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, pressing for radical reorganisation. 'The presence of a company with a massively dominant position in the market could seriously obstruct the entry of new operators and the development of real competition,' said Mr Saja. The anti-trust authority believes Enel should be broken up and its constituent activities then sold. Privatisation represented a unique and unrepeatable opportunity to encourage competition, said Mr Saja. The present public monopoly must not be transformed into a private monopoly, he added. It is widely thought that the privatisation of Enel in its present form may not occur before next spring. Reorganisation along the lines sought by the anti-trust authority would probably put back Italian electricity privatisation by two years.</p>

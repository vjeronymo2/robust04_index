			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, security adviser to the </F> Russian president, by unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given: "We Remain a Great Power"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, the radical  reformer Gaydar has resigned, society is becoming increasingly  polarized, and the West is voicing growing doubts about  Yeltsin's ability to see reforms through. What consequences  does all this have for Russia's stability?    [Baturin] Unfortunately, people such as Gaydar and Finance  Minister Fedorov have become the sole symbols of reform. Their  departure is then promptly interpreted as signifying danger, as  meaning that reforms will be halted.    [DER SPIEGEL] Following this latest government reshuffle,  the West is already preparing itself for a standstill and  hyperinflation....    [Baturin] I know, but, under the new Constitution, only the  president can set the basic directions of domestic and foreign  policy. The government just implements his will. In the second  half of February, when Boris Yeltsin presents his state of the  nation report to parliament, we will see whether he is still  serious about reform.    [DER SPIEGEL] Yeltsin's closest allies are accusing Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin of having already staged an "economic  coup" and are predicting mass uprisings and chaos in the spring.    [Baturin] I do not want to say that we are now on a certain  course regarding economic policy. But I would be against seeing  things in excessively dramatic terms. One has to let the new  government start work before one tell whether it is promising  more than it can accomplish.    [DER SPIEGEL] What advice would you offer the president?    [Baturin] As security adviser, it is my task to predict what  kind of course of developments would spell danger for Russia.  The population was positively disposed toward the reformers  around Gaydar over a long period of time. In April, a majority  voted in favor of their economic policies. However, shock  therapy -- the lifting of controls on prices and the scarcity of  money -- led to great dissatisfaction in the meantime. The  result of the December parliamentary elections was the check.    [DER SPIEGEL] There are about 70,000 unprofitable plants in  Russia, but only eight filed for bankruptcy last year. What is  the shock about?    [Baturin] You may see things that way. For someone who is  fit, it is not hard to jump out of a third story window -- he  will just get up and carry on running. For someone who is not  in shape, jumping off a chair can be fatal. Many plants have  not paid their employees' wages for months now. Relatively few  are well off. On the other hand, there are millions who are  living below the poverty line -- is that not a shock? These are  the very people who determine what happens at the ballot box.    [DER SPIEGEL] So there will be no adjustments to the basic  policy course?    [Baturin] Policy must be adjusted by introducing social  buffers.    [DER SPIEGEL] New presents of loans for bankrupt enterprises  will push up inflation dramatically.    [Baturin] Inflation might go up, but that does not have to  lead to catastrophe right away. The same thing might have  happened with Gaydar and Fedorov, and who knows on what scale.  Besides, if the government departs from the president's policy  course too much, Boris Yeltsin will make adjustments -- I am  certain that he is capable of that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Who actually decides what is good for Russia's  security: the president, who is equipped with totalitarian  powers, the Security Council, or the new parliament?    [Baturin] What do you mean by totalitarian? There is a  clear distinction between the powers of the president and of  parliament. The Security Commission at the federal council level  and the Duma can make proposals and thus shape national security  concepts. Decisions are made by the Security Council. If there  are any doubts, the president has the last word.    [DER SPIEGEL] The president has an enormous apparatus that  shields him.    [Baturin] Yeltsin's administration really is too big, and  that hinders effective work. The team of advisers -- there are  five of us -- is much smaller.    [DER SPIEGEL] In Belarus, the ex-Communists have brought  down the head of parliament and are advocating union with  Moscow. In the Crimea, a Russian nationalist who has been give  the title of president promises union with the old motherland.  Will the old union be re-established?    [Baturin] The Soviet Union collapsed overnight. However,  the economic, cultural, and human ties that existed have not  been broken. It is like an elastic band, it you stretch it too  much, it suddenly contracts. For economic reasons alone, there  had to be a turnaround in the republics. However, there will be  no Soviet Union again.    [DER SPIEGEL] But a new association led by Russia?    [Baturin] Russia is the most powerful republic and is  economically in a better position than the rest, which means  that it acts like a magnet. As the situation in our country  becomes more stable, the former republics will rally round us  all the more.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Russian president in Simferopol wants to  hand over the entire Crimea immediately.    [Baturin] We have to be very careful. Every rash act can  revive political tensions between Russia and Ukraine. That is  something that we should not promote. Of course, every people  has the right to express its will.    [DER SPIEGEL] Recently, Foreign Minister Kozyrev has been  repeatedly calling for understanding to be shown for Russia's  "special role" on the territory of the former USSR. What does  this "special role" entail?    [Baturin] In the former Soviet republics, there are a great  many people who still feel that they are citizens of Russia....    [DER SPIEGEL] The figure that is cited is 25 million....    [Baturin] It's about that. There is no comparable situation  in international relations. To tell these people now that  history has caught them out, that they no longer belong to us,  would be morally unacceptable.    [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, the "special role" is a modest way of  expressing great power politics?    [Baturin] If Russia sees itself as a great power, then it  must take care of the "Russians abroad." The United States  already views Russia as a developing country. That might be  true from the economic angle. However, in the past we were also  never leaders in world markets, but were still considered a  great power. Why was that? Because everyone was afraid of a  country that was full of nuclear weapons and had an enormous  army.    Now the West is afraid that the collapse of the Union will  produce an explosion that will make itself felt in Europe or in  other parts of the world too. So, according to that criterion,  we are still a great power.    [DER SPIEGEL] Those sorts of views have turned the Baltic  states, where you see the Russians as being discriminated  against, against you.    [Baturin] There must a tough reaction to tough action....    [DER SPIEGEL] You mean stopping the withdrawal of your  troops?    [Baturin] A great power cannot duck for cover every time,  that is not the way for a great power to behave.    [DER SPIEGEL] Yeltsin has welcomed the NATO "Partnership for  Peace." Will that kind of cooperation not just boost support  for nationalists such as Zhirinovskiy?    [Baturin] One cannot exclude the possibility that they will  get more wind in their sails as a result. Besides, Yeltsin did  not "welcome" this kind of cooperation with NATO. He expressed  himself in a rather more restrained manner.    [DER SPIEGEL] In the Army, the number of votes cast for  Zhirinovskiy was particularly high. How would you interpret  that warning sign?    [Baturin] It was a protest. If there had been reformers who  could sell themselves as well as Zhirinovskiy, then the result  would have been different.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your tasks include the reform of the state  security service. What is to remain of the old KGB?    [Baturin] In the new Russia, there should be no more  political persecution, no campaigns against those who think  differently, and no ideological uniformity imposed by force. In  reforming the Security Ministry, we have disbanded the  departments that operated in those areas. We are now forming a  civilized counterintelligence service.    [DER SPIEGEL] But the security service generals have doubts  about your competence. Are you not afraid that you will fail in  the same way as Vadim Bakatin, whom Gorbachev charged with  reforming the KGB?    [Baturin] If I was not afraid, then that is precisely what  would happen. I have to be more cautious than Bakatin. The new  office of security adviser marks the beginning of civilian  control over Russia's Army and security structures.    [DER SPIEGEL] Zhirinovskiy talks of a clean bill of health  that was apparently issued to him by the KGB. When will the  Lubjanka archives be finally opened and the files made available  to everyone?    [Baturin] I hope that will happen. It is undoubtedly a very  sensitive issue, one that affects the interests of a great many  people. One must find mechanisms that will enable one to start  on this kind of treatment of history in a relatively painless  manner.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market prospects 'very finely balanced' Gold market prospects look 'very finely balanced', according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, a London-based research company. In an update to its Gold 1994 report, published today, the company says that a good case can be made for suggesting that the metal's price will break out of the recent trading range, 'either on the upside or the downside'. The direction of the break-out will depend, it says, on 'the interplay between wealth creation, inflation, interest rates and finally, perceptions about gold's fundamentals'. In the first half of this year mine production continued to grow at an annualised rate of 2 per cent, taking account of seasonal factors, says the update. But net official sector supply changed dramatically. 'While not actually reversing to a position of net buying, the level of sales (by central banks) dropped to only 36 tonnes (compared with 244 tonnes in the second half of last year and 275 tonnes in the first half). 'Instead of sales,' GFMS explains, 'the activities of official participants have been largely confined to lending and swapping gold.' Meanwhile, forward selling by producers continued to decrease and, 'with the continued repayment of gold loans, this has resulted in producer hedging contributing more than 90 tonnes to the demand side of the equation'. 'The above changes might have been expected to produce a positive impact on sentiment and price,' the update says. But they have been countered by significant disinvestment in Europe and North America as investors, disillusioned with the gold price's reduced volatility, switched their attention to other commodity markets. Successive increases in US interest rates also dampened interest in buying gold. The jewellery sector's demand for gold this year has reflected 'a mix of some very disparate trends', says GFMS: 'the continued improvement in the United States; the sluggishness so far of European demand to respond to improved economic conditions; extremely weak offtake in the Middle East; and, finally, the price-elastic response (relative to the first half of 1993) of jewellery (demand) in the Far East'. The net result has been a moderate first half rise to a level that remains nearly 14 per cent below the first half figure in 1993. GFMS sees scope for sharp upturns in European jewellery sector demand for gold, as consumer confidence improves, and in Middle Eastern demand, as this year's oil price recovery feeds through. 'But it is in the Far East that the most intractable question lies: namely, did this year's recovery in physical offtake represent consumers beginning to adjust to the higher price level, or alternatively, was it an example of pent-up demand following the buyers' strike of the second half of last year?' GFMS suggests that, 'with other things being equal', the former explanation would point to further rises in offtake and the latter to a slowdown. 'But of course, other things will not be equal,' it says. If China's monetary policy is loosened before the economy has cooled sufficiently 'the impact on confidence could easily initiate a new hedge-buying gold rush, similar to what was seen in 1992. 'On the other hand, some of this year's (gold) fabrication in China appears to have gone into increasing retail inventories which may have to be worked off before a real improvement in offtake can take place.' GFMS sees the level of world-wide investment or disinvestment as 'arguably . . . the element in the market which will have the greatest impact in the short term. 'If inflation looks like gaining the upper hand over the efforts of central banks to keep it in check, there could easily be a renewed surge in hedge-buying of gold. 'But again, perceptions about the gold market's fundamentals and interest rates will be crucial in determining investment strategies. A break-out of the price on the upside could galvanise investors and result in a self-fuelling rally, whereas if the price were to show the same lack of movement that characterised the first half, a continued drift away from the market could be expected.'

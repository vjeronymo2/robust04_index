			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Haitians fear weakening of US support: More conservative views in Washington will irritate Aristide Haitian officials fear the Republican party's sweeping success in this week's mid-term elections threatens continued US support for their country. Officials in the new administration of Mr Smarck Michel, the prime minister, are worried that Republican law-makers, many of whom have opposed President Bill Clinton's policy of military and economic support for Haiti, will demand a rapid reduction in American involvement. With Republican control of the US House of Representatives and the Senate from January, the officials said yesterday, it was likely that a timetable would be approved for an early withdrawal of US troops from the Caribbean state, creating a security vacuum before the planned 10,000-member Haitian police force was recruited and trained. This could create instability in the country, where law and order is being maintained by foreign troops and police monitors, they say. The economic reforms planned by the government may also be threatened by a harder line from the Republican controlled legislature. The US is the main donor to a Dollars 800m aid package which international financial institutions and the Haitian government agree is needed to start rebuilding the economy and the social and physical infrastructure over the next 15 months. A more conservative attitude to Haiti by US lawmakers in the New Year is likely to irritate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is banking on US support for the remaining 14 months of his administration, diplomats in Port-au-Prince suggested yesterday. Without a clear commitment on continuing support from Washington, Mr Aristide may be inclined to reconsider the political merits of some of the administrative and economic reforms to which he is now committed, particularly those likely to be unpopular. However, a more optimistic position is being taken by US officials in Haiti. 'I think the support for President Aristide and the restoration of democracy in Haiti will continue to be US policy,' said Mr Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the US embassy in Port-au-Prince. 'Thus far it has been successful and we would hope that success would continue in the future and that all Americans will continue to support it.' This is apparently no comfort to the new Haitian administration. Officials say President Clinton had to ride roughshod over the more liberal outgoing Democrat-controlled legislature to secure US military pressure to force Haiti's army leaders out of the country and assure Mr Aristide's reinstatement. 'The one factor which Mr Clinton has going for his Haiti policy is that it has been a foreign policy success so far,' said a diplomat to Port-au-Prince yesterday. 'But now he will be swimming upstream on this issue. This apparent success might be undone before it is guaranteed - which must be with the installation of Mr Aristide's successor in February 1996.' A key player in Washington's Haiti policy in the new legislature will be Mr Jesse Helms, the Republic senator from North Carolina, who is likely to become chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Senator Helms has been a consistent and harsh critic of Mr Aristide, and has publicly questioned the president's mental stability. Meanwhile, the new government's priority is to jump-start Haiti's economy, Mr Michel said. The adjustment of the economy will be done on the basis of 'democracy, justice and tolerance,' with the public sector being rebuilt, and social services rehabilitated. One immediate government concern is public health. Maternal and infant mortality are increasing, and there is a high incidence of tuberculosis. The new government will try to stimulate economic growth by an early reform of import tariffs in order to eliminate monopolies. State enterprises and services which are to be privatised will be sold to companies and individuals who will be capable of running them efficiently, the prime minister said.</p>

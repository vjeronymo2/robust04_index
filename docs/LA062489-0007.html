			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA'S ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE  </P> <P> Ms. Gabor admits her vehicle registration and driver's license were expired.  She also admits having an open container of liquor in her car when stopped. She  slapped the policeman who stopped her, and drove away because she didn't know  what the "F" word meant.  </P> <P> She then calls a news conference to announce she is "standing up for the  battered women in America." It would appear she was really just standing up for  all the cameras and as a result dealt a damaging blow to the issue of battered  women.  </P> <P> MICHAEL KENYON  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Personal View: A perverse loss of local knowledge 'The holistic planner overlooks the fact that it is easy to centralise power, but impossible to centralise all that knowledge . . . necessary for the wise wielding of that centralised power . . . (so) the greater the gain in power, the greater will be the loss of knowledge' - Sir Karl Popper, philosopher, The Poverty of Historicism. It is a nice irony that those in Britain who have been among Popper's greatest disciples should now be so deaf to his injunctions. It was one such, Michael Heseltine, who in 1979, when he was environment secretary, pledged 'to sweep away tiresome and excessive control over local government'. But 14 years later, with the passage of 144 separate acts of Parliament, each shifting power from town hall to Whitehall, the Conservatives have created the most centralised system in western Europe. Government orders to be pushed through the Commons today will turn the screw on councils still tighter. The system is cumbersome, inefficient and unfair. It has led to the gratuitous loss of services and jobs in many boroughs, particularly those in urban areas, which have had their budgets forced well below the level necessary to maintain a decent level of service. But there are also councils whose budgets have been forced above the levels which local councillors - and electors - thought appropriate. In January 1993, Ernest Mallett, Conservative leader of the Elmbridge District Council in Surrey, described the capping system as a 'joke' which encouraged councils to 'spend up'. He added: 'If there were no capping, our spending would probably be about Pounds 1m lower.' As Popper said, the greater the centralised power, the greater will be the loss of knowledge. Ministers cannot know what the priorities should be in every community across the land. So to establish a consistent system of budget control, the judgments of 24,000 councillors in 400 councils have to be reduced to a mathematical formula. But there are no data, and there is no algebra, which can do this fairly or sensitively. Trial and error is used, producing the most preposterous results. Oxford is declared to be more deprived than Liverpool, Bournemouth has worse social conditions than Barnsley. The formulae are then 'massaged', 'damped', and leeway has to be built in to avoid, in particular boroughs, a melt-down in public services (which not even social security secretary Peter Lilley would contemplate). It all ends with a circumstance stunningly reminiscent of 1970s incomes policies, so despised today. In place of discretion, or negotiation, there is a national 'going rate' and electors are denied choice. As Sarah Whitehouse, a delegate to the Conservative party conference in October, put it: 'Under rate capping (sic), you can't tell the difference between Labour and Tory.' Furthermore, the overall effect on public spending is perverse. In the words of Tony Travers, author of a London School of Economics study, budget capping has 'led to higher spending by councils, the opposite result to that intended'. So what should replace this apology for a system? First, central government should cease trying to control what local councils spend on current services from their own local tax base. Just five years ago, this was John Major's policy. As the then chief secretary to the Treasury, he published the quaintly titled white paper, 'A New Public Expenditure Planning Total'. In this, he said that mixing central government spend with local council self-financed expenditure 'blurs the status of the various aggregates'. So he proposed that, in future, the Treasury's planning total should include only central government grant to councils, and exclude locally raised revenue. The policy lasted for about six months, but the case is as strong as ever. Second, councils' tax base should be broadened to include revenue from the business rate. Today, the council tax raises just 20 per cent of total spend. Third, the central government grant which each council receives should be cash limited. Fourth, annual elections, with a third of councillors retiring each year, should be introduced in every council area. London local democracy is far less effective than in, say, my constituency of Blackburn, where an election is never more than months away. Annual elections would also produce greater continuity and stability in councils. Then the electors would be able to exercise power, with knowledge. To the extent that the chancellor either knew or cared about local councils' self-financed expenditure, he would probably find that over time its trend was lower than if he had continued to interfere in it.

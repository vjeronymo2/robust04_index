			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Code of ethics planned for NHS boards BOARD MEMBERS of the National Health Service are likely to become subject to a code of ethics and business behaviour within the next few months, Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive, said yesterday. In June Sir Duncan set up a task force to examine accountability and probity issues following serious managerial failings in the Wessex and West Midlands regional health authorities. He told a National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in London yesterday that the proposed national ethical code would be one of the likely outcomes. Another probable result of the task force's work will be a register of interests for chairmen, board members and directors of health authorities and trust hospitals. 'Such a register of interest must reassure the public that the people at the very top of each NHS body have a clear understanding that private interests and personal gain must play no part in the conduct of NHS business,' Sir Duncan said. He added that the NHS was responsible for 15 per cent of public spending and 'mismanagement of these funds, or unacceptable risk taking, is a proper and understandable cause for public disquiet'. During the next six months every health authority and trust should begin to look at its effectiveness as a board, he said. The task force would provide guidance on good management, including: Identifying functions that might be carried out by a company secretary figure. Establishing a schedule of reserved decisions that could be taken only by the board. Producing detailed guidance on functions and accountability of board sub-committees. Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance which reported last year, told the conference that boards must provide a proper degree of disclosure of information, and guard against 'undue concentrations of power'.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market struggles after interest rate rise - Market report The UK equity market successfully rode out potentially one of the most turbulent trading sessions in recent months, in spite of a major defeat of the government in the House of Commons, a rise of  1/2 percentage point in domestic interest rates, a Pounds 2bn gilts auction and a warning of possible further US interest rate increases in the short term. One of the top dealers at a leading UK securities house described the trading session as 'one of the most difficult for many months; all the big traders are reluctant to get involved in such awkward markets'. At the close of a dramatic day the FT-SE 100-share Index was down a mere 3.6 at 3,012.5. The FT-SE Mid 250 index moved in tandem, finishing 4.9 lower at 3,425.3. But dealers were under no illusions about the market stability in the short term. Wall Street was swinging around during London trading hours, and was down almost 20 points 1 1/2 hours after London closed. Most of the drama occurred in the first two hours of trading. The Conservative government's defeat on Tuesday evening over the implementation of the second stage of VAT on domestic fuel was the trigger for a flurry of selling pressure in sterlimg, gilts and equities at the outset of trading. The market's response was to mark down both gilts and stocks, albeit by smaller than expected amounts, to try to head off any large-scale selling. Meanwhile, the markets picked up the scent of a possible cut in UK interest rates to prevent a sell-off in sterling and encourage demand for the Pounds 2bn gilts auction. As soon as the 50 basis-point rise in interest rates was known the equity market staged a dramatic reversal, racing ahead strongly in the wake of a gilts market that rallied from being down a half-point to up 1/4 . The FT-SE 100, which was 13.0 lower at its worst, was transformed, accelerating to post a near 19 points rise in mid-morning. The markets, dealers said, were happy that the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England had moved so decisively to prevent a run on sterling and to choke off any build-up of inflationary pressures in the economy. Thereafter the pace of market activity slackened and the 100-share index began to drift easier, with traders looking towards Wall Street for a lead. The US stock market's good showing overnight had given a boost to European markets early on. But with Wall Street coming under pressure at the opening, after comments on excessive growth in the US economy by Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, the UK market fell back into negative territory. Marketmakers remained cautious about short term trends in equities ahead of news of the chancellor's new moves to provide for the Pounds 1.5bn Budget shortfall. Utilities were given a thorough shaking, and closed sharply lower amid worries that the sector may yet be the subject of a windfall profits tax. Some strategists refused to be panicked by the rate rise. Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said the rise had 'cleared the air' and that he expected the market to move higher between now and the end of the year, as the gilts market leads people to look towards 1995. There was general disappointment among brokers at the continuing low level of customer business. Turnover yesterday was a poor 596.7m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing 58 per cent of the total. The Office of Fair Trading produced the biggest shock of the day, recommending that the British Aerospace and GEC bids for VSEL, the submarine manufacturer, be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, a move that stunned the market. VSEL shares plummeted.</p>

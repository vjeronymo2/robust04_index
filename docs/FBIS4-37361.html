			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA) -- The British Embassy in Cairo  will hand over equipment valued at over one-half million  [Egyptian] pounds to the Palestinian police tomorrow. Designed  to be used in Gaza and Jericho, the equipment will be delivered  to the Egyptian town of Rafah.    A statement by the embassy today said that the equipment is  part of the assistance program of 105 million dollars, about 250  million Egyptian pounds, which, during his visit to Gaza early  this year, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd promised to the  Palestinians over a three-year period.    The statement said that Britain will also contribute 20  percent of the 50 million Sterling pounds, 250 million Egyptian  pounds, earmarked by the European Union for development projects.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET: DREXEL'S CASINO WORK MAY GO BUST  </P> <P> After it agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts a few weeks ago, Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc. was suspended from selling New York City municipal bonds.  Now it looks as though the embattled investment firm is having trouble in New  Jersey.  </P> <P> Sources close to Jersey gambling regulators say Drexel could soon be barred by  the New Jersey Casino Control Commission from doing business with casinos there  because of its agreement to pay $650 million in penalties for securities law  violations.  </P> <P> Besides being a headache for Drexel and a continuation of the slow  deterioration of its business, such a move could also be a major blow to Bally  Manufacturing, which owns two casinos in Atlantic City. Drexel Burnham has been  spearheading a restructuring effort for Bally.  </P> <P> "Part of the licensing process is meeting the statutory criteria," says a  source close to the regulators. Under state law, almost all felons are  automatically kept out of the casino business, and companies -- like Drexel --  that serve the casino industry may also be barred if convicted of a felony.  "You can form your own opinion," the source said when asked if Drexel would be  barred.  </P> <P> Under the state law, a felon could be allowed to take part in the gaming  business in a service capacity if he -- or it -- has shown signs of  rehabilitation. While such a loophole might help Drexel down the road, right  now it is unlikely that the investment house can prove that it has changed that  much in the past month.  </P> <P> "It's not a hard and fast rule," said another source close to the casino  commission. "But if you are talking about Drexel, it will probably be  impossible for them to do business here."  </P> <P> Drexel has done so much business with the casinos in New Jersey that regulators  early last year asked the company to file for a license as a service industry.  This license is now pending.  </P> <P> Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said: "Our guys are looking at that (the New  Jersey situation) now." Will Drexel be allowed to do business with the casinos?  "I hope so," he added.  </P> <P> Chicago-based Bally, meanwhile, finds itself in a precarious situation. The  company announced months ago that it wanted to split itself into two parts. One  part would be a gaming and hotel business. The other would include health  clubs, amusement center products and its lottery equipment operations.  </P> <P> The casino part of the company, however, would end up with much more debt than  it now has. Regulators generally don't like casinos to be highly leveraged, so  experts on Wall Street believe that the plan is destined to fail even without  the added burden of Drexel's troubles.  </P> <P> But even before Bally can submit its restructuring plan, the company has to  find out whether Drexel Burnham Lambert will be able to continue to work on the  transaction. The other investment firm on the deal, Lazard Freres &amp; Co., is  too small to carry the load all by itself. Sources speculate that only one or  two other firms -- Merrill Lynch and perhaps Shearson Lehman Hutton -- would be  capable of replacing Drexel.  </P> <P> Bally is supposed to file the restructuring plan with New Jersey regulators  next month. "I don't know if they want to come in here right now," says a  casino source. Other sources say Bally has already received inklings that the  commission isn't keen on its restructuring idea.  </P> <P> There were reports around Wall Street last week that Bally Chairman Robert E.  Mullane was scouring the financial community for another investment banker to  replace Drexel. If Mullane can't salvage his current restructuring plan, there  is speculation that he might attempt to take the company private. As previously  reported, an investor group has already expressed an interest in buying Bally.  </P> <P> A Bally spokesman would only say that Drexel is still its investment counselor.  </P> <P> About this time last year, famed climatologist Iben Browning of Sandia Park,  N.M., predicted that the United States would be sweating its way through a  drought in the summer of '88. He was, of course, right.  </P> <P> So what does Browning think about next summer? He's predicting a "more moderate  summer (that) will return toward normal in both rainfall and temperature."  </P> <P> And there is more good news for consumers. Browning, who also acts as a  consultant for the Paine Webber brokerage, says the acreage that will be  planted with corn this year will increase by one-third. That's mostly because  of changes in the government subsidy program.  </P> <P> But if Browning's prediction about the weather holds up, that will mean that  the country will be rolling in the stuff.  </P> <P> Last year about 40% of the corn and soybean crop was lost during the drought.  Between 10% and 15% of the spring wheat crop was also destroyed.  </P> <P> Browning based last year's accurate prediction on the extraordinarily high  number of tornadoes along the Gulf Coast. There were more tornadoes than  normal, Browning claimed, because the jet stream -- the same weather pattern  that brings rain over farmland in the High Plains during summer -- was  misplaced.  </P> <P> But the jet stream appears to be right where it belongs this year, says  Browning, who counted hardly a Gulf Coast tornado all fall.  </P> <P> If soon-to-be-President Bush wants to raise revenues while also fighting some  American vices, Merrill Lynch suggests an increase in the tax on cigarettes,  wine, hard liquor and beer. And, to keep some of the imbibers off the road,  throw an additional tax on gasoline.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch Capital Markets estimates that a 25-cents-a-gallon tax on  gasoline would generate $25 billion a year in revenue. And, even better, the  price of a gasoline wouldn't be any higher than it was at the height of OPEC's  power.  </P> <P> So-called sin taxes -- on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes -- would bring in  another $10 billion in revenue.  </P> <P> Merrill Lynch says none of these taxes have been raised more than once in the  past 35 years. It says these taxes are lower today -- when inflation is taken  into account -- than they were in the 1950s.  </P> <P> What's more, the additional taxes can easily be justified. The higher levy on  fuel can be presented as a revenue raiser for pollution control or highway  maintenance, and the booze tax can be bottled as a way to raise money to fight  substance abuse.  </P> <P> Fees and commissions paid by industrial corporations to investment bankers rose  16% in 1988, according to Greenwich (Conn.) Associates. Smaller companies saw  the biggest increase. Forty percent of the money went for merger and  acquisition activity . . .  </P> <P> Cummins Engine stock has been rising on takeover rumors ever since Sir Gordon  White, head of Hanson Industries, announced a few weeks ago that he owned lots  of its stock. But sources close to Sir Gordon insist that the British  investor/raider has no intention of taking over Cummins on either a friendly or  unfriendly basis. "It's just an investment," the source repeated several times  . . .  </P> <P> Corporate takeover activity has slowed considerably over the past few months,  according to investment banking sources, but not because people don't want to  do deals. The sources say companies and raiders are holding back so as not to  create a furor in Congress at the start of the Bush Administration . . .  </P> <P> A Transco Energy Co. executive has told Wall Street that the company may settle  a lawsuit concerning natural gas contracts before the end of this month. It  would result in a writedown, the size of which he did not disclose . . .  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference with Peter Weiss, chairman of the </F> Party of the Democratic Left, SDL, including recorded interview  with Weiss by correspondent Ivan Samel]    [Excerpts] The political crisis provoked by the  incompetence and unwillingness of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] to cooperate is gaining momentum. Peter Weiss,  chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] opened  today's regular news briefing with these words.    Apart from the present internal arguments between the  opposition and the government, journalists focused on tomorrow's  26th Session of the [Slovak] National Council and the proposed  constitutional bill, submitted yesterday [14 Feb], to shorten  the parliamentary term. At the end of the news conference, SDL  chairman Peter Weiss answered some questions by correspondent  Ivan Samel.    [Samel] Chairman, it seems that the political crisis in  Slovakia is nearing a climax. What solutions are going to be  sought by the SDL as it enters this period?    [Weiss] It must be said that this political crisis was  provoked by the HZDS itself, through its inability to  democratically manage the emerging different strands of opinion  within the party and its leadership's subjective lack of  readiness to cooperate with other political parties. I do not  understand the hysterics that took hold of a section of the mass  media when the possibility was mentioned of expressing no  confidence in this government. I do not know why Slovakia  should be in danger, as today's headlines in the REPUBLIKA note,  just because one group of government officials would be replaced  in the next elections. This would happen if a vote of  no-confidence is passed in accordance with the Constitution.    After all, Slovakia is not Meciar, and Meciar is not  Slovakia. Our premise is that it is first of all necessary to  call early elections. This is the basic factor that would  settle the internal political situation. The second condition  to ease the internal political situation is, in our opinion, the  passing of the large-scale privatization bill, in the form in  which it was agreed with opposition forces. [passage omitted]    [Weiss] There are many considerations that favor the holding  of the fall elections. First, it would not be good if the  Slovak election campaign were to run in parallel with the  election campaign in the Hungarian Republic, as the center of  attention would shift only to ethnic matters and national  passions could rise. Moreover, it is necessary to gain some  time to correct the basic political mistakes and mistaken  decisions of this government. If elections were to be called  for June, there would be a permanent election campaign starting  from February. It might lead to destabilization of the  situation in society, meaning that all attention would be  focused only on the election campaign and not on the resolution  of the problems that must be tackled.    Finally, citizens should be shown that there are other ways  of governing and modes of cooperation between political  parties-- besides the model of one against everyone--and of the  promotion only of one's own political view and interest.

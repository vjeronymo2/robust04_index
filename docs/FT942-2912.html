			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Trade surplus shows sharp drop in Japan The first clear-cut evidence that Japan's huge current account surplus has peaked came yesterday with figures showing a sharp drop in the trade surplus for May. The Ministry of Finance reported that the customs-cleared merchandise trade surplus fell by 15.9 per cent from the same month a year earlier, to Dollars 6.54bn (Pounds 4.3bn), the first double-digit year-on-year decline since December 1991. Imports rose by 12.3 per cent to Dollars 21.5bn while exports grew by just 4.2 per cent to Dollars 28.1bn on a year earlier. The more reliable three-month trend, which irons out monthly fluctuations, showed a fall in the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus of 7 per cent in the three months to the end of May. The sharp fall in the dollar-denominated surplus reflects the decline in yen terms under way for several months. The sharp rise of the Japanese currency against the dollar in the last year had led to a rise in the dollar-denominated surplus, despite a fall in the surplus in volume terms. But yesterday's figures suggest the volume of imports is now growing so fast as to outweigh the effects of the stronger yen. Import volumes rose rose as much as 16.1 per cent on a year ago, the fifth consecutive monthly increase, while export volumes fell 2.6 per cent, the fourth straight fall. The sharp rise in import volumes appears to reflect a slight strengthening in domestic demand, but some analysts attribute it to the growth in Japanese companies' offshore production. To offset the yen's high value, many manufacturers have stepped up overseas production. Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said: 'The Japanese economy is now sucking in imports, as Japanese companies increase the foreign out-sourcing of many of their operations.' Most analysts agreed that the figures marked a turning point. 'The strong yen is at last being reflected in a smaller dollar trade surplus,' said Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific. 'We can now expect to see some spectacular falls in the surplus in the second half of the year.' But the figures are unlikely to have an immediate effect on the trade tension between the US and Japan. The bilateral trade surplus rose 7.5 per cent from a year ago to Dollars 3.05bn, reflecting the strength of US demand for imports. The dollar was little affected, remaining under pressure against the Japanese currency, at Y102.65 to the dollar at the close of Tokyo trading. Ministers greeted the figures with caution.</p>

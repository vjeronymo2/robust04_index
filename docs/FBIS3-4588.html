Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state, and Ho Chong,  deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations,  held a contact today at the UN Headquarters and said they had  reached a four-point agreement on simultaneous actions [negae  hangui tongsi haengdong chochi], including the above.    The U.S. and North Korean representatives said: The United  States will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise  when nuclear inspections begin on 1 March after visas are issued  to the members of the International Atomic Energy Agency  inspection team. They also said that North Korea will concede to  a working-level contact for the South-North exchange of envoys  if the ROK proposes it first.    Right after the U.S.-North Korean talks, North Korea's Ho  Chong said: The nuclear inspections to begin on 1 March will be  conducted at the level necessary for guaranteeing the continuity  of nuclear safeguards, and this is appropriate for the  particular situation of the temporary suspension of the  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]  [haekanjon chochiui yonsoksong pojange piryohan sujunimyo inun  haekhwaksan kumjijoyak taltoeui hyoryogul ilsi chungjihan  tuksusanghwange mannun gosirago malhaessumnida].    According to well-informed UN sources, the third round of  U.S.- North Korean high-level talks, slated for 21 February,  will endorse a package solution to the problems concerning North  Korea's return to the NPT, its complete implementation of the  Nuclear Safeguards Accord, the U.S. abandonment of its hostile  policy toward North Korea and the cessation of nuclear threats.</p>

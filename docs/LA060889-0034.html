"One evening I decided to make a recipe I found for cabbage  strudel and I decided to improvise on it. Since my husband liked it so much, I  gave a few friends the recipe and they loved it."  </P> <P> CURRIED CABBAGE STRUDEL  </P> <P> 1/2 medium head cabbage, finely shredded  </P> <P> 2 cups ground turkey or beef  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons oil, about  </P> <P> 1 cup sour cream  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons curry powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted  </P> <P> 5 filo leaves (thaw if frozen, cover with cloth to prevent drying)  </P> <P> Cook cabbage in boiling water until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain well  and set aside. Brown ground turkey in skillet with as much oil as needed. Drain  and set aside. Mix sour cream, curry powder, salt, pepper, cabbage and turkey.  Place 3 filo leaves on ungreased baking sheet and brush with melted butter.  </P> <P> Place remaining filo leaves crosswise and brush with butter.

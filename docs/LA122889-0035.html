			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A LOAN COULD HELP BOYFRIEND  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I recently inherited money and would like to lend some to a  boyfriend who's starting up his own company. My only worry is that, if I do  this, something might happen and it would end up hurting our relationship. I  know he needs the money, but some guys can't stand taking anything from a  woman. If I do give it to him, how should I do it? -- F.E.  </P> <P> DEAR F.E.: The more businesslike you can be about the loan, the less chance  there will be for misunderstanding later, in case he can't repay you. There's  an old saying that you should never lend money you can't afford to lose. Always  assume that the loan might go sour. If it does, you might be able to deduct the  debt as a "short-term capital loss" on your tax return as long as you have  proof.  </P> <P> If you're seriously involved with this man, don't hesitate to discuss your  feelings about the loan with him. Find out how he feels before you write out  any checks.  </P> <P> If you do decide to make the loan, by all means don't give it in cash, and make  it clear that all repayment should also be by check so you both have a record.  Formalize your agreement; the more casual you are about lending, the more  likely the exchange will impinge on your friendship.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband was very poor when he was a young man and he's  determined to see that his two children have everything they wish. Even though  they are 8 and 12, they have their own credit cards, and they don't hesitate to  use them. I feel it isn't fair to them to let them grow up thinking that they  will always have whatever they want. We're not that rich, and someday they're  going to have a rude awakening. -- D.S.  </P> <P> DEAR D.S.: Children need allowances because this is a way of teaching them how  to save for special things that cost more than they can afford. Parents who  don't give youngsters allowances are robbing them and giving them an  unrealistic view of what money is and what it can do.  </P> <P> Parents who give children too much never allow them to learn the true value of  money. It's vital for youngsters to find that you can't have everything you  want when you want it.  </P> <P> Children need to learn about delayed gratification. Allowances help them to  postpone gratification and also gives them a necessary sense of independence.  They learn by making mistakes, and if they choose unwisely, they may have to go  without for a few weeks and this impresses them, making their next choices  wiser and more deliberate. If a child is simply given a credit card, he won't  learn this and will have to pay dearly later in life.  </P></p>

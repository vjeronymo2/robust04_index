			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: New issues Anglian's first day trading discount of 3 per cent puts it somewhere in the middle of the latest crop of new issues: less of a disappointment than the 13 per cent scored by The Telegraph, but trailing Kenwood's 1 per cent premium.

Research from the City University Business School into new issues between 1980 and 1988 suggests first day trading is an unreliable indicator of future performance. Though the average initial premium was 14 per cent, the collective underperformance thereafter against the FT-Actuaries All-Share index was 4 per cent over three years. The outstanding performance of Body Shop apart, shares with the highest initial premium tended to perform worst. Unfortunately for The Telegraph, shares opening at a discount were the second worst performing group. The best started with a premium between 6 and 12 per cent. A modest degree of underpricing may yet be the best recipe for getting an issue away.</p>

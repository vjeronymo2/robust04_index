			<p>BFN     [Text] The press center of the Black Sea Fleet command  declared that in the course of the next round of the  Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet held 21-22  April in Sevastopol the parties "have outlined the ways to solve  the problems under discussion." The information of the press  center stresses that the participants of the dialogue recognize  that "the Black Sea Fleet should not become an apple of discord  between the friendly states."    "At the same time we should admit that the position of the  Ukrainian party did not meet the spirit of constructiveness with  which the Russian delegation has come to the negotiations."  "There was an impression that representatives of Ukraine's  Defense Ministry and Navy try to disavow the Moscow agreement  dated 15 April 1994 another time," says the message.    The press center believes that "the Ukrainian party admits  dual interpretation of the provisions of the Moscow agreement on  separate basing of two fleets and proportional division of the  Black Sea Fleet. To this effect it refers to the fact that as  before representatives of Ukraine's Defense Ministry "insist  that Ukraine's Black Sea Fleet and Navy should be stationed in  Sevastopol." The authors of this document assert that "this  contradicts not only to the logic of the military theory but to  the will of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents and to the last  decisions of the Sevastopol city council of people's deputies."    The document underlines that "the Russian delegation hopes  that sound sense would prevail over political ambitions and the  negotiations would continue." "The Russian party takes off the  entire responsibility for the disruption of a constructive  dialogue," declared the press center of the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

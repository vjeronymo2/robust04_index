			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRAUD TRIAL SET TODAY FOR KARCHER ACCOUNTING DIRECTOR  </P> <P> The accounting director of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain is scheduled to go on  trial today in Los Angeles on criminal charges of securities fraud through  insider trading.  </P> <P> Alvin DeShano of Orange, 54, has been accused in a one-count indictment of  avoiding $7,107 in potential losses by selling Carl Karcher Enterprises stock  based on confidential corporate information. The sale occurred on Oct. 15,  1984.  </P> <P> If convicted, DeShano could be sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined as much  as $250,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only Criminal Charge  </P> <P> Of the 16 people accused by the government last year of illegally trading in  securities of Anaheim-based Karcher Enterprises, DeShano is the only one to be  charged criminally so far.  </P> <P> Described by acquaintances as a soft-spoken family man, DeShano is director of  general accounting at Karcher Enterprises. He has been an employee of the  company for 15 years.  </P> <P> After the trial before U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, a jury will be  asked to decide whether DeShano knowingly sold Karcher securities on the basis  of information not available to the general public. Federal law prohibits any  trading based on such knowledge.  </P> <P> The criminal charge is an outgrowth of a civil lawsuit filed in federal court  last April by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused Carl  N. Karcher, chairman and chief executive of the firm, 14 family members and  DeShano of avoiding market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984.  </P> <P> The civil charges are still pending against Karcher, six of his relatives and  DeShano. Karcher and his six immediate family members are scheduled to go to  trial on June 6.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Pure' Insider Trading  </P> <P> DeShano's trial will be the first in recent memory in Los Angeles dealing with  "pure" insider trading in which an employee with access to corporate  information has been accused of using it to his advantage, according to legal  observers.  </P> <P> More typically, insider trading cases involve so-called "tippees" --  non-employees who were told confidential information by insiders, then used it  to buy or sell stock.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. James L. Sanders has declined to comment on why DeShano is  the only civil defendant who faces criminal charges or whether anyone else will  be indicted.  </P> <P> But according to court papers filed by the government, DeShano "worked on  making corrections" to the company's quarterly financial report on Oct. 15,  1984. Those corrections, the government alleges, had the effect of reducing the  company's profits for the quarter.  </P> <P> "At approximately 12:15 p.m. on Oct. 15, DeShano contacted his stockbroker and  sold all of his available (Karcher) shares. . . . As a result, prior to the  public announcement of (Karcher's) lowered earnings, DeShano avoided losses of  approximately $7,107," court documents state.  </P> <P> Defense documents, on the other hand, portray DeShano as an unsophisticated,  hard-working employee who rarely traded stocks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legitimate Reasons Cited  </P> <P> "He didn't trade based on inside information," said defense attorney David  Wiechert of Irvine. Instead, DeShano "had totally legitimate reasons for the  sale," the attorney said.  </P> <P> According to Wiechert's trial brief, those reasons included financial need.  DeShano's son had asked his parents for a $5,000 loan, the papers state. And  DeShano and his wife, Paula, were considering buying a mountain cabin in Lake  Arrowhead.  </P> <P> In addition, defense documents say DeShano was advised by a Karcher executive,  Steve Kishi, to diversify his investments. And his supervisor, Karcher  controller George Cloward, told DeShano that he could properly sell his stock  when he did, according to the trial brief.  </P> <P> "Cloward, as Al's supervisor, was responsible for instructing Al regarding the  trading rules of the company," defense papers state.  </P> <P> The trial is expected to last 4 to 8 days.  </P></p>

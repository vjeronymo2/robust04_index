			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Sega games go interactive on cable Sega, the Japanese video games maker, is set to launch a cable TV games-on-demand service on a dozen US cable networks later this month and in Japan a few weeks later. In the US, the 'Sega Channel' will be available to almost half of the country's 60m cable TV subscribers. A joint venture between Sega and two of the largest cable companies, TCI and Time Warner, it represents the cable industry's first interactive service. Sega said the services would begin in Japan in three regions - Tokyo, Nagano, in northern Japan and Mie, in the south. Subscribers to Tokyo Cable Network, LCV in Nagano and Cable Television Yokkaichi will be able to use the service. In Japan, Sega will charge a monthly fee of Y3,000 (Dollars 29) which will cover the cost of renting a special cartridge that plugs into the Sega video game machine, and playing as many of the games available as many times as desired. In the US, it says the service will be priced in line with 'premium' cable TV channel services, which typically cost about Dollars 15 per month. Compared to the cost of new game cartridges, which typically sell for about Dollars 50-Dollars 60, this may be a bargain for video game enthusiasts.</p>

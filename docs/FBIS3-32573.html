Saul  Landau, specialist at the Political Studies Center in  Washington, said it would be a mistake to interpret this  decision as a U.S. Government change in policy toward Cuba.    Washington authorizes trips to Cuba for only certain  categories of travelers: reporters, researchers, scholars,  government officials, and U.S. citizens of Cuban origin with  relatives in Cuba, or guests whose expenses are paid by the  Cuban authorities.    News dispatches last week indicated that the White House is  studying a Department of State proposal to broaden the scope of  travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens.    Saul Landau today stated that the proposal to expand the  categories of American visitors to Cuba must not be viewed as a  positive indicator regarding the United States' general policies  toward Cuba. The measure might be a sign of flexibility  regarding restriction of the rights of Americans. However, this  is not indicative of a lowering of the guard against Cuba.    The Department of State proposal is based on an amendment  bill drafted last year by California Democratic Representative  Howard Berman, opposing the travel ban. State Department  specialists drafted the new proposal, which is now being studied  by the National Security Council for government approval.</p>

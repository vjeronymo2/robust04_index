			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> ON THAT SUBJECT: Raffi and Midnight Oil aren't the only pop artists who don't  want their new CDs released with a long box. According to manager Kenny Laguna,  rock songstress Joan Jett manager has made a formal request to CBS Records  asking that the label issue her next album without a CD long box.  </P> <P> "Joan isn't someone who gets involved in a lot of causes, but she feels  strongly about this -- she doesn't want to be a party to destroying millions of  trees for a box that everyone throws into the garbage," explained Laguna, who  said Jett's album is tentatively scheduled for a Christmas release. "So we sent  a letter to the top execs at CBS about a month ago, along with some recent  Earth Day articles. Joan made it clear she's serious. She said if they felt  they couldn't market her CD without a long box, then she'd rather them not put  a CD out at all, even though that could cost her a lot of record sales." Laguna  said the CBS brass is currently considering her request.  </P></p>

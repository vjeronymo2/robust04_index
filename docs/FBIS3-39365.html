			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ulrich Reitz: "The Boss; Wolfgang Schaeuble Has </F> Done It; The Union Caucus Leader Is His Party's Prime Mover in  Bonn; His Handicap Does Not Hinder His Ambition"]    [Text] One party colleague recently suggested to his  parliamentary caucus chairman that he resign. "Wolfgang, just  become president, that will solve the whole problem."    Wolfgang Schaeuble let a hasty reply escape his lips: "I  cannot exactly review the troops from a wheelchair."    What is true for the president is also true for the  chancellor.    Protocol-pro Helmut Kohl dismisses the occasional defeatism  of his most important associate. Whether or not one can review  troops from a wheelchair is irrelevant.    The chancellor sent Schaeuble, the victim of an  assassination  attempt, a biography of the paralyzed U.S. President Franklin D.  Roosevelt.    Motto: If you believe in yourself you can do anything.    Schaeuble did not read the huge volume and finds the  comparison with the U.S. president inappropriate. "Roosevelt had  polio. I had my legs shot out from under me in an instant. The  two are completely different."    But even without Roosevelt's formula, Schaeuble has  succeeded  in believing in himself once again. Today he is at the top--the  one and only union colleague whom Kohl can tolerate having with  him. And no election chances remain for the ailing chancellor.    This tough individual, confined to a wheelchair, has with  determination maneuvered himself to the top. Government  administrator, parliamentary caucus leader, CDU strategist: a  man for all seasons. Kohl's luck has run out and Schaeuble's  desire for power is increasing.    Hermann-Otto Solms, the FDP [Free Democratic Party]  parliamentary caucus leader, has a realistic opinion of his  partner in the coalition: "Chancellor? Yes, he will make it  there."    Schaeuble has this awkward parliamentary group under control  for the most part. As one member of the executive committee  recalls, Schaeuble's predecessor, Alfred Dregger, "was Kohl's  vassal. Schaeuble is his opponent."  <H5>  The Man Makes Mistakes </H5>   Once, during a momentary loss of reality, when Schaeuble  voiced his desire to reduce the sessional expense allowance for  his deputies, a furor ensued. Developmental politician Volkmar  Koehler, an unflappable man who had never before lost his  composure in the parliamentary caucus, was barely able to summon  the right words: "Mr. Chairman, you have contributed to the  disparagement of the members of parliament."    But Schaeuble's mistakes do not cling to him. And no CDU  member is able to explain this. They point to the obvious: "He  is simply the only alternative to Kohl."    The fact that his colleagues tend to overlook his mistakes  also has something to do with the wheelchair. They do not want  to assail anyone who is already so vulnerable.    Parliamentary caucus meeting last Tuesday. The first  following Christmas break. The 317 representatives are expecting  encouragement for the big election year. How will we be able to  pull it out again? Helmut Kohl is gone.    And Schaeuble?    He says that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  now  has the opportunity for the first time to come to power, and  that the feeling of discontent with the coalition is great.  Schaeuble believes that red-green no longer represents a  nightmare to many voters.    He presents his election campaign plan without emotion--not  a  trace of upheaval. The members of parliament had returned to  Bonn from winter break in a bad humor, many slunk back into  their offices as if they were boarding a sinking ship. Evenings,  over wine, they philosophize on the virtues of the opposition.    Herbert Werner expressed it in a nutshell: "For 22 years now  I have sat here in the Bundestag. That was the gloomiest first  meeting of the year I have ever sat through."    The government, with Kohl at its pinnacle, is in the  basement. And Schaeuble is not pulling it out. Coincidence?    For a year now Schaeuble has again been able to drive a car.  Only now are photographs of this appearing in the press.  Confidants of the chancellor interpret the message: His handicap  is no longer an obstacle--to anything. Coincidence?    At the end of last week Schaeuble planned to announce to the  public that in the union's view the economy is picking up. The  CDU leadership discussed precisely this topic over the weekend.  Schaeuble, the parliamentary caucus leader, wanted to be faster  than the party headed by Kohl. His hard luck: His delegates  remained at variance and the paper was not completed. The  demonstration of leadership was dropped.    Schaeuble speaks loyally of Kohl. Recently, as presidium  members have noted with amusement, Schaeuble's loyalty has even  been "a little maliciously euphoric." On Friday he disclosed to  the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG what the Germans have in Kohl: "a  treasure." In December this read somewhat differently. At that  time BILD asked him whether he thought the chancellor would give  him his job in 1994.    His answer: "Because I know Helmut Kohl very well, I know  that he will put his great responsibility before his own  opinions."    No one has ever used nicer words to say that Kohl has become  weary of his office.    Schaeuble gave an ironic comment regarding newspaper reports  of a putsch against Kohl: "I will be happy if I am not around  for that."    Michael Glos, CSU [Christian Social Union] land caucus  leader  and long-time colleague of Schaeuble, agrees with Kohl-Deputy  Heinz Eggert: "He is too clever to overthrow the chancellor."  And Solms knows what Schaeuble is also convinced of: "Only Kohl  can decide when to leave office. No one can force it."    This could change completely following the elections in  Lower  Saxony. If the CDU loses more than five percentage points in 10  weeks, as is feared by union strategists, the debate over the  chancellor will be opened up. A whole group of parliamentarians  are planning to call for Kohl's resignation. And they will be  assisted by a tail wind from CDU land associations. Schaeuble  has painted himself as an alternative. And then?    Today his analysis of the situation remains cool: "The costs  of a change would be too great." But no one is in a position to  predict the dynamics of a debate over the chancellor following a  clear defeat in a key election.    If the representatives no longer see any chance of securing  their own mandate with Kohl, and if they think Schaeuble would  be their only salvation, then things would look bad for Kohl.    Schaeuble has much to thank Kohl for. The chancellor was his  sponsor, he gave him encouragement in the Reha Hospital in  Langensteinbach. In terms of their human traits, the two are  quite close.    Already in 1989 Heiner Geissler was speaking with others  about Kohl's demise. Schaeuble, on the contrary, is not Kohl's  Brutus. He issues frontal attacks, when they are called for.    If he thought the situation was serious enough that the CDU  was on the verge of being swept down the river, he says, "I  would discuss it with him." For Schaeuble it is a question of  loyalty. "Otherwise I would feel like a blackguard."    Schaeuble wants to nip in the bud speculation in the union  that is a threat to him that he is purposefully seeking to  overthrow Kohl in order to succeed him: "I do not want to become  chancellor. I want to be spared this bitter cup."    Once, in the fall of 1992, Kohl gave Schaeuble (and Volker  Ruhe) a solemn warning. When the parliamentary caucus chairman,  together with the east German CDU representatives, was moving  for the investment loan, thus dragging Kohl into the scrape,  many in the union considered it an indisputable fact that:  "Schaeuble is pushing for a grand coalition." Kohl warned,  hinting at the 1989 putsch: "Anyone who needs it may have a  Bremen party congress." At that time the party penalized the  putschists led by Lothar Spaeth. Schaeuble understood. Glos  describes the consequences: "Schaeuble does not give Kohl an  opportunity to suggest disloyalty."    The shrewd analyst leaves nothing to chance. Certainly not  his career. This fact is recalled even today by many colleagues.    As parliamentary party secretary, Schaeuble exposed the  weaknesses of Chancellery Minister Philipp Jenninger often  enough. When Jenninger had to go, the succession went to  Schaeuble as a matter of course.    Then in the chancellery he diligently performed his  apprentice work in a classic department under the watchful eyes  of Kohl.    In the Interior Ministry Schaeuble early on secured for  himself the job of handling the number one issue: German unity.    "How was it before with the Saarland? Who was in charge  then?" he quizzed his officials. As was so often the case,  Schaeuble already knew the answer: It was the minister of the  interior who organized the reintegration of the Saarland. This  made the whole thing clear: Chancellery Minister Rudolf Seiters,  who was actually responsible for the operative Germany policy,  remained outside.    The subtitle of the Schaeuble book The Treaty then  read "How I negotiated German unity." This irritated Kohl, the  chancellor of unity, greatly.    It is also notable that the representatives who initiated  the  demise of the then parliamentary caucus leader Alfred Dregger  came from Schaeuble's Baden-Wuerttemberg land caucus. After the  "accident" (Schaeuble seldom refers to it as an assassination  attempt), Dregger was permitted to extend his stay in office for  one year, after which he had to yield to Schaeuble.    His positions have always been promotions for him--as if  there were a cuckoo clock for careers.    Today Schaeuble is slaving away. Decisions are no longer  being made in the cabinet, but rather by the party and  parliamentary caucus leaders in the coalition. Schaeuble is  maneuvering and pushing. As Glos has noted, "He wants rapid  results; Kohl is waiting for the wave to die down."    Kohl is becoming a statesman, presiding more than governing.  If things become too close then Schaeuble has to straighten them  out.    For some time now the parliamentary caucus leader has not  restricted himself to governing. He is looking after the CDU  image. Schaeuble knows that it is not enough on election day  merely to present a list of accomplishments from the preceding  four years. New issues must be addressed--and a clear definition  of political course must be presented.    At the Berlin party congress in September of 1992 Schaeuble  announced his claim to political and spiritual leadership. He  possessed key ideas for preventing a drift of disillusioned CDU  voters toward the right: "national community," "patriotism,"  "fatherland," the state as a "protective community and community  of destiny," German "normalcy," the family as the center of  society, the well-armed state--Schaeuble intones Kohl's theme of  a transition of power from 1982: the spiritual-moral transition.    For some time now he has been preparing a strategy for  making  the two people's parties again distinguishable.    Earlier, Schaeuble checked those who were backing conflict  as  a way to improve the CDU image: "If the government can no longer  function, a clear outline of party policy will be of absolutely  no use."    Those days are gone. Today the parliamentary caucus leader  quotes the successful election candidate Heiner Geissler: "We  need to start a fight." If necessary, even in his own camp.    That is why it no longer matters if Volker Ruehe criticizes  Schaeuble's push for the domestic deployment of the Bundeswehr.  It is more important to the party leader that SPD Party Chairman  Rudolf Scharping falls into his trap, allowing himself to lose  his head over a comparison with Spain's fascist dictator Franco.    Schaeuble already has the next major issue of conflict up  his  sleeve: the privatization of responsibilities of the state. Very  soon, financing of Germany's expressways will have to come from  private sources. Citizens will then be required to pay for their  use. This will provide relief for the budget and will help the  environment. If the SPD rejects this, Schaeuble plans to hold  them up as state-minded supporters of a planned economy.    Schaeuble, the most effective speaker in parliament, long  ago  became the most threatening opponent of the SPD. He speaks more  softly than he really needs to. He says things that cause the  opposition to experience a moment of shock before it can catch  its breath.    Kohl for consensus, Schaeuble for upheaval. The  parliamentary  caucus leader has assumed Geissler's former role. He is closing  the gap left by the Adenauer house.    This is still true now. Sometimes it becomes a bit too much  for him. Thus it is considered only logical that he would like  to again put Geissler up against Scharping. His problem: The  former general secretary is more devoted to the union than the  SPD.    The SPD continues to plot its course against Schaeuble.  Parliamentary Secretary Peter Struck's attempt: "He has always  been somewhere between conservative and reactionary." In  addition: Schaeuble remained silent during the debate over the  abortion paragraph 218, and maneuvered for a long time over the  issue of right to asylum. A rightist?    For the strategists, the results are generally more  important  than the means. "No good will result if in the end one has a  clear conscience but has achieved nothing." So he allows the  aspersions to bounce off of him: "Anyone who considers me a  rightist must already be rather stupid."    Scharping tried a different formula: "This man is driving  the  union into a nationalist-rightist corner with his callous  nature."    Callous? Nearly all members of the parliamentary caucus  leadership have found Schaeuble to be more tolerant, composed,  and sympathetic since the assassination attempt. The feeling is  different, however, among those who are not so close to him.    Schaeuble will never be a chummy type like Kohl. Beloved in  public, respected in the parliamentary caucus. With Kohl the  reverse is true.  <H5>  Schaeuble Defends Minorities. </H5>   For example, Friedbert Pflueger. He finds "this new  stereotype of callousness simply vicious." He says he feels  "happy and motivated" under Schaeuble's leadership.    Schaeuble explains relapses into arrogance with his  "admittedly somewhat difficult to understand Baden humor."    Nonetheless: Schaeuble has risen from superior to chairman.  Now he may become chancellor. The parade can begin.  <H5>  [Box, p 20] </H5> <H5>  Wolfgang Schaeuble on... </H5>   Rudolf Scharping: A great deal of sympathy for the SPD  party chairman    He is a dangerous opponent, a very good party chairman for  the SPD in its current condition. He has managed to give the SPD  confidence. And he has succeeded in conveying to the people the  idea of a transition in government as something undramatic. He  does not have a great deal of depth.    Hans-Ulrich Klose: Gets along well with the SPD  parliamentary caucus leader    I have a very high opinion of Hans-Ulrich Klose. He is one  of  the most intelligent individuals in the German Bundestag, while  at the same time he is quite human. He worries: Will we be able  to look ourselves in the eye later when we look back at what we  have done? I think the same way.    Helmut Kohl: Loyal to and friendly with the CDU  chancellor    He has what one needs to be chancellor: a thick skin. No  other office is exposed to such attacks. And he has no tendency  toward becoming a potentate, he has remained a relatively normal  person. And he is a reliable friend--like few others.    Wolfgang Schaeuble: Prefers to remain true to himself,  the CDU parliamentary caucus leader    I also hold him in high regard. I am not a split personality  who is dissatisfied with himself. When one is in the political  field one must also be a little overconfident, otherwise one  will not be capable of making decisions. I lie seldom and  poorly--and I do not like living with an unclean conscience.  <H5>  [Box, p 22] </H5> <H5>  Desires and Fears--The Private Wolfgang Schaeuble </H5>   --Epiphany is marked in red in Wolfgang Schaeuble's  calendar.  It was then that he lost a game of chess to his 19-year-old son  Hans-Joerg for the first time. The perfectionist has a hard time  dealing with losing. He said his wife is the same: "Ingeborg,  she is a hopeless case."    --Schaeuble has four children and two brothers. He is a  family man. Even more so after the assassination attempt. "When  you have had an experience like that, you know how important  your family is."    --There is a ramp in the new Bonn assembly hall. It is too  steep for wheelchairs. If Schaeuble wants to go to the speaker's  desk he must go down the ramp. A ride along a perilous  precipice. If he brakes too sharply with his hands his vehicle  will tip over. "I will carry this image with me for the rest of  my days."    --Wolfgang Schaeuble admires Vaclav Havel. Not least because  of his power as a speaker. In September 1991 he visited the  Czech president. In the Prague castle, however, there was no  elevator. Only many stairs. And Havel lived upstairs. Upon  arriving there the union member sighed: "Not my milieu."    --From 20 centimeters below the chin upwards there is no  trace of Schaeuble's disability. He keeps his balance with his  arms. Two arms are need to play the violin. Schaeuble has taken  it up.    --Schaeuble is supposed to have grown embittered. Saxon  Heinz  Eggert, Helmut Kohl's deputy in the CDU party chairmanship, sees  things differently: "I have seen disabled individuals who have  comforted the high and mighty."</p>

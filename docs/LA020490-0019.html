			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CLASS IS DISMISSED, BUT THE 'GRANDE DAME' IS NOT FINISHED TEACHING  </P> <P> An ambulance raced to the scene of an accident on Interstate 5 south of  Bakersfield. The driver, it seemed, had dozed off at the wheel and hit a guard  rail. When the paramedic peered into the car and saw the uninjured driver, a  flash of recognition came across his face.  </P> <P> "I don't suppose you remember me," the paramedic told Gladys Waddingham, "but I  used to be in your Spanish class at Inglewood High School."  </P> <P> Another former student had just encountered Inglewood's most acclaimed former  teacher.  </P> <P> "I run into students in bizarre situations all the time," the 89-year-old  Waddingham said recently. "I've had 10,000 students in my classes over 45  years. Some of them are now bald-headed."  </P> <P> Waddingham's teaching career began in 1922 and lasted so long that she now has  former students who are teachers and have former students of their own.  </P> <P> Waddingham retired in 1967 but in a sense she has never given up teaching.  Today, she is the city's unofficial historian with a schedule busier than many  who are generations younger. As one longtime friend and admirer, Brenda  Conyers, put it, "She does more before breakfast than the rest of us do all day  long."  </P> <P> An early riser, Waddingham fills her days with meetings for the Historical  Society of Centinela Valley, Inglewood's 100-year-old First Presbyterian Church  and the never-ending stream of city advisory committees that inevitably add  Waddingham's name to the list of members.  </P> <P> "We need 100 more Gladyses," Inglewood Councilman Jose Fernandez said,  extolling her commitment to the city.  </P> <P> Her home has a wall full of plaques that she and her late husband, Francis, who  was also active in community organizations, received over the years.  Politicians love to invoke her name in speeches, and during election time they  vie for publicity photographs with Waddingham. When local officials can't  answer an arcane question about the city's past, they refer the questioner to  Waddingham.  </P> <P> A man from Michigan called her recently to find out where an electronics school  that once operated in Inglewood had relocated. She got another call from an  Oregon man trying to track down anyone who had known his mother, a city  resident in the late 1950s.  </P> <P> "She's the grande dame of the Centinela Valley," said the Rev. Daniel H.  Newhall, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church for the last 25 years.  </P> <P> Keeping the past alive for future generations is Waddingham's obsession.  </P> <P> She wrote a 95-year history of the First Presbyterian Church in 1985 and  updated it last year to honor the church's centennial celebration. She spends  much of her time sorting through boxes of slides and other artifacts and  shipping them to universities and historical societies.  </P> <P> "I have to do it now because it would be a shame if all of it went to waste,"  she said.  </P> <P> Born on a farm near Scottville, Mich., in 1900, Waddingham lived with her  family in Oregon and San Diego before moving to Los Angeles to attend  Occidental College in 1916. She graduated four years later as the class  valedictorian and immediately began teaching Spanish in a 44-student high  school in Las Vegas. Two years later, she took an $1,800-a-year job in  Inglewood.  </P> <P> As the city has been transformed from an agricultural community to a Los  Angeles suburb and from an all-white enclave to a predominantly minority city,  Waddingham has worked to keep Inglewood aware of its historical roots.  </P> <P> In the 1970s, when residents proposed renaming Monroe Junior High School after  Martin Luther King Jr., she wrote biographies of Judge Albert Monroe and 12  other city fathers to explain their accomplishments to current residents.  </P> <P> "I'm against renaming the schools," she said recently. "But I can understand  new people moving in and not knowing about the city's past."  </P> <P> The school board later decided not to rename Monroe or any of the other schools  named after Inglewood's founders, many of whom were Waddingham's  contemporaries.  </P> <P> Although many of Waddingham's friends have moved away, she has become an  Inglewood booster. One of her longtime crusades has been recruiting younger  members to the historical society. Another is letting outsiders know that  Inglewood has a rich history that is continuing every day.  </P> <P> "Not everything is wonderful about Inglewood," Waddingham said, "but everything  is not wonderful in any town."  </P> <P> She has a longtime friend who used to live in Inglewood who proves her point.  </P> <P> "She will not come over here because she thinks it's dangerous," Waddingham  said with a hint of annoyance in her voice. "But she's had troubles with kids  breaking the (lights) in her apartment house. The neighborhood kids around here  don't bother me at all."  </P></p>

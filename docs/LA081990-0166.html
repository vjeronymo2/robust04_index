			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF SECONDARY TO SON'S HEALTH FOR NICKLAUS  </P> <P> If Jack Nicklaus seemed distracted during the International tournament, he had  good reason.  </P> <P> His son Gary is hospitalized at Swedish Medical Center in suburban Denver for  treatment of a virus of the heart that left him in a semi-coma Thursday.  </P> <P> Gary Nicklaus, 21, was in good condition Saturday night, according to a nursing  supervisor. He was expected to be released as soon as tonight.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus failed to qualify for today's final round of the International.  He acknowledged that after his third round on Saturday, leaving the tournament  was not uppermost in his mind.  </P> <P> "I'm more concerned about my son," Nicklaus said. "At first they thought he had  suffered a heart attack."  </P> <P> Gary Nicklaus was stricken Wednesday and was confined briefly to the hospital's  intensive care unit. His mother, Barbara, has been with him.  </P> <P> The younger Nicklaus had been expected to compete in the U.S. Amateur, which  begins Tuesday at nearby Cherry Hills Country Club.  </P></p>

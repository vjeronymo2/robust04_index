The  committee will discuss various areas of future cooperation  between Jordan and the Palestinians following the security  agreement on self-rule that the PLO signed with Israel last  Wednesday [9 February].    The committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id  al-Tall  and the head of the PLO's Political Department Faruq Qaddumi, is  discussing cooperation in the areas of economy, security, and  issues tackled by the multilateral Middle East peace talks.    Mr. Qaddumi told reporters on arrival in Amman last night  that the committee would debate a wide range of issues which  would later be referred to specialized subcommittees which would  meet regularly. He accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  of reneging on the peace accord by repeatedly stating that dates  were not sacred. Mr. Qaddumi called for closer strategy  coordination between Jordan and the PLO.</p>

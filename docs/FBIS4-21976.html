			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone Interview with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the </F> Political Bureau of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, "who  is residing in Damascus," by Samaih al-Ma'ayitah]    [Text] Al-Ma'ayitah: What has prompted the  Zionist leadership to launch these threats against Jordan and  Hamas?    Abu-Marzuq: It is the Movement's basic and strong  presence among the Palestinian people. The Movement's cadres  and organizations are in the occupied territories. The presence  outside these territories is natural, be it in the form of  supporters, spokesmen, or official spokesmen in the Movement's  name. It has political and information presence in most states  of the region. However, as a result of his failure to suppress  or confront the Movement or stop its armed operations, Rabin  tried to hold external sides responsible for these actions so  that the Israelis would not have great room for criticizing his  policies and exposing his shortcomings and his inability to  provide peace and security for them.    This is not the first time that Rabin has shifted the  responsibility for his policies on to outside parties. When the  soldier Toledano was kidnapped, Israel accused the United States  of sponsoring Hamas leaders and accused Syria of sponsoring the  Movement. Now it is directing these false accusations against  Jordan. I must express my astonishment because the U.S.  Administration supports these allegations and accusations while  knowing that they are incorrect. The United States responded to  Israeli's accusations in early 1993 denying the presence of any  Hamas leaders on its territory and proved that the Movement's  military operations are planned and executed inside Palestine.  Here we must emphasize the following:    1. The Hamas Movement has confined its battle in Palestine  as an occupied territory and we have the right to resist with  all means available to us. The Movement has been committed to  this.    2. Rabin's accusations reveal the enemy's inability to  confront Hamas and its attempt to instigate our brothers against  it.    3. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions have always  announced their responsibility for their operations inside  Palestine by various means, such as leaving a leaflet at the  site of the battle, announcing the operation by graffiti or  through a loudspeaker, contacting news agencies, or distributing  leaflets bearing the signature of the battalions. As for  statements by its representatives abroad, they are merely  comments and affirmations of the Movement's methods. This also  happened after the recent operation.    Al-Ma'ayitah: What is happening demonstrates the  state of confusion in the Zionist enemy leadership. They cannot  find a place or a Hamas group to retaliate against as they do in  Lebanon against the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance. It is  also a continuation of the series of pressures against Jordan to  compel it to sign a separate peace agreement.    Abu-Marzuq: Israel does not know where to strike  at Hamas within its policy of deterrence. The Hamas Movement  and military apparatus are in Palestine. They directed several  blows at it in 1989, in late 1990, and in 1993 and were unable  to limit the Movement's military activities. This created a  crisis in the Zionist entity and this prompted it to choose  Jordan as a means to shift responsibility to it. It is worth  noticing that for the first time, Rabin and his Foreign  Minister, Peres, appeared at press conference at the same time.  Rabin's words were very strong in his capacity as minister of  defense and interior, something which only made his failure  worse. Peres' expressions were calmer because he knows that  these threats are part of the political game.    Al-Ma'ayitah: There are attempts to raise  Jordanian fears concerning the seriousness of Hamas activity in  the Jordanian arena. Some people try to substantiate these  fears by citing the history of Jordan's relationship with PLO  factions. Are these fears likely to materialize with regard to  the Hamas Movement?    Abu-Marzuq: We believe that the security and  stability of any Arab country, particularly Jordan, plays a role  in supporting Palestinian rights. On the other hand,  destabilizing any Arab country will have a negative effect on  the Palestinian cause. We have seen this repeatedly and the  result was that Arab weakness has adversely affected the  Palestine question.    We are aware that Jordan is facing difficult circumstances  and many pressures which we understand. We also assert that  Jordan's position on the reckless Zionist threats was  distinguished and deserves thanking.    We, from a position of responsibility, will not give our  enemy an excuse to fish in troubled water and will adopt  appropriate measures and steps in this connection to safeguard  Jordan's security and stability.    We do not carry out military action from outside. As for the  statements that talk about the five revenge operations, they  were contained in statements issued by the ['Izz-al-Din]  al-Qassam Battalions in Palestine. Other statements only  reiterated this.    We think that there are no grounds whatsoever for these  fears  because we are concerned about Jordanian cohesion and the  security and stability of this country.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Do you feel that Jordan understands  this position?    Abu-Marzuq: The Jordanian Government is certain  that the credibility of the Hamas movement is high and it has  never felt anything that contravenes this policy. It knows for  sure that the official spokesman or the Movement's  representative in Jordan have no connection with any action  inside Palestine. They know, and everybody else knows, that the  Movement and its military presence as a whole are inside  Palestine. Therefore, Jordan is in a strong position to reject  these threats because it stems from its sincere stand and actual  practice. Therefore, I think that the Jordanian Government  understands the Movement's position.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Is the Movement going to adopt any  measures in light of the Zionists' threats Zionists to Jordan?    Abu-Marzuq: Basically, we will not allow any  justifications for the enemy to fish in troubled water. This is  in addition to some measures that have to do with the Movement  itself, which we are going to take into consideration in the  future, God willing, so as not to embarrass Jordan in these  difficult circumstances.    Al-Ma'ayitah: How do you view Jordan's position  on the recent threats?    Abu-Marzuq: I think that Jordan's reply to  Israeli threats was strong and characterized by frankness and  objectivity. The Movement had no official offices to begin  with. The government officially deals with the PLO. Jordan has  not dealt with us as representatives of the Palestinian people,  and we have not claimed to be so. We represent part of the  Palestinian people, but we do not recognize PLO representation  of all the Palestinian people. Jordan's position was open and  objective and it reflects actual reality.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Given the international, Arab, and  Palestinian situation, it seems that Hamas is approaching a  fierce war with the Zionist enemy and its allies, particularly  in the PLO leadership. It stands alone in confronting the  Zionist enemy militarily at a time when the rest of the 10  factions opposing the current settlement process are  unjustifiably absent. The question is how will Hamas confront  this fierce war?    Abu-Marzuq: We realize that since the first  setback [the 1948 Arab-Israeli war], the Palestinian people have  been facing successive plots and making large sacrifices. The  Hamas Movement is part of these people and derives its strength  -- after depending on Almighty God -- from the people's resolve  to continue their jihad until they attain their hopes and  aspirations and regain their land. We are aware of the  seriousness of the next stage and it is the same seriousness the  Palestinian people faced at various historical stages in  Palestine and elsewhere.    What is new in this regard is that part of the Palestinian  people chose another path for reasons with which we differ.  These differences, however, will not affect the Palestinian  people's resistance of occupation. I believe that the current  attempts to resolve the conflict will not be successful because  they neither deal with the crux of the issue nor remove the  causes of the conflict. This means the conflict will continue.  We will not transfer the conflict to the Palestinian arena and  will continue to deal with this conflict as sons of the  Palestinian people regardless of differences in opinion. We  hope they will deal with the Palestinian arena in the same way.  The Movement will continue its jihad. We, like them, are  suffering from oppression and imprisonment and we will continue  to make sacrifices and pay the price of freedom.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Following the implementation of the  full or partial autonomy, two facts will emerge: Resistance of  occupation, which will be pursued by Hamas, and the autonomy  institutions and the Palestinian people's living aspects. How  will Hamas coexist with these institutions and the living and  servicing aspects?    Abu-Marzuq: We are part of the Palestinian people  and cannot ignore their interests and causes, which we will  continue to defend. We will also continue to be an active  element in all areas of life, including education, economy, and  services, whether inside or outside the framework of autonomy.    As for the political issue, that is, the administrative  autonomy and normalization, we will certainly not deal with them  positively. We will not participate in building the institutions  that do not serve the Palestinian people unless these  institutions go beyond the designated framework and begin to  express the Palestinian people's ambitions. The Movement can  then live up to the stage and serve the Palestinian people  through the same framework. We will then not create many  difficulties for those administrations and will be careful to  direct our efforts toward fighting the enemy.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Even if the autonomy institutions  dealt with Hamas as an illegal and outlawed organization?    Abu-Marzuq: I think it is difficult for the  autonomy institutions to do so. We are part of the Palestinian  people, not a simple part which can be chased. Consequently, it  will be difficult for them to take such a step and I do not  think they will make such a reckless decision.    Al-Ma'ayitah: The Political Bureau of Hamas issued  a political statement in which a paragraph reads: "Any peace in  the region must be based on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied  territories and holding free elections in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip to elect representatives of the Palestinian people who  will decide the next steps and the future of the [Palestine]  question." Does this mean that developing the present formula of  the settlement will win the approval of the Hamas Movement?    Abu-Marzuq: As a resistance movement, we think  that if the enemy government wants to end the ordeal it is  experiencing, then this cannot take place by imposing surrender  on the Palestinian people. What we are saying is that there  could be a peace treaty or a truce in order to rescue the region  from its complex situation and end this crisis.    The resolutions of international legitimacy have considered  the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem occupied  territories owned by the Palestinian people who live on these  territories. If they want the resistance to stop this very  minute, then what is required:    1. The withdrawal of the Zionist forces from the West Bank,  the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem.    2. The dismantling of the settlements.    3. Compensation for the losses and victims as a result of  the  occupation.    4. Holding free elections so that the Palestinian people  will  elect a leadership that will express the aspirations of the  Palestinian people and the future of the conflict. If the  Movement gets elected, then it has its own clear stand toward  the conflict. However, if it wins a minority of votes, then it  will express its views freely and we will respect the opinion of  the elected majority.    What we are offering is a way out of the current  predicament.  The PLO is negotiating with the Zionist enemy on foundations  which we do not think are correct. The party that has a right  to present views regarding the future of the conflict must be an  elected leadership that represents the Palestinian people.    We do not mind seeing the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and  Jerusalem under the supervision of international troops,  Palestinian police, or the Arab administrations which had  previous control over these territories or of which these  territories were a part before the 1967 aggression.    Al-Ma'ayitah: Is this a political initiative?    Abu-Marzuq: You can call it this way if you like.  You can also say this is the Movement's vision to end the  predicament, if you like.    Al-Ma'ayitah: "The killing of civilians" is  rejected internationally. Why did Hamas do this in the 'Afula  and Hadera operations?    Abu-Marzuq: Over the past years, the al-Qassam  Battalions have been committed to their right to resisting the  occupation troops and the settler militias, and they have never  violated this rule. However, the occupation troops have been  killing our children, women, and old men. Also, the occupation  troops do not stop the inhuman practices of the settlers, whose  peak was the killing of dozens of people at the Ibrahimi Mosque.  This crime was not enough for them. A series of other crimes  followed in the same city, and curfew was imposed on the victim.  The occupation troops also let the criminal wolves free in the  land and gave them a free hand to kill the sons of our people,  to the extent that they did not spare a woman in her third month  of pregnancy and the baby which she was trying to protect. This  is in addition to shooting schoolchildren in Bethlehem, injuring  nine of them.    All of this has prompted the Battalions to treat the enemy  the same way, and this is approved by international law and  divine law until the troops and settlers stop killing the  unarmed sons of our people. Then, the Battalions will go back  to their policy of resisting the occupation.</p>

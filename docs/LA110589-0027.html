			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET: BLAME PENSION FUNDS FOR STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY  </P> <P> If small investors want to end the stock market volatility that's being caused  by program trading, they may have to stop complaining to their congressmen and  stockbrokers and, instead, send angry letters to the guys who watch over their  own pension money.  </P> <P> Lost in the recent swell of anger over computerized program trading is the fact  that without institutional investors (like insurance companies) and pension  funds (like those that take care of the retirement money of millions of  Americans), program trading would just disappear.  </P> <P> "The little guy should understand that he is directly involved in program  trading," says Jeffrey Tabak, a managing partner of Miller, Tabak &amp; Hirsch  -- one of the first firms to use program trading in the early 1980s. Tabak does  not, however, use the most despised type of program trading -- index arbitrage  -- for its own money.  </P> <P> A number of brokerages during the past week have joined Miller Tabak in no  longer taking part in what is called "proprietary index arbitrage." That means  these brokerages will not let their own money flow back and forth between the  stock market and the stock index futures markets in order to profit from the  small discrepancies between the two.  </P> <P> That's good for a start. But it really won't make the market entirely stable --  not until institutional investors and pension funds also forsake index  arbitrage.  </P> <P> It is difficult to determine just how much of this dastardly index arbitrage is  done by pension funds and other clients of brokerage firms. In September, the  New York Stock Exchange reported that an average of 20.9 million shares of its  total volume each day was connected with all sorts of program trading.  </P> <P> About half of that amount -- or 10.45 million shares -- was computerized index  arbitrage. And of the 10.45 million shares being index arbitraged, sources  estimate that about two-thirds involve brokerages' own money.  </P> <P> That would mean that pension funds and other "regular" people are trading more  than 3 million shares of stock a day in the hated index arbitrage programs.  </P> <P> While a two-thirds decline in the amount of index arbitrage trading will be a  welcome relief for the beleaguered stock market, it doesn't mean that  everything will be back to normal. In fact, if the institutions and pension  funds try to trade their 3-million-share daily dose of index arbitraged stock  all at once, the market could still easily come unglued.  </P> <P> This past week, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton announced  that they would stop doing index arbitrage for their clients. Only one other  firm -- Paine Webber Group -- has gone that far.  </P> <P> The rest of Wall Street's brokerages have taken the easy way out so far by  forbidding their own money to be used for index arbitrage purposes.  </P> <P> In taking action, Merrill Lynch said the public sees index arbitrage as a  contributing factor to excess volatility in the stock market. So it will stop  using the practice -- even for clients -- "until we are satisfied that  effective controls are in place."  </P> <P> Experts say one needed control is a "circuit breaker" that stops trading on the  stock market and the stock index markets simultaneously. The New York Stock  Exchange said it is looking into the matter. Right now, the stock index circuit  breaker is tripped four times sooner than the circuit breaker that affects  stocks.  </P> <P> And that just leads to panic on Wall Street.  </P> <P> You didn't have to listen too carefully to the Wall Street grapevine these past  few weeks to hear the rumor that Pennzoil Co. was accumulating shares of  Chevron Corp. The rumor may or may not turn out to be true.  </P> <P> But what's more intriguing than the rumor itself is how this particular gossip  seems to have started.  </P> <P> Corporations and raiders sometimes use what Wall Street refers to as a "beard,"  or intermediary, when they want to quietly buy stock in another company. The  "beard," who is usually some little-known financial adviser in some obscure  hamlet, places his purchase orders for the stock with various Wall Street  firms.  </P> <P> By doing this, the corporation or raider hopes to disguise its purchases so  that Wall Street speculators won't get wind of the fact that the stock is being  accumulated. This helps keep the price of the stock down and generally makes it  a bigger surprise when the company or raider finally decides to pounce.  </P> <P> The use of a beard is perfectly legal -- unlike the "parking" schemes that the  government cracked down on these past few years. When the time comes to make a  filing with the government on the stock purchases, the real owner -- not the  beard -- finally comes forward.  </P> <P> Now back to the origin of the rumor that Pennzoil is getting ready to attack  Chevron.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Pennzoil accumulated a large stake in Burlington Resources  Corp. Traders claim that the accumulation -- which was done very quietly -- was  handled for Pennzoil by a beard named Robert Garrett, who runs a company called  Garrett Associates in Skillman, N.J.  </P> <P> The Chevron rumor reportedly started weeks ago when, traders claim, Garrett  started buying Chevron stock through as many as five different brokerages.  Speculators reasoned that since Garrett, a former head trader for Morgan  Guaranty Trust, had a history of working with Pennzoil, then Pennzoil must be  the one for whom he was buying the Chevron stock.  </P> <P> Wall Street has become pretty convinced that someone has been accumulating  shares of Chevron, and they think that the buyer is Pennzoil. But the truth is  that nobody -- whether they are traders on Wall Street or members of the press  -- really knows what's going on.  </P> <P> All anyone knows is that trading in Chevron's stock has been peculiar.  Chevron's shares are up 50% in value this year, and volume has been  extraordinarily heavy.  </P> <P> The best guess among experts is that Pennzoil is buying Chevron stock because  it believes that this will help postpone a huge tax liability that Pennzoil  could owe to the government. Pennzoil could have to pay an extra $800 million  in taxes on its multibillion-dollar legal victory over Texaco, unless the  billions are spent to acquire oil and natural gas properties before the end of  1991.  </P> <P> Wall Street doesn't think that Chevron could be taken over. That would probably  cost $40 billion, and it would be difficult to pull off the largest acquisition  ever in the current economic environment.  </P> <P> But if nothing else, it's good to know that a big company like Chevron could be  shaken by something going on in a village like Skillman, N.J., population  around 3,600.  </P> <P> The deal to acquire UAL Inc. fell apart largely because Japanese banks didn't  want to loan money to the prospective buyers. While that was a unique  situation, it does raise the interesting question: What would happen if the  Japanese suddenly decided that they not only didn't want to invest in things  like the UAL takeover but also wanted no part of investing in the United  States?  </P> <P> Japanese investors are estimated to hold $80 billion in American securities and  real assets. The United States government has been able to operate with a huge  budget deficit because Japanese investors and other foreigners have been  willing to send their money here for safe-keeping.  </P> <P> The UAL deal could serve as a miniature lesson on just how important Japanese  cooperation is to America's borrowing needs.  </P> <P> "If there were a sudden decline in the Japanese demand for dollar securities,  things would be bad," says Robert Z. Aliber, professor of international  economics and finance at the University of Chicago.  </P> <P> Just how badly does the United States need Japanese investment right now? "If  they pull out, it's going to have a very negative effect," says Peter Rona,  president of IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust, a unit of the Industrial Bank of  Japan.  </P> <P> Without the flow of Japanese investments, interest rates would go up, economic  growth in the United States would decline and our standard of living could drop  sharply. Some things could help alleviate the pain. Americans could save more  and use that extra savings to invest in government bonds. (That's not likely.)  Or the government could cut its budget deficit -- now estimated at $150 billion  a year. (That's always difficult to accomplish.)  </P> <P> Luckily for the United States, Aliber says, Japanese investors aren't likely to  stop sending their money over here because there are few attractive  alternatives. "They are making life easy for us, and we are making life easy  for them. It's mutually advantageous," he says.  </P> <P> Unless, of course, one day the Japanese suddenly decide not to invest any more  in the UAL . . . uh . . . I mean the U.S.A.  </P> <P> New York investor Donald J. Trump last week was trying to raise money for a new  offer for AMR Corp., according to a Wall Street source. The source didn't give  details, but rumors said Trump was trying to put together a $95- to  $100-a-share offer. Trump previously offered $120 a share for the airline  company but then withdrew the bid before he ever raised a nickel. Wall Street  is skeptical that Trump really wants to own AMR . . .  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there are some very believable reports around Wall Street that  investor Carl C. Icahn has been trying to raise the billions necessary to stage  a credible threat to USX Corp. Icahn is said to be displeased with the  restructuring that USX recently announced. Raising financing for a bid would be  one of the only ways that Icahn would be able to convince Wall Street that he's  capable of threatening the steel and energy company . . .  </P> <P> Keep an eye on a "revolutionary" transaction (as several sources called it)  that will soon come out of Gradco Systems Inc. Sources say the Irvine maker of  paper-handling equipment will soon announce that it is going private, using  financing raised in Japan. Gradco has publicly that it is considering becoming  a private company, but the Japanese angle hasn't been disclosed. In essence,  Gradco -- which does a lot of its business in Japan -- could end up changing  from a publicly traded U.S. company to a Japanese one. And it could give other  U.S. companies similar ideas.  </P></p>

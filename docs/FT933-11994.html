			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / People: 'Guru' splits role Shandwick, the international public relations company, has announced that Peter Gummer is splitting the role of chairman and chief executive with effect from next April's agm; with Dermot McNulty, chief operating officer, stepping up into the chief executive's seat. McNulty, 44, spent 15 years with Burson-Marsteller before joining Shandwick in New York in 1989. He moved to the UK the following year, initially as director of international marketing. He says the move means he will be 'responsible for a great number of important but routine things, leaving Gummer, who is accorded 'guru status' in worldwide public relations circles', more time for marketing and business development. Meanwhile, 62-year-old Len Kingshott is joining the board as a non-executive director. He stepped down from his position as deputy chief executive of Lloyds Bank International in 1989; since then he has held a number of positions, including the chairmanship of Rosehaugh, the property group now in receivership. Kingshott had also been lined up to head the European end of BCCI under a planned reconstruction of the group shortly before the Bank of England moved in to shut down the entire operation.</p>

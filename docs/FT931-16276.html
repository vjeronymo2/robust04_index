			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Banks appeal over BCCI THE Association Francaise des Banques, representing France's banks, is appealing against yesterday's ruling by a Paris court that it must pay FFr400,000 (Pounds 46,674) compensation to each of four clients of BCCI, Alice Rawsthorn reports from Paris. The four lost FFr400,000-FFr2.6bn when BCCI collapsed two years ago. The AFB had offered to pay them the standard compensation of FFr105,000.</p>

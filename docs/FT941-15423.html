			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Porter attacks district auditor's findings Dame Shirley Porter, at the centre of this week's row over allegations of gerrymandering at Westminster city council, last night attacked the judgment of the Westminster district auditor and vowed to fight her case to the House of Lords in a bid to clear her name. Speaking to the Financial Times from Palm Springs, California, where she is on holiday, Dame Shirley dismissed as 'ludicrous' the suggestion that Pounds 21.25m had been wasted as a result of Conservative-controlled Westminster's council house sales policy. Dame Shirley, leader of Westminster council until 1991, said she refuted 'everything' in this week's damning report by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, who said in provisional findings that Dame Shirley and nine other people connected with the council might have to repay the money alleged to have been wasted. During a 20-minute telephone conversation, Dame Shirley, in confident mood, said she rejected the methodology on which Mr Magill's report had been based. She had lined up a 'leading firm' of accountants - which she was not prepared to name - to counter the suggestions made in the findings from Mr Magill, who is a leading accountant at Touche Ross. Asked about suggestions that she had disposed of documents pertinent to the inquiry, Dame Shirley said: 'I have not disposed of anything at any time.' She accused Mr Magill of 'making a new law' in his provisional findings. These were seized upon this week by Labour politicians who claimed they demonstrated the weakened moral authority of the Conservative government. Dame Shirley said she had 'complete faith' in the judgment of Mr Jeremy Sullivan, Queen's Counsel who acts for Westminster council and who had assured her and other council officers that the authority's housing policies were legal.

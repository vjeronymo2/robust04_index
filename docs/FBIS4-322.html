			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare April 6 SAPA -- Home Affairs Minister Dumiso  Dabengwa has ruled out door-to-door registering of Zimbabwean  voters, saying the suggestion was not feasible, ZIANA national  news agency reports. Several members of Parliament, including a  senior Zimbabwe Government official, have suggested that the  country should consider door-to-door registering so as to ensure  that all eligible voters register and participate in Zimbabwe's  forthcoming general elections. However, Mr Dabengwa shut the  door on the suggestion saying the exercise would be far too  costly.</p>

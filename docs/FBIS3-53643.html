			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Mikha'el Tuchfeld -- live]    [Text] [Tuchfeld] Mr. Beilin, do the pronouncements heard  at the joint news conference by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad,  in which the latter spoke about normal relations, meet Israel's  expectations?    [Beilin] I think we must wait for a detailed report about  the lengthy meeting held by the two men which we are due to get  either tonight or tomorrow morning. The pronouncements made at  the news conference were important, but they are not what we  would like to hear from President al-Asad himself. Had the  latter said what President Clinton said we would definitely feel  more comfortable. It is important to ascertain whether President  al-Asad's is fully committed. The commitment in principle to  arrive at a comprehensive peace and to work toward normalization  are important, and I would not want to play them down in any  way. The feeling would seem to be that we have taken a step  forward, although we are still far from clarity.    [Tuchfeld] Does the fact that the two presidents issued  separate statements rather than a joint one strengthen what you  say; namely, that we heard the pronouncements from Clinton  rather than from al-Asad?    [Beilin] Maybe. I do not know whether they had planned to  come out with a joint statement, but the fact remains that they  issued separate statements. Of course, both statements  contained positive elements. Some things, which cannot be  dismissed out of hand, were left unsaid. However, as I said  before, we should wait for a full report and regard this news  conference as an element of progress in a long process which may  now be shortened.    [Tuchfeld] Is the opening of a U.S.-Syrian channel of  communications good or detrimental for Israel?    [Beilin] It is not detrimental for Israel. I think it is  part of an overall structure containing a three-way and a  two-way dialogue between us and the Syrians and between the  Syrians and the Americans. I see it as part of overall  progress, and not as something having an adverse effect on us.    [Tuchfeld] But we did not hear even one word on the question  of terror. Syria is considered a terror-supporting country, but  we heard no mention of the subject in the news conference.    [Beilin] I suppose many things were said behind closed doors  and were not repeated at the news conference. We must wait a  few more hours to better understand what happened in the closed  rooms.    [Tuchfeld] Finally, I cannot help asking you about Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's criticism today. He said your remarks  last week about the future of the Golan and that settlements  should not have been established there were thoughtless.    [Beilin] Perhaps you cannot help asking me, but I am  entitled not to answer you.    [Tuchfeld] Mr. Beilin, thank you very much.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japonica Makes Bid for CNW: Paul Kazarian and his Japonica Partners investment  group have stepped up their efforts to acquire CNW Corp., making a formal offer  to acquire the Chicago-based railroad holding company for $721.6 million. The  offer exceeds by more than $213 million the value that Japonica placed on the  company in proxy materials mailed to CNW shareholders. CNW's board will meet  promptly to consider the bid, CNW spokesman Fred Bloedorn said. Japonica asked  the board to respond to its offer by 9 a.m. Monday. In a letter to CNW's board  of directors, Japonica said it would buy all of CNW's stock for $44 a share --  $39.50 in cash and $4.50 in preferred stock if the board would agree to a  merger.  </P></p>

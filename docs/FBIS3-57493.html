			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last week Russia has made known again that it is  ready to be a sole arbitrator in the Karabakh conflict. This  fact was supported by two sequential meetings of Andrey Kozyrev  with his Azerbaijan and Armenian colleagues. There are all  reasons to think that the West has somewhat reduced its peaceful  efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh after President Clinton's visit to  Moscow. The details of talks held in the multi-storey building  on Vosstanie Square remained behind the closed doors.  Unexpected may be considered the participation in the summit of  Arkadiy Gukasyan, the Nagorno-Karabakh foreign relations  minister. He has received the invitation from Kozyrev on his  way back from the former Yugoslavia to Stepanakert via Yerevan.  By the available information, the Azerbaijani foreign minister  Guseynov has remained not completely satisfied with results of  his talks with Kozyrev. As told by TURAN news agency, he  insisted on unconditioned withdrawal of the Armenian troops from  the territory of Azerbaijan, having in mind the Karabakh  territory as well. Galina Sidorova, his assistant, told that  Guseynov expressed discontent with position of the CIS  countries, particularly of Russia, which by his view "does not  demonstrate adherence to principles in connection with Armenian  aggression against Azerbaijan".    TURAN news agency has circulated a report, with reference to  the "well-informed source in the Russian Federation Foreign  Office", in which the tendencies of Yerevan are stated.  According to these statement [as received], Armenia asks Russia  to dispose Russian troops along the Azerbaijani-Iranian border,  which will make Azerbaijan-cut off Iran-be more agreeable. As  refers to the post-war setup in the area of conflict, the same  "informed source" has presented the Armenian model according to  which Azerbaijan must provide a broad political autonomy to  Nagorno-Karabakh, present him Shusha city, and leave inviolable  the humanitarian corridor connecting Karabakh with Armenia. The  author of this project, according to TURAN, is the President  Yeltsin's adviser, the well-known politologist Andranik  Mihranyan. However Yerevan did not confirm the truth of this  news.    In difference to Gasanov, the head of Armenian Foreign  Affairs Department Vahan Papazyan thinks that the Moscow summit  should be considered as a significant step on a way to prepare  the cease-fire agreement. In his interview to NEGA news agency  he has emphasized that it is necessary to resume the talks with  Azerbaijan. Special concern, by his belief, should create the  tendency to internationalize the conflict, since Afghan  mujahedins and mercenaries from the former Soviet republics are  being involved in the conflict, and arms concentration is  increased. Papazyan has emphasized that the balanced approach  of Russia to the conflict settlement is completely acceptable  for Armenia since it agrees to the documents adopted by the CSCE  and approved by the UN Security Council. Russian side intended  to organize the meeting between Gasanov and Papazyan, which  however failed. Meanwhile, the official Yerevan has revealed  restrained attitude to Moscow talks. It would be premature to  bind special hopes with these talks, told SNARK one top official  of the Armenian Foreign Office. The difficulty is, he  explained, to make consistent the opposite positions of Armenia  and Azerbaijan.</p>

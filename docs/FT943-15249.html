			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Bulgaria come from behind to knock out Germany 2-1 Outsiders Bulgaria struck twice within three minutes in the second half to send defending champions Germany crashing out of the World Cup at Giants Stadium in New Jersey yesterday. Goals by Stoichkov and Letchkov ended Germany's reign to put Bulgaria into the semi-finals for the first time. German captain Lothar Matthaus, making a record-equalling 21st appearance in a World Cup finals game - joining his countryman Uwe Seeler, Wladislaw Zmuda of Poland and Argentina's Diego Maradona - fired the Germans ahead from the penalty spot in the 49th minute after strikers Klinsmann and Voller had both been brought down. Bulgaria then seized the initiative and Stoichkov curled in a free kick in the 76th minute to bring the teams level. Three minutes later Letchkov - who had been at fault for the German penalty - scored the winner with a spectacular diving header. Iankov lofted a center from the right and Letchkov dived for it with Hassler, got there first and directed a well-placed header between the diving German goalkeeper Illgner and the right-hand post. Ironically, Hamburg mid-fielder Letchkov, who was 27 yesterday, is the only German-based player in the Bulgarian squad. It was sweet revenge for Bulgarian coach Dimitar Penev, whose team have also beaten the other 1990 finalist, Argentina. Penev played against German coach Berti Vogts in the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, when West Germany beat Bulgaria 5-2. Bulgaria, who last beat then West Germany in 1960 and who had not won a World Cup game in five previous visits to the finals, now meet three-time champions Italy in the semi-finals, also at Giants Stadium, on Wednesday.</p>

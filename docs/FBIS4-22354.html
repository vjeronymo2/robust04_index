			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Serov, deputy chief of Track Service for </F> the Transbaykal Railroad, by V. Pakulin, GUDOK correspondent:  "The Transsiberian Is in Danger: the Mainline's Engineering  Structures and Roadbed Are in Urgent Need of Restoration";  Chita, date not given]    [Text] On 8 October of last year, GUDOK published an  article by P. Lugovoy, head of the Laboratory of the Tynda Frost  Station, "Transsib v ozhidanii rekonstruktsii" [The  Transsiberian Awaits Rebuilding]. With facts and figures in  hand, he convinced the readers that the Transsiberian mainline  was seriously ill and needed radical treatment.    Four months passed, though, and another article on this  subject appeared in the newspaper -- "Transsib ne bolen, on  moguch i zhdet bolshoy raboty" [The Transsib is Not Sick, It Is  Powerful and Awaits a Great Deal of Work], by G. Teterskiy,  lecturer at the Irkutsk Transport Engineers Institute. Its  author states, in particular, that "there is not and cannot be  any question of the life and death of the supermainline. The  Transsiberian is healthy, and possesses unused transport  capacity. It is capable of transporting several times more than  it does now, and ensuring high-speed movement of `East-West'  container trains."    The problem is a major one. Opinion is divided, and I  directed the attention of V. Serov, deputy chief of Track  Service, to this matter. He is the one who well knows the state  of the engineering structures on the mainline.    [Serov] The one-sidedness of the conception of technical  policy on improving the railroad transport process shows through  many publications and articles by scientists and directors of  the MPS [Ministry of Railways] and railroads. Most often it is a  question of the administrative system for transport, the  efficiency of the locomotive and railcar operation, optimization  of operating expenses, the capacity of the permanent way and,  naturally, train traffic safety.    Beyond all these undeniably important problems, however,  they  seem to have forgotten the foundation of the railroad: the  man-made structures and roadbed. Meanwhile, the proportion of  engineering structures in the fixed capital of the roads  constitutes from 17 to 29 percent, depending on the geographical  and other conditions. On the Transbaykal, it is over 26 percent.  The transport process depends directly on the state of this  equipment.    It is like a truism. Most unfortunately, however, the  engineering structures and roadbed, as before, are regarded as  simply part of the track equipment.    Suffice to say that, by some strange coincidence, there is  no  mention of the engineering structures of the track installations  in the "Program for Re-Equipment and Modernization of MPS  Railroads up to the Year 2000."    As for the polemics on the pages of GUDOK, I think that Petr  Nikolayevich Lugovoy probably estimates the situation on the  Transbaykal as one of the most vulnerable sections of the  Transsiberian.    I remind you that physical wear on man-made structures and  the roadbed here was over 60 percent, and the level of defects  and deformations of the engineering structures -- 40 percent.  Repair of the fixed capital is doubly overdue, but this is not  all, the number of objects subjected to varying degrees of  wash-out has reached 892. Of them, 328 must be completely  rebuilt. According to the reliability indicator, train traffic  speeds must be restricted to 5 kilometers an hour on 516  bridges. Another thing: recent calculations of the load capacity  of the reinforced concrete superstructures showed that 167 of  them (on half the road) need to have speed restriction  conditions introduced. This is where our potential failures and  sites of possible accidents lie.    [Pakulin] The figures are impressive, but, after all,  inspection of the engineering structures has not yet been  finally completed. What are the possible results of this?    [Serov] Next year we will finish the inspection of four more  track sections. Even today, though, it is clear that the  predictions are not consoling: the road's engineering structures  are in critical condition and are deteriorating every day.    Rebuilding requires 40-60 "windows," lasting from 6 to 12  hours, every month. This creates tremendous difficulties for  traffic organizers.    In general, repair of the engineering structures must not be  regarded as just a whim of the track workers -- it is in the  interests of the entire road.    [Pakulin] What are the scales of rebuilding which should  increase the reliability of the roads with increased loads? We  know that engineering structures were designed and built at the  turn of the century, practically 100 years ago, and were not at  all calculated for today's heavy trains and speeds....    [Serov] Rebuilding bridges, tunnels, ducts, retaining walls  and the roadbed on our scale and significance is more difficult  than the automatic blocking and electrification programs  mentioned, which we carried out in previous decades. These  programs, however, swallowed up tremendous funds, pulled away  from rebuilding, and in some cases, urgent work to maintain  man-made structures in at least working condition.    Built back in tsarist days, they are completely obsolete. We  must now recognize the priority significance of rebuilding  bridges, ducts and the roadbed in the next 10-15 years.    Noting the serious situation of the industry and the results  of the inspections, we determined the concept of rebuilding the  Transbaykal. We must concentrate our main efforts on the Mogocha  and Skovorodino divisions. The situation is very strained there.  The Chita division also needs more attention and will be  completely worked over, as well.    The approach to action on the Borzya Division is different.  Considering the increase in freight turnover with the  development of foreign economic relations, it is likely that  accelerated work will have to be done there on some lines,  sections and facilities which impose a restriction on the  throughput capacity, and the state of which is simply the limit.  The special feature of this division is that the Manchurian  branch line has only one rail. There are studies on second  tracks, but so far no funds. This problem must be solved,  however, before the contractors leave.    The "maneuvers" here, in my opinion, can be like this: at  first, in parallel with the rebuilding of existing structures --  construction of new engineering structures, and at the second  stage -- laying the tracks. The Mogocha Division, however, is  unquestionably in first place with respect to difficulty and  importance.    [Pakulin] Even the general picture of the state of the  man-made structures and the prospects for rebuilding which you  have outlined give an idea of what major resources will have to  be concentrated on the road....    [Serov] We cannot manage this, of course, with our own  subdivisions. Just imagine, a total of 480 people are engaged in  the maintenance and repair of the engineering structures on the  road. This is on the total 3,640 kilometer length of the main  route. A special team is required for planned-preventive repair.    Nor is there any help from the brigades involved in  maintaining the permanent way -- they got out of routine  maintenance of the roadbed and other engineering structures.  Worse than that, in capital repair, the track machine stations  are intensifying the already serious situation of the bridges  and the roadbed. Why? Well because they are ignoring the  planning and technological norms, rules and instructions, and no  one bears the responsibility for this.    [Pakulin] Nevertheless, the rates of repairing the  structures  are increasing: in 1992, as compared with 1968, they succeeded  in increasing the work volume by a factor of six. At the expense  of what?    [Serov] The subdivisions of the Transstroy Corporation  (former Ministry of Transport Construction), with which we  continue to cooperate, have contributed to this. Last year, 16  construction organizations worked on the Transbaykal, and of  them, 12 had been brought in.    [Pakulin] Last year, however, the plan was scarcely  40-percent fulfilled. Of course, the unsatisfactory financing  made it impossible for the road to do a great deal of what had  been outlined. It seemed that the forces concentrated on capital  repair of the engineering structures were solid. But without  settling with the contractors for doing the work, and without  issuing them an advance to acquire material resources, it is  hard to count on having normal work continue.    [Serov] I do not agree with the assertion, that the reason  for the cut in the rates of rebuilding lies in the road's  insolvency. I know the situation, and not by hearsay, and I note  that they had money. It could have been redistributed. But  priority was given to the permanent way, because of which the  complex of work on planned preventive repair was considerably  overfulfilled. The Transbaykal Railroad is now "at the top of  the list" for the road network with respect to the reliability  level of the permanent way.    I could be happy for my colleagues if the foundation of the  railroad --the engineering structures -- had not suffered  because of the shortage of funds. The plants of the construction  industry, having supplied the bridge structures, broke off  relations with us because of non-payment. We owed the builders,  the designers and the scientific institutes 11 billion rubles  [R], counting loans, fines and indexing. The situation has  become so exacerbated that some of the subdivisions, recruited  for the road with such difficulty, are refusing to cooperate  with us. Having lost the reputation of a solid partner, we may  be deprived of them, and this will cost us dearly.    [Pakulin] What do you see as the way out of the situation  that has been created?    [Serov] First and foremost, in purposeful dividing up of  funds and changing priorities in favor of engineering  structures, and on the other hand, the need to reorganize the  administrative structure of the engineering structures has  become urgent. This was the topic five years ago at the road's  technical-economic council. No positive decision was reached at  that time, though.    What do I have in mind? Our capital repair, having exceeded  all the parameters, grew into rebuilding. The unusual nature of  the situation lies above all in the fact that to carry it out we  were forced "under the wheels." This is very difficult: there  are no analogies in practical work, so far no normative  documents, technological decisions or experience in organizing  traffic in this sort of development. We cannot do without a  change in administrative structure here.    Or take our department. There are six specialists in it.  This  is enough under normal conditions for our operations. But we not  only have to form our own ideas (operational, technical,  construction), we have to embody them: plan the operations work,  keep track of the planning and financing, coordinate the actions  of the executors, accept what has been done.... In short,  perform the functions of the capital construction department. As  you can see, this situation is far from a standard one. We  discussed it at a council on complete rebuilding of the  engineering structures, and came to the conclusion that we could  not manage without creating a special board of directors, which  would deal fully with operations and rebuilding.    [Pakulin] Nevertheless, without waiting for the board of  directors to be set up, you are already dealing with the  rebuilding yourself, and everything involved in it?    [Serov] It would, of course, have been stupid, in the  extraordinary situation which had formed, to wait for a special  signal for large-scale operations to begin. Procrastination is  fraught with many unpleasant things, and the main one -- we are  risking human lives. The opinion that one should wait for a more  tolerable economic and financial situation, and should amass  material resources is an erroneous opinion. The road's condition  no longer requires just therapeutic treatment, it needs surgical  intervention.    As I have been saying, the rebuilding of engineering  structures and the roadbed -- priority work, let us call it --  is estimated at 10-15 years. By the end of this period, the  second stage of rebuilding -- structures built in the 1930's --  will also "be done." We are also faced with fairly large  expenses: we need new technology, new base settlements and new  resources. We are already taking this into consideration, and in  rebuilding one of the tracks, we are doing some preventive work,  if not complete repair, on the adjacent track. Moreover, the  situation will in general become catastrophic, if we break off  at stage one. It would not appear difficult to understand one  simple thing: by increasing expenditures for capital repair, we  will many times reduce operating expenses, through increased  reliability.    [Pakulin] Just what will it take to develop work in  accordance with the complete rebuilding program?    [Serov] It will take R55-60 billion a year at today's prices  in the next decade. But we cannot leave operations, rebuilding  and all the construction unaccompanied by science. There is  nothing to dream of unless we develop a construction industry  based on full-scale work.    Furthermore, our subdivisions need re-equipping. The  mechanization level of our routine maintenance and capital  repair of engineering structures is not over 20 percent. For  comparison: routine maintenance of the permanent way is 46.7  percent mechanized, and capital repair, using PMS [track machine  station] resources -- 87 percent. An inadmissible disproportion  has formed in the economy of one service. Unless we equip the  brigades of bridge workers and roadbed workers (including the  subdivisions called in) with modern technical devices, we are  faced with failing to achieve the task.    All this also requires expenditures. We calculated that we  will need R1 trillion in the first ten years.    The last thing. There will be no rebuilding "under the  wheels" unless, in organizing and confirming the train traffic  schedule in the MPS, the technical condition of the engineering  structures, the need for "windows" and single-track temporary  rails, and the need to grant a special "window" day for the most  labor-intensive repair work are taken into consideration.    In general, I feel that rebuilding the engineering  structures  and track installations must be given the status of a target  program on the state level.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bavaria plans large share sell-off THE Bavarian government hopes to raise between DM2bn and DM3bn (Dollars 1.25bn-Dollars 1.9bn) through the privatisation of its shareholdings in several German companies, Mr Edmund Stoiber, the state premier, said yesterday. Its biggest stake is a 58 per cent holding in Bayernwerk, the largest southern German energy utility, which would be merged with Viag, the Bonn-based industrial conglomerate. Negotiations with Viag are under way, and Mr Stoiber said he confidently expected the new company to move its headquarters to Munich as part of the deal. 'I believe they are ready to move and create a big new undertaking with its headquarters in Munich,' he said. At the same time, the Bavarian government is planning an early sale of its 8 per cent stake in Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler-Benz aerospace subsidiary, for an estimated DM400m. The proposed sell-offs mark the first significant move among the German Lander to break supportive links forged during the post-war economic recovery with vital infrastructural and new, job-creating industries. The federal government is committed to cashing in most of its remaining holdings, including a 51 per cent stake in the Lufthansa airline, which is being restructured and restored to profit. Recent interest in privatisation has been spurred primarily by the urgent need, stressed by the Bundesbank, for the reduction of federal and state deficits. Central bank officials have lately suggested that the budget consolidation process could be helped by sell-offs. Activity has been encouraged by statements from national leaders of the Social Democratic party (SPD) that there are no longer any ideological objections to the sale of public assets. However, acceptance at Land level, where the SPD controls most of the regional governments in western Germany, has yet to be tested. There is a growing acceptance among public sector shareholders that the attractions of Germany to foreign shareholders could be enhanced if all traces of political involvement in private sector business were removed. Many of Germany's leading companies have regional politicians on their supervisory boards by virtue of extensive state holdings. The Lower Saxony government, for example, owns 20 per cent of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest volume car maker. North Rhine Westphalia controls the Westdeutsche Landesbank, which in turn has significant stakes in local and international businesses. Bavaria's decision to offload the holding in Dasa is likely to enhance the attractions of Daimler-Benz shares when they are listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. The state's withdrawal from Bayernwerk in a phased process (its 58 per cent holding will be reduced to 50.1 per cent in the first stage) would suit the ambitions of Viag to consolidate its position and expand further in the highly profitable power business. Viag owns 39 per cent of the utility, which, in turn, has a 24.9 per cent stake in the conglomerate. Viag is known to have been pressing for a restructuring. The conditions for absorbing Bayernwerk into a privately-controlled concern were better than before, Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, Viag chairman, told shareholders yesterday. Mr Georg von Waldenfels, the Bavarian finance minister, said the government might retain a stake of up to 40 per cent in the new business, a complete withdrawal was being considered in the medium term. Mr Stoiber, who took over as Bavarian premier only last month, said that the privatisation process was not intended to finance the Bavarian state budget, but rather to provide long-term investment funds to attract and promote more high-technology investment in the state. Apart from Bayernwerk and Dasa, Bavaria has a stake in Rhein-Main-Donau, the company operating the canal linking Germany's two main rivers with the Danube, and in Bayerische Wasserkraftwerke, a hydroelectric generating business. Mr von Waldenfels said the government aimed for a quick sale of both holdings. However, there were no plans to withdraw from the Bayerische Vereinsbank, one of the top five banks in the country, and traditional links with the Hofbrauhaus brewery would remain, Mr von Waldenfels said.</p>

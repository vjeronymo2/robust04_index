			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Thyssen Industrie divisions see return to black in next two years THYSSEN Industrie, the capital goods division of Thyssen, hopes to bring all of its divisions back into the black in the next two years, according to Mr Eckhard Rohkamm, management board chairman, Reuter reports from Essen. Mr Rohkamm said that if all divisions were able to remain profitable under difficult economic conditions, the company would be able to boost lift its sales to earnings ratio. 'Thyssen Industrie as a whole is still profitable and will remain so to the end of the year. But unfortunately we have some areas that are making losses,' Mr Rohkamm said. He declined to say which companies would post a loss in the current year but said automotive supply and engineering were hit hardest by the slump in car and steel industries. 'When a big customer such as the car industry and a second large customer such as the steel industry are having massive problems . . . then, of course, areas that are dependent on steel and cars are massively affected,' he said. He said there were no signs yet of a recovery of group plant and equipment orders. Orders on hand were about DM9bn (Dollars 5.6bn) but group incoming orders would be down 10 per cent from DM8.4bn a year earlier. Thyssen Machinenbau, the engineering division, was up to 90 per cent dependent on orders from the car industry, he said. The automotive industry accounted for 28 per cent of Thyssen Industrie's total sales. While continental European carmakers were gripped by recession, Thyssen Industrie operations in the US and UK had benefited from rising car sales. Tallent Engineering, its UK unit, was working at high capacity and showing a very satisfactory development, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States can transport uranium from the  nuclear arms plants of the former Soviet Union across Finland.  The Council of State has granted a lower responsibility in the  event of accidents with regard to the transportation of  low-level uranium. The decision was made because of plans by a  U.S. company to import diluted uranium extracted from nuclear  arms to the United States to be used as fuel in nuclear power  plants.    The uranium is transported by cargo ships, which can now  visit Finnish harbors to collect cargo.</p>

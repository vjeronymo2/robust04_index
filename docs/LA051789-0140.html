			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ACCUSED WIFE KILLER DENIED BAIL  </P> <P> A judge today ordered David Schoenecker held without bail on charges that he  killed his wife. Schoenecker, 48, wrote a newspaper columnist about the crime,  then fled California. It was Schoenecker's first court appearance in Orange  County after his capture by a posse in rugged mountains near Superior, Mont.,  last week. The defendant did not object to his extradition to face charges in  California.  </P> <P> Schoenecker, an engineer, allegedly prepared a list of 54 relatives and  acquaintances he planned to "punish," and many of those named were under police  protection until his arrest.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Kazuharu Makino in Fullerton canceled the $500,000 bond  that had been set by a Montana judge and ordered Schoenecker held until a May  31 arraignment.  </P></p>

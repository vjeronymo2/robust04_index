			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CUT, UNCUT: If a federal budget isn't agreed upon by Oct. 1, the FAA plans to  furlough air traffic controllers and cancel thousands of flights a day at 40  major airports. John Wayne was on that list until Thursday, but the FAA decided  it could handle normal traffic there, even with furloughs. . . . Look for big  cuts at LAX, however. If furloughs are ordered, controllers could handle only  57% of peak-hours traffic. Cathy Curtis and Bob Schwartz  </P></p>

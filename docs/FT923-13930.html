			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US primed for fresh trade war salvo WITH THE latest failure of the European Community and the US to resolve their differences over farm trade in Munich, Washington farm groups and legislators are now focusing on a provision in the US farm law that could allocate millions more dollars for American food export subsidies.

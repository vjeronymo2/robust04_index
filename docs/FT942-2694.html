			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (14): Group C - Spain Spain are football's great under-achievers. Their club sides continue to match the Germans and Italians for success in the European cups but the national team does not. Their best World Cup finish was fourth in 1950. They have qualified for the last three World Cups, but the pattern is always the same. They come through the first round fairly comfortably but then go quietly. The problem is no doubt partly psychological and this team does not seem to possess the talent to break that cycle. World class players such as Emilio Butrage 1/16 o, Michel and Martin Vazquez have gone and been replaced by lesser players. Only Julen Guerrero (Athletic Bilbao), just 20, offers flair. The rest of the team is made up of disciplined, industrious, hardened professionals. The frequently outrageous coach Javier Clemente is likely to provide more entertainment than his team. The make-up of the group should allow Spain to reach the next round as usual, but they are unlikely to progress further.</p>

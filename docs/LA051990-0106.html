			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PIC 'N' SAVE, FIGHTING TAKEOVER, PUTS ITSELF ON BLOCK;  </P> <P> RETAILING: SKEPTICAL ANALYSTS SAY THE EFFORT APPEARS HALF-HEARTED AND MAY BE  JUST AN EFFORT TO PERSUADE SHAREHOLDERS THAT IT IS MOVING TO BOOST THE STOCK  PRICE.  </P> <P> Pic 'N' Save officials, trying to blunt a persistent takeover threat, on Friday  launched what some analysts called a half-hearted effort to sell the company.  </P> <P> The close-out retail chain said it asked its investment bankers to contact  prospective buyers. At the same time, Pic 'N' Save maintained that few buyers  would be able to pay a fair price for the company because takeover financing  for retail chains has dried up.  </P> <P> Pic 'N' Save also said it would open its confidential financial records to  bidders only if they agree to a long list of restrictions.  </P> <P> Analysts said that, rather than really trying to find a buyer, company  officials seem more interested in persuading shareholders that they are trying  their best to strengthen Pic 'N' Save's stock price.  </P> <P> "They want to maintain control of the company, and this is the way to do it,"  said Marcy Koory, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian in Omaha,  Neb.  </P> <P> Koory said it appears that Girard Partners, an investment group led by La Jolla  financier David H. Batchelder, is gaining in its effort to unseat Pic 'N'  Save's board. Girard is seeking consent from shareholders to form a new  five-member Pic 'N' Save board dominated by Batchelder and his partners. The  group says it would buy Pic 'N' Save itself or auction it off to another  bidder.  </P> <P> Girard has disclosed acquiring 6.7% of Pic 'N' Save's stock, and on Monday the  investment group said that it won the support of a key ally, Bill M. Thomas. A  former executive vice president of Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save, Thomas is  believed to be its biggest individual shareholder, with 4% of its stock.  </P> <P> Batchelder declined to comment Friday.  </P> <P> Lewis B. Merrifield III, chairman and chief executive of Pic 'N' Save, promised  that the company would make "an aggressive" effort to find a buyer. But he  asserted in an interview that there is little prospect that Girard or another  buyout specialist could come up with the financing to pay a fair price.  </P> <P> Rather, he said, the best prospect to acquire Pic 'N' Save at an attractive  price would be a financially strong "strategic" buyer such as another big  retail chain or a firm in a related line of business.  </P> <P> Merrifield said that since Girard announced its initial investment in Pic 'N'  Save on April 11, "we have not received to date a single expression of interest  from any other party" about a buyout.  </P> <P> He said the restrictions on access to the company's confidential data are  intended to avoid opening bidding "to speculators who would buy (Pic 'N' Save  shares) at the cheapest possible price."  </P> <P> "Girard Partners' objective," he said, "is not to pay a full and fair price."  </P> <P> Among other things, Pic 'N' Save would require anyone who reviews its records  to avoid acquiring any more of the company's stock for three years unless it  does so with an all-cash offer or the consent of its outside directors.  Investors also would be barred from waging a proxy fight for the company.  </P> <P> "They're trying to put a roadblock up for Girard Partners," said Sarah Stack,  an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But an analyst for one of the company's biggest institutional investors called  Friday's announcement a "positive step." It signals that management "is aware"  of the disenchantment among many shareholders, said Betty Keppel of the  Wisconsin Investment Board.  </P> <P> Pic 'N' Save's stock climbed in heavy over-the-counter trading Friday. It  closed at $13.875, up 87.5 cents, but traded as high as $14.375 while 1.65  million shares changed hands.  </P> <P> The company has 190 stores in 12 states that specialize in close-out and other  discount merchandise.  </P> <P> PIC 'N' SAVE STOCK JUMPS  </P> <P> Daily closing price in dollars per share. Friday close: $13875, up $0.875  </P> <P> Source: Knight-Ridder Trade Center  </P></p>

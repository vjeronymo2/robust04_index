			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Down the hatch Who are the UK's most lavish boozers? The lads and lasses of Lancashire and neighbourhood, according to today's survey of living-costs from the Reward consultancy. Whatever their social niche, the folk of north-west England spend more on drink than their counterparts in any other region. Second come the Scots, with London commuters only a short measure behind them. Mainland eyebrows, however, will no doubt be raised by the finding that the lowest spenders are the denizens of Northern Ireland. The explanation could of course be that they somehow manage to consume more booze for less money. On the other hand, Reward's researchers might have paid undue heed to the Ulster blarney, or the finding may be just an opt(hic)al illusion.</p>

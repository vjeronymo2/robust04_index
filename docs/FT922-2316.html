			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Norweb lifts profits 96% at year-end NORWEB, the Manchester-based regional electricity company, yesterday reported a 96 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 137.9m for the year to March 1992. This will provide more grist for the mills of critics of electricity privatisation, who have attacked the 41 per cent increase announced on Monday by East Midlands Electricity, the first regional company to report. The result follows a warning on Monday from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, that the privatised industry would not be allowed to make excessive profits. But Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said the company was being fair to customers. 'Our tariff increase of only 1 per cent this year was one of the lowest in the industry,' he said. The company also pointed out that the underlying increase in profits was a more modest 20 per cent, close to the 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 514m announced yesterday by National Power, Britain's largest electricity generator. Norweb's big increase last year was partly because - like all 12 regional electricity companies - it raised prices sharply in April 1991. This was to compensate for the previous year, when the companies undercharged customers. In addition, profits in the previous year were depressed by exceptional costs, particularly bad debts in the company's retail business. If both these factors were stripped out, Norweb said, underlying profit would have increased 20 per cent. National Power was the focus of attention yesterday when it came to job losses. It cut a further 2,400 jobs, while Norweb cut 280 jobs. National Power, which cut 3,000 jobs in the year to March, said this was part of a programme announced after privatisation, when it had around 17,000 staff. But it acknowledged it had revised proposed job cuts up from 5,000 to 8,000 last year. Both companies said lower electricity prices depended on the negotiations with British Coal, an important fuel supplier. 'Good progress has been made towards the sort of deal that will lead to real term reductions in the electricity price,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. And Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, said: 'We expect to keep our prices below inflation next year. How far below depends on the coal deal.' Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 24</p>

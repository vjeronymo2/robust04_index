			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Afrikaner food: will it get your vote? - A look at how Boers and Malay slaves contributed to the specific character of South African food In the good old bad old days, when the right-wing, extra-right wing and far-right wing had it all their own way in South Africa, election days were feast days. On school playing fields and in scout halls across the land, spick-and-span candidates proffered honesty and koeksisters (a kind of crisp, plaited doughnut steeped in spiced syrup). Party-faithful mums beamed family values as they flipped thick, frangrant pannekoeke (pancakes) over portable burners. In the run-up to this country's first democratic election on April 27, the National Party has expanded on the old successful formula. Come hear us speak, they said to the poverty-stricken newly-enfranchised masses, and there will be food there. So the masses came, and indeed there was food. Great pots of steaming putu (an African staple, stiff maize porridge), vats of sweet tomato-and-onion sous (relish), thick curls of boerewors (traditional spiced sausage) sending fragrant smoke abroad as they sizzled over barbecues. 'We say: go to their meetings, eat their food . . . and then vote for us,' was Nelson Mandela's rejoinder to that particular election ploy. But perhaps the ANC, and the rest, should not underestimate the seductive power of Afrikaner food. At its best it can steal your heart: whether it can also steal your vote remains to be seen. Like the language itself, traditional Afrikaner food is a composite of many influences. It owes much to its Dutch ancestry, something to the English fellow-colonialists, and much to the 1820 French Huguenot settlers. But South African cuisine gets its specific character from two things: the hot Great Trek across the vast interior, when the Boers moved inland to get away from English rule in the Cape, and to the Malay slaves who were brought to Cape colony 300 years ago. Dried food - most famously biltong - is one of the successes of the Trek. Spicier than jerky, biltong is beef or game which has been marinated in spiced vinegar then studded with roasted coriander seeds and air-dried. It lasted for months as the ox wagons jolted across the arid plains in search of the promised land. Lack of refrigeration was just one problem facing ox-wagon cooks. Lack of cookers was another. Fresh food had to be cooked in a pot or over coals. The barbecue - braaivleis in Afrikaans - is probably South Africa's trademark cuisine. Sunday afternoons in the suburbs are characterised by gourmands in witty plastic aprons waving tongs like wands over fires. Purists get pedantic about the perfect boerewors, or the kind of wood necessary to produce the perfect coals. No conclusion has been reached on either front. The other legacy of the great trek - and the fact that 60 per cent of South African households are still not electrified - is potjiekos literally, pot food. The settlers were hauled up Africa by oxen, which did double duty by filling the bellies of those they transported. Veteran trek-oxen are tough in the extreme: long, slow cooking was the only way to tenderise the meat, and bredie, or stew, is the result. Before leaving the Cape, the trekkers had picked up some useful ways with spices from the Malays, which no doubt helped. The pot in question was then  -and still is - iron-black, three-legged and round-bellied. You fill it with whatever you fancy, and when the fire burns low, you heave it onto the coals and sit back with beer and biltong. Some hours later, all will be ready. More mythology attaches to potjiekos than almost any other South African food. There are potjiekos festivals across the land, and recipes are guarded fanatically. A bredie does not have to be made in a potjie. Perfectly delicious ones are dished up in restaurants which have never seen an open fire. The many forms of bredie are well worth exploring - most piquant is tamatie (tomato) bredie, most poetic is waterblummetjiebredie, variously translated as pondweed stew and water lily stew. Springtime in the Cape is marked by the appearance of sweet-scented white water lilies. (Aponogeton distachyos). The flowers are picked in the bud stage and impart a lovely green freshness to the mutton with which the dish is made. Very little else is added - a handful of sorrel plucked from where it grows alongside the lilies (OK, a squeeze of lemon will do), some seasoning, a grate of nutmeg. More profound than the Great Trek is the Malay influence on Cape cooking. The Cape Malays as an ethnic group are somewhat misnamed: the slaves spoke Malay, but came from Java. Cape Malay cuisine is thus predominantly Indonesian in origin, although heavily influenced by Indian cooking. Since Malay cooks were much sought after in the kitchens of the Dutch settlers, traditional Dutch dishes soon acquired a sprinkling of nutmeg here, a puff of cinnamon there. The harvest of the seas was scented with golden turmeric, cumin and jeera made their way into meat marinades. The lack of wine and brandy - both of which South Africa has produced in quantity since the early days - can probably be attributed to the Moslem Malay influence. But South Africa was not built on meat alone. Indigenous vegetables include sweet potatoes, butternut, gem squash and the like. Butternut is held to be as close to heaven as a gourd can be. Simply roasted whole, its dense orange, sweet, smooth flesh is the perfect accompaniment to just about anything. It is combined with carrots or apricots to make delcious soups; steamed or boiled with cinnamon and mashed, it can melt the most recalcitrant meat-eater. With some exceptions, like the ubiquitous melktert - a kind of custard pie dusted with cinnamon - and koeksisters, traditional deserts rely on the abundance of local fruits. Extremely popular is a date tart rather like pecan nut pie in appearance, over which ladles of brandy syrup are poured while the tart is hot, and which is served with thick cream. Fruit fritters and salads are common, and stewed guavas served with custard are what roly-poly is to boarding-school dinners in England. The bad news for visitors to South Africa is that restaurants specialising in local cuisine are much less in evidence than Italian or American-style restaurants. The country's top restaurants all specialise in French fare. So getting a South African meal in South Africa is rather like . . . well, finding traditional British cooking in Britain.</p>

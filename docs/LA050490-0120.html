			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM NEWS HOLDERS ADOPT TAKEOVER DEFENSE  </P> <P> Majority owners of Freedom Newspapers Inc., worried that dissident shareholder  Harry H. Hoiles might align himself with takeover specialist Robert M. Bass,  have created a voting block to thwart unwanted suitors for their family  operation.  </P> <P> The majority shareholders, representing two branches of founder R. C. Hoiles'  family and two-thirds of the company, hired New York merger lawyer Martin  Lipton to draft an agreement that essentially requires them to vote their  shares together and to sell their stock only to each other.  </P> <P> The actions are meant to "signal to anybody who is thinking of making a raid on  the company that we're determined to remain a privately held, closely held,  family company," said Robert C. Hardie, chairman of Irvine-based Freedom  Newspapers, owner of the Orange County Register and 26 other daily newspapers.  </P> <P> The actions would also tend to reduce the value of the Harry Hoiles family  stock to any outsider.  </P> <P> Hoiles has battled the families of his sister, Mary Jane Hardie (Robert  Hardie's wife), and his late brother, Clarence H. Hoiles, for more than a  decade in his effort to split up the company and take his share of the assets.  The three families each hold about one-third of the shares of Freedom, which  also owns 25 weekly newspapers and five television stations.  </P> <P> The majority contends that Hoiles is entitled only to the value of his stock,  not the assets. Hoiles lost lower and appellate court cases to break up the  assets but plans to ask the state Supreme Court to reverse the rulings.  </P> <P> Hoiles has threatened a number of times to sell his stock to an outside party,  an act the majority would abhor.  </P> <P> At several Freedom meetings this year, Hoiles was accompanied by Glen Johnson,  a Ft. Worth lawyer whose firm handles much of the Robert M. Bass Group's legal  matters. Hoiles' son, Tim, said he had retained the lawyer while acting as  publisher of Freedom's Pampa, Tex., paper in the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> Though Hoiles said he has not talked with any Bass people about selling his  stock to the Ft. Worth investor, the Hardie and Clarence Hoiles branches don't  believe it.  </P> <P> "We know who the lawyer is. We know the firm and who it represents," Robert  Hardie said.  </P> <P> And the majority also knows that the Bass Group -- whose investments include  American Savings Bank, a Stockton thrift operated out of Irvine -- currently  holds 40% of Times Publishing, which owns the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times.  </P> <P> It bought the stake from two granddaughters of founder Paul Poynter and is  challenging a dividend structure that it believes was a result of an  acrimonious family feud among Poynter descendants. While Bass says his stake is  simply a long-term investment, newspaper executives there contend that Bass has  a hidden agenda to take control of the company.  </P> <P> Freedom's majority owners decided to try to prevent a similar occurrence in  Orange County. Hardie said the majority needed to hire a top Wall Street lawyer  such as Lipton because they feared they would be up against the might of the  Bass Group.  </P> <P> Under the new voting block agreement, the shareholders in the two families  agreed to sell their stock only to each other and to allow a seven-member  committee to vote the shares through the end of 1994, with annual renewals  thereafter.  </P> <P> The agreement supersedes a previous pact between the two families that required  current shareholders to offer stock to each other before selling to an  outsider.  </P></p>

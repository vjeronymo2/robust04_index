			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Records: The new troubadours - Folk and Rock THIRTY-FIVE years ago British poets such as Christopher Logue, Adrian Mitchell, Pete Brown and myself started wedding our verses to jazz. A few years later the Beatles and Stones were importing songs by Chuck Berry and Bob Dylan and rolling their own. For the preceding half century American blues, folk and rock songwriter-singers had set the pace. When the Woodstock generation and British beats became parents, spoken and sung word-sounds opened up. What had been pigeon-holed as folk, ethnic, R&amp;B and spiritual genres overlapped more loosely with poetry, pop and, latterly, world music. These (r)evolutions have been catalysed by artists, writers and producers of many hues. Dylan has acknowledged how instrumental the 'spontaneous bop prosody' of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg was in metamorphosing the Midwest-suburban college boy Zimmerman into the wildly free-ranging song-&amp;-dance man he remains. 'Talking New Bob Dylan', a song on the recent album History (Virgin 2703) by Loudon Wainwright III, one of Dylan's most original successors, articulates the perennial beginning-troubadour situation :'I had to stop listening/times were too tough/Me being the New Me/was hard enough/You kept right on changing/like you still always do/And what's best is - the old stuff/still sounds new.' History sounds newer still, confronting harsh mid-life realities with telling wit and unescapist fortitude. Another stream of straight-talking lyricism is renewed in the Stormy Horizons of C&amp;W populist Hank Wangford, with his resourceful and spirited band. This recording (Sincere Sounds 004 - cassette Pounds 7, CD Pounds 11 from Frank Management, 3 Chesterton Road, London W10 5LY), is dedicated to the golden aeon of hillbilly boogie 40 years ago, before the great divide between rock and country was widened through fear, racism and sexual suspicion. The music conveys Wangford's passion for Texan honky-tonk, Tennessee Ernie, the Everly Brothers and the 'sweet sadness of country harmonies straight from the Kentucky coalfields.' At the same time it twangs in perfect - and frequently comic - tune with current British gloom, as in 'End of the Road': 'I've had enough/enough of the rain/enough of the cold/I'm tired of the nights/The dazzling lights/when the wipers won't wipe/I've got cowboy craziness/burning inside/but I'm out of pills . . . I could be warm /lying in your arms/So why am I here/with another flat beer/I want to go home.' After temping as a clerk in the City of London, John Baine felt that the stage-name Attila the Stockbroker would be in keeping with his avowed contract from the muses 'to liquidate the gaggle of grey lugworms and displaced Martians who have held the UK poetry set-up in thrall for yonks resquirming the same old nepotistical pretentious irrelevant gunk.' Having spent a few years in punk and heavy-metal bands he was no more sanguine about the pop scene, feeling in 1981 that 'rock has become largely redundant as a means of communication because the generally inane volume means you can't hear the words.' Since then he has issued a dozen lucidly phrased albums and cassettes, the best of which perpetuate his energy, humour and improvisational verve as a performance poet, singer and electric mandola virtuoso. Donkey's Years (Musidisc 107891, cassette &amp; LP Pounds 6, CD Pounds 10 from ATS, 6 Colebrook Road, Southwick, BN4 4AL) gathers 13 of his latest hits, notably 'Video Nazis', 'This is Free Europe', 'The Bible according to Rupert' and this ultra-contemporary lover's complaint: 'Today I took out the rubbish/and thought of you./ At the bottom of my dustbin/the maggots wriggled round and round/like planes circling over Heathrow Airport./ Now and then/two larval aviators collided in the crowded, circular, putrescent grooves of metal/and I thought yes, this is us - /not even ships that pass in the night/but maggots wriggling in predetermined circles/in the putrescent dustbin/of the enterprise culture.' Paul Weller, like Attila, is 34, but had formed The Jam at 14 and swiftly built it into one of the most rhythmic, soulful and humanly political beat groups in the world for the entire decade. He goes on being one of the only big pop stars to pen hard-edged straight verse as well as music. His recent recording, Paul Weller (Go] Discs 828 343-1) is, rather surprisingly, his first solo album. It intensifies my sense of him as a more melodic, inventive and poetic guitarist, tunesmith and lyricist, especially of love songs, to keep on trucking than anyone since Dylan and the Beatles - with the possible exceptions of Peter Gabriel and Billy Bragg.</p>

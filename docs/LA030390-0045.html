			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL DIVISION IV;  </P> <P> CORONADO TITLE DEFEATS IMPERIAL, STEREOTYPE  </P> <P> Hey, all you water polo and tennis players, listen up. The Coronado boys'  basketball team won the Division IV San Diego Section championship Friday with  a 63-53 victory over Imperial at Golden Hall.  </P> <P> Nyah-nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah.  </P> <P> "We're stereotyped as a tennis and water polo school," said 6-foot-3 center  Derek Wastila, who scored 19 points. "Little do they know we have some talent  out here."  </P> <P> Enough, in fact, to win the school's first section basketball championship.  This team also won Coronado's first league championship since 1963, finishing  atop the newly formed City Harbor League.  </P> <P> "All they hear is tennis and water polo," Coronado Coach Bob Stanton said. "But  we've beaten some pretty good teams this year. This wasn't a fluke."  </P> <P> Still, people have been telling guard Paul Carter for years that he should  transfer to a real basketball school. He didn't listen.  </P> <P> "I stuck it out for four years," he said. "And I'm pretty satisfied with my  career here."  </P> <P> Carter ended it with an exclamation point, scoring nine points and assisting  his teammates on a rather amazing accomplishment in the third quarter, when  Coronado (19-8) outscored Imperial 18-2. Imperial, which used a balanced  offense to build a 33-29 halftime lead, managed only a pair of free throws in  the third quarter. Forward Brian Williams' half-court prayer at the conclusion  of the period, which bounced around the rim and out, was the closest thing  Imperial had to a field goal.  </P> <P> "I think their size and strength wore us down a little," Imperial Coach Kerry  Legarra said. "We just quit moving and maybe that was because of fatigue."  </P> <P> If Imperial (16-8) was tired, it wasn't extinct. Trailing, 47-35, at the end of  the third quarter, the Tigers trimmed Coronado's lead to eight with less than  three minutes remaining. Then, when Imperial forward Erik Mellas drove for a  layup, Wastila swatted Mellas' shot halfway to Orange County, and Carter wound  up with a layup on the other end.  </P> <P> "I do tend to feast on the smaller teams," Wastila said.  </P> <P> A basket and three free throws down the stretch by forward Adam Smith, who  scored 19 points to share game-high honors with Wastila, helped preserve the  victory, Coronado's second over Imperial this season.  </P> <P> One key to this victory was Stanton's decision to change the defense in the  third quarter from a box-and-one, designed to shut down forward/center Brian  Williams, to a two-three zone. Williams managed just nine points, and the  defensive switch threw Imperial's offense out of kilter.  </P> <P> "A lot of their shots came easy," Legarra said. "And a lot of ours came very,  very hard."  </P> <P> But Legarra wasn't completely dissatisfied.  </P> <P> "How many teams," he asked, "score two points in one quarter and are still in  the ball game?"  </P></p>

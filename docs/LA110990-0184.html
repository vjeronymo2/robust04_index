			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IGWEBUIKE INDICTED IN HEROIN CASE  </P> <P> Minnesota Vikings place-kicker Donald Igwebuike was indicted today by a federal  grand jury on charges he schemed to smuggle heroin from his native Nigeria.  </P> <P> Igwebuike was charged with conspiracy to import, conspiracy to possess with  intent to distribute and the importation of heroin.  </P> <P> Igwebuike's name was linked to the case two weeks ago when ABC News reported  that prosecutors in Tampa had "irrefutable" evidence connecting the  place-kicker to an attempt to smuggle heroin into the United States from  Nigeria.  </P> <P> Igwebuike was charged on three counts of a four-count indictment that also  named Maduwuba Ibekwe and Ibezim Ofedu, who already had been arrested in the  case.  </P> <P> Ibekwe was arrested Oct. 12 at Orlando International Airport where a personal  search by a U.S. Customs Service inspector allegedly resulted in the discovery  of three pellets containing heroin.  </P> <P> Igwebuike's lawyer has said the football player is a victim of circumstantial  evidence, which reportedly includes a plane ticket Igwebuike bought for Ibekwe  and taped telephone conversations between the men.  </P> <P> Lawyer Larry Reed said Igwebuike simply wanted Ibekwe to rush $12,000 to his  parents in Anambra, Nigeria. Reed said the kicker's parents received the money.  </P> <P> Custom agents searched Igwebuike's Bloomington, Minn., apartment the day after  the ABC report and reportedly seized telephone records and other personal  papers.  </P> <P> Igwebuike has been one of the most accurate and consistent place-kickers in the  NFL during his career. He spent five years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and is  the club's all-time leading scorer with 416 points.  </P> <P> Bucs Coach Ray Perkins released him just before the start of this season,  saying rookie Steve Christie has a stronger leg and had the potential to become  a better kicker. Minnesota claimed Igwebuike off waivers, and he has made 14 of  16 field goals since joining the Vikings.  </P> <P> Ironically, one of the missed attempts was a 48-yarder that would have beaten  Tampa Bay in overtime Sept. 30.  </P></p>

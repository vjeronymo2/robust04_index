			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Pifco shows sharp contraction to Pounds 1.17m PIFCO HOLDINGS, the electrical appliances group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.17m for the year to April 30. The outcome was down on last time's Pounds 3.69m but marked the first annual result to include Russell Hobbs Tower, the kettle and cookware maker which had incurred losses of Pounds 30.6m in the 28 months up to its acquisition in April 1991. Pifco bought RHT for Pounds 7.75m from the administrators of Polly Peck International. Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said that by the year-end RHT 'was trading close to break-even and should make a profit contribution in the coming year'. He ascribed the turnround not to 'restructuring in a major way', but to a 'downsizing' and a 'focus on profitable sales, not volume'. As a whole, Mr Webber said, Pifco 'was not chasing market share', but 'new products leading to new prices is the engine of growth'. Export sales expanded from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 7.6m and accounted for 19 per cent of the group total. He said he was looking to make 'digestible' acquisitions in Europe. The group manufactures half its own products, with the other half made by others to Pifco's specifications. Mr Webber said this gave 'leverage on capital employed'. Group turnover rose 71 per cent to Pounds 40m (Pounds 23.3m), though RHT accounted for all that growth and more, said Mr Webber. Trading profits were halved at Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 2.61m) before interest payable of Pounds 62,000, against receivable of Pounds 1.09m accrued on the pre-RHT Pounds 8.7m cash pile. At the year-end cash balances stood at Pounds 957,000. Earnings shrank to 13.9p (32.6p) per share but the final dividend is unchanged at 4.25p for a same-again 7.75p total.</p>

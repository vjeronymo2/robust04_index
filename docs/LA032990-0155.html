			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO;  </P> <P> LIBRARY HAS 5,000 TITLES TO CHECK OUT  </P> <P> If it had been the corner video store, most customers would have done a double  take.  </P> <P> In the section labeled "New Arrivals" were titles such as "The Prisoner of  Zenda" with Ronald Colman, "The Beautiful Blonde From Bashful Bend" with Betty  Grable and "The Story of Louis Pasteur" with Paul Muni.  </P> <P> As it was, though, most people in the Thousand Oaks Library last week simply  gave the section a glance, some of them stopping to pick up a cassette and read  its back cover before heading to the rows of videos spread out before them.  </P> <P> "Since I found out about this, I've come here at least twice a week," said June  McGahey of Thousand Oaks as she placed a third videotape under her arm. "They  have everything, from way back until now."  </P> <P> The library has come a long way since 1981, when it purchased its first  videocassette. Today, the collection has more than 5,000 titles and the library  is constantly looking for new acquisitions, according to Kathleen Sullivan,  division manager for collection and reference services.  </P> <P> Feature films, which include dramas and comedies from 1930 to 1990, cost  library card holders $1 per day. Educational videos, which include everything  from foreign language films subtitled in English to how-to videos on building  homes, are free for seven days.  </P> <P> "What we've tried to do is get as wide a variety as possible," said Sullivan,  who is responsible for adding new titles to the collection. "You can find  classics, to videos on opera and history. Those aren't usually what you'd find  in most video stores."  </P> <P> Each week, Sullivan said, patrons check out about 3,000 feature films, which  were purchased with funds from the nonprofit Thousand Oaks Library Foundation.  Educational videos, purchased with library funds, are checked out at about the  same rate, Sullivan said.  </P> <P> The appeal of the library's wide selection of videos at a low cost upset owners  of local video stores. When the library announced plans to create the  collection, Sullivan said, local video store owners were not pleased.  </P> <P> Concerned that the library would present unfair competition, Sullivan said  video store owners met with library representatives and City Council members to  express their objections to the idea. It wasn't until library representatives  explained that they would most likely be attracting a different type of  clientele that the protests subsided, she said.  </P> <P> "We're really not in competition with them," Sullivan said. "Video stores tend  to carry the more popular recent releases, the hot stuff. When people come here  and say they can never get a hot one, we send them to the video stores."  </P> <P> That spirit of cooperation apparently works both ways. Carol Clark, who works  in a video store in Calabasas, said she regularly sends customers to the  Thousand Oaks library for titles the store doesn't carry.  </P> <P> "We get videos the day they are released, and most of our customers are college  students who want the new releases," Clark said. "But when they want an old  movie, I tell them to go to the library because there's a much bigger  selection."  </P> <P> With so many titles to choose from, which ones are the critic's choice?  </P> <P> In the educational section of the library, rock 'n' roll fans might want to  check out Paul McCartney's film on rock legend Buddy Holly, which can be kept  at no cost for a week.  </P> <P> Armchair travelers can take a look at a video guide to the Mexican Riviera or a  90-minute journey to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Sociology buffs can get their fill with a video on the royal wedding of  Britain's Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, or take a leisurely peek into  "Alcatraz, America's Toughest Prison."  </P> <P> And then, for weekend athletes who want the weekend off, there are always great  titles such as "A Guide to Bicycle Touring," "Come Sail With Us" or "Baseball  the Pete Rose Way."  </P> <P> Uh, on second thought, maybe we'll skip that last one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A FAST-FORWARD THROUGH VIDEO STORES  </P> <P> Many local video outlets are equipped to provide even the most finicky  cine-maniac with something other than the latest from Andrew Dice Clay. Here is  a sampling:  </P> <P> * Salzer's Video -- 5801 Valentine Road, Ventura, 656-5801. Open Sunday through  Thursday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m.  </P> <P> Salzer's has everything from public service videos that discuss life's daily  issues, to instructional videos on how to paint, to the best of the cult  classics. "We have about 150 cult titles . . . we've got all the Divines, the  Andy Warhols," says Becky Beckner, the store's manager. "Warhol is new. He's  cult because he's dead now. His art is one of a kind."  </P> <P> * Ojai Video -- 305 E. Matilija St., Ojai, 646-9652. Open Monday through  Saturday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. and Sunday, noon-8 p.m.  </P> <P> This store specializes in foreign films so get the old Berlitz out. All the  Berlitzes, in fact. They've got tapes in Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Hungarian,  Swedish, German and Indian, among others. Selections date as far back as the  '30s, but the latest releases are also available.  </P> <P> * The Lord's Storehouse -- 1871 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks,  495-6136. Open Monday through Friday, 9:30 a.m.-6 p.m. and Saturday, 9:30  a.m.-5 p.m.  </P> <P> See, there is a critic more influential than Siskel and Ebert.  </P> <P> The Storehouse's inventory is made up predominantly of videos with a Christian  slant.  </P> <P> "We also provide some home-school curriculum," says Kathy Wolski, general  manager. "So we have some Dickens, some Shakespeare, some opera. There was a  nude scene in 'Romeo and Juliet,' but we had it edited out. Everything here is  very good and clean."  </P> <P> * Video Depot -- 2520 E. Main St., Ventura, 643-7902. Open Monday, 8 a.m.-9  p.m.; Tuesday through Thursday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 9 a.m.-10  p.m. and Sunday, 11 a.m.-8 p.m.  </P> <P> The Depot specializes in classics, going back as far as "Wings, from 1928.  </P> <P> Manager Tinke Reid says her clientele is made up mostly of adults, but that  younger people come in on occasion. "Most of our customers are looking for  movies without violence and sex. The younger ones come in only when they have  to do a book report and are too lazy to read the book."  </P> <P> * 5th Street Video II -- 211 W. Pleasant Valley Road, Oxnard, 486-7777. Open  every day, 10 a.m.-9 p.m.  </P> <P> This store specializes in Mexican videos or videos dubbed into Spanish.

Matilija St., Suite 110, Ojai, 646-4315. Open  Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m.-9 p.m. and Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m.-10  p.m.  </P> <P> If you're looking for horror videos, forget it. Manager Kim Perry says the  store isn't really into them. But if it's the classics you want, Video  Adventures has about 300 selections.  </P> <P> "We've got the old classics going back to 'Grapes of Wrath' and 'A Guy Named  Joe,' " says Perry, "and we just purchased 'Bus Stop' with Marilyn Monroe."  Video Adventures also has a sizable selection of movies with John Wayne, Jack  Lemmon, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn.  </P> <P> * Video City -- 210 Arneill Road, Camarillo, 987-6800. Open every day, 10  a.m.-9 p.m.  </P> <P> Video City owner Mick Thiesen prides himself on his collection of National  Geographic videos. "Just about anything they put out, I'll order," he says.

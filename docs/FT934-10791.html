			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Illegal labour a growth business: Ariane Genillard on Germany's problems with a cheap import IT IS 8am and Mr Herbert Botz, who heads the task force clamping down on illegal workers at the labour office in Cologne, scans his first construction site of the day in nearby Leverkusen. 'We have never found a clean construction site in the whole region,' says Mr Botz. In Leverkusen, as in most cases, a letter from a rival construction company caused the surprise search. Three Polish workers are ordered to lay their tools down a few minutes later, when overdue papers show they are not entitled to be on site. 'Often, we just tell them to stop working. Sometimes, they are put back on buses to eastern Europe,' says Mr Botz. More than half a million workers from eastern Europe are believed by trade unions and political organisations to be employed illegally in Germany's construction industry. Gathered in parking lots, they wait to be picked up by employers who are eager to pay less than 25 per cent of a German wage for the same job, says Mr Peter Rack. Albanians, employed for DM3 (Dollars 1.80) to DM4 (Dollars 2.40) an hour, are the cheapest. With growing unemployment and bitter price wars for construction contracts, the rising number of illegal job-seekers crossing Germany's porous eastern border is pitting companies against each other and unionists against politicians. Meanwhile, as the number of unemployed in western Germany in the sector has risen by 3,000 to 76,122 last year, profits in the construction industry have surged by 5.6 per cent, mostly as a result of growth in the east. Nearly 1,000 new construction companies were registered last year. For IGbau, the construction industry union, the core of the problem lies in labour exchange agreements signed between Bonn and eastern neighbours in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall. These allow 97,104 people from eastern Europe to work in Germany at any time for specific contracts lasting up to a year. Most are employed in the construction industry. The unions say this has fostered the growth of middlemen from eastern Europe who sub-contract their nationals to German companies. 'One middleman gets 30 permits through a contract. But three days later, he exchanges legal workers against illegal ones. This way he can keep people coming in although they don't have the proper papers,' says Mr Hanz Haber, spokesman for IGbau. Aware of the growing abuses, the authorities have been trying to control the problem by targeting companies rather than workers. Since the beginning of the year local officers can check construction sites without search warrants. IGbau, which wants the labour agreements cancelled and greater protection of the local highly regulated labour market, claims the authorities are deliberately turning a blind eye to the problem. It says the government, which has already asked Poland and the Czech Republic to take back asylum-seekers, is reluctant to apply further pressure. Pressure on the government has also come from organisations representing small and medium-sized companies squeezed by falling prices for construction contracts. 'We want the government to allow a limited number of eastern European workers per enterprise, depending on the labour force it employs,' explains Mr Julius Louvenen, from the Christian Democrats' small business lobby group. Talks with the government, which started a year ago, have been fruitless, prompting an IGbau threat to take the government to the constitutional court to introduce tighter wage controls in the workplace. Meanwhile, some attempts are being made to improve the control on the workers on a construction site. Special passes have recently been issued to facilitate regular check-ups. But fines for illegally employing workers have not been significantly increased. 'We get caught, the boss pays the fines and we come right back. For big employers, the fines are peanuts. They'll make the money back in one month, if you ask me,' says one illegal worker before vanishing into the crowd.</p>

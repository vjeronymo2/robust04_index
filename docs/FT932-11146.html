			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Aid sought by Czech employers THE CZECH government should do more to help foster companies' competitiveness, rather than focus primarily on macro-economic stability, the Czech Employers Confederation says. Mr Rudolf Baranek, the confederation's chairman, says companies face growing problems because of a decline in exports, poor production structures and marketing. The end of the currency union with Slovakia, together with import restrictions into the EC, have also exacerbated their difficulties. Employers are worried, too, by the rapid growth of wages, which they say outstrips improvements in productivity. The National Bank of Slovakia revalued the Slovak crown by 3 per cent against the clearing Ecu set up to regulate trade with the Czech Republic.</p>

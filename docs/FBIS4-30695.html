			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seita Sakamoto, NIKKEI KINYU reporter in London] </F>   [Text] Japanese banks such as city banks have begun to seek  Europe's Asia business via their European branches, owing to  sluggish growth of loans in Europe. They are selling themselves  as "Asian banks" with the goal of winning the business of major  European companies with stepped-up enthusiasm for entering the  Asian markets," while sparing no effort in developing ideas for  investment in Asian projects on the part of European firms.  Among Japanese banks striving to survive in London's  international financial markets, "Asia" has become a password.    "Asian Seminars" targeting local European firms by Japanese  banks are being conducted on a fairly active basis. Such  seminars have been held in London by the Industrial Bank of  Japan in February and by the Bank of Tokyo in May, and in London  and Paris by Sanwa Bank.    Seminars have included lectures on economic trends in China  and ASEAN nations by instructors such as the former head of a  Beijing branch office. Noticeable are attendees from large  companies such as British Petroleum (BP) and British Gas. The  seminars are used to impress upon participating firms that the  banks play a "dominant role in the Asian market."    The move by Japanese banks to vocally stress that they are  "Asian banks" was inspired by the intensification of actions by  major European firms to reduce the number of banks with which  they maintain relations.    Blue chip firms which had raised capital by organizing major  international loan consortia during the latter half of the  1980's have intensified moves toward reducing banks with which  they do business to "core banking groups" of 10 or so  institutions. A loan officer at a London branch of a Japanese  bank says, "Only two or three Japanese banks will be left in  core banking groups." As European firms intensify their  aspirations to enter such markets as those of China, the appeal  of phrases such as a "bank playing a dominant role in the Asian  market" will serve as a powerful weapon to engage in  transactions covering that area.    As an example, when a leading British telecommunications  services company was issued approval for loans in March, fierce  competition among Japanese banks resulted in the designation of  Sumitomo and Sanwa Banks to handle the loans. Sanwa Bank was  selected because it had already established close relations with  the Hong Kong joint venture of the parent company. London branch  manager and managing director Masaaki Fujimoto stresses that his  bank's dominant role in Asia "serves as momentum for it to win  business in that area."    Emphasis on Asia by Japanese banks' London branches is not  limited to an appeal for customers. Connections with European  firms entering the Asian market have been providing increasing  opportunities to develop new business ideas for the Asian market.    Mitsubishi Bank played an intermediary role in arranging a  $1.5 billion loan by a Japanese-U.S.-European loan consortium  signed in the fall of 1993 for the construction of an oil  refinery in Thailand by Royal Dutch Shell. The transaction was  initiated by the London branch of Mitsubishi by taking advantage  of its previous relationship with Shell.    Reportedly, "individuals in charge of project financing and  aircraft financing are making frequent trips to Hong Kong and  Singapore" from Sumitomo Bank's London branch. As growth in  demand for capital remains sluggish in Europe, loan officers in  London have turned their attention to Asia, where demand for  capital is lively.    Needless to say, any increased activity by European branches  in winning business for the Asian market can cause friction  within banks. Thus, the respective banks have devised systems  for sharing profits arising from such advisory activities among  branches and for conducting business across the branches'  regional jurisdictions.    Japanese banks' London branches eying Asia face formidable  competition from European and U.S. banks. One assistant branch  manager of a long-term credit bank's London branch admits,  "Britain's Merchant Bank with experience under the old colonial  system has far more know-how in the area of providing  capital-raising advice." And, U.S. investment bankers are making  bold investments in personnel and capital in the Asian market.    Japanese banks are working assiduously to establish their  own  unique strengths. Tadashi Kurachi, the Bank of Tokyo's managing  director and London branch general manager for European affairs,  stresses, "Our bank has a branch network that covers the world  as far as India and Pakistan and has access to detailed  information through the Chinese connection." Both Mitsubishi and  Sumitomo say, "Not only are we strong in Asia, but we sell  ourselves in terms of being superior in handling project  financing and aircraft financing."    London branches of Japanese banks have finally recovered  from  losses suffered as a result of inflated real estate investments  in the latter half of the 1980's and are now seeking a path to  the future. "Asia" is now designated as an ideal target for that  purpose. The future will provide the answer to whether they can  compete effectively with European and U.S. banks and whether  they can make effective use of their full potential.</p>

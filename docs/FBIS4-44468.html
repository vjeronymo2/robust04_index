			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article written by Hua Tong (5478 2717) and Duan Shiguang </F> (3008 0174 0342) of the "Central and Local Tax Allocation  Relations Reform" Study Group: "On the Classified Tax System's  Guiding Principles and Its Actual Implementation"--The study  group is headed by Hua Tong. Other participating units are  Jiangxi's Provincial Finance Society and Institute of Finance,  the Financial Ministry's Institute of Science and Technology' s  District Financial Study Department, and the financial study  departments of Jiangsu, Gansu, Guizhou, and Ningbo. The first  paragraph is a source-supplied introduction.]    [Text] It is the authors' opinion that in  implementing the classified tax system, we must adhere to five  basic principles: We need a unified policy with administrations  at separate levels; financial authority should match  administrative authority; the central government should have the  bulk of financial power, but local interests should be taken  into consideration; fairness and efficiency should be combined;  and reform should be radical but gradual. The target mode of  China's classified tax system is the radical classified tax  system characterized by different kinds of taxes levied at  different rates. We can achieve this goal only in steps. That  is, we must first set up a classified tax framework, then  amplify the mechanisms to regulate regional interests, and  lastly, we eliminate the defects left behind by the old system  and implement a radical classified tax system. The authors  emphasize that the implementation and operation of the  classified tax system must be in conjunction with the tax  reform, and we must also set up corresponding local tax systems  and improve budget management.    The conflicts China is facing as its economic system shifts  to a different track and our urgent task to increase national  strength urge and compel us to accelerate the restructuring of  the financial system. After years of deliberation and  preparation, the classified tax system, as a modern financial  management system, has been formally affirmed by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, and at any  time, it will move from the theoretical probing and experimental  stage to the nationwide implementation stage. This is an  important move to meet the needs of the socialist market  economic development and to put an end to the dissipation of the  state's financial strength, the weakening of the central  authority's regulation and control power, and the financial  plight of governments at all levels. It is a positive step in  promoting lawful and scientific financial administration. It is  an unprecedented change in China's financial system since the  founding of the nation. This article proposes some guiding  principles for this reform and for its implementation and  operation.  <H5>  I. Guiding Principles and Basic Requirements of the </H5> Classified Tax System    Modern classified tax system is accepted worldwide in  nations  that have adopted the market economic system. But different  countries' classified tax systems have different characteristics  and contents; each has to do with the respective country's  situation and financial system. China is a developing nation  with a socialist market economic system. Its goal must be to  develop the socialist market economy, vitalize public finance,  and increase its national strength, so that its classified tax  system can have contemporary Chinese characteristics. The  overall requirement is to build a financial operating mechanism  that meets the needs of the socialist market economy through the  classified tax system to improve and strengthen the financial  ministry's functions, mobilize the enthusiasm of the central and  local governments, distribute the financial strength between  central and local governments in a scientific and standardized  way, and achieve financial autonomy at every level within the  scope stipulated by state laws and national policies.  Specifically we must abide by the following five principles:    1. The principle of unified policy and graded  administration. China is a unified socialist nation and is  fundamentally different from countries uder the federal system.  The most important thing in restructuring the financial system  is the central government's unified leadership, which is  manifested primarily in its unified policies and decrees. From  the point of state finances and taxation, the country's basic,  and most important, policies and laws and regulations must be  unified; there can be no flexibility here. This is a point we  must insist on. This means we must insist that the central  government has financial leadership and regulation and control  rights. On the other hand, China is a large multinational state  with geographic, historical, and environmental differences, and  unlike some small countries, the central government cannot be  too broad or too detailed when exercising control; it must give  play to the role of local governments. Creating an  administrative hierarchy has important practical implications.  Localities should be given reasonable autonomy and legislative  power over regional financial and tax laws and regulations as  well as methods and systems of operation and interpretation. We  should adhere to the principle that every level of government  should have its own administrative power and its share of  financial power. The central and local authorities have their  respective duties and responsibilities, and each should suit  measures to local conditions and manage their own financial  affairs and balance their own budgets. This is another point we  must insist on, for failing to do so will render it impossible  to mobilize local initiative and enthusiasm, and then there will  be no classified tax to speak of. Under the old system, "every  measure has a countermeasure"--it was like a chess game between  those on top and those below; it hindered the country's  government and weakened public finance. We must insist on  changes and replace this with a new system of unified policy  with an administrative hierarchy and which is coordinated  between the higher and lower levels.    2. The principle of matching financial jurisdiction to  administrative jurisdiction. Any amount of administrative  power must be guaranteed by the appropriate amount of financial  power and financial strength. "One must be paid for the amount  of work one performs"--this is a simple and basic principle.  Thus, we must determine the amount of administrative authority  before we determine the amount of financial power. In  implementing the classified tax system, first, we must draw a  clear line between the central government's administrative power  and that of the local governments at different levels. Thereupon  we can separate the tax categories and delimit the financial  power. We must make sure that the state and the localities have  the financial power and the financial strength to carry out  their respective administrative functions, so as to give  expression to the principle of integrating responsibilities,  rights, and privileges. The delineation of administrative power  involves the restructuring of the political system and the  standardization of government conduct. We must comply with the  demands of the modern market economy and reconsider the status,  function, and role of the state government in society. In the  past, there were problems of mishandling, abuse, and shirking of  administrative power among the state government, enterprises,  and society; between the central and local governments; and  between the higher and lower level governments. That has to be  corrected, so that we can radically solve the problem of  financial misallocation.    3. The principle of upholding the central government's  dominant financial role while taking care of local  interests. A strong and effective central government is the  organizational guarantee of the proper administration of  important state affairs and solidarity of the people of all  regions and nationalities. An important part of being "strong  and effective" is having financial strength. If the central  government is not backed by substantial financial strength,  state administration and macroeconomic regulation and control  will be but empty words. In recent years, the central  government's income as a percentage of the national income has  been declining steadily, and by 1992, it only came to 38.6  percent, which marked the lowest point since the founding of the  PRC. This percentage not only was below that of nations with a  centralized state power system but was also much lower than  nations with a federal system of separation of power. Worries  about "heavy branches on a weak trunk" are not just alarmist  talk; we must be on the alert. On the other hand, while we  insist on giving the central government the dominant financial  role, we must take care of local financial interests and give  the localities--financial administration at the first level--the  necessary political power and some important sources of  revenue, so as to fully mobilize local initiative and  enthusiasm in taking care of their financial matters as their  own masters. We must not over-correct the problem and go back to  the old "state monopoly of revenues and expenditures."    4. The principle of balancing fairness and  efficiency. Economic development requires efficiency;  social stability demands fairness. Efficiency comes first, but  we must take fairness into consideration and combine fairness  and efficiency. This is an important principle in China's system  of income distribution. Thus, linking the benefits of economic  development to the government's revenues and expenditures is a  necessity; it complies with the needs of the socialist market  economic system. In establishing a financial system, it is  understandable that for some time, we must give consideration to  the vested interests of the economically well-developed coastal  regions, but as a unified socialist nation, large disparities in  reveue and expenditure and living conditions among different  regions not only has an adverse effect on the underdeveloped  regions but will ultimately jeoparidze the long-term development  of the developed regions. One of the central government's  fundamental functions is to balance the regions through macro  regulation and control and reasonably limit the differences  among the regions and prevent the gap from widening. In  particular, there must be a protective policy for public  services in the low-income regions. We must scientifically  determine a poverty-line; regions that fall below this  poverty-line must be given the necessary assistance. As for the  autonomous nationality regions and provinces deemed their  equivalent, we should extend exceptional care in accordance with  laws toward the minority nationalities. This is out of economic  consideration, but it is out of political consideration too.    5. The principle of combining reform's radical nature  and the need to proceed gradually. The classified tax  system involves the comprehensive reallocation and readjustment  of financial strength among the governments and among the  regions. It affects the economic interests of all parties. We  can imagine how sensitive the issues, how sharp the conflicts,  and how heated the debates can be. Adding China's complicated  situation and the lack of proper conditions in many areas,  reform is bound to be difficult and cannot be achieved in one  step; we must proceed gradually. Therefore, we must insist on  two things: First, we must set the goal of implementing a  scientific, radical classified tax system nationwide; this goal  should never change. Second, to achieve this goal, we must work  hard to create the conditions and move in steady steps until we  succeed. In short, the determination of our reform goal should  be positve and radical; the implementation of our reform should  be gradual and gentle. This will reduce friction and avoid  shock, so that we can smoothly attain our reform goal.    To uphold the above five principles, we must accomplish the  "six conducive" and "two guarantees." That is, everything must  be conducive to the construction of a unified socialist market;  conducive to the central government's effective macroeconomic  regulation and control; conducive to the local governments'  autonomous management and lawful financial administration under  the supervision of the people's congresses at their  corresponding levels; conducive to encouraging the local  governments to show interest in local public welfare  undertakings and the building and preservation of public  facilities; conducive to scientifically smoothing relations  between the central and local governments at all levels and  clarifying the interest boundaries to reduce friction; conducive  to tax collection and management and prevention of loss of tax  revenues. On those bases, we can guarantee that the new system  will work as expected and guarantee that when the system changes  tracks, it can shift without confusion and change in an orderly  fashion, so that revenues will increase and budgets will balance  at all levels.  <H5>  II. Choice of a Specific Form of Classified Tax System and </H5> Its Implementation Procedure    As said earlier, the goal of China's restructuring of the  financial system is to implement the radical classified tax  system. The so called radical classified tax system is a graded  financial administration system of classified taxes based on  socialist market economic principles and public finance  theories. The "radical" nature of this kind of classified tax  system is manifested not only in its clear-cut tax categories,  but more importantly, it is manifested in its scientific,  legislated, standardized administration of revenues and  expenditures at separate levels. Today, in nations that have  relatively sound classified tax systems, they usually take one  of two forms: one form allows revenue-sharing taxes and the  other does not. Judging by China's situation, without  revenue-sharing taxes, it will be difficult to take care of  central and local interests at the same time. Revenue-sharing  taxes provide a "common point" between central and local  financial interests and facilitate economic development.  However, revenue-sharing should not take the form of percentage  retention; instead, it should be in the form of "taxing from the  same sources" but at different rates. The central and local  governments' revenues may be collected at different rates by  separate tax organs or by the same organ on their separate  behalf; however, each should have autonomous power to tax, not  to tax, to exempt, or reduce taxes without interference from the  others. Under this method, the delineation of financial power  and financial sources is very clear, which is completely in line  with the principles of the radical classified tax system.  Therefore, it is our opinion that China's classified tax system  should be the radical classified tax system characterized by  separate tax categories and different tax rates.    Implementing the radical classified tax system has broad  ramifications and is a complicated, systematic project. In view  of China's actual situation and realistic conditions, it will be  very difficult to succeed overnight. We must keep pace with the  restructuring of the economic system and adhere to the principle  of combining the radical and gradual nature of reform and  proceed in three steps:    Step one: Set up the framework and implement a  preliminary classified tax system.    The preliminary classified tax system is not a complete  classified tax system. Its main purpose is to set up a framework  according to the principles and needs of the classified system  to create a mechanism in the near-term to lay the foundation to  promote and deepen the restructuring of the tax system. The  preliminary classified tax system is born out of the contract  system and bears two characteristics: On the one hand, it has  the basic substance of a modern classified tax system. For  example, we can delineate administrative and financial power  according to the classified system, concentrate financial power  in the hands of the central government, and set up separate  central tax and local tax collection organs. On the other hand,  it retains many of the original features of the contract system.  For example, we will still implement percentage  revenue-retention, set the revenue and expenditure bases using  the base method, collect income tax based on enterprises'  jurisdictional relationship, and retain the original method of  delivering subsidies to the higher levels. When reform first  begins, these measures are inevitable and are necessary. Its a  transitional format that suits the realistic conditions.    Step two: Strengthen the regional interest regulation  mechanisms and further amplify the classified tax system.    Step one of the restructuring of the tax system tries to  preserve the original interest pattern and, on that basis,  allocates financial strength according to the classified tax  system only for the incremental portion; it is but a fledgling  classified tax system. According to the principles of the  modern classified tax system, there are still many unresolved  essential questions we have not dealt with. In particular, we  have not achieved the goals of macroeconomic regulation of  regional financial interests. Therefore, the main purpose of  step two of the reform is to amplify the substantive contents of  tax assignment according to the needs of the classified tax  system by focusing on the readjustment of the interest pattern.  Specifically, the most important thing is to implement the  transfer of payment system and gradually introduce the factoring  method for calculating expenditures in the process and solve the  problem of the widening gap between the rich and poor regions,  so as to give expression to the state's macroeconomic regulation  and control policy. At the same time, we should create  conditions for further deepening the reform to install the  classified tax system via financial legislation, by building a  tax collection and management contingent, and by developing  sources of revenue, so that we can make the "quantitative  accumulation" to facilitate the transition from the preliminary  classified tax system to the radical classified tax system.    Step three: Eliminate the defects left by the old  system and implement the radical classified tax system.    This reform step is founded primarily on the previous two  steps to further smooth relations, perfect the system, define  responsibilities and rights and privileges, and eliminate the  defects left by the old system. It changes the percentage  revenue retention system to a system of classified taxes  collected at different rates. We should go all out to promote  the factoring method according to objective, scientific, and  standardized needs to really smash the original, improper  interest pattern, so as to truly meet the needs of radical  classified tax system. Specifically, we should: (i) clearly and  properly delineate administrative and financial power to comply  with political reform and adhere to the principle of b alancing  power and obligations; (ii) establish and reinforce the central  government's dominant financial role, perfect the transfer of  payment system, and amplify the macroeconomic regulation and  control system to suit the socialist market economic mechanism;  (iii) amplify and strengthen the central and local tax  collection and management system and create and develop major  sources of tax revenues at different levels to meet the needs of  financial administration at separate levels; (iv) set up rigid  budget constraints to meet the needs of financial autonomy at  each level. We expect that this radical classified tax system  can be implemented nationwide by the end of the century.  <H5>  III. Actual Implementation and Operation of the Classified </H5> Tax System    Overall, the implementation and operation of the classified  tax system should coincide with tax reform to link the  restructuring of the tax system to the new form of taxation.  Specifically:    1. Delineate administrative power and assign spending  responsibility. The delineation of administrative power is  based on the responsibility of each level of government as  assigned in the restructuring of the political system. This task  must be carried out as meticulously, quantitatively, clearly,  and scientifically as possible based on the separation of  government and enterprises and as government functions change to  meet the needs of macroeconomic regulation and control. Besides  taking care of their respective administrative expenditures, the  central government's spending should cover the state's key basic  constructions, national defense, foreign relations and foreign  aid expenditures, the state's share of price subsidies, interest  and principal payment of domestic and foreign loans. Local  expenditures should cover local basic constructions, urban  construction and public undertakings, agricultural support,  pension and welfare, and local share of price subsidies. Certain  factors should be used to determine various social development  and public welfare expenditures to guarantee the necessary  spending in carrying out the government's duties and make sure  that every taxpayer receives the same social services. But we  must realize that the classified tax system can only be  implemented in gradual steps, and we should allow for a  crude-to-refined process (especially in 1994 when we build the  framework, we should not go into great details,) but we must  plant our foothold on the present but look to the future and pay  attention to linking up with our long-term goals.    2. Delineate financial authority and assign  jurisdiction over specific tax categories. After  delineating administrative power, we must delineate financial  power based on the mix of tax categories created by the  restructuring of the tax system. As for where specifically to  draw the line, it is our opinion that tariffs, value-added tax  and consumption tax collected by customs, and revenues handed  over by the railroad, post and telecommunications, banking, and  insurance departments and so on should go to the central  government. Agricultural and livestock taxes and odds-and-ends  taxes which have always been collected locally should go to the  localities. Opinions are more or less unanimous on these, and we  need not elaborate here. The two main areas that are more  controversial are: One, circulation tax which comprises more  than 80 percent of the financial revenues. The localities will  find it unacceptable if this tax goes to the central  governments, and vice versa. The other is enterprises' income  tax. This has to do with the original source of revenue of  various levels of governments and the localities; it has  deep-rooted blood ties with governments at all levels, and it  will be equally difficult no matter who ends up with the  jurisdiction. According to the financial ministry's plans,  consumption tax goes to the central government, business tax  goes to the localities, value-added tax will be shared, and  enterprises income tax will continue to be levied according to  enterprises' jurisdictional relationship, and the amount will be  based on 1993's revenues and expenditures. In our opinion, this  program may be far from meeting the needs of the classified tax  system and is in fact a new version of the old "double-track  system," but in view of today's situation and conditions, it is  our best option and the only program everybody can accept at  this early stage of the restructuring of the tax system; it is  necessary and workable. However, as the restructuring of the tax  system deepens, we must gradually make improvements and  adjustments, so as to better give expression to the principles  of the classified tax system. First, the proportion of  revenue-sharing tax should shrink; percentage revenue-retention  cannot be applied on a long-term basis. Tax collection based on  enterprises' jurisdictional relations should also be changed.  Specifically, (i) value-added tax should be changed from a  "shared" tax to the central government's "exclusive" tax; it  will be the central government's main tax category which  guarantees its dominant financial role, so that it will have the  financial strength to implement macroeconomic regulation and  control. (ii) Enterprise income tax should be changed to  "shared" tax and administrative subordination relationship  should be ignored. Central and local governments will tax the  same sources at different rates to encourage both to be  concerned about enterprises' management and administration and  economic efficiency and prevent governments at different levels  from treati ng enterprises differently based on their  jurisdictional ties, so as to facilitate enterprises' fair  competition.    3. Implement a reasonable transfer of payment system  based on the central government's macro regulation and control  needs. According to the needs of the classified tax system,  most of the income should go to the central government, and most  of the spending should be in the localities. Financially, the  central government needs room for maneuvering to give expression  to the state's macroeconomic decisions and intentions through  various kinds of rebates and subsidies. We should change today's  "upward flow of funds," which in some sense puts the central  government under the control of the localities, to "downward  flow of funds," which gives the central government macro  regulation and control power over the localities. We need the  following types of subsidies: (i) Balancing subsidy--systemic  subsidy used mainly to balance local budgets and help the  localities to meet basic expenditures for carrying out the  government's functions. (ii) General subsidy--used mainly on  projects which the state wants but the localities cannot afford  to undertake because of lack of financial means, or on projects  which when taken by one locality will benefit many. For example,  subsides for water conservancy projects, compulsory education,  disaster prevention and relief, immunization, and family  planning. (iii) Special subsidy--subsidy for large construction  projects, agricultural development matching funds, and price  subsidies and so on. (iv) Extraordinary subsidy--primarily to  aid large natural disasters and other extraordinary events. In  short, through transfer of payment, we can strengthen the  financial ministry's role as lever and strengthen the central  government's macroeconomic regulation and control capability. In  the future, the high level financial departments should guide  the lower level departments not by "red-heading documents" and  administrative orders but mainly by enticing them with financial  gains.    4. Actively create conditions and adopt unified  objective standards and scientific method to determine revenue  and expenditure bases. One of the important features of the  classified tax system is the adoption of the factoring method to  calculate revenue and expenditure, but because of various  limitations, implementing that method requires a long process.  Except for the first year of the classified tax system--that is,  in 1994--when we will continue to use the base-year method  because we don't have much time, we should adopt some  transitional methods in subsequent years and draw closer to the  factoring method in steps. Specifically, we should calculate the  per-capita financial revenue capacity based on the legally-set  tax rate and actual tax base and other factors and use those as  basis for determining the percentage or amount of various  subsidies. In calculating spending, we can use a combination of  the factoring and base methods. That is, we should adhere to the  principle of the factoring method, treat the original base as a  "historical factor," take it into consideration along with other  objective factors, and integrate ordinary needs with  extraordinary needs and theoretical spending base with actual  spending base. While we should take vested interests into  consideration, we should not try to protect all vested  interests. We should make ordinary needs the base and use  extraordinary needs to readjust and amend ordinary needs. In  actual operation, first, we should determine a national  per-capita spending norm and then consider various objective  factors that can affect that norm and come up with a revision  coefficient for making revisions and adjustments and verify all  aspects of the spending base. At the beginning, we can use a  "rough" figure (be as simple and direct as possible.) The  proportion of objective factors can be smaller, and except for  such basic factors as population, land, and administrative  districts which determine expenditures, the main factor is the  special subsidies. Later, the objective factors should  proportionally play a larger role and historical factors a  smaller role, and we should be even more scientific and precise  in our calculations until we implement the factoring method in  full.  <H5>  IV. Establishing Local Taxation Systems </H5>   The core of the local tax systems consists of three issues:  the scope of local income, legislative and administrative  jurisdiction, and installation of tax organs.    1. Expand the scope of local tax revenues. We hope  to see a gradual increase in the share of local taxes to 30  percent of the state's total tax revenues and 70-80 percent of  the total local revenues. We must foster and develop sources of  tax revenues using this as basis. In developing local tax  systems, we should expand local revenues' "two proportions": The  first is the proportion of local revenues to local national  income. In particular, we should change the situation where the  non-state-owned economy contributes a disproportionate share of  revenues. Secondly, when local governments gather funds in  society, they should increase the proportion of tax revenues and  reduce the share of non-tax revenues, so as to gradually  eliminate the "three chaos." After the implementation of the  classified tax system, in the near-term, the bulk of local tax  revenues will come from the circulation and service sectors.  Therefore the localities must vigorously develop tertiary  industry and enliven commercial circulation, and while they  actively promote the development of the state-owned economy and  collective economy, they must also encourage individual and  private economies. In addition, we must pay attention to  protecting, developing, and utilizing local resources and  develop more sources of resource tax (resource tax should best  be allocated to the localities or be shared based on different  tax rates in the future.)    2. Expand local (referring to provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions) legislative organs'  power to legislate local taxation. Basic laws pertaining to  local taxation nationwide should be formulated by the central  government, and within the scope of the basic laws' regulations,  local people's congresses may consider local conditions to  formulate implementation methods and individual laws applicable  to some local tax categories. They should have the right to  determine the scope of taxation, the tax rate, the amount, and  the starting point of taxation as well as the right to decide  when to begin or stop taxing and to grant tax exemption and  reduction. We must enhance the local people's congresses'  legislative authority and strengthen the local people's  congresses and governments' concept of being responsible to the  masses and the taxpayers. Characteristically, local taxes are  "taken from the localities to be spent on the localities," and  the localities should have greater autonomy. They must "open the  front door and close the back door." As long as the central  government's interests are not being compromised, as long as the  unity of the nation's basic orders is not jeopardized, the  central government should not interfere with the tax laws and  regulations local people's congresses have introduced through  normal legislative processes. Central authorities and local  supervisory departments may check and rectify taxes and fees  that have not been legislated through normal procedure, and  local parties may refuse to carry out the orders.    3. Set up branch tax organs. In the wake of the  implementation of the classified tax system, we must set up  separate central and local tax organs to collect and manage  state and local taxes. We have already reached a consensus on  this point. The question now is how to set up those tax organs  after introducing the classified tax system. We have two  options: One, we can turn the existing tax organs into state tax  bureaus and local tax bureaus. Two, we can turn the existing tax  organs into state tax bureaus and set up local tax bureaus using  the agricultural tax department and financial department as  bases. We think the second option is better, because we can  avoid the trouble and complication of having to "divide up the  people, household, and properties" in the process; it can help  steady the cadres' minds and will not affect current tax  collection. Moreover, letting the localities themselves set up  local tax organs is something local governments value and  support, and they can provide the conditions and basis in terms  of setup, funding, and leadership and functional mainstay. Our  concrete suggestions for setting up local tax organs are: (i)  Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should be the  basic units responsible for setting up local tax organs. They  should suit measures to local conditions. In principle, local  tax bureaus should be set up in provinces (municipalities and  autonomous regions,) cities (autonomous prefectures,) and  counties (cities); city-administered districts should have local  tax branch bureau; township and urban district branch bureaus  should set up local tax offices. As the provincial government's  agencies, prefectural administrative offices generally should  not set up local tax bureaus, but, if agreed by the province or  autonomous region, some localities may set up local tax bureaus  so long as they retain their existing prefecture-level budgetary  status. (ii) Local financial departments and local tax organs  should implement the leadership management system of "hanging up  two signs but having one leading group." The head of the  province-level financial department (bureau) should serve as  head of the province-level local tax bureau; financial bureau  chiefs and department heads at below-province-level become local  tax bureau chiefs and local tax department heads at the  corresponding levels. Local tax bureaus should not set up party  organs; they should be led by the financial departments' party  organs at the corresponding levels. (iii) Local tax system at  above county-level will not provide vertical leadership; the  higher-level tax departments are responsible for guiding and  supervising lower-level local tax departments. Urban local tax  branch offices and township (town) local tax offices are  agencies of local tax bureaus at the next-higher level; their  bureau chiefs and department heads are appointed and dismissed  by the higher-level local tax bureaus, and a dual leadership  system should be implemented, with the higher-level local tax  bureaus having more say. (iv) Construction of local tax organs  must begin before the classified tax system is introduced and  should go into operation when the new system goes into effect.  The most urgent task now is to develop the system, set up the  framework, and hang up the shingle, and we can worry about  personnel and facilities later.  <H5>  V. Improve Government Budget Management According to </H5> Classified Tax Principles    To implement the classified tax system, we must make budget  management even more legislation-oriented, more standardized,  and more systematic, so as to truly give expression to the  principle that each level of political power can administer its  own finances and has its own budget.    1. We must have independent budgets at separate  levels. Setting up independent budgets at separate levels  is the centralized manifestation of graded financial  administration. In some sense, China's existing local budgets  are budget in name only; in fact they are not independent, and  they have no fixed source of income. Local budgeted income and  spending are include in the state's total budget; there is no  independent legislative right to have a budget. Therefore, we  must promptly strengthen budget legislation and follow the  Constitution to delineate the budget management jurisdiction of  the people's congresses and their standing committees and of  governments at all levels and their financial offices and  clarify the central and local government organs' authority in  checking, approving, legislating, and supervising the budgets.  For each level to administer its finances and have its own  budget, we must separate local budgets from the state budget, so  that the state's budget only include the central government's  budget. Localities should gather their own income and plan their  own spending according to their scope of responsibilities and  amount of local taxes when preparing their budgets which must be  approved by the local legislative organs to make them more rigid  and binding.    2. Establish a budget management system that is  compatible with the restructuring of the administrative organs  and the classified tax system. After implementing the  classified tax system, financial administration should take the  following form: It should consist of two levels of regulation  and control (central and provincial,) three levels of  administration (central, provincial, and county) and four levels  of operation (central, provincial, county, and township.) We  should follow this pattern to determine the duties of financial  administrations at each level and standardize their financial  conduct and smooth the financial relations between levels. In  particular, we should standardize the method of computation and  allocation basis and principle in the transfer of payment  (subsidies, loans, and interests) from the central government to  the localities, so as to strengthen the state budget's ability  to regulate and control and balance society's overall financial  strength and strengthen its rights and responsibility to guide  local budgeting behavior. We should further improve the  budgeting procedure and make the process tighter and more  scientific. Under the state's unified policy guidance, each  level should prepare and report its own budget; deficits will  not be made up by the central government, so that each level  truly manages and balances its own budget.    3. Actively promote the double-entry budget system and  separate "grocery money" from "operating funds." Double-entry  budget includes government budget, state-owned asset management  budget, social security budget and so on. Double-entry budget as  a modern budget form has inseparable internal ties with the  classified system and must be installed together. The  double-entry budget should make laws and regulations the  criteria and give expression to the characteristics of graded  financial administration. We should use double-entry budget to  make financial administration more transparent. It must  separately reflect how regular and construction funds are being  balanced, so as to help party and government leaders at all  levels to make analyses and decisions, facilitate the people's  congresses in their budget supervision, and help governments at  all levels to adhere to the principles of "doing one's best and  gauging one's ability" and "feed the people first, build later."  The most important thing is to "have food on the table" and then  worry about construction. No deficit is allowed in regular  budgets.    4. Strengthen ta x collection and management and  prevent loss of revenue. To separate the "legislation" and  the "enforcement" of taxation, separate "tax law" from  "taxation," and tighten the relationship between financial  administration and taxation, we must include tax work in the  centralized planning and execution of financial undertakings at  each level. In the past, we went overboard in reducing taxes and  yielding profits and incurred losses as a result, and it has  also led to today's improper interest pattern. That is water  under the bridge now, but there is still a lesson to be learned.  We must insist on curbing arbitrary tax reduction and exemption  and tax contracting in its actual or disguised forms  (circulation tax should never be contracted; contracting of  enterprise income tax should be stopped with the "separation of  taxes and profits.") We must link the strengthening of tax  management and collection to the anti-corruption activities and  the crackdown on unhealthy practices in the grass-roots collecti  on units. We should quickly set up and amplify the tax report  system and the open tax return system and strengthen supervision  and auditing. In particular, we should take advantage of the  fact that after the implementation of the classified tax system,  local governments at all levels will have a better sense of  their financial roles, and with the party and government  leaders' increased attention, we can raise the standard of tax  collection and management and minimize the incidents of tax  evasion, tax loopholes, and export tax fraud.    5. Improve extra-budgetary fund management and curb  external fund circulation. Implementation of the classified  tax system will create the positive environment and conditions  for improving and strengthening extra-budgetary fund management.  First, after the implementation of classified tax system, all  extra-budgetary funds managed by the local financial departments  can be included in the local budgets, ending the separate  management of two kinds of funds at the same level. Second,  administration-related charges must be separated into revenues  and expenditures and put into the budget. Extra-budgetary funds  managed by institutional units should be carefully sorted out  and clarified and included in the local budget where possible.  The portion that cannot be included in local budgets must be  included in the unit's revenue and expenditure plan to offset  spending or to be spent along with the state's allocated funds.  Moreover, as enterprises' management mechanisms change, and with  the implementation of the "two principles," and in particular,  with the gradual improvement of the modern enterprise system,  the extra-budgetary funds managed by state-owned enterprises is  essentially different today; they are no longer extra-budgetary  funds, and after careful checking and examination, they should  be legally deemed enterprise funds, to be put under enterprises'  own disposal. Thereupon, we must draw the line between  government funds and enterprise funds and resolutely block the  local governments from "stashing their wealth in enterprises,"  preventing them from turning budgetary funds into  extra-budgetary funds.    6. Strengthen financial legislation. We should  take into consideration the new situation after the  restructuring of the economic system and the introduction of the  classified tax system to sort out the financial laws and  regulations, and depending on the situation, we should amplify,  supplement, and amend or abolish some of them. We should change  the old practice of relying on government documents in lieu of  the people's congress's legislation, and in particular,  important laws and regulations pertaining to financial  administration and local taxation must be formally promulgated  and implemented by local legislative organs according to legal  procedure. We must resolutely overcome the tendency to rely on  words instead of laws or power instead of laws and refrain from  being arbitrary when fulfilling the budget.    Besides the above-described situations, in order to meet the  needs of the classified tax system, we should adopt other budget  management measures. For example, not only should we use the  factoring method to calculate and allocate the central  government's portion of transfer of payment, we should carefully  separate the transfer of payment in the central government's  budget, not only in preparing the budget but also in the bases.  We should strengthen the management of bonds; local-issued bonds  should be evaluated and debated by the central government.  <H5>  VI. Several Noteworthy Issues in Implementing the Classified </H5> Tax System    1. The issue of preventing distortions during  reform. Most people are very confident about the classified  tax system, but some comrades are worried that because of the  complicated situation and because of strong local interests,  there will be a lot of resistance, and if not done right, the  classified tax system can be distorted: One, we may have the  "classified tax system as a shell with the contract system at  its core"; two, we may have "classified tax administration in  form but in effect we may be "returning to state monopoly of  revenues ad expenditures." In our view, the first concern is not  completely baseless, and we should pay close attention. In  implementing the classified tax system, it is inevitable that we  will have to make certain "compromises" when dealing with  various conflicts and interest relations; without compromises,  we cannot begin to take care of everybody's interests. But this  kind of compromise should not violate the principles of reform;  they cannot obliterate the basic characteristics of the  classified tax system. The so called classified tax must at  least uphold six things: One, it must not expand the scope of  percentage revenue retention; two, it must clearly delineate  administrative power, and financial power and administrative  power must be fully integrated; three, it must not follow the  old tax base method; four, it must not allow central and local  governments to usurp their power in granting tax reductions and  exemptions; five, it must not permit arbitrary subsidies and  appropriations; six, it must not perpetrate the kind of "idling"  seen in the pilot classified tax system. Failing to comply with  the above, the classified tax system will be a fraud. Of course,  as we said before, because our classified tax system is based on  the contract system, at the beginning (specifically in 1994 and  1995,) it will retain some of the contents and practices of the  contract system. But in our minds, we must clearly understand  that this is the new system's temporary "concession" to the old  system, but it cannot be permanent. To "take a step backward" is  for the sake of "taking two steps forward." With the passing of  time and as various conditions are met, traces of the old system  must slowly be removed, and the reform goals of the new system  must be gradually attained. This is the concrete meaning of the  radical and gradual nature of reform. As for the second concern,  we think it is but a misunderstanding; it reflects errors in  some comrades' understanding. We should point out that the  financial contract system was a negation and abandonment of the  system of state monopoly of revenues and expenditures; it was  progress. The classified tax system, as an even more advanced  stage of graded financial management, is an extension and  advancement of the contract system. In implementing the  classified tax system, we are correcting the defects of the  contract system marked by the dispersion of financial strength;  it strengthens the central government's macroeconomic regulation  and control and is in no way a "restoration" of the system of  state monopoly of revenues and expenditure. The biggest  difference between the system of state monopoly of revenues and  expenditures and the classified tax system is that the former  overly emphasizes "centralization" and ignores "autonomy," and  in some sense it turns the localities into the central  government's accounting units. The latter system pays attention  to "proper degree of centralization" while emphasizing "legal  autonomy," and it adheres closely to the theme of establishing a  macroeconomic regulation and control system and takes care of  the central and local governments' interests at the same time,  and in turn it brings the enthusiasm of the central and local  governments into play. In our opinion, we must do a good  propaganda and explanatory job, and at the same time, when  concentrating the central government's financial strength, we  should pay attention to the proper "degree" and avoid dampening  the enthusiasm and initiative of local financial administration.  Reform must be substantive and avoid giving the people the  impression that except for handing a few important tax  categories to the central government, everything will stay the  same.    2. The issue of regulating financial interests among  the regions. Within a unified country and given the same  tax burden, citizens living in regions of different economic  conditions will receive unequal public services. This is unfair  but realistic. Reasonable and proper adjustments are necessary.  "Adjust" does not mean "equalize." The national economy is an  organic integral whole. No one region must support another  region. Support must be mutual, and without mutual support,  there will be no rapid and coordinated national economic  development. We must stand on the high plane of the whole  situation and adhere to the principle of fairness and efficiency  to resolve this issue. Specifically, there are two things: One,  the amount of "grocery money" should be more or less the same  for all. There should be protective policy to help regions that  cannot meet basic needs; we must gradually narrow today's  differences. The other thing is that "operating funds" should be  planned based on how they affect the layout of and benefit the  nation's construction; measures should suit the times and local  conditions. In this respect, perhaps we can learn from  Australia's and Germany's "equality" and "fairness." We can set  up some very rigid laws and work out a simple formula for  computing the transfer of payment, and all subsidies and aids  must be calculated according to that formula without  negotiations.    3. The issue of the actual application of the factoring  method. The factoring method is fairly complicated, and we  will inevitably run into many problems in practice, but we have  no choice. Without the factoring method, the classified tax  system will not be a scientific system. Therefore we must  concentrate our efforts on investigation and studies and learn  from other countries' experiences. In particular, when choosing  the factors, we must solicit ideas from all regions. We suggest  that the financial departments set up a special organ to study  and work out the factoring method and come up with a specific  implementation program for the leaders to examine and make a  decision on and legally put it into effect upon promulgation.    4. The issue of resolving the conflict between "tax  break" and "tax discrimination." Based on the principle of fair  competition in a market economy, we should set our preferential  policy based on industry and not on economic nature or  jurisdictional relations, even less should we extend preferences  to individual enterprises. To attract foreign investments, we  should work on improving the investment environment and not  focus simply on tax reduction or exemption. To extend one-sided  preferential treatment to foreign-funded enterprises is to  discriminate against domestic-funded enterprises. In the future,  domestic and foreign enterprises should pay the same income-tax,  and except for the free-trade zones, we should not grant foreign  companies tax-breaks within Chinese territories. After  implementing the classified tax system, domestic-funded  enterprises' taxes should be administered at different levels  according to the law; foreign-funded enterprises' tax collection  and administration involve national interests and therefore we  must em phasize centralization.    5. The issue of other related reforms. Primarily,  they are (i) reform of the tax system; (ii) reform of the  administrative organs' personnel assignment system; (iii)  further deepening of reforms of various specific financial  systems based on the criteria of the "two principles"; (iv)  continued implementation of the "Provision" to change  enterprises' management mechanisms and go all out to promote  reform to "separate profits from taxes," (v) reform of the  state-owned asset management system; (vi) reform of the state  treasury system. Among these other necessary reforms, the most  important is the reform of the tax system. It should follow the  laws of the socialist market economy, adhere to the principle of  fair tax burden and encouragement of competition, and meet the  need to raise the "two proportions." In view of the fact that  the circulation tax has traditionally been China's most  important tax, in the near-term reform, it is both necessary and  possible for us to set up a three-tax-two-regulation pattern  comprising of the value-added tax as the primary tax and  supplemented by the consumption tax and business tax. But in the  longer time-span, as the classified tax system develops, we  should strengthen the income tax and develop the resource tax.  The change or development in the circulation tax is based on the  rate of economic growth; income tax's development and change is  based on economic efficiency. Income tax has a great future;  many countries that practice the modern market economic system  are relying primarily on the income tax. It is our opinion that  it is quite likely that China will embark on this path in the  future.    6. The issue of properly linking the old and the new  systems. When the system changes tracks, it should "shift  without confusion" and "change in an orderly fashion."  Specifically, the central and local financial administrations  and tax bureaus should work together to make meticulous  preparations and keep in touch and pay attention to possible  cracks and loopholes. They must vigorously encourage people to  consider the whole situation, submit to the whole situation, do  everything according to the law, banish the tendency to grab  power and shirk responsibility, and to look beyond  self-interests. We should guard against those who fiddle with  the base numbers and artificially generate revenue surpluses or  shortfalls, avoid paying unnecessary price in implementing the  classified tax system, and maximize the positive effects while  minimizing the negative effects, so as to ensure steady  development of financial administration at all levels, striving  for double bumper harvest in structural reform and financial  administration.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: US bank advances to Dollars 48.5m MARINE Midland Banks, the US bank which is an indirectly-held, wholly-owned subsidiary of London-based HSBC Holdings, yesterday reported an increase in net income in the third quarter, agencies report. Income for the period advanced to USDollars 48.5m and to Dollars 127.8m for the year to date. This compares with net income of Dollars 29.9m and Dollars 73.5m for the corresponding periods in 1992. The bank lifted net interest income to Dollars 189.2m for the quarter, from Dollars 173.7m last time, mainly because of favourable margins and increased credit card assets. Other operating income for the quarter declined to Dollars 50.5m, compared with Dollars 82m for the same period in 1992. 'This decline is primarily attributable to a one-time gain from the sale of mortgage-backed securities in the third quarter of 1992, and decreasing amounts of fee income from securitised credit card assets and mortgage servicing,' the bank said. Marine's tier one risk-weighted asset ratio increased to 9.85 per cent for the third quarter, compared with 9.29 per cent for the third quarter of 1992. The bank's total risk-based capital ratio was 16.76 per cent in the third quarter, compared with 17.09 per cent for the third quarter of 1992.</p>

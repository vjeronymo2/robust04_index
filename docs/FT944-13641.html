			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Prospect to pay Pounds 11.7m for Whessoe piping side Prospect Industries, the engineering services company, has agreed to acquire the piping systems division of Whessoe for Pounds 11.7m. The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 83.2m new shares to Whessoe at 14p apiece, which will be placed with institutional investors. Prospect also plans to raise Pounds 1m towards the costs of the acquisition and placing with the issue of 7.07m new ordinary shares at the same price. Qualifying shareholders will be invited to apply for 69.4m shares on a 1-for-3 basis. The piping systems division of Whessoe trades as Aiton in the UK and Connex in the US, and is involved in the design and manufacture of pipeworks for nuclear and fossil fuelled power generation plants. For the 10-month period to July 31 it incurred an operating loss of Pounds 2.7m on turnover of Pounds 22.7m. According to Whessoe, this was the result of a lack of orders, an unsuitable product mix and contractual delays. Prospect's directors attribute its poor performance to relocation and management changes at Connex, and believe the division is 'already recovering from these setbacks'. The piping systems business has a large, under-used fabrication plant in Derby. Prospect intends to move its UK repair, maintenance and piping businesses onto this site, and to integrate the management and purchasing of its new acquisition with one of its operating companies, Dunn. Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman of Prospect, said it was a 'unique opportunity to expand its marketplace from a reduced cost base'.</p>

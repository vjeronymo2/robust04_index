			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Shevardnadze hope of Karabakh peace: Georgian leader optimistic of chances of settlement in Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the president of Georgia, said yesterday there 'were grounds for optimism' for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have been fighting for five years over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The former Soviet foreign minister also warned that the forces of democracy in Russia were 'more troubled than ever' warnedthat their defeat would be 'a disastrous event for the world.' Mr Shevardnadze said that in recent meetings with Mr Levan Ter-Petrossyan, the Armenian president, and Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the Azerbaijani president, he had found there was the political will to attempt a negotiated settlement. 'I think that we have come to the point when all our people are tired of this conflict. We (three Caucasian presidents) are all of the same mind,' he said. Mr Shevardnadze said concessions from both sides had been discussed - and that both sides would 'bring these ideas out in negotiations.' Mr Elchibey said at the weekend that 'in one or two months, the psychology of peace will show its head' and that the three presidents, together with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, 'have common thoughts, common ideas among ourselves'. He warned, however, that reactionary forces in Russia and in the Caucasian states were blocking peace initiatives. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has claimed nearly 3,000 lives and was further escalated when Armenian and Karabakh forces established a land bridge through Azerbaijani territory last summer. Over the past few days, Armenian forces have taken Azerbaijani villages to the north of Karabakh, following earlier setbacks. Mr Shevardnadze hopes to convene a meeting of the Caucasian presidents, probably in Tblisi, to seek a basis for negotiation. He calls his project an attempt to create 'a peaceful sky over the Caucasus'. He also hopes to involve the north Caucasian republics in Russia. The Georgian leader also expressed hope that agreements, due to be signed between Georgia and Russia over the next two weeks, would produce a better climate for a settlement of the conflict in the Georgian province of Abkhazia where separatist forces are fighting Georgian troops. He said Russia could play a 'positive role in settling the conflict' - though he accused units of the Russian military and mercenaries from the Russian north Caucasus of supporting the Abkhazians. He said that he thought it was a 'possibility' that United Nations troops would be involved in Abkhazia. The Georgian economy is suffering from acute energy and other shortages. Mr Shevardnadze said that former Georgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia had made a 'tragic mistake' breaking trade and other links with Russia.</p>

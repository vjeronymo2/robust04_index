			<p>BFN     [Text] In the view of Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] defense expert, Erwin Horn, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union --CDU) will have to close down some  of the Bundeswehr's facilities. Talking to BILD AM SONNTAG,  Horn said: "Urged by the government coalition, the defense  minister seems to be planning to cheat the voters. He says that  all the garrisons will be maintained, even if the Bundeswehr is  cut down in forces. But in fact, under the Ruehe concept there  will be several barracks where there will only be uniformed  caretakers left, who will maintain the buildings. These  facilities will, of course, no longer be used for military  purposes. The full truth will not emerge until after the  Bundestag elections, when a number of barracks will be closed  down for cost reasons."    Horn demands: "The tasks of the Bundeswehr have to be  clearly defined now, so that the army can be made smaller and  more efficient." The SPD politician is offering to cooperate on  this matter: "I will support the CDU minister in this honest  and important task, even if his concept includes closing down  several garrisons. But the voters must be told the truth before  polling day!"</p>

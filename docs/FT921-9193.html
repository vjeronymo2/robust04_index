			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls on lower yen and bond prices THE LOWER yen and bond prices, and worries about developments in an alleged bribery scandal discouraged market participants, and the Nikkei average lost ground in low activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, which lost 287.60 on Monday, gave up another 277.88 to close at 21,541.64. The index opened at the day's high of 21,781.44 but fell on small-lot arbitrage-related selling, hitting the session's low of 21,475.60 in the afternoon. Volume rose to 170m shares from 137m. Dealers continued to dominate trading, though some light basket buying by foreigners was noted. News yesterday that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed in principle to parliamentary testimony by key figures in the Kyowa bribery scandal raised fears of political repercussions. Market participants were cautious about the near - term outlook for equities. 'Domestic institutions are done with trading for the year,' said Mr Dan Kerrigan at County NatWest, adding that large moves in the market before the March book closing were unlikely. Declines led advances by 823 to 139, with 129 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 18.13 to 2,428.72, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.38 to 1,219.58. All first section sectors, except paper stocks, lost ground. In the morning, some shares were supported by comments from Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, that Japan should carry out a redenomination of the yen to boost the economy. Mr Watanabe said in a speech on Tuesday that redenomination would help create new jobs and demand through replacement of computers and vending machines. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said that his ministry was not considering such a move. Nevertheless, paper and printing shares gained on prospects of new money being printed. Oji Paper advanced Y7 to Y862, but Dai Nippon Ink surrendered an early rise to profit-taking, finishing unaltered at Y1,490. A total of 22 issues reached new lows since January last year, including Fujitsu, which lost Y12 to Y770. It said that unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the current year to March would be down 60 per cent, while consolidated figures are forecast to fall by 80 per cent. Other high-technology issues were also weak, with NEC declining Y20 to Y1,150 and Hitachi falling Y17 to Y877. Precision instrument makers continued to fall after last week's decision by a US district court to charge Minolta Camera for patent infringement. Minolta ended Y30 cheaper at Y470 and Nikon relinquished Y29 to Y821. In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 264.58 to 23,217.15 in volume of 108.5m shares. Roundup SENTIMENT was mixed in the Pacific Rim, as Hong Kong reversed Tuesday's decline and Seoul fell for the third consecutive day. HONG KONG rebounded strongly at the close, almost wiping out Tuesday's 59-point correction. The Hang Seng index climbed 57.91 or 1.24 per cent to 4,732.43. Turnover decreased to HKDollars 1.9bn from HKDollars 2.4bn. Laggards were sought, Hong Kong &amp; China Gas rising 70 cents to HKDollars 13.30 and topping the most active list. The utility was also supported by rumours of a covered warrant issue and strong earnings growth. SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrials index ended 2.82 lower at 1,521.10, in turnover of SDollars 133.5m, against SDollars 167.4m. City Developments fell 14 cents to SDollars 4.12 in heavy volume on rumours, later denied, that a leading member of the Kwek family, the biggest shareholders in CityDev, was seriously ill. KUALA LUMPUR pulled back from the day's lows on bargain hunting. The composite index lost 3.70 at 600.75 in turnover of 61.9m (91.6m). SEOUL's decline continued, the composite index dipping 10.09 to 664.23 in turnover of Won341.5bn. Concern over possible bankruptcies of small companies hung over trading. TAIWAN ended slightly lower as the correction to last month's gains continued. The weighted index shed 10.44 to 5,061.60 as turnover fell to TDollars 32.8bn from TDollars 47.4bn. AUSTRALIA lost ground in early trading on publication of disappointing December retail sales figures, but recovered well later. The All Ordinaries index gained a net 1.7 at 1,617.1 in a turnover of ADollars 256.4m. TNT rose 8 cents to ADollars 1.85 following reports that Federal Express was considering restructuring. News Corp fell 8 cents to ADollars 15.70. After hours, it announced a 38 per cent rise in half-year profits, better than market expectations. NEW ZEALAND showed further improvement but ended off the day's high: the NZSE - 40 index put on 9.72 to 1,477.64 in turnover of NZDollars 23.5m. Telecom and Fletcher Challenge both gained 4 cents to NZDollars 2.39 and NZDollars 3.46. MANILA recovered on local sentiment: the composite index gained 12.69 to 1,225.48 in turnover of 155m pesos. BANGKOK gained in active trading, the SET index adding 14.53 at 801.44 in turnover of Bt11bn. Banks were strong on a half-point cut in prime rates from tomorrow. BOMBAY soared to a record intra-day high of 2,337.75 before closing at 2,305.38, up 31.91 or 1.4 per cent.</p>

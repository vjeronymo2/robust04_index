			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KANSAN FOLLOWS A DISTANT DRUMMER WITH 'NO' VOTE  </P> <P> When Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) cast the lone GOP vote Thursday  against John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary, it was just the latest  example of an independent streak that has earned her respect in both parties.  </P> <P> Three years ago, the daughter of 1936 Republican presidential nominee Alfred M.  Landon bucked the Ronald Reagan Administration by voting for economic sanctions  against South Africa and by helping to lead the Senate in an override of the  President's veto.  </P> <P> More recently, Kassebaum challenged the Reagan Administration's policy of  seeking a military solution to the Nicaraguan civil war, and she has voiced  abortion positions that set her apart from most other Senate Republicans.  </P> <P> "Nobody can say she is an automatic, hard-line party vote," one Senate aide  said. "She has strong conservative views and more often than not votes with her  party, but she votes her own mind, that's for sure."  </P> <P> On Thursday, Kassebaum, 56, released a four-page statement explaining her  opposition to Tower, saying: "I have discussed this matter in some detail with  the President. I believe he understands my thinking just as I understand his."  </P> <P> In prepared comments that the publicity shy Kassebaum did not actually deliver  on the Senate floor, she charged that Tower's work for defense contractors  shortly after leaving his position as a U.S. arms-control negotiator "raises  very serious concerns about the nominee's judgment."  </P> <P> Kassebaum, who formerly headed the Senate's Military Reform Caucus, suggested  that the Pentagon procurement scandal has shaken public support for defense  spending and said that Tower's actions, while not illegal, "demonstrate to me  an enormous insensitivity to issues and questions that have been at the heart  of our defense debate for years."  </P> <P> The Kansas senator, sensitive to allegations that Tower is a womanizer, also  questioned whether he would "demonstrate the necessary sensitivity" to women's  rights issues in the military. She noted a recent Pentagon study indicating  that women face serious problems with harassment and promotion in the armed  forces.  </P> <P> Until her statement was released an hour before Thursday's vote, Kassebaum took  no part in the often vitriolic Senate debate. But she criticized the "circus  atmosphere" surrounding the nomination, contending that the news media had been  irresponsible in reporting allegations about Tower that had not been proved.  </P></p>

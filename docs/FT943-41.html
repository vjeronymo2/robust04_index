			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Trade and the World Economy (30): A test of resolve - Trade / Guy de Jonquieres on the Morocco agreement When almost 120 governments signed the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April, they committed themselves to the most sweeping world trade liberalisation in history. Now, the strength of their good intentions is to be put to the test. Their first task is to ratify the round in time to implement it on schedule early next year, and simultaneously to establish the new World Trade Organisation, the grander successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The biggest doubts about the timetable have long centred on the US Congress. After months of wrangling and partisan strife ahead of November's congressional elections, prospects for swift ratification have recently brightened. President Clinton has, however, been forced to pay a heavy price by dropping his simultaneous request for 'fast track' authority for new trade agreements. Without such authority, the administration will find it much harder to negotiate planned free-trade deals with other countries, notably in Latin America. There are also uncertainties about the fate of the Uruguay Round in the European Union, where ratification has become entangled in a jurisidictional dispute between the Council of Ministers and the Brussels Commission, and in Japan, where continuing political upheavals have disrupted the parliamentary calendar. These difficulties have not, however, deterred Gatt members from pressing ahead with plans to set up the WTO in January and to select its first leader. The WTO will enjoy a number of advantages over the Gatt, which has operated on a 'provisional' basis since it was formed in 1947. They include a formal legal structure, stronger mechanisms for settling international trade disputes and a much wider remit, spanning sectors such as agriculture, services and intellectual property rights. The WTO is intended to develop into a permanent negotiating forum, which will replace omnibus trade rounds, and to play a prominent role alongside the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in fostering global economic co-ordination. But realising these ambitions will place heavy demands on the cohesion and sense of purpose of the WTO and its members, at a time when rapidly accelerating changes in the world economy are creating many new tensions. The new WTO head is expected to play a crucial role in providing the direction and leadership needed to keep the multilateral trade system moving forward. Among the challenges ahead are: Holding governments to their Uruguay Round pledges to liberalise long-protected and politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture and textiles. Formulating new rules for trade in services and foreign investment, both largely uncharted policy areas which involve delicate issues of sovereignty. Coping with pressures, notably from the US, to involve the WTO in politically contentious matters such as the links between trade, labour standards and environmental policy. Admitting about 20 further countries, including China and members of the former Soviet Union. These tasks have to be tackled against a background of confusing - and sometimes conflicting - international economic trends. The past decade has witnessed dramatic advances in global interdependence, as national borders have crumbled under the impact of past trade liberalisation, enhanced capital mobility and technological advances, particularly in communications. These trends have helped to stimulate rapid economic and exports growth in much of the developing world, notably in Asia, steadily shifting the centre of gravity of the world economy and international trade away from the industrialised powers. At the same time, however, intensified global competition threatens to provoke negative reactions within countries, as governments come under pressure to shelter vulnerable domestic constituencies from painful adjustment to forces outside their control. So far, the temptation to respond by erecting higher trade barriers across the board has been resisted. In the US, it has been deflected into aggressively unilateralist trade initiatives - notably towards Japan - and more activist industrial and export promotion policies. In the EU, the worst fears of a 'Fortress Europe' have not materialised. But EU attitudes remain delicately balanced between the protectionist inclinations of southern members, led by France, and the traditionally more liberal northern countries. Furthermore, the EU is seen by many trading partners as suffering from a myopic preoccupation with internal problems, which has inhibited it from addressing decisively new global economic opportunities and challenges. Cutting across these trends, in both developing and industrialised countries, is a proliferation of bilateral and sometimes overlapping regional economic arrangements, exemplified by the North American Free Trade Area, the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, and the Latin American Mercosur grouping. These groupings are impelled by a variety of motives. As well as improving access to export markets, these include the desire to 'lock in' domestic economic reforms, efforts to forge regional solidarity, the quest for increased influence over international economic policy and the simple fear of being left out. The stampede towards regional link-ups seems curiously at odds with the accelerating pace of global economic integration and the strengthened multilateral disciplines in the Uruguay Round. However, advocates of regional blocs often argue that, rather than fragmenting the world trading system they contribute to its long-term development by promoting liberalisation between their members. So far, regional trading arrangements do not appear to have led to higher barriers against non-members. But the evidence is less clear on how far they have stimulated increased trade flows or merely diverted existing ones. A possibly greater threat could be posed to the integrity of the multilateral system if members of bigger regional blocs use their collective weight to try to pressure other countries into accepting their own rules and regulations in return for improved market access. That risk, however, is only likely to materialise if negotiations within regional blocs prove a more effective way of achieving consensus on liberalisation than is available through the WTO. Nonetheless, persuading governments to treat regional trade deals as building blocks towards - rather than alternatives to - truly global liberalisation is likely to pose one of the stiffest tests of the WTO's ability to establish its authority.</p>

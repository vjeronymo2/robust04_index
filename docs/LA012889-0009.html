			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JUDGE ASKED TO LET RAIDERS DEAL PROCEED  </P> <P> The city of Irwindale on Friday asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles  E. Jones to lift his order blocking completion of final financial and  contractual arrangements to build the proposed Raiders football stadium in the  San Gabriel Valley community.  </P> <P> A filing by Irwindale attorneys contended that in preparing and approving an  environmental impact report on the stadium project, the city has fully complied  with the terms of a September, 1987, court order.  </P> <P> John Belcher, an attorney for Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who  brought the suit that resulted in the court issuing its temporary restraining  order requiring a satisfactory environmental impact report, said Friday that  his side has 10 days to contest the Irwindale filing but may decide not to do  so.  </P> <P> Should the court lift its order, Irwindale authorities will then try to secure  financing and reach a satisfactory final deal with Los Angeles Raiders owner Al  Davis for construction of the planned 62,500-seat stadium.  </P></p>

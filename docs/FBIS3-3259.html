Agriculture, peasants, and the rural economy heading for the  market is historically inevitable. However, this is not a  simple thing. Nor can we get the desired results simply by  removing restrictions. Although the broad masses of peasants  have been tempered in commodity production for many years since  the beginning of reform and opening up, and the market is  playing a more and more important role in agriculture and the  rural economy, this remains a new task for both the broad masses  of rural cadres and hundreds of millions of peasants. What are  the responsibilities of government departments in this process?  How should they give guidance to the peasants? How should they  organize people to blaze new trails? How should thousands upon  thousands of households be merged with the market? Who should  provide information in a larger scope? How should various kinds  of risks be shared? All these questions demand exploration and  prompts answers in practice.    In recent years, various localities have gained some  successful experiences in the transition to the socialist market  economy, and they also have encountered some new problems. We  have opened this new column today to report questions on "How  Peasants Head for the Market" in a concentrated manner. We  warmly and sincerely welcome articles on successful experiences,  good methods, feelings, understandings, questions, and even  perplexity so long as they contribute to mutual exchange and  mutual enlightenment.</p>

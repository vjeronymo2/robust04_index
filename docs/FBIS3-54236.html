			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Major General Yitzhaq  Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command, told our army  affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David tonight that Hizballah has  been trying for 24 hours to escalate the confrontation in  Lebanon.    [Begin recording] [Ben-David] Now that the meeting with  President Clinton is over, have the Syrians let the reins loose  again in Lebanon?    [Mordekhay] It was anticipated that on the day the talks  open in Washington they will escalate the situation and try to  make Hizballah and the confrontation in Lebanon the top news  item, since this has usually been the way they have acted when  talks begin. I believe we have the necessary answers and the  confrontation continues in the security zone.    [Ben-David] Do you think that as long as the negotiations  continue and no progress is made there the Syrians will continue  to conduct the war in Lebanon?    [Mordekhay] We believed in the past and still believe that  if the Syrians want, they can significantly restrain Hizballah  activities in south Lebanon against the security zone, the SLA  [South Lebanese Army] and against Israel. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 24 January  reports that "SLA soldiers managed to foil a terrorist attempt  to overtake an SLA outpost in the 'Alman al-Shumariyah area in  the security zone. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that  Hizballah fired mortars and katyushas at the outpost, and under  cover of the shelling tried to capture the post, but were warded  off. An SLA soldier was killed, and two were wounded in the  attack. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA troops pursued the  terrorists."]</p>

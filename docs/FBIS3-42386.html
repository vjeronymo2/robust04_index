			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letters by Major V. Pupkov and Major S. Timofeyev under the </F> rubric "Military Reform: Problems of IAS": "Where to Get  Technicians?-- (Two Letters on One Topic)"]    [Text]  <H6>  Break the Stereotypes </H6>   Much is being said and written today on the lack of social  and professional protections for aviators of all categories, but  I think that the officers of the IAS [aviation engineering  service] with secondary education are in the most difficult  position. Judge for yourself: a lieutenant who is a graduate of  a VATU [military aviation technical school] comes to a line unit  in the post of aircraft technician, servicing group technician  (standard procedures) or a specialist of a technical crew. And  that is effectively his service ceiling. The higher positions,  after all, are engineering ones.    It happens in real life that an officer technician who has  not received higher education (very often owing to circumstances  beyond his control) is named the chief of a flight or detachment  TECh [technical maintenance unit], a servicing group or  technical team, or even the chief of a group for standard  servicing operations for the TECh of a regiment. But this is,  after all, a breach of standard positional discipline. The  positions correspond to the ranks of senior lieutenant or  captain.    I knew quite a few good aviation specialists, conscientious  and disciplined officer technicians, who served for 25 years or  more at an airfield and were discharged into the reserves at  those ranks. Many of them strove to keep learning at one time,  but were not able to attain their dream owing to retraining on  new aviation hardware, a shortage of people, combat duty  etc.--they were not able to become engineers, although I repeat  that many of them possessed profound knowledge and unparalleled  organizational abilities.    Graduates of the higher aviation engineering schools, as a  rule, are first assigned to technical positions. After two or  three years of service they are transferred to engineering  positions as chief of a flight or detachment TECh, a servicing  group (standard operations) or a technical team.    And they serve an average of three to five years in this,  their first supervisory position. They forget a great deal over  this time, and the information they received at the higher  educational institution becomes partially outdated. When some of  them "grow up" to be a commander at the regimental level, they  thus have to learn all over again.    I consider correct the decision to institute a term of study  at the VVIA [Air Forces Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye.  Zhukovskiy in which an officer technician receives higher  military education rather than higher special education (as  before), i.e. primary training for engineers and  training for supervisory engineering personnel are combined.  This would give the graduate broad prospects in the service.    I am deeply convinced that the posts of chief of a flight or  detachment TECh, chief of a servicing and standard operations  group, assistant chiefs of IAS for an air squadron (in the  training air regiments), deputy commander of an air squadron for  IAS and positions close to them are not engineering positions in  the full sense of the word in the new standard organizational  structure of IAS. They could full well be held by officer  technicians with the appropriate additional training.  Engineering positions are the regimental engineers by fields,  the chief of the TECh and the deputy commander of the regiment  for IAS--that is, those that require the profound engineering  analysis of the good working order and combat readiness of  aviation hardware on the scale of a regiment, along with the  ability to supervise large collectives.    I have become convinced through personal experience that  competent officer technicians could successfully perform duties  up to deputy commander of an air squadron for IAS (commander of  ATO [airfield technical support]) inclusive. A powerful  incentive in the service would then appear for them--the  prospect of official advancement and promotion. Technical  positions for such categories as engineers by fields and chief  of regimental TECh could also be instituted in the training air  regiments of flight schools equipped with training aircraft of  relatively simple design.    I propose somewhat of a re-organization of IAS as a whole as  follows (I think that these measures could be carried out in  stages over several years).    First, the positions of aircraft technician, servicing and  standard operations group technician and positions equal to them  could be made senior warrant officer rather than officer  positions. The air training regiments have such experience,  where servicemen in these categories are successfully handling  the duties of technicians and supporting a considerably greater  yearly flying time for aircraft in high-quality fashion than in  the line units.    The screening of candidates for the positions of technicians  could be conducted among warrant officer mechanics, NCOs on  extended duty and conscript servicemen, as well as among  civilian youth.    Their training should be conducted at warrant officer  schools, according to a special curriculum and with a regard for  the level of professional knowledge of the trainees. The cadets  should study profoundly the design and operation of the type of  airframe that they will be servicing in the units during these  training sessions. The future technicians should acquire skills  in organizational work with subordinates.    The level of sophistication of the warrant officer schools  must be raised and brought closer to the level of the military  aviation- technical schools. They should train specialists as  warrant officer mechanics for a term of 1.5--2 months, and  senior warrant officer technicians for 5--6 months. The military  rank of senior warrant officer is conferred on the graduating  technician with the successful passage of exams and the receipt  of certification of completion of the school. He completes  graded evaluations according to specialty for the engineers of  the regiment, and begins independent work under the monitoring  of officer technicians in the unit.    Second, the graduates of the VATU should be assigned to  officer positions in the IAS, starting with chief of a flight or  detachment TECh, chief of a servicing group or their equivalent.  These positions should be defined as technical rather than  engineering. Some changes in the program of training cadets at  the VATUs need to be made for the high-quality training of such  specialists. The profound study of the design and operation of  specific types of aircraft, the acquisition of durable skills in  decoding the materials of on-board recording gear, the  practicing of algorithms for finding and eliminating flaws in  aviation hardware, making use of experience in servicing it, and  the training of future officers in organizational work with the  military collectives of the IAS up to squadron inclusive should  all be envisaged in them.    Third, a permanently operating system of training  specialists  for higher positions should be created in the Air Forces. The  training of candidates in special courses at technical or  engineering higher educational institutions or at the staffs of  large units and formations would be expedient for IAS. The  program of courses should be composed with a regard for the  knowledge, skills and abilities that could be needed by the  trainees in the corresponding categories when working with  personnel and on aviation hardware. Classes on the design and  operation of aviation hardware could be conducted by the  instructors of higher educational institutions, and on the  organization of IAS operations and increasing combat readiness  and flight safety by the engineers of the larger units and  formations. Such courses should be one-and-a-half to two months  long, but saturated with information.    Fourth, each officer--regardless of his education--should  have real prospects for service advancement. The main criterion  for his assignment to a higher post should be his attitude  toward the service and the fulfillment of his official duties.    Major V. Pupkov (Krasnodar VOLTU)  <H6>  Trust the Warrant Officers </H6>   It is no secret that the aviation engineering service of our  Air Forces is experiencing difficulties. One of them is a  chronic shortage of technicians. An attitude has taken shape  toward this profession as a minor one for some reason. Who is to  blame for that?    First of all, it seems, those who are obligated to train and  cultivate the IAS specialists and provide professional and  social protections for them. The attempts that have been made at  short-term courses to train technicians at the military  aviation-technical schools have unfortunately sunk into  oblivion. There are no open opponents to the ideas of the  authors. But it is a paradox--matters never move further than  talk. I will try and confirm this with statistical data. I make  no claim to absolute completeness of the data in my possession,  but it testifies eloquently to the unenviable position of the  IAS.    I was able to visit four aviation units where aircraft of  various types are being operated. They are stationed under  relatively favorable conditions. The people are more or less  well provided for. The shortcomings that are able to be revealed  would thus be average ones for all of the Air Forces, as it  were. What was I able to find out?    The units are staffed with officer technicians and engineers  in such a way that they are, at a minimum one, out of six  specialists short. The question of where the graduates of the  Air Forces technical schools are is a natural one. Some 354  young specialists have come here over the last ten years. Sixty  nine of them were "lost" virtually irretrievably to the IAS over  that time--34 transferred to other service, and 35 were  discharged into the reserves. One out of five VATU graduates, in  short, lost touch with the IAS over the ten years. It turns out  that each school trained two full classes for... the national  economy and filling vacancies in support units.    There is another fact of no small importance as well. Forty  one of those remaining advanced in the service, and 17 went for  training at military higher educational institutions in their  fields. Isn't that where the "floating" level of education of  IAS officers comes from?    The problem of technical personnel staffing levels for the  IAS cannot be solved by calling up reserve officers for two  years of service after their completion of civilian higher  educational institutions, since these people are by and large in  the army temporarily. According to the data, only 53 of the 237  people who came to the aviation units from civilian life over  the last decade remain in the ranks of the Ministry of Defense.    The large understaffing of the IAS with technical personnel  is thus obvious. Is there a way out of this situation? I think  there is. This problem can moreover be resolved at the local  level in most cases. The aviation units have able specialists  (the discussion here concerns warrant officers) who want to  perform the duties of technicians and senior technicians. Just  give them the opportunity to study up in special courses, and  they are ready technicians, chiefs of servicing groups and the  TEChs of detachments and flights...    I am confident that a warrant officer who becomes an officer  will serve until discharge into the reserves for age reasons or  based on total time served. Why not make use of that? The sad  statistics would change immediately, it seems, if we were to do  that. In favor of the IAS.    Major S. Timofeyev (Achinsk VATU)    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pinochet Stayed in Amstel Hotel </F> Under Pseudonym"]    [Text] Former Chilean President Pinochet stayed in the  Amstel hotel in Amsterdam in the night of Thursday to Friday,  where he had signed up under a false name. On Friday morning  staff members recognized him.    The hotel management went to talk to Pinochet and his party,  says director F. van der Post. "We told him that we could not  guarantee his safety or the safety of the others in the hotel.  His security people then decided to leave." Pinochet and his  party left the hotel on Friday night, according to Post.    The former dictator is on a tour of Europe this week. He is  leading a trade delegation from the Army's procurement  department. Today [30 May] he is expected in the Czech capital  Prague.    Czech President Havel and Prime Minister Klaus openly  dissociated themselves from the visit. "I am not thrilled about  the fact that the first important Chilean trade mission to the  Czech Republic is led by General Pinochet," Havel declared.  "But I consider this notification."    According to the president, Pinochet has not been invited by  any official department and will not meet with government  representatives. Pinochet was invited by the semi state company  Omnipol, which is responsible for the sale of Czech arms.</p>

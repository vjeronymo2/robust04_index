			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Scrambled Sky at a premium - Television Sky Television is currently urging satellite viewers to phone for details of 'A brand new Sky'. Do so and you receive a 36-page sales brochure which declares 'Summer's here and there's a completely new look to satellite television on the way. The Sky Multi-Channels Package will be the most exciting thing to hit your TV screen in years. There are brand new channels to satellite (sic) and a new way of receiving all your current favourites. Sky Multi-Channels launch on September 1, so hurry to page 11 to read all about it. You could also win a brand new Vauxhall . . .' This seems to be Sky-speak meaning 'From September we shall be adding new channels to the output. Most of the material will be American. At the same time we shall scramble the signal on all but one of the Sky services so that we can charge you for what you were previously watching for nothing. You could also win a brand new Vauxhall . . .' The minimum 'package' of 12 scrambled channels will cost Pounds 4 a month for the remainder of this year and then Pounds 7 a month from January. That will bring you the general entertainment channel Sky One, the Children's Channel, the British repeat channel UK Gold, and the nine new channels listed below. Add to that package one of the 'premium' channels (The Movie Channel, Sky Movies Plus, or Sky Sports) and the price goes up to Pounds 12 a month. Add two premium channels and the cost is Pounds 17 a month. For all three it is Pounds 20 a month. With the two top price packages you get Sky Movies Gold thrown in, though it is neither a premium channel nor part of the basic package. Thus the lowest priced Sky package will, from January 1994, cost Pounds 84 a year: Pounds 1 more than the BBC licence fee. If you take all the Sky services it will cost Pounds 240 a year. What about those in Britain's 2.5m satellite homes who bought their dishes on the understanding that the cost of the hardware, currently around Pounds 200, would be all they had to pay, not realising that encryption and subscription would follow? Since the dishes pick up all signals transmitted via the Astra satellite (actually three satellites now in the same position, with 48 channels already useable and more to come) there are still many channels which are neither owned by Sky nor marketed as part of the Sky package which can still be received in clear, though most are German or Dutch language services. English language channels which will continue, for the moment anyway, to be available free to those who cannot afford to pay another Pounds 84 a year, or who simply decide to resist Sky's urgings, will be Ted Turner's global news network CNN, Sky News (which is presumably staying unscrambled to compete with CNN), the 24-hour rock video channel MTV, Eurosport, and Turner's Cartoon Network which is due to arrive soon. And what are those 'brand new channels' which Sky is offering as an inducement to pay a subscription? There are nine: The American children's channel Nickelodeon. A 24-hour home shopping channel called QVC ('quality, value and convenience'). The Family Channel showing series such as Remington Steele and Big Brother Jake. Discovery, a factual channel specialising in wildlife, travel, 'adventure', etc. Two more all-music networks: CMT, or Country Music Television; and VH1, or Video Hits One, which seeks to be an adult version of MTV 'for the generation that grew up with the music'. A women's channel called UK Living, described by Lis Howell, head of programming, as 'the elastic waistband' station; she warns that it will be 'domestic' and 'undemanding'. Two American 'retro' channels: Nick At Night which claims to be 'dedicated to the preservation of television's heritage'; and Bravo which promises 'treasures from the vaults'. This appears to be the sort of 'niche programming' that we have so long been told is the natural outcome of the multi-channel systems brought in by satellite and cable. UK Living will presumably screen British material, though only 2 1/2 of their 18 hours a day will be original programming, and perhaps QVC's goods will be British, though we shall have to wait and see. Marketing programmes currently filling spare time on some satellite channels at night seem to sell only American products  - plastic house painting kits, kitchen knives, car cleaners - with 'programmes' made in the US even though the presenters are invariably British. Those services aside, it looks as though these nine networks will consist almost exclusively of American material, most of it old, some of it quite astonishingly so. Few of these new - well, new to Britain - channels have even started test transmissions yet, but Bravo and Discovery have been running in clear for a couple of weeks, so it has been possible to get an idea of what they, at least, have to offer. The answer is a strong whiff of nostalgia, an overpowering sense of American cultural values, and a feeling of stringent budgets. There is some British material here: on Discovery I have seen Bellamy's Bird's Eye View and several Loch Ness Updates covering a scientific hunt for a monster. There was even a European programme on Saturday evening, a 60-minute production called Airbus, about the building of the aeroplane, but as this droned on - 'Here's the comfortable six-abreast business class . . . comfort on board is unique . . . preparation has been patient and minute in its details' - it became impossible to believe that it was not, literally, a promotional video produced by the marketing department of Airbus Industries. Perhaps they paid Discovery to screen it; I hope so. More common are old American programmes such as The Story Of Rock And Roll which includes Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and The Byrds but excludes The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and anybody else who happens to be British. The subject of Friday's Biography was Joe Di Maggio, baseball player and Marilyn Monroe's sometime husband from the 1950s. The footage was, like much on Discovery, in black and white. In case you missed them Airbus and Biography were repeated mid-evening on Saturday, having also been shown the previous Tuesday. American Caesar turned out to be an old black and white documentary about General MacArthur. Bravo's material is even more consistently black and white than Discovery's, and although it does include old British B-movies (an antique Edgar Wallace called To Have And To Hold with William Hartnell and Ray Barrett as detectives, the 1965 'silent' black and white comedy A Home Of Your Own with Willie Rushton, Bernard Cribbins and others on a building site, and so on) it, too, relies mainly on geriatric American television series. Friday brought Car 54 Where Are You? followed by The Doris Day Show and, later that evening, one of the oldest American series I have ever seen on British television: Art Linkletter And The Kids. It is amazing that these exist at all, having been made in the fifties and, I suspect, even the late forties. We seem to be rapidly reaching the point where the world's (well, Britain's and America's) entire stock of old television programmes is being run on one channel or another all the time. It is, no doubt, a cheap way of filling schedules, in which case we may wonder why we are asked to pay such a relatively high price. Though there are 12 channels, with possibly more to be added, in Sky's basic package, they contain far fewer original programmes than the BBC's two channels or ITV and Channel 4. True, in October Sky One will be the first channel in Britain to screen Queen, sequel to the two Roots series (American of course) and the network is currently in the process of producing a dramatisation of the Ken Follett novel Red Eagle, the first time they have ever done such a thing rather than buy from the American and Australian stockpiles. However, there is a very long way to go in the origination of drama, documentary, comedy, arts - virtually all types of programme other than news and sport - before satellite and cable can be seen as anything other than re-packaging parasites. The technology may be wonderful but we do not watch the technology, we watch the programmes.</p>

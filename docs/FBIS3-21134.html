			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The National Institute for Research in Inorganic  Materials, STA, has succeeded in synthesizing diamond from  fullerene crystals (C[.sup]60[/], soccer ball shaped carbon  molecules) by using shock compression. The synthetic diamonds  obtained by using fullerene crystals as a starting material are  ultrafine particles about 10 nm in diameter. The yield is about  50% of the starting material at about 20 GPa and when the  pressure is increased to 50 GPa, the yield reaches almost  90%.  This yield is very high, about ten times the yields obtained  using other forms of carbon (such as graphite, glassy carbon,  etc.)    Conventional carbon materials are difficult to convert into  diamond, even with shock compression. Even if diamond is formed,  the yields have been low at less than 10%. On the other  hand,  methods for synthesizing large amounts of C[.sup]60[/] and  C[.sup]70[/] fullerene crystals have been established, so  they are now easy to obtain, and this has spurred activity in  various types of experimental and theoretical research.    The No. 8 research group at NIRIM focused on fullerene  crystals as a new starting material for diamond synthesis. In  C[.sup]60[/] crystals, the C[.sub]60[/] molecules have a  spherical, cage-like structure held together by Van der Waals  forces, which are relatively weak.    The C[.sup]60[/] molecules form a dodecahedron consisting  of 20 six-membered rings and 20 five-membered rings. The five-  and six-membered rings in the molecules contain two different  types of bond angles and bond lengths that are similar to the  SP[.sup]3[/] bond configurations of diamond in some places.  Therefore, the researchers hoped they would be easy to convert  to diamond.    Following this line of thought, researchers used shock  compression and successfully obtained high yields of synthetic  diamond.    The fullerene starting materials were in the form of  rectangular or hexagonal fine particles, and they were mixed  with copper powder and pressure molded. The samples were  subjected to a shock wave from a single-shot gun using a  gunpowder cartridge and recovered in two containers made of  different types of material, stainless steel and copper. Then  the copper was removed from the sample by treating it with acid,  and the phase was determined by X-ray diffraction of the sample  powder. Results confirmed that synthetic diamond had been formed  at a high yield.    This diamond takes the form of ultrafine particles similar  to  the diamond recovered from the carbon in gunpowder. The yield  ranged from 50-90% of the starting material depending on  the  conditions of the shock compression. Researchers conducted  synthesis on samples of mixed C[.sup]60[/] and  C[.sup]70[/] molecules, and on C[.sub]60[/] molecules  alone.    Researchers at NIRIM believe this product can be used for  polishing mirror surfaces, etc., but they also believe the  material costs will be too high. In these experiments the  researchers went up to 90 GPa of pressure, but they found that  when they surpassed 50 GPa, the synthetic diamond disappeared  and was converted into another unknown substance. Researchers  plan to work hard to clarify this phenomenon and proceed with  the search for new post-diamond phase materials and  superconductors.</p>

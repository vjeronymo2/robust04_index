			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Crisis talks over Mideast massacre: Israel and PLO accept US plea on peace efforts after mosque killings Israel and the Palestinians agreed last night to try to save the Middle East peace process at talks in Washington after a Jewish settler shot dead at least 50 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque. President Bill Clinton said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, had agreed to his request that they should send negotiators to the US as soon as possible 'and to stay here in continuous session until their work is completed'. In the single worst attack on Palestinians since Israel occupied the West Bank in 1967, an Israeli settler opened fire with an automatic rifle in the packed Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron at the start of the morning's Moslem Ramadan prayers. Dozens of Palestinians were wounded and a further 12 killed by Israeli troops during subsequent protests. As news of the killings spread throughout the occupied territories, first Hebron and then the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip erupted in clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops. 'Extremists on both sides are determined to drag Arabs and Israelis back into the darkness of unending conflict,' Mr Clinton said yesterday. 'The answer now is to redouble our efforts to conclude the talks between Israel and the PLO and begin implementation of the agreement they have made as rapidly as possible,' he said. No date has been set for the talks. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, called for calm to prevent the 'enemies of peace' from exploiting yesterday's tragedy. The gunman, an American-immigrant doctor, Dr Baruch Goldstein, who lived in the nearby radical Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, appeared to have planned the attack in an effort to torpedo the peace negotiations. The Israeli authorities said Dr Goldstein later died, but it was not clear whether he had been overpowered or had committed suicide. Mr Arafat summoned Palestinian leaders to a crisis meeting in Tunis. 'What has happened today in the mosque is a real tragedy and will make a very negative backfire on the whole peace process,' he said. Mr Rabin said in a telephone call to Mr Arafat that he condemned the massacre and promised to investigate eyewitness claims that Dr Goldstein had not acted alone. He also offered to speed up the transition to Palestinian self-rule in the territories. 'As an Israeli, I am ashamed,' he told Mr Arafat, according to an Israel Radio report. Earlier Mr Rabin had said he hoped the 'loathsome criminal act of murder' would not be followed by Arab attempts at revenge. Several Israeli ministers proposed banning the racist Kach movement of which Dr Goldstein was a member, and disarming its supporters. The shooting took place soon after 5am, when the vast mosque that covers the tomb of biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, was crammed with about 500 Moslems marking the month-long Ramadan fast. Dr Goldstein, a 42-year-old Brooklyn-born father of four who had spoken out publicly about his hatred of Arabs, burst into the mosque wearing his army reservist's uniform, and then opened fire with a Galil automatic rifle. Eyewitnesses said Israeli soldiers on duty at the site allowed him to keep firing for more than 10 minutes. An Israeli army spokesman insisted that no soldiers had been inside the mosque, and that fleeing Palestinians had prevented troops from entering to intervene. Dr Wissam Muhtaseb, who was treating the wounded at Hebron's Al-Ahali hospital, said six Palestinians were killed outside the hospital when soldiers tried to disperse crowds congregating outside. There were also reports of two deaths in Gaza and one in Nablus. Killer 'was kindest man - he wouldn't hurt a cat'Page 2 Talks smothered by cry of outragePage 10</p>

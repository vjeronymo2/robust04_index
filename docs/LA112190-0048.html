			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SCHAEFER REVERSES DECISION, ORDERS AIDE BACK TO WORK;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS: DOUG JOHNSON, CLAIMING THAT HE WAS FIRED, NOT PUT ON LEAVE, SAYS  HE WILL NOT RETURN TO HIS FORMER JOB.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who abruptly dismissed an administrative  aide Monday after discovering that he will go to work for her successor,  reversed herself and ordered the aide back to work Tuesday in a terse telegram.  </P> <P> In response, Doug Johnson said he will never work for Schaefer again and  declared her assertions that he had been placed on leave, rather than fired, a  lie.  </P> <P> "Yesterday she demanded my keys and my garage pass. She threw boxes at my feet  and told me to pack, and she had the locks changed as soon as I left," Johnson  said. "If that's not firing, I don't know what is."  </P> <P> Schaefer, who was defeated by Maria VanderKolk in June, said Tuesday that she  had ordered Johnson out of their Thousand Oaks office Monday because he had not  told her that he had agreed to work for VanderKolk after the new supervisor  takes office Jan. 7.  </P> <P> He also originally denied that he had accepted the VanderKolk job, Schaefer  said.  </P> <P> Schaefer said that while she had ordered Johnson out of her office, she never  told him that he was fired. She said she considers Johnson to be on  administrative leave, which she is now rescinding. After their angry  confrontation, Schaefer said she discovered that aides are paid for 60 days  after they are dismissed.  </P> <P> Johnson, who makes $43,848 a year, will be paid $5,900 over the next seven  weeks before he goes to work for VanderKolk.  </P> <P> "I just don't want the taxpayers paying for a problem between Doug and me,"  Schaefer said. "There was no formal discussion about this, just a lot of  yelling and lying. If Doug wants to stick it to the taxpayers of Ventura  County, then he won't show up for work."  </P> <P> A copy of Schaefer's telegram, which Johnson said he received at 1 p.m.  Tuesday, said: "Administrative leave canceled. Report 11-20-90 to Sup.  Schaefer's office at 800 S. Victoria, Ventura, at 8 a.m."  </P> <P> Schaefer works at her office in Thousand Oaks, not at the County Government  Center in Ventura. Johnson would write proclamations and do research for her,  the supervisor said.  </P> <P> Johnson said he may soon return to work for the county, if county  administrators can arrange it, but not for Schaefer.  </P> <P> "Whether I go back to work is up to me," he said. "I no longer work for Madge  Schaefer, and she no longer has any form of supervision over me. She fired me."  </P> <P> County Personnel Director Ronald Komers said Monday that if Johnson had been  thrown out of Schaefer's office and fired, as the aide claimed, then he would  be eligible for 60 days severance pay.  </P> <P> The 27-year-old aide, who committed to work for VanderKolk earlier this month,  said he regrets that Schaefer found out about his new job through an anonymous  letter over the weekend.  </P> <P> But he said he is angry because Schaefer apparently told a Thousand Oaks  newspaper that she had given Johnson three choices Monday -- not working, using  his vacation time or working for her in a separate office.  </P> <P> "I don't object to being fired," Johnson said. "But her lying now after the  fact is absolutely disgraceful."  </P> <P> When asked about offering Johnson three options Monday, Schaefer said she was  not referring to her comments to the aide in the morning but to her telegram,  which was sent Monday evening.  </P> <P> Although the telegram only directs Johnson to report to work, it indirectly  outlines his options, she said.  </P> <P> Johnson, who interviewed with VanderKolk in October, said he did not tell  Schaefer of the appointment earlier because the supervisor was upset about her  mother's illness.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F> for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 21 March]    [Text] 1. In Lunda Norte, South African mercenaries have  met the appropriate response to their adventure of 16 March 1994  when they carried out an attack in the area between Lufige and  Luxa Rivers, resulting in the death of 12 white South African  mercenaries. They were led by Lieutenant (Stein Marais) and  Noncommissioned Officer (Bronoz). Captured documents revealed  that additional groups are being deployed in the region.    2. The Russian aircraft impounded in Rundu, Namibia, are  owned by the Futungo [Angolan Government] and have nothing to do  with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA]. The pilots are Angolan and Portuguese nationals. The  Namibian Government is hereby challenged to take the crew to one  of its tribunals so that the world may know the truth.    3. Until a general and verifiable cease-fire is declared,  the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] will  seize no more UNITA-occupied positions without receiving the  appropriate response. Military adventures must come to an end.    [Dated] Huambo, 21 March 1994    [Signed] Army General Arlindo Chenda Isaac Pena Ben-Ben,  chief of the General Staff</p>

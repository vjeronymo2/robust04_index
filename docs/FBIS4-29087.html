			<p>BFN     [Text] Kin -- Yoshimoto Masanori, lieutenant governor of  the Okinawa Prefectural Government, observed a live-firing  exercise conducted by the U.S. Marine Corps on Okinawa across  Prefectural Highway No. 104 on the morning of 14 June. The  live-firing exercise was the fifth such exercise since the  beginning of this year. During his observation, the lieutenant  governor surveyed how the highway was blockaded during the  live-firing exercise and how the exercise affected the lives of  residents. This is the first time that the lieutenant governor  has observed an exercise since taking office. Meanwhile, a rally  was staged to protest the live-firing exercise in Kodai, Igei  District, under the auspices of the Okinawa Peace Movement  Center. Rally participants blocked about 70 armed U.S. Marines  trying to march through the rally, sparking a brief jostle  between the Marines and labor unionists.    Lieutenant Governor Masanori and other prefectural  government  officials arrived at Prefectural Highway 14 at 0800 on the  morning of 14 June when the live-fire exercise began. Katsuhiro  Yoshida, chief of Kin town, told the lieutenant governor:  "Forty years of live-firing exercise have turned Mt. Onna into  a treeless mountain. Nature there is being destroyed. Red soil  from training grounds where trees and rocks have disappeared are  destroying Kin Bay. I want the live-firing exercise halted  immediately." The town chief also pleaded with the lieutenant  governor for an early enactment of the Military Land Conversion  Law to promote the effective use of military lands to be  returned.    In response, the lieutenant governor said: "U.S. Forces in  Okinawa are certainly moving to cut back their training.  However, the live-firing exercise is not a problem that can be  resolved simply by streamlining and scaling back U.S. military  bases in Okinawa. The exercises should be halted completely. I  intend to speak out against the exercises with the residents'  sufferings in mind."    One shell after another was fired into Mt. Onna when the  lieutenant governor observed the live-firing exercise.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Prosecutors raided the head  office of Kajima Corp. and the homes of its top executives and  former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura on Wednesday [8  March] in connection with Nakamura's alleged acceptance of a 10  million yen bribe from the construction giant.    The raids covered more than 30 locations which included the  homes of Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of Kajima, and Akira  Miyazaki, president.    Meanwhile, the House of Representatives Steering Committee  convened Wednesday to listen to Justice Ministry officials to  discuss a request by prosecutors to arrest Nakamura, a member of  the house, who quit the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) earlier in the day.    Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda told reporters later that the  lower house needs to decide on the request as early as possible.    Diet permission is required for the arrest of  parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet  is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late  January.    Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors  Office will soon ask Ishikawa, 68, to voluntarily submit to  questions pertaining to the money allegedly paid in January 1992  to Nakamura, investigative sources said.    Ishikawa formerly served as head of the Japan Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, one of Japan's four top business  organizations, and also of the Japan Federation of Construction  Contractors Inc., an industry association of general contractors.    He resigned as president of the chamber last year as  prosecutors promoted probes into the widening scandal involving  politicians and contractors.    Investigators have already quizzed Miyazaki, 70, the  president of Kajima, one of Japan's top contractors.    On Tuesday, prosecutors again arrested a former vice  president of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, on suspicion of giving  the 10 million yen bribe to Nakamura.    Nakamura allegedly received the money as a reward for using  his influence to help prevent the Fair Trade Commission (FTC)  from lodging a criminal complaint against contractors including  Kajima, for bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture.    Kiyoyama allegedly asked Nakamura, a senior member of the  LDP's construction lobby, to put pressure on the FTC not to file  an accusation with prosecutors against a bid-rigging cartel  involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms.    At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chairman of the LDP's  panel on the Antimonopoly Law. The LDP was in power for 38  years until the inauguration of the coalition government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last August.    Nakamura later served as construction minister from December  1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    Investigators intend to question fallen LDP kingpin Shin  Kanemaru, 79, who is being tried in a separate income tax  evasion case, the investigative sources said.    Prosecutors suspect Kiyoyama first asked Kanemaru to put  pressure on the FTC, an antitrust watchdog body. Kanemaru  allegedly replied that Nakamura was handling the matter, the  sources said.    Kiyoyama and three other former Kajima officials were  indicted last year in two bribery cases. Prosecutors said the  Kajima officials gave 20 million yen to former Ibaraki Gov.  Fujio Takeuchi and 10 million yen to former Sendai Mayor Toru  Ishii.</p>

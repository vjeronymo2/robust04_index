			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS APPROVE CZECH COALITION RULE  </P> <P> Communist Party leaders today agreed to give up their 41-year monopoly on power  in Czechoslovakia by promising to propose a coalition government including  other political parties and dropping its legally guaranteed "leading role" in  political affairs.  </P> <P> The dramatic move followed a two-hour meeting between Prime Minister Ladislav  Adamec and the Civic Forum, the 9-day-old opposition organization led by  playwright Vaclaz Havel.  </P> <P> The announcement, the latest in a series of lightning reforms in Eastern  Europe, also followed 11 straight days of demonstrations organized by students  and the Civic Forum to demand political freedom.  </P> <P> Those protests climaxed Monday, when millions of Czechoslovaks walked off their  jobs for a two-hour general strike to oppose one-party rule. The walkout was  one of the most vivid manifestations of a peaceful revolution interrupted 21  years ago when Warsaw Pact tanks snuffed out the reform-minded Prague Spring.  </P> <P> As dusk fell, hundreds of citizens again gathered under the statue of St.  Wenceslas in the capital's famed Wenceslas Square, shouting "Freedom! Freedom!"  in celebration of the announcement by Adamec's government.  </P> <P> "By Dec. 3, we will propose to the president of the republic (Gustav Husak) to  appoint a government with a new composition," said Marian Calfa, a minister  without portfolio for legal affairs.  </P> <P> "It is expected that it will be a government of a broad coalition base, in  which there will be both non-party representatives and representatives of other  political parties, and at the same time, of course, representatives of the  Communist Party," Calfa said.  </P> <P> "It will be a government first of all of specialists and experts," Calfa added  during a five-minute news conference. He did not take questions.  </P> <P> Since the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in February, 1948, many crucial  government positions were held by professional Communist Party members with no  qualifications for the posts they held.  </P> <P> Speculation on future leaders focused on Valtr Komarek, 59, an economist linked  to Civic Forum and known for his outspoken view that the Communist leaders  could not stop the country's economic decline. Posters have begun appearing  saying, "Komarek for Premier."  </P> <P> Calfa also said the government will ask Parliament to eliminate three articles  in the constitution, including one guaranteeing the Communist Party the leading  role in political affairs and another requiring a Marxist-Leninist-based  education.  </P> <P> Eliminating the education provision would end the traditional cradle-to-grave  political indoctrination forced upon citizens.  </P> <P> The third article to be dropped outlaws groups not allied with the National  Front, a pro-government umbrella organization for political activities.  </P> <P> In the past, non-Communist groups have been allowed to join the National Front,  but such groups had to be allied with the Communist Party.  </P> <P> The proposals will be presented to the two-chamber National Assembly or  Parliament, which is meeting in joint session.  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Creditors in legal action against US arm of O&amp;Y The creditors which control Olympia &amp; York Developments have accused the failed Canadian developer's surviving US arm of concealing crucial data on the restructuring of the US operations. A group of bank lenders, including Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Sanwa Bank of Japan, yesterday asked an Ontario court to set a five-day deadline for the creditors and the US company to agree on ways in which this information could be shared. OYDL's most valuable remaining asset is an 80 per cent stake in the US operations, whose flagship property is the World Financial Centre in New York. However, ever since OYDL's restructuring in February 1993, tensions have been apparent between the parent company's creditors, the US management and the administrator who oversees OYDL's remaining interests. The US subsidiary, which has managed to remain out of the bankruptcy courts, is understood to have completed a working plan for restructuring its Dollars 5bn debt. However, it has refused to divulge details to OYDL creditors. According to court documents, the US managers claim that some creditors, notably CIBC and Sanwa, have a conflict of interest because they are also direct lenders to properties involved in the US restructuring. US management also maintains that it would be inappropriate for OYDL creditors to receive information which is not generally known to US project lenders. But the creditors are concerned that the US managers, led by Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York, might be jockeying for advantage in the restructuring process. 'The interests of the management are potentially not the same as the Canadian equity owners,' a source close to the dispute said.</p>

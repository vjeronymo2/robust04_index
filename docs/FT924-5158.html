			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Banks deny witholding cuts BANKS responded yesterday to criticism that they have not passed on all base rate cuts to small businesses, and asked for a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The move came as a study of small businesses' relationship with banks found most did not think bank charges were unreasonable, but arrangement fees and fees for minor administrative services caused considerable irritation. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, wrote to Mr Lamont requesting a meeting. The association said it waited 10 days for bank chairmen to be contacted by Mr Lamont after he said he wanted a meeting. The association's letter marks an attempt by banks to defend themselves against charges of making excessive profits from small businesses. Mr Lamont asked the Bank of England to extend an earlier inquiry into bank lending. Sir Nicholas said in his letter that the Bank's inquiry last year into lending policies had shown that criticisms were 'largely unjustified'. He said he wanted to discuss recent criticisms in that context. Sir Nicholas said he and senior bank executives wanted to talk about 'the effects of the economic background of the last few years on the banks, and the need for a strong banking industry based on sound capital and fair competition'. Mr Lamont told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee 10 days ago that he would ask the chairmen of the clearing banks about lending policies. The association said none of its members had been contacted.</p>

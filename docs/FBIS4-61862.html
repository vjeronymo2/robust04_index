			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "Star Fall at the Beginning of </F> Summer?"]    [Text] The Defense Ministry caused a scandal on the eve of  the holiday. Your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent was not  allowed to attend a festive press conference, in which the  minister listed the Russian Armed Forces' accomplishments in the  two years since their creation. This is how the Defense  Ministry's Identify Friend or Foe system operates. And this  despite the fact that Pavel Grachev himself has repeatedly asked  in his press conferences: Where is such and such MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS correspondent, why has he not arrived?!    There is no wish to say anything at all -- this is just  awful, that's all. In addition, to all appearances the Defense  Ministry is bracing for drastic changes just around the corner.  Observers do not rule out that the reshuffle may affect even  the minister. Reports about Boris Yeltsin's consultations on the  subject with Andrey Kokoshin and Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov proved to  be not entirely groundless. Having signed the "civil peace"  agreement with his opponents, the president appears to have  decided to exploit the respite to deal with the most "powerful"  of all the power ministries following the special services  reform.    The president's plans may have been prompted not so much by  his disagreements with General Grachev on the Ukrainian issue,  but by his wish to see rather a diplomat than a troop commander  as his defense minister. If the CIS is to be substantially  strengthened, an enterprise on which the president is clearly  inclined to embark presently, the clever and subtle  Generalissimo Menshikov [Tsar Petr the Great's lieutenant] is  preferable as a right-hand man than Marshal Zhukov.</p>

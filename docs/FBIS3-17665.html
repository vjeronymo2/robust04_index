Colonel-General Pavel Kozlovskiy told INTERFAX in an  exclusive interview that he was going to ask the law-enforcement  authorities to carry out a proper investigation and, after its  results are made public, to bring a defamation of character suit  against Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of the Provisional  Parliamentary Anticorruption Commission, who accused him of  illegal dealings.    Kozlovskiy said some of the executives in Defense Ministry  companies had indeed committed offenses, but that all of them  had been "punished."    He said Lukashenko's accusations were groundless because,  "following the logic of Lukashenko, formerly manager of a state  farm and nowadays chairman of the Commission for Fighting  Corruption, he himself could have been dismissed from his rural  managerial post immediately after an anonymous report came in  that a pailful of formula feed had been stolen from one of his  pigsties."    "The defense minister cannot be responsible for the behavior  of each soldier and officer of the Belarussian army, which is  nearly 100,000 strong, any more than a factory manager can bear  personal responsibility for the personal integrity of each of  his workers, of whom there may be many thousands," Kozlovskiy  said, describing Lukashenko's accusations as "an attempt to draw  the army into political intrigues and destabilize the situation  in the Republic during the presidential election campaign."    Asked whether the Defense Ministry needed to have its own  businesses, Kozlovskiy said the funds the Armed Forces were  receiving from the state were "clearly insufficient." "In order  to keep the army from being ruined and strangled financially we  are forced to use, for example, the potential of transport  aircraft for the commercial transportation of cargo," he said.    Meanwhile, the prime minister's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin  told INTERFAX another five members of government accused by  Lukashenko of various offenses were going to bring defamation of  character suits. They are Deputy Premiers Nikolay Kostikov and  Stanislav Bril, Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko, Minister of  Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Radkevich, and National Bank  Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich.</p>

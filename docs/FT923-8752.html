			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Bonn on course in economy drive BONN'S economy drive is on course for success this year, but there are still signs of over-spending among state governments and local authorities, according to Mr Manfred Carstens, junior finance minister. Government spending so far matched forecasts and there were no detectable big risks on the income side, he said yesterday. Claiming that Bonn expected to be able to meet its target of a DM40.5bn (Pounds 14.3bn) federal budget deficit for 1992, compared with DM52bn in 1991, he announced plans to raise around DM33bn on capital markets during the current year. Credit raising so far had proceeded smoothly and on relatively good terms, Mr Carstens added. However, he reflected concern about over-spending among state governments and local authorities, with a warning that they should now play their part in the consolidation process. While the federal government seems to be holding to its undertaking to clamp down on spending increases, appeals to the states to limit annual increases to 3 per cent appear to have gone unheard. According to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, state and local authority spending is likely to rise 5 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, trade figures published yesterday underlined the uncertain state of the German economy. The DM2bn visible trade surplus in June was almost double the May figure and four times as high as a year earlier. But both imports and exports fell: imports of DM49.5bn were down almost 3 per cent on May, while exports were more than 1 per cent lower at DM51.5bn. The pan-German deficit on the current account, which includes services and other invisible elements, rose to DM4.3bn, compared with DM4bn in May and also in June last year.</p>

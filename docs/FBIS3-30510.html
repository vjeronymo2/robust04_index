			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] At a brief news conference, we asked  Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] and Slovak prime minister:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Prime  minister, what will your movement propose to other parliamentary  parties at the meeting of the cross-party standing committee  [gremium] tomorrow [4 February, following today's parliamentary  crisis]?    [Meciar] We will address the basics. The basis of the  problem  is the fact that the parliament chairman was stripped of his  rights in an unconstitutional way [deputies voted that the  deputy chairman should chair the session today]. The essence of  the problem lies in the fact that this parliament has been  deliberately led into crisis for a long time now. They try to  change election results so that the structure of parliament  changes. That is immoral and politically wrong. There cannot  be two moral codes in parliament. One has to dig even deeper  into the efficiency of this political system that has emerged in  parliament. For example, when voting, let us say in the  cross-party standing committee, everyone stands for one  political entity. Thus, the antigovernment coalition has the  majority. In reality, though, with the number of votes, it  represents a minority. They [the antigovernment coalition]  cannot assume a majority stance on some issues.    We have to make it clear what the position of Ludovit  Cernak,  the National Council's [parliament] deputy chairman is. He  became deputy chairman on the basis of the coalition agreement,  which he later trampled on. Does he have any moral or political  right to be a deputy chairman of the National Council? This  question has to be resolved as well.    It is not our intention to create a crisis at any cost in  the  way the opposition is trying to do. The whole opposition is  trying to do so, including Peter Weiss [chairman of the Party of  the Democratic Left]. Our aim is to find a model for  cooperation. We will either cooperate or let us confess to  citizens that we are not able to do so. Let them then choose  from among us with whom they want to cooperate. This situation  has been coming to a head for a long time now, several months  now. I still do not consider this to be a critical moment. I  consider it to be an element of the first conflict, which will  still be resolved. However, if essential, deeper, systemic  changes are not adopted, there is a danger that the crisis will  recur. It might change into a permanent parliamentary crisis.  That, already, is a very serious matter.    [Unidentified correspondent] At the moment, there is in fact  a stalemate in parliament--75 for and 75 against. Do you think  the National Council will be able to continue discussing the  government bill [on large-scale privatization] tomorrow?    [Meciar] It is not appropriate that I should take a stance  on  parliamentary matters from my position as a Cabinet member. I  would rather speak on behalf of the HZDS movement. There is no  stalemate [in parliament]; the balance is still in our  [government coalition's] favor. We do not do this out of fear.  We have the majority in parliament, even the majority needed to  adopt necessary laws, as the law on large-scale privatization is.    [Unidentified correspondent] One lady deputy allegedly left  the HZDS yesterday?    [Meciar] I do not know anything about that.    [Unidentified correspondent] Did you change your opinion on  early elections after what happened today?    [Meciar] My opinion remains the same. First, those who left  their [deputies'] clubs--namely, nine deputies from the HZDS,  several SNS deputies who left for the so-called national  democratic [club]--should leave their seats in parliament. The  citizens voted for particular parties. The election system is  based on parties.    Therefore, it will be one of our duties to initiate a  change,  both through a bill on internal affairs and by asking the  citizens to petition and support the referendum, which would  decide on this matter. If the referendum fails, the next option  for a solution, in my opinion, would be early parliamentary  elections. However, I still prefer other options--i.e., I prefer  tackling the internal situations in deputies' clubs in harmony  with the election law and not in the spirit of two moral codes,  two sets of rules, two approaches regardless of the law. That  would be dishonest. [end recording]</p>

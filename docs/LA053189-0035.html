			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAD OF COLOMBIA DRUG-PROBE AGENCY SURVIVES BLAST KILLING 4, INJURING 38  </P> <P> The head of the elite Colombian intelligence agency that probes the country's  powerful drug gangs survived a car bomb explosion Tuesday that killed four  people and injured 38, police said.  </P> <P> Four vehicles -- two belonging to bodyguards of intelligence chief Miguel Maza  Marquez and two private cars -- were destroyed in the explosion, which also  shattered the windows of buildings in the area, witnesses said. Maza Marquez  was traveling with bodyguards in a bulletproof car when the bomb exploded in a  parked car on a main street. He was only slightly hurt, although several of his  bodyguards were seriously injured.  </P> <P> "It looks like a street in Beirut," an unidentified witness told a local radio  station. Another witness said 10 children were injured as they were awaiting a  school bus.  </P> <P> Maza Marquez, the fifth-ranking police officer in Colombia, is head of the  government's top intelligence organization, known as the Department of  Administrative Security. It investigates narcotics cases, right-wing  paramilitary groups, leftist guerrillas and massacres.  </P> <P> Anonymous telephone callers to Radio Cadena Nacional radio station said the  attack was "made in Medellin," apparently indicating it was plotted by drug  traffickers in Colombia's second-largest city -- the home of one of the largest  cocaine rings in the world.  </P></p>

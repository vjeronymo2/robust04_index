A source at the [Lusaka] peace talks said UNITA  is refusing to negotiate further on national reconciliation  without knowing about its participation in central and  provincial power. According to the same source, the Angolan  Government is willing to hand over some posts to Savimbi's  movement but it does not agree to negotiate the sharing of power  in Lusaka in view of the results of the September 1992 elections.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP;  </P> <P> FLYERS CAN'T PUT ANOTHER ONE PAST ROY  </P> <P> For the second straight game, Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy had a streak  ended. He liked the result a lot better this time.  </P> <P> Roy, whose 34-game home unbeaten string ended in Game 1 of the Wales Conference  finals, snapped a nine-game winless slump against Philadelphia with his second  career playoff shutout Wednesday night as the Canadiens evened the series with  a 3-0 victory over the Flyers.  </P> <P> "Every good thing has to come to an end," Roy said of his unbeaten streak at  the Forum. "Tonight was a confidence-builder. I hadn't beaten the Flyers, but I  was very comfortable out there tonight."  </P> <P> Roy, 0-4-5 previously against the Flyers -- including 0-3 in the playoffs --  stopped 24 shots.  </P> <P> "He just wanted to shut people up, and he did" defenseman Craig Ludwig said of  Roy. "Going to Philadelphia down, 2-0, would have been tough."  </P> <P> Montreal's Stephane Richer scored during a 5-on-3 advantage in the first  period, and rookie defenseman Eric Desjardins added a power-play goal in the  second.  </P> <P> Guy Carbonneau scored in the third period.  </P> <P> Flyer goaltender Ken Wregget, who faced 39 shots, played his third straight  game in place of Ron Hextall, who is out with a knee injury.  </P></p>

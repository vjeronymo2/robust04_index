			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / People: Amber Day picks Carr Amber Day has appointed a non-executive director to help restore its credibility, damaged by last year's collapse in profits and the departure in September of Philip Green, its controversial chairman and chief executive. Peter Carr until recently worked in Spain, where he was chief executive of Galerias Preciados from 1988-91, when the group enjoyed an increase in profitability. Before that he spent 11 years, up to 1986, with the stores group Debenhams and was promoted to managing director in 1984. He has also worked for British Home Stores and been a consultant to a number of European retailers. Carr, 52, is the first of two non-executive appointments promised by Stacey Ellis, also 52, who became chairman in January after leaving Inchcape, the motors and business services group. Amber Day, which owns the What Everyone Wants discount stores, is still looking for a new chief executive, a role currently being covered by David Thompson, the finance director. 'Credibility is beginning to be re-established, both internally and externally,' says Ellis.</p>

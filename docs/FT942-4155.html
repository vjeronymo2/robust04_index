			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / P&amp;G moves to avoid veto on takeover Procter &amp; Gamble, the large US consumer goods manufacturer, is understood to have made a last-minute offer to modify its controversial proposed takeover of a leading German maker of feminine hygiene products, in an effort to win Brussels' approval of the deal. The offer is believed to have been made yesterday, soon after Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, had won broad agreement from senior advisers to his fellow commissioners that the takeover should be blocked as anti-competitive. Though the offer is thought to go some way to meet Mr Van Miert's main objections to the deal, he is still expected to argue that it should be prohibited in its original form when the full 17-member commission meets on Wednesday. That would not prevent P&amp;G from filing a fresh application asking Brussels to approve the takeover of Vereinigte Papierwerke Schickedanz, in modified form. Though the exact terms of P&amp;G's offer are not known, Brussels is understood to have insisted that the deal could not go ahead unless the US company agreed to divest several of Schickedanz's main German sanitary towel brands. The shift in P&amp;G's tactics coincides with signs that Mr Van Miert plans to enforce competition rules more rigorously in other areas. He is expected soon to propose heavy fines on Europe's leading manufacturers of carton board and cement for alleged price-fixing. However, the commissioner is believed to be taking a more cautious line in investigating the French government's plan to rescue Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned bank, by injecting FFr4.9bn (Pounds 570m) of capital and writing off FFr40bn of bad debts. Mr Van Miert is expected to set up a panel of eminent bankers to advise him on the case - an unprecedented step in an EU competition inquiry. If the P&amp;G takeover of Schickedanz were prohibited, it would be only the second deal which the Commission has blocked since it was given increased powers to vet large mergers more than two-and-a-half years ago. The earlier veto, of the planned takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, provoked a storm of protest in Paris and Rome. Brussels competition authorities have objected that the P&amp;G deal would give the US company more than half the German market for women's sanitary towels and a dominant position in the EU overall. P&amp;G's leading competitors also oppose the takeover. However, P&amp;G disputes the Commission's market share figures. The company's supporters, said to include German federal and state ministers, have argued that jobs could be lost if the deal does not go ahead. The Commission investigation into carton board covers all the main EU producers and was launched in 1991, after the British Printing Industries Federation complained of co-ordinated price rises across Europe. The cement case is one of the most important cartel investigations on Brussels' books and centres on alleged price-fixing involving 77 producers and industry associations.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> NWA BEATS THE RAP ON APPEAL  </P> <P> A state appeals court overturned the disorderly conduct convictions of three  members of the group NWA for asking women in a concert audience if they wanted  to have sex with rapper Eric (Eazy-E) Wright.  </P> <P> The court Wednesday said there was no evidence the group's behavior at the 1989  show recklessly inconvenienced, annoyed or alarmed anyone -- the standard under  Ohio law.  </P> <P> All five members of NWA had been charged. Lorenzo (M.C. Ren) Patterson, Oshea  (Ice Cube) Jackson and Todd (Too-Short) Shaw were convicted and fined $100  each. Wright was acquitted, and Antoine Carraby is awaiting trial.  </P> <P> The ruling Wednesday was the second obscenity defeat for city prosecutors in  the past two months.  </P> <P> In October, jurors rejected obscenity charges involving the Contemporary Arts  Center's display of photos by Robert Mapplethorpe.  </P></p>

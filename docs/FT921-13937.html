			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei at lowest level since October 1990 FUTURES-LINKED arbitrage and institutional selling prior to March book-closings pushed the Nikkei average to its lowest level in over a year yesterday amid continued low volume, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed down 290.82 at 21,321.37, the lowest close since October 1, 1990, and down 4.7 per cent on the week. The index posted a high of 21,660.29 and a low of 21,145.71 during the day. Volume came to 240m shares, against 244m on Thursday. Declines led rises by 814 to 172 with 132 shares unchanged. All 36 sectoral indices declined while 192 issues reached their lowest levels since 1990. The Topix index of all first section shares fell 18.12 to 1,600.26 but, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.23 to 1,217.76. The broadly-based decline was triggered early in the day as continued selling by trust funds and other financial institutions, combined with futures-related arbitrage to put pressure on shares, a pattern whichhas become familiar in recent days. 'The great fiscal year-end selling spree has started,' said Mr Jesper Koll, economist at SG Warburg. 'This is putting tremendous pressure on the market at a time when you can't find any interest in Tokyo equities.' Prices recovered briefly in the early afternoon on talk of a meeting between executives of the Big Four securities houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi, to discuss market support measures. Comments by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno suggesting that interest rates might fall also lent some support. At a conference yesterday, Mr Kenji Kobata, general manager at Nomura Securities, said that he expected the market to emerge from its slump in the second half of 1992. Financials lost ground, with Nomura Securities off Y50 at Y1,510 and Sumitomo Bank downY50 at Y1,880. Pharmaceuticals also fell, with Dainippon declining Y50 to Y1,240 and Daiichi by Y40 to Y1,530. Electricals managed some gains, with TDK up Y120 to Y4,350 and Toshiba by Y6 to Y636. Some speculative issues surged after a heavy sell-off the previous day, with Takuma rising Y30 to Y1,110. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 227.87 to 22,779.84 in volume of 82.2m shares. Izumiya fell Y150 to Y1,750. Roundup HEAVY volume featured in a number of rising markets yesterday. HONG KONG scored its fourth successive all-time high, the Hang Seng index rising 42.75 to 4,454.89, up nearly 1 per cent on the day and 2.5 per cent on the week. Turnover rose again, from HKDollars 1.92bn to HKDollars 2.3bn. The market was lifted by news of a trade accord between the US and China.

SINGAPORE saw bargain-hunting but finished mixed in active trading, the Straits Times Industrial index rising 3.46 to 1,532.51, up 3.0 per cent on the week. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index ended just 0.42 higher at 569.65 after profit-taking, but was 3.2 per cent higher on the week. BOMBAY was lifted to its third record high this week by a surging steel sector, on news late on Thursday that the government was lifting its controls on steel prices and distribution.

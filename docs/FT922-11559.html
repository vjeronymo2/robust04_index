			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Indonesia to allow foreign ownership FOREIGN investors are to be allowed to hold 100 per cent equity in new companies in Indonesia, the government has announced. The new directive will delight international donors, such as the World Bank, pressing for further deregulation of the economy. The directive applies to investments with a paid-up capital of over Dollars 50m in Java and Sumatra. Projects with less capital must be in remote provinces to qualify. Previously, 100 per cent foreign ownership was permitted only for export-oriented industries in the bonded zone of Batam Island. Foreign companies had also been allowed 95 per cent ownership of joint ventures which exported at least 65 per cent of production, but their equity had to be reduced to 49 per cent within 15 years. For existing joint ventures, under the new directive this period has been extended to 20 years. The directive requires future investors to sell at least 5 per cent of equity to an Indonesian company or individual within five years and to transfer 20 per cent within 20 years. There is no export requirement. The move follows a decision to allow a Dollars 1.6bn petrochemical plant to proceed under foreign ownership. Construction had been suspended on the grounds that, with domestic ownership, foreign loans would count toward Indonesia's soaring international debt. Officials are confident loans raised for wholly foreign owned projects will not be viewed as Indonesian debt, estimated at Dollars 75bn. Bankers say the trade-off demanded by opponents of the petrochemical project included the extension of foreign ownership across the board.</p>

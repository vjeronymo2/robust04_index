			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Jennings remains deep in the red at halfway stage JENNINGS, Australia's biggest home builder, has remained deep in the red in the first half to December after further big extraordinary losses in its problem areas. The company, whose operations are at the cutting edge of the Australian recession, reduced extraordinary losses to ADollars 32.6m (USDollars 24.6m) net from ADollars 96.6m a year earlier. This still swamped slightly improved operating earnings - up to ADollars 3.7m from ADollars 1.1m - and left the company's net earnings ADollars 27.9m in the red. Although this was an improvement on the previous half's ADollars 94.4m net loss, directors have omitted the interim dividend compared with a 2 cents a share payout a year earlier. The result followed a fall in sales revenue to ADollars 301.2m from ADollars 370.7m. Jennings is involved in a programme of asset sales, rationalisations and debt rescheduling, moving back to its core business of house building. The biggest item in its extraordinary losses was business writedowns and closure costs. The directors said asset sales came to ADollars 45.4m and disposals since December 1990 totalled ADollars 225m. 'The company will continue to dispose of non-core assets over time and as market conditions permit, to achieve maximum economic value for shareholders,' they said. 'Management is targeting sales at the rate of approximately ADollars 100m per annum over the next 24 to 36 months. The timing of sales and the realisation values achieved will be dependent upon market conditions over that period.' 'Whilst good progress has been made to date with the company's asset sales programme, Jennings continues to have a substantial exposure to the commercial, tourist and retail property sectors in Australia and the outlook for commercial property in particular remains very clouded. 'The company's asset values would be vulnerable to any further decline in those areas, and sales prospects are dependent upon a variety of factors which are difficult to predict.' The directors pointed to 'tentative signs' of the Australian economy emerging from recession, but they said recovery in the housing sector would depend on consumer confidence levels. The operating profit followed a tax provision of ADollars 2.4m compared with ADollars 295,000. Interest charges eased to ADollars 9.5m from ADollars 12.9m, while depreciation was down to ADollars 2.1m from ADollars 2.8m.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Paying price in Germany Sir, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the I G Metall union in Germany, said ('When unity can sap the strength of a union', October 13) that his members in east Germany tell him that they cannot pay capitalist prices with socialist wages. I wonder if Mr Steinkuhler will have the courage to tell east German workers that it is not possible to pay capitalist wages for socialist product-ivity.

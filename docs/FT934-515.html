			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Setback for Rothmans' plans Rothmans International's plans to merge its tobacco interests in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong into a single regional company have suffered a setback. A meeting to seek approval from shareholders in Rothmans Malaysia - 50 per cent owned by the group - had to be adjourned after one large shareholder asked for more time to consider the proposals which it fears may dilute its stake. The meeting was postponed until December 31. The merger, already unanimously agreed by shareholders in Rothmans Singapore, requires the approval of 75 per cent of public shareholders in the Malaysian company.

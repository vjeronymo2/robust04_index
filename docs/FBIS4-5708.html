			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  ordered a full study Wednesday on Seoul's alternatives in  dealing with North Korean loggers fleeing from work camps in  Siberia.    Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Kim instructed  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to consult with Russian officials  on the issue during his visit to Moscow this week.    Over 100 North Koreans have reportedly escaped from logging  camps, run by Pyongyang in exchange for labor fees paid in wood,  and are seeking resettlement in South Korea.    Spokesman Chu said President Kim previously shelved the  issue  of North Korean loggers for the time being in an effort to help  foster an atmosphere for North Korea's return to the  inter-Korean dialogue and their acceptance of nuclear inspection  by the International Atomic Energy Agency.    "As North Korea keeps rejecting them, the president gave the  instructions to review the issue based on the principle of  humanitarianism," Chu said.    On the presidential instructions, the government will  examine  several ways to extend a helping hand to the North Korean  loggers stranded in Russia.    The measures will include granting them asylum in South  Korea, allowing only those loggers classified as "non-criminals"  to resettle in the South, and having Moscow legally allow them  to stay in Russia, a government source said.    "Earlier we refrained from raising the issue of the loggers  so as not to offend North Korea. We now believe our restraint  has no meaning at this stage when North Korea persists in their  intransigence," he said.    Chu said it was from the same approach that the South  earlier  shelved the deployment of Patriot missiles but now promote their  introduction because North Korea continues to reject additional  nuclear inspection and boycott the South-North dialogue.    "We will decide on whether to resume the Team Spirit  military  exercise from the same angle," he added.</p>

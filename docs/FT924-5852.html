			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / German rate cut unlikely after leap in money supply: EC hopes for boost dealt blow HOPES that Europe's faltering economies would receive a boost from an early cut in German interest rates were dealt a blow yesterday with the publication of figures showing a sharp rise in the growth of the country's money supply. There was also scepticism at suggestions that a proposed package by the European Commission to stimulate growth would attract new capital. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, dismissed reports that he was masterminding a multi-million pound programme of infrastructural projects as part of an expansionist 'dash for growth'. Declaring himself 'quite astonished' at claims that European Community finance ministers had discussed figures as high as Pounds 50bn to finance such a scheme, he insisted, in an interview on BBC radio, that no figures had been mentioned at Monday's meeting. Officials at the European Investment Bank also questioned the role the European Commission has proposed for it in funding a European growth package. Mr Lamont conceded that there was concern about the possibility of Europe entering an economic slowdown. But he added: 'The most important thing that we could actually do for the European economy would be to have lower German interest rates.' European leaders have shown increasing impatience with the Bundesbank's policy of keeping its official interest rates at a ceiling of 9.5 per cent, a level that makes it difficult for Germany and other governments to encourage an economic recovery. The Bundesbank's unwillingness to ease monetary policy also compounded a gathering storm inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The Bank of France intervened twice on the foreign exchanges yesterday, buying the French franc, after the currency fell below the level of FFr3.40 against the D-Mark for the first time since October. The Irish and Danish central banks were also forced to intervene on the foreign exchanges for the second day running after their currencies fell to their ERM floors against the Belgian franc, one of the strongest currencies in the system. The Bundesbank's provisional figures yesterday showed that M3 money supply climbed by 10.2 per cent in October, on a seasonally adjusted annualised basis, breaching 10 per cent for the first time since the M3 target was introduced in 1988. This was far higher than the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5-5.5 per cent, and compares with a 9.3 per cent rate in September and 8.8 per cent in August. Since the currency crisis of the late summer, the Bundesbank has sought to play down the temporary importance of growth in broad money, which includes cash, current accounts and short-term deposits. The Bundesbank has argued that it has been distorted by special factors such as currency market intervention, and for some months now it has been obvious that the M3 target for the year could not be met. However, on Monday night Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank council, argued that the excess growth in money supply could not simply be 'argued away'. Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank, also said that it was not the Bundesbank's job to bail the ERM out of its current difficulties, implying that the German government should lead efforts to refashion a fixed exchange rate system. 'The council should not act nervously in response to what happens in the financial markets,' Mr Hufner said. 'The tensions in the EMS cannot be remedied by a 1 percentage point cut in the discount rate.' In currency markets, ERM trading was extremely tense yesterday, with markets gripped by rumours of more devaluations and withdrawals from the ERM.

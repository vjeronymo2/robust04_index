			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Warburg sets alarm bells ringing: The marketmaking problems of smaller companies THE decision by SG Warburg to cease making a market in 362 stocks has created alarm among the 90 companies whose stocks risk being switched from the main market to the Stock Exchange's Bulletin Board, which provides information to help match buyers and sellers of the shares of illiquid smaller companies. Those facing relegation to the Bulletin Board will be left with only one marketmaker as a result of Warburg's withdrawal, and they have two weeks to find a replacement. Mr Paul King, chairman and managing director of Property Partnerships of Norwich - one of the 90 - was shocked by the Warburg decision. 'We are a highly respectable and highly solvent company,' he said. 'We have been quoted since 1962. It's come as a complete surprise. Operating on the Bulletin Board is easier said than done. We don't have the resources to buy the company to go private. I don't know what to do.' His concern was echoed by Mr David Frame, chief executive of Usborne, manufacturer of animal feed, who said: 'Warburgs haven't been the least bit of good for us. 'The market they've made has been so small it hasn't been worth it. Their failure really shows that the Stock Exchange is failing to deal with illiquidity of company stocks.' Mr Frame said that when Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister, joined the board, he had to wait two months before he could buy shares, eventually buying through another broker. 'Warburgs were unable and unwilling to make a market,' Mr Frame added. Mr Harry Lambert, chief executive of Adscene, a printing and publishing company, said: 'We have not been told about it by Warburg and I think that is rather discourteous of them.' He was hopeful that a replacement would be found. If the hunt proved unsuccessful, 'it may defeat the object of being a listed company'. He accepted that there was not much liquidity in the shares - he owns 51 per cent and other directors a further 20 per cent. 'But we became a listed company so that we could be more liquid.' The timing of Warburg's announcement could not have been worse for Adscene, he added. 'We announce our final results on Tuesday and normally trade livens up after that. It will be annoying if there is less activity in our shares next week.' Mr Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood Securities, which specialises in making markets for smaller companies' shares, said many of the 90 companies would feel they had been 'virtually delisted and they could not raise money (equity finance) with that sort of status. 'These companies paid a great deal of money to get a quote and now they are being driven back into the clutches of the banks.' He favoured modifications to the system to help the market-maker in smaller companies, and so stimulate liquidity. The Stock Exchange stressed that companies were not being delisted. They still had access to the full range of capital-raising methods. Mr Andrew Beeson, at stockbrokers Beeson Gregory, which has four clients left with only one marketmaker, said the Warburg move was part of a trend towards an order-driven, as opposed to quote-driven, market in less liquid securities. 'The vast majority of trade in smaller companies is not through market makers, but through people like ourselves who talk to investors about buying and selling and then work at matching the business.' He did not think that a company's ability to raise money by issuing shares would be affected. The Stock Exchange said that it could not make companies liquid or interfere with the commercial decisions of its members. 'We can only provide an alternative mechanism where marketmakers feel they cannot commit the necessary capital.' But it replied to companies reluctant to move to the Bulletin Board by saying that it offered several advantages. Orders were displayed that might enable an immediate trade, it said. An order could be posted to attract takers and prices were indicated. The broker was named and was well placed to know who was interested in doing business.</p>

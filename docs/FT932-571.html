			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / BP on target after a year of painful cuts / A look at a reversal in fortunes at the oil group MR DAVID SIMON can look back this weekend on a year in the top post at British Petroleum confident in the knowledge he has gone some way towards reversing the fortunes of one of the UK's largest companies. Last week's sale of another big chunk of the company's nutrition business and its Swedish petrol stations means he has already achieved his target of selling Dollars 2bn-worth (Pounds 1.3bn) of assets this year in an effort to cut debt. The stock market has welcomed Mr Simon's attempts to wrestle with BP's large debt burden and, in spite of a flat oil price, the shares have risen by two-thirds to pass 300p from a low of 180p last August. That low point in BP's stock price followed the departure of Mr Robert Horton, former chairman and chief executive, in a boardroom coup a year ago and the subsequent dividend cut. Mr Simon inherited a company strapped for cash with a debt-to-equity ratio that had risen to almost 100 per cent by the end of last year. As a result, he was forced to adopt a stringent cost-cutting programme aiming to slice Dollars 1bn off operating costs by the end of this year, including cutting 10 per cent of the workforce. He also set some ambitious targets for disposals to cut debt and plans to sell another Dollars 2bn of assets next year. He set a goal of paying off BP's Dollars 14.5bn net debt at a rate of Dollars 1bn a year. It was either that or sacrifice all growth in the company for many years. BP now looks like being able to deliver on most of its targets for the next couple of years. Some 6,000 jobs have gone. He has managed to arrest the company's cash haemorrhage by halving the net outflow last year to Pounds 607m from Pounds 1.14bn the year before, with surplus cashflow of Pounds 600m generated in the first quarter. Analysts expect BP's profit to grow to around Pounds 900m next year, and Pounds 1.4bn the year after. The company will begin next year to see a reduction in the amount paid in North Sea oil taxes, which could add as much as Pounds 200m to net profit. But some in the City ask whether the company is running the risk of missing investment opportunities because of its strict cost-cutting programme. 'BP can't go on tightening its belt forever. It needs some economic growth in the business areas it serves and at some point a re-capitalisation of its balance sheet,' said Mr Peter Spring, industry analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, the UK brokers. Lord Ashburton, the company's chairman, has knocked on the head, for the time being, the oft-repeated rumour of a rights issue but many in the City believe the company will have to come to market eventually. It desperately needs exposure to the fast-growing refining market in south-east Asia where Shell, for example, is seeing high returns. Nevertheless, the City's sceptics welcomed the company's sale of its US animal feeds business, Purina Mills, and its Swedish petrol stations last week which added Dollars 585m to its receipts from disposals so far this year. 'One area in which the company has consistently outperformed every expectation is the speed and price of its disposals amid indifferent conditions,' said Mr Nick Antill, industry analyst at stockbrokers, Hoare Govett. He also points out that, working on the basis that the most attractive assets sell first, next year's disposals target could be a lot more difficult to achieve. The remaining small businesses in BP Nutrition should fetch a price of around Dollars 500m and BP Chemicals is looking to sell parts of its operations for around Dollars 600m over the next couple of years. In addition, BP is looking to sell two oil refineries in the US - Marcus Hook in Pennsylvania and Ferndale in Washington state - but few buyers are interested in moving into a crowded US refining market. BP is left with the dilemma of whether to implement the upgrade needed to bring the plants in line with US environmental legislation at an estimated cost of Dollars 100m each or to close them and take a write-off. But if there are no takers for these parts of the business, the company could be forced to sell assets previously considered its core activities, such as some European petrol stations, which in turn will reduce its exposure to the economic upturn. If the company can rely upon cost-cutting and asset disposals to improve earnings over the next couple of years, additional growth should start to trickle in by 1995 from new oil exploration fields. BP's high-risk exploration strategy of focusing on so-called 'frontier' areas is beginning to pay off, although its hopes for Azerbaijan could be jeopardised by local political unrest. The company needs to diversify its sources of crude production: it is heavily concentrated in the North Sea and Alaska, both of which should start to decline by the end of the decade. The company's reserves-to-production ratio - the length of time it can keep up production at its current rate before it runs out of oil - is nine years compared with 16 years at Royal Dutch/Shell. It was partly an expensive exploration programme in the past that ran up debt. BP's giant Cusiana field in Colombia is planned to come on stream in 1995, adding Pounds 100m to profits by the end of the decade, with other discoveries such as the Mars field in the Gulf of Mexico kicking in later. The company's oil finds in UK waters west of the Shetland Isles could provide an important new resource base for BP in the next century. At the same time, the company could get a boost from an upturn in the economic cycle which would help its downstream and chemicals businesses. US investors, who have led the recovery in BP's shares, are more sanguine about the company's future than many in the City. 'On a cashflow basis, the company looks stronger and compared with a lot of US oil companies it is trading at a reasonable price,' said Mr Lars Reierson, industry analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. Mr Simon's target of earning Dollars 2bn net income by 1995 is within reach. But many in the City believe this is a very modest aim, representing only a 10 per cent return on capital. BP will have to show it can use this as a base for future growth.</p>

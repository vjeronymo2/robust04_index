			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Electoral reforms secured in Mexico MEXICO'S Congress has approved a package of political reforms which the government hopes will give a more democratic gloss to the country's authoritarian image. The changes were passed easily, late on Tuesday, with votes from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and two opposition parties. Three opposition parties voted against. The reforms regulate what the opposition claims is the PRI's unchecked access to public funds and the news media, and put limits on campaign financing. Also, for the first time in Mexican history, any offspring of foreign-born parents will be allowed to become president, as of 1999. Other important reforms will: Open the Mexican Senate to opposition representation by allowing a third, minority-party senator from each state. Introduce some proportional representation into the way the lower chamber of Congress is elected. Set up a federal body to oversee elections. The proposals are seen as the last chance for President Carlos Salinas, who has won international praise for his bold economic reforms, to fulfil promises to modernise Mexico politically. The PRI, which has governed Mexico for the past 63 years, needed only its own Congressional majority to pass the proposals, but it negotiated the support of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) so as to give the reforms credibility at home and in the US. Some US legislators are demanding a more democratic Mexico before they ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement. The PRI won over the PAN by allowing a minority-party senator from every state and allowing presidential candidates with foreign-born parents, an old PAN demand. However, the moves failed to win the approval of the nation's most powerful opposition force, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). In 1988, a leftist alliance, which later formed the PRD, lost to Mr Salinas a hotly contested presidential election marred by charges of fraud by the PRI. During the next few days, the PRI and the PRD will meet in a last attempt to gain PRD support, although this is seen as unlikely. 'The changes are unacceptable,' says Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, head of the PRD. 'They show the PRI is not prepared to think about losing elections.' Many opposition members maintain the PRI will use these latest reforms to increase its grip on power. 'The change in electing deputies will increase the PRI's over-representation via a more proportional system of representation,' says Juan Molinar, an electoral expert with the Colegio de Mexico. 'Although the reforms sounds good, it means the PRI can get 40-something per cent of the vote and end up with 60-something per cent of the seats.'</p>

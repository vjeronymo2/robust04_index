			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Comac Pounds 228,000 in the red Comac Group, the UK's largest information technology staff agency, returned losses before tax of Pounds 228,000 in 1993 after exceptional charges and unallocated overheads wiped out an operating surplus. The results included two months' contribution from CSS Trident, formerly the UK's largest independent supplier of contract computer staff, acquired at the beginning of November last year. CSS Trident made profits before tax of Pounds 2m on revenues of Pounds 53m in 1992-93. Group turnover grew from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 19.8m and operating profits rose from Pounds 429,000 to Pounds 855,000. There were, however, exceptional charges of Pounds 773,000 to pay for redundancies and reorganisation costs and unallocated central overheads amounted to Pounds 216,000. Losses per share were 1.9p, against earnings of 3.7p. An interim dividend of 1.5p is declared in lieu of a final. Mr Philip Swinstead, who became chief executive in June last year, said Comac's agency business had been integrated into CSS Trident's operations with the closure of all the former Comac offices and some 20 redundancies. He said that some 1,261 contractors had been placed with clients by December. The company intended to make its first moves in IT consultancy and systems integration in 1994 in pursuit of its declared strategy of becoming a broadly based computing services company. Growth would be both organic and by acquisition.</p>

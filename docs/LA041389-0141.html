			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWASTIKA BURNED INTO LAWN IN BEVERLY HILLS  </P> <P> Someone burned a swastika into the lawn of an apartment house near Beverly  Hills High School last week.  </P> <P> The 7-by-4-foot Nazi symbol, burned in with chemicals, is barely visible from  the street, but tenant Harvey Myman said he found it disquieting.  </P> <P> "If the (apartment) house was toilet-papered it wouldn't bother me so much," he  said.  </P> <P> Dr. Wilmore B. Finerman, owner of the eight-unit building on Spalding Drive,  said he believes the swastika was etched onto his lawn as a prank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Didn't Want to Make Fuss'  </P> <P> "I didn't call the police because I didn't want to make a fuss about it," he  said. The swastika was first spotted last Monday.  </P> <P> Lt. Bill Curtis, spokesman for the Beverly Hills Police Department, said there  have been no complaints of such vandalism.  </P> <P> But Rabbi Steven Robbins of nearby Temple Emanuel said such incidents should be  reported and investigated, and those responsible punished.  </P> <P> "Although it can be just an action of a group of wacky kids . . . when you see  it move out of neighborhoods where you'd expect to see it, to neighborhoods  where you wouldn't, then it becomes even more disturbing," he said.  </P> <P> Whether to report such incidents has always been a matter of debate, said  Steven Windmueller, executive director of the Community Relations Commission of  the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The argument is, if you report this, do you give it publicity and visibility,  and at the same time the argument is that, no, you need to report it because it  makes the statement that this kind of behavior is inappropriate and socially  unacceptable," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increase in Incidents  </P> <P> The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said in a report issued in January  that anti-Semitic incidents rose last year in California and across the country  for the second straight year.  </P> <P> "(Swastikas) are not very common any place but they do occur," said David A.  Lehrer, the league's regional director in Los Angeles. "In a country of 250  million people, we have 800 incidents. It's quite commonly a neighbors' dispute  or a problem with children in school."  </P></p>

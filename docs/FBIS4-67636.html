			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by David Brindle, social services </F> correspondent: "`Few Patient Benefits' in NHS Changes"]    [Text] The market-style changes to the National Health  Service have done little to improve the quality of care or  patient choice, the first broad and independent evaluation says  today.    Only fund-holding by family doctors has produced any marked  -- if selective -- benefits, according to research by the King's  Fund health policy institute.    This has led to two-tier health care in some parts of the  country.    The institute commissioned seven research projects over the  period 1990-93, covering various aspects of introduction in 1991  of self-governing hospital trusts, fund-holding and the  contracting system between trusts and health authorities or  fund-holders.    A report drawing together the research results says that  while the changes have put in place systems for improving  performance, and while there is potential for exploiting them,  there is yet only limited evidence of any gains.    Claims that trusts have led to greater efficiency are  difficult to substantiate because the first trusts were already  the more efficient units, the report says. The degree of patient  choice of hospital has always been low and the changes "do not  appear to have affected this situation".    Services for elderly people have shown no improvement in  terms of choice, accessibility, communication or quality, with  patients covered by the research having waited longer for  treatment in 1992 than in 1990.    Introduction of medical audit has offered a chance to  improve  the quality of care by highlighting and reviewing good and bad  practice, the report says.    But research at four hospitals showed that it was  interpreted  too narrowly and was dominated by senior doctors, excluding  other health professionals.    While the report says that fund-holding general  practitioners  have achieved benefits for their patients, and that fund-holding  is one of the few parts of the changes having the planned effect  on competitive efficiency, it warns that this may be at the  expense of equity of treatment.    "The evidence suggests that a two-tier service has developed  in places, almost by default." Although it is argued that all  patients will eventually benefit, "it is hard to see how this  could come about without some expansion in funding to finance  across-the-board improvements in services".    Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Health  Service, welcomed the report but said that the changes had not  yet been fully implemented, with re-structuring of health  authorities, the Department of Health and the NHS management  executive still to come.    "The reality for patients is that the NHS has reduced  waiting  times, increased the level of treatment and enabled significant  improvements in the quality of care provided," Sir Duncan said.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Nuremberg, May 22 (CTK) -- The right to  homeland for the 2.5 million Sudeten Germans expelled from the  former Czechoslovakia after the Second World War was supported  by representatives of both the Federal and the Bavarian  governments at the 45th Sudeten German Congress today. [passage  omitted]    Kanther told the congress participants that the German  government would be on their side whenever "it was a question of  moving the right to homeland a step forward towards its full  recognition and realisation."    He said that Germans wanted to live with Czechs as peaceful  neighbours. It was thus necessary to solve problems together,  and this also meant together with the Sudeten Germans.    "Sudeten Germans have to be integrated into future  German-Czech relations with great calm and matter-of-factness,  in a spirit of friendship and reconciliation and the abandoning  of revanchism," Kanther said. It would help attempts at  understanding when "those responsible in the Czech Republic  recognise it as a priority of mutual relations."    "I know that dialogue between Sudeten Germans and our Czech  neighbours will not be simple," Kanther said. He also stressed  that normalisation of the situation in Central and Eastern  Europe was in the German interest.    He omitted from the prepared version of his speech, which  met  with only measured applause, a more vigorously formulated  passage addressed to the Czech government.    Stoiber's speech was clearly motivated by the June elections  to the European parliament and the September elections to the  Bavarian Land Assembly. He praised Czech-Bavarian cooperation,  but said it was lacking in discussion between Prague and the  Sudeten Germans. "What is missing is political dialogue between  the Czech government, the Czech parliament, and elected  representatives of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft  (countrymen's association)" he said.    "Rejecting dialogue is not politics," he said, adding that  he  believed this policy "harmed a good neighbourly relationship."  He also called upon German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to  "put this dialogue on to the German-Czech agenda," and spoke in  favour of the abolishment of the Benes decrees of "lawlessness"  by which the Sudeten Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia  (after the Second World War) which "are no longer suitable for  the European landscape of the end of the 20th century.    Stoiber denied using the planned oil pipeline from  Ingolstadt, Bavaria to the Czech Republic as a means of putting  political pressure on the Czech Republic. "The pipeline project  is another sign of our good neighbourliness," he said, adding  that Czech leaders recognised that Bavaria was not only talking,  but was also acting in favour of bilateral cooperation.    Yesterday, Federal Finance Minister and chairman of  Bavaria's  Christian Social Union (CSU) Theo Waigel had also called upon  the Czech Republic to hold dialogue with Sudeten Germans.    Another speaker today was Imrich Kruzliak, introduced as an  adviser to Slovak President Michal Kovac. "The Sudeten question  cannot be swept under the carpet because of political  calculations," he said.    The congress, which takes place every year, was attended by  several tens of thousands of people. The organisers are talking  about a figure of 100,000.    According to information from the Landsmannschaft, 3.8  million people now declare themselves to be Sudeten Germans, of  whom 3.4 million live in Germany, 160,000 in Austria and 100,000  in the Czech Republic. However, in the last census in the  former Czechoslovakia in 1990, only 50,000 people declared  themselves to be of German nationality. [passage omitted]    The Nuremberg meeting was not attended by official  representatives of the Czech Republic. Until 1989, in fact, the  Czechoslovak ambassador used to leave West Germany in protest  every year for the duration of the congress. In 1990, however,  the ambassador came to the congress, and in 1991 it was attended  by a group of Czech parliamentary deputies. [passage omitted]</p>

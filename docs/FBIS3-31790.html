			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lieutenant Colonel General Ratko Mladic, commander  in chief of the Srpska republic army, today inspected Srpska  republic army units in the 1st Krajina Corps' operational zone.  In a talk with reporters, General Mladic commented on the  latest events in Sarajevo following NATO's ultimatum to the  Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from around the city. A  report by our correspondent Dragan Stekic:.    [Stekic] General Mladic visited the fighters and officers of  the 1st Krajina Corps in the course of his regular tour.  Accompanied by the commander of this corps, Lieutenant Colonel  General Momir Talic, the commander in chief inspected a number  of units on Mount Ozren and the Doboj and Teslic fronts, and  expressed satisfaction at the morale of the fighters and their  resolve to defend the borders of the Srpska republic and counter  any threats to Serb territories.    In a brief meeting with reporters, General Mladic commented  on the latest developments on the fronts around Sarajevo and the  placing of Serb heavy artillery under the supervision of the UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]:    [begin recording] [Mladic] We have displayed the maximum  understanding this time to peacefully resolve the war drama on  the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has never even crossed our minds to  leave the people in the lurch and at the mercy of our enemy's  whims. What they and their sponsors had in store for us became  evident in the past stages of this war. Therefore, our weapons  will be supervised by UN forces, which does not mean that we  will not defend ourselves if attacked. We will defend ourselves  with all available means. The guarantee for our survival is our  might and our unity, not anybody's will.    [Stekic] UNPROFOR's Russian troops are now deployed along  the  separation lines. Are they enough of a guarantee for the  maintenance of the truce in this area?    [Mladic] If I were to judge, I would describe this as a  major  international development. I believe that a great world power  has every right to be in the focus of events in this region in  these difficult times. I think that the presence of Russian  troops in the role of peacekeepers will significantly contribute  to the equal treatment of all sides in the conflict in future,  in contrast to the international community's present one-sided  approach to our enemies -- the Muslims and the Croats and their  armies -- and the maximum logistical support and media coverage  they are receiving.    [Stekic] In your view, is there a possibility NATO might  strike against Muslim and Croat positions?    [Mladic] [Chuckles] Hardly. They would never strike against  their satellites. They [Muslims and Croats] belong to them.  They have been preparing for war in their countries, they are  toeing their line, obeying their orders. They are their  extended hand in the Balkans. Why would they pound them? True,  they have been at each other's throats, but they [NATO] know how  to keep them in line. They have ways of dealing with them if  things get out of hand.

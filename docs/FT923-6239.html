			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading BUSY trading in the futures market yesterday was once again dominated by currency and interest rate concerns, writes Christopher Price. The September contract on the FT-SE Index opened weakly at 2,306 as independent traders figured large on the selling side. However, a squeeze developed and, soon after the opening, September moved forward, reaching the day's high of 2,314 by 10am. By this time, however, traders' minds were again focused on sterling, the dollar and the D-Mark, and the effect on UK base rates. As pressure on the pound mounted, the market began to slide, accentuated in late-morning trading by a big sell programme by BZW. Further events combined to maintain the downward pressure: a weak Wall Street, a French opinion poll on Maastricht, and a large sell order executed by US broking house Salomon Brothers. September hit 2,256, its low of the session, late in the day's trading, but rallied towards the end. It finished at 2,285, down 31 points from the previous close and around a 5-point premium to its fair value of 5.5. Turnover was 17,139 lots. In traded options, volume reached 41,335 contracts, of which 15,957 were in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

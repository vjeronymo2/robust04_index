			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent Vasiliy </F> Naumov: "Agro-Industrial Complex Is Deteriorating, but the Herd  of Horses and Camels Is Growing"]    [Text] The Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] has  released the preliminary results of financial-economic  operations of the republic's agro-industrial complex. Over 1993  the expected losses of sovkhozes, kolkhozes, and agricultural  combines will amount to 129.6 million tenge, and the loss level  is 4.8 percent, while a year earlier 119.7 million  tenge--recalculated into national currency equivalency--was  earned in profits and the profitability level was 7.4 percent.  Also, 1,232 entities, or 49 percent of the total, will account  for 422.4 million tenge in losses.    As we can see, almost one-half of public sector agricultural  enterprises ended up bankrupt. The other half, which have  survived the trials of a savage market, managed to cover only  71.7 percent of the losses.    It would be useful to look at the financial side from the  sectoral angle. Plant-growing, for instance, is overall  profitable--17.5 percent. Moreover, all the main sectors are  profitable: grain production--19 percent, potatoes--32 percent,  field-grown vegetables--36 percent, and so on. At the same time,  losses from sales of animal husbandry products amounted to 323.1  million tenge; the loss level in milk production is 40 percent,  wool--39 percent, and horned cattle--34 percent.    The costs of agricultural production increased 11-fold as  compared to last year, which in turn resulted in increased  production costs in plant-growing by a factor of nine to 25, and  in animal husbandry by a factor of seven to 11.    The Goskomstat provides specific data on how much of what  products was produced, and the comparison between 1993 and 1992  figures. Grain and legumes were planted on 22 million hectares,  or 348,000 hectares less than during the preceding year. The  area sown decreased with respect to all crops, but an especially  sharp cutback occurred with respect to millet--almost by half.  The gross yield of grain in all categories of farms amounted to  21.6 million tonnes, which is 8.1 million, or 27 percent, less  compared to last year's yield.    Grain yield per hectare amounted on average to 9.7 quintals,  which is one quarter lower than the levels reached in the past.  The average yield of millet was only 4.4 quintals per hectare,  and buckwheat--3.2 quintals. The shortfall in the production of  these crops amounted to 216,000 and 99,000 tonnes, respectively.  Production of potatoes and vegetables also declined in 1993--by  9 percent and 15 percent, respectively. There are two  reasons--smaller area sown and lower yields. The output of fruit  and berries, as well as grapes, also declined as compared to  last year--by 37 percent and 52 percent. The gross yield of  sugar beet declined by almost one-quarter, and sunflower  seed--by 12 percent.    As Goskomstat reports, the herd of horned cattle decreased  as  compared to last year by 5 percent, of swine--by 6 percent, and  of sheep--by 1 percent. At the same time, the herd of horses  increased by 4 percent, and of camels--by the same proportion.    At first glance, the herd of cattle decreased  insignificantly. Translated into absolute figures, however, the  numbers are impressive--hundreds of thousands of head. I will  add myself that over the past three years the herd of horned  cattle decreased by 596,200 head, swine--by 783,800 (that is, by  one-quarter), and of sheep and goats--by 1,460,500.    The state of affairs in animal husbandry in different  regions  of the republic obviously is far from the same. For instance,  the most perceptible decline in the size of horned cattle herd  took place in Pavlodar Oblast--by 28 percent; in North  Kazakhstan Oblast it decreased by 10 percent, and in Kustanay  Oblast--by 7 percent. The herd of swine decreased by one-fifth  in South Kazakhstan Oblast and almost one-third in Zhezkazgan  Oblast; in a number of northern oblasts an active reduction of  sheep and goats herd is underway. There are, however,  encouraging examples as well. In southern and western oblasts,  for instance, there was an increase in the size of horned cattle  herd, in Akmolinsk and Karaganda Oblast--in swine, and in  Atyrau, Mangistau, Kzyl-Orda and some other oblasts--in the  number of sheep and goats.    According to Goskomstat reports, the reduction of herd in  the  public sectors, which began several years ago, continues. The  hope that the private sector will make up for the losses did not  fully materialize. Yes, there is an increase, but not as  significant as expected. Take for instance horned cattle. Their  number at private farms increased by 18,000, bringing the total  to 87,000. This is less than 1 percent of their total number.    They say that under market laws, bankrupt enterprises cease  to exist and are sold at auction. But there are just too many of  them--1,232, almost one-half. Let us say some brave people will  undertake this step. But who would want them, these economically  insolvent agricultural enterprises?    This is the first thing. Second, sovkhozes and kolkhozes  became bankrupt not by their own volition. There were, of  course, unprofitable enterprises before--five, 10 years ago--but  not this many! And the explanation that in the past the state  subsidized them is not valid, because at the same time it  underpaid the farms for their products, and rural workers--for  their labor.    Third, over the past three years everything has been done to  push agro-industrial complex enterprises into bankruptcy. Prices  for industrial production grew much faster than for agricultural  output. The cost of borrowing was unsustainable for sovkhozes  and kolkhozes. On top of that, the state treasury ran out of  money, delaying payments for grain and other products procured  from the farms, which devalued the earnings even more.    It is clear today that the comprehensive solution for the  problems of the agro-industrial complex that seemed possible  turned out to be unacceptable. It is not so simple to disband  unprofitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and land cannot be  distributed to farmers overnight. Plus, far from all will take  it, and it is far from certain that those who will can get  operate it profitably. Of more than 15,000 private farms, a good  half, or maybe even more, also are bankrupt. Thousands of  independent peasants do not know how to make the ends meet.    In short, just as the leadership of the Peasant Union and  the  Kolkhoz Council had predicted, the republic's agro-industrial  complex has run aground, and solidly. And it is unlikely that we  will be able to find a genius (domestic or foreign) capable of  sorting everything out--when and what step to make, what to do  today, what--the day after tomorrow. We will have to search for  a solution together--politicians, economists, scientists, and  peasants.    The number one priority by far should be the introduction of  price parity on industrial and agricultural production, without  which economic stabilization is impossible. Agricultural Academy  scientists have developed a conceptual program of  agro-industrial complex development, and it would be a waste not  to use it. Academician M. Suleymenov, director of Imeni A.I.  Barayeva Scientific-Research Institute of Grain Growing,  Transportation Academician S. Plokhov, and others offer original  ideas aimed at stable development of grain growing. All we need  is to learn how to see and hear them.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Kohl braves his 'twilight months' The mood in Germany is more miserable than at any stage since the depths of the last depression in 1980, and the popularity of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has hit a new low, according to opinion polls. The newspapers are talking of collapse in the ruling coalition and a 'twilight of the chancellor'. Yet Mr Kohl himself remains unmoved and apparently immovable: 'It is only midday,' he said yesterday. 'I do not see any sign of twilight.' The occasion was the chancellor's traditional end-of-year press conference, a ritual round-up of the government's successes, and failures, of the year, and a chance for the media to tease and taunt their prime political target. If the opinion polls are anything to go by, Mr Kohl is in dire straits. The Forsa opinion research institute said yesterday that only 24 per cent of the population would back him to become chancellor again, against 37 per cent for his rival, Mr Rudolf Scharping of the Social Democratic party. It is four points down on the chancellor's rating one year ago, according to the poll for RTL television. On the other hand, no fewer than 39 per cent do not like the idea of either Mr Kohl or Mr Scharping as chancellor. As for the respected Allensbach Institute, the longest established of Germany's opinion polling organisations, it says that the national gloom is deepening. No fewer than 83 per cent of the population believe they are living through particularly difficult and uncertain times, and fear it will stay that way. Barely one third of west Germans believe in a brighter future. The pessimism, according to the Allensbach monthly poll in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, is worse than at any time since 1980. Yet the chancellor's performance yesterday suggests that he sees nothing to worry about. He demonstrated his faith in his ability to sit out any storm, and emerge victorious at the general election in October 1994. The chancellor could hardly be said to be cocky. His mood was subdued. On most of the questions of the day - such as budget cuts, the Russian elections, the state presidency, and his own re-election - his answers were very much the same: 'You will have to wait and see.' But it is a formula which has stood him in good stead up till now.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon little changed at Pounds 32.5m LOWER SCOTCH whisky volumes and weaker prices took their toll on pre-tax profits at Invergordon Distillers Group. Profits of Pounds 32.5m for the year to December 31 were less than 1 per cent ahead of the previous year's Pounds 32.2m. On an FRS 3 basis, however, the accounts showed an increase of 16 per cent, with the 1991 figure restated at Pounds 28m after an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.2m for the defence against the bid from Whyte &amp; Mackay was reclassified as an exception-al. Earnings per share - on the same basis - were 30 per cent ahead at 17.5p (13.5p). A final dividend of 4.2p lifts the total to 7p, an increase of 7.7 per cent. Turnover declined 8 per cent from Pounds 92.4m to Pounds 85m as prices came under pressure; but the fall in operating profit was held to 3.8 per cent at Pounds 35.3m. Mr Chris Greig, managing director, said that overall sales volumes were 1 per cent higher. Sales in the UK rose 6 per cent as the group maintained its leading position in the own-label Scotch whisky sector, but export volumes were 3 per cent lower, due to a 14 per cent reduction in bulk sales, mainly to Japan and Australasia. 'However, there was a favourable movement in the mix of export business as bottled-in-Scotland volume increased by 12 per cent,' Mr Greig said. Volume sales of the group's Cluny brand increased 18 per cent; Isle of Jura single malt sales rose 9 per cent; and Invergordon single grain whisky volumes were 45 per cent higher. Invergordon's grain distillery continued to operate at more than 90 per cent capacity, but its four malt distilleries reduced output from 65 per cent to 60 per cent of capacity and a further 15 per cent cut is planned this year. The new white spirit distilling joint venture at Greenwich is expected to make a small contribution to profits this year. The group, which has benefited from increasing use of its own whisky stocks, continued to add to them. Stocks were valued at Pounds 59.7m compared with Pounds 55.5m in 1991. Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 33.5m to Pounds 25m, bringing gearing down from 73 per cent to 42 per cent. Interest charges fell 38 per cent to Pounds 2.8m. COMMENT Invergordon's strength in the own-label sector - one of the few beneficiaries of recession - and its stocks of mature whisky enabled it to ride the difficulties of the market with some success until late last year. But with continuing pressures on volumes and margins, the strain is beginning to show and is likely to increase this year. Analysts forecast a decline in profits for 1993 to between Pounds 30m and Pounds 31.5m, putting the group on a prospective p/e of 16, still a 15 per cent premium to the market and a rating 20 per cent to 25 per cent higher than Guinness. That reflects expectations of a renewed bid from Whyte &amp; Mackay, now biding its time in the wings with its 41.3 per cent stake. It could make an entrance later this year.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Basque elections strike further blow at Gonzalez Attempts by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to regain the political initiative have suffered a significant setback in regional elections in the Basque country, where conservatives and communists made strong gains at the expense of his Socialist party. The Basque elections on Sunday were won, as expected, by the mainstream nationalist party, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV), which regained the 22 seats it had held in the outgoing 75-member regional parliament. But despite an active campaign by Mr Gonzalez, the Socialist party, which had been the junior coalition partner in the PNV-led Basque government, lost four of its 16 seats in the local legislature, its worst electoral result in the region. In a highly fragmented vote that will make creation of a new governing majority difficult, the conservative Partido Popular (PP) gained 11 seats, up from six, and the communist-led Izquierda Unida group (IU), which previously had no members in the Basque parliament, returned six. Sunday's poll underlined the sharp fall in support for the prime minister that emerged last June when the PP established a 10-point lead over the Socialists to win the European parliament elections, and when both the PP and IU doubled their vote in Andalucia, Mr Gonzalez's home region, causing the Socialist party to lose its majority in local elections held on the same day. Mr Gonzalez, who was returned to power for a fourth term in 1993 although without an overall majority, is blamed for a severe recession that has raised unemployment to a record level and for a series of corruption scandals that rocked his government earlier this year. June's defeats propelled the often reclusive prime minister into a hectic schedule of parliamentary appearences, public meetings, television 'fireside chats' and media interviews. However, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, PP leader, said yesterday the Basque poll had confirmed 'the unstoppable decline of the socialist vote'. Analysts said the Socialists had probably been penalised in the Basque elections for co-opting a local left-wing party, Euzkadiko Ezkerra, on to its ticket and campaigning for the 'ethnic' Basque vote. Traditional socialist voters in the area are mainly immigrants from elsewhere in Spain or their descendants. Mr Gonzalez's popularity will next be tested in municipal elections in May, as well as in polls to elect new parliaments in 13 of Spain's 17 autonomous regions. The responsibility for leading the Basque executive, meanwhile, falls once more to the PNV, which has governed the area, either on its own on in coalition with the Socialists, since 1980.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU to renew Andean Pact trade benefits The European Union has promised to renew economic assistance and trade benefits to the Andean Pact trade group and endorsed the economic reform and drug fighting efforts of its member countries. EU representatives of the Andean-European Commission, which met in Quito last week, said the preferential tariff system offered to the four other members of the pact - Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru - was likely to be renewed and expanded to include Venezuela. The special tariff regime, which exempts most exports to Europe from duties, was first granted to the four countries four years ago to help these countries in their fight against drug production and trafficking. Venezuela is being included because it is part of the Andean Pact and faces similar drug problems, according to Mr Juan Pratt, the head of the EU delegation. The final decision by the European Council is expected before the end of the year. Despite open access to the European market, Andean Pact exports to the EU have not increased or diversified over the past four years. A trade surplus of Ecu1.3bn (Dollars 1.6bn) in 1990 turned into a deficit for the pact in 1993. However, as trade with Europe has declined, trade within the pact has grown substantially. Mr Mario Reyes Chavez, head of the Andean Pact Delegation, says: 'Given our limited export potential, it is obvious that the Andean Pact members first turned towards each other for trade. But it is time for us to seriously look towards other trade blocks.' The full re-integration of Peru and a final agreement over the common external tarriff still obstructs the path towards a common customs union, initially scheduled to go into effect earlier this year. Trade analysts believe it will be difficult for Peru and Bolivia to conform to the four-tiered tariff structure agreed by the other members. Yet both Andean and European representatives acknowledged that the key to boosting trade between the two blocs goes beyond offering tariff reductions. Says Mr Pratt, 'An integral part of EU efforts in stimulating Andean exports is providing technical and financial assistance.' Several 'Euro Centres' throughout the region are to promote exports by assisting small and medium-scale entrepreneurs, providing information on ventures or exploring investment and trade opportunities in Europe. Despite the European union's pledge to renew trade benefits and technical assistance, Ecuador emerged from the meeting with none of its trade worries resolved. EU restrictions on Latin American bananas, which affect Ecuador as the world's largest exporter, were not discussed. As a further blow to its diversification efforts, two weeks ago the US imposed a 50 per cent tariff on the country's rose growing and exporting industry.</p>

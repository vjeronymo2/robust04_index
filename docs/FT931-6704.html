			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Baffled? DTI has an answer - Computing 'THIS accounts package does not work] It can't even calculate VAT on my invoices properly.' The voice at the other end of the line was accusing; after all, only a few months ago I had recommended the package in question as a Best Buy in one of the Personal Computer magazines. I asked the gentleman to send me a copy of his disks and some of the faulty invoices. The problem soon became clear. His business was wine retailing where prices are quoted inclusive of VAT. He wanted to invoice a VAT-inclusive gross price such as Pounds 3.99 and for the computer to automatically calculate net price and VAT. Unfortunately, accounts packages normally expect you to enter the VAT-exclusive net price and to calculate VAT and gross. Each method of calculation yields slightly different VAT amounts. He needed both, since some of his sales invoices were for wine in bond which is quoted at VAT-exclusive prices. Now whether or not this Pounds 299 budget package should have offered both methods for calculating VAT is arguable. The important point is that the wine merchant, when he started looking for an accounts package, had no idea that his invoicing requirements were unusual and might present a problem. He thought he just had to go out and buy an accounts package which did invoicing. When you buy a computer vague objectives such as 'I want it to do my invoicing,' or 'I want it to handle stock control' are not good enough, for at the nuts and bolts level at which computers operate there are endless permutations of invoicing or stock control and you have to know precisely which versions you need. Without a doubt, the key to buying a computer system that works is first to define in detail the tasks the computer will be required to carry out. Before looking at solutions, first spend some time defining the problem. This can save you hours of frustration and wasted time later on. The more effort you put into setting down a detailed specification before you start looking at computers, the easier your search will be. The prospective buyer who starts armed with even a thorough 'spec' will have a clear view of what he is looking for, and this helps him keep his eye on the ball as he wades through all the jargon and technical irrelevancies with which the computer vendors will inevitably assail him. In the computer industry this document is referred to as a 'specification of requirements' or 'system Specification'. Writing one is a skilled task normally performed by a 'systems analyst'. It requires experience both of business (in order to understand how the current manual system works) and also of computers (how a computer system could replace it). A systems analyst is the key person in any computer purchase since he or she is the only person involved who has an understanding of both areas. Such individuals are rare, and competent systems analysts tend to work for big companies or the more expensive dealers. For the smaller company that wants to computerise, perhaps the best route is to have its specification of requirements written by a consultant under the DTI Enterprise Scheme. The Enterprise Scheme applies to individuals, companies or partnerships in manufacturing or services employing fewer than 500 people. The majority of DTI projects are done for businesses with 20 employees or less. Under the Financial and Information Systems Initiative, you can employ a consultant to define your specification for you. The DTI will pay half, or in some cases two-thirds, of the cost. Minimum time for the project is five working days, maximum 15 days. As a consultant, I invariably get my customers to apply for an FMIS subsidy under the Enterprise scheme. The FMIS Initiative is an important scheme which ought to be more widely publicised. The client is guaranteed a reasonable level of competence (all consultants are screened before they are allowed to go on the DTI register). One disadvantage is that it concerns itself entirely with producing the system specification which, while essential, is simply a means to achieving an end, that is a working computer system. Make it clear to your consultant at the outset, that you do not just want a big report for your money; you expect the computer to be installed and working. For this a further five days subsidy is available for 'implementation guidance.' The first step is to telephone your regional DTI branch for the brochure and an application form. But hurry] The DTI Enterprise scheme is scheduled to end in 1994. DTI Greater London, call 071-627-7800. For other regions phone the DTI's free Innovation Enquiry line on 0800-44-2001.

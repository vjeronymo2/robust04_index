			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD General Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F> Ollaf Opitz; place and date not given: "A Great Similarity"]    [Text] [Opitz] The United States wants to test Rudolf  Scharping to see if he is a suitable candidate for chancellor.  The most important examination question: Does an SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany]-governed Germany demand a special  role for itself in security policy?    [Verheugen] Not at all. The basis of German security policy  is fixed. That means a firm presence in NATO and in the  European Union. Germany remains a reliable alliance partner  that adheres to its duties. That is one of the important  messages that Rudolf Scharping will deliver in the United  States. The close German-U.S. partnership is more than just a  security-political challenge for the SPD. In this partnership,  we want to introduce a new dimension, that of economic and  environmental policy, something which the Federal Government has  badly neglected. In this sphere we notice a harmony with  President Clinton's own views.    [Opitz] The Clinton administration also wants to know if  Chancellor Scharping would permit German units to be involved in  UN operations.    [Verheugen] That is an artificial subject. The UN is not at  war, and NATO cannot independently assume tasks that go beyond  its mission of common defense. It can only do so within a UN  framework, and in the future the UN will not demand that German  troops are sent into action.    [Opitz] But the UN secretary general sees things  differently.    [Verheugen] Butrus-Ghali thinks Germany could support the UN  in various ways. The UN needs unlimited assistance. We are  ready to give it. But I do not understand why everyone keeps  talking about combat operations. Where on earth should UN units  fight? On the contrary, after the experience of Somalia and  Bosnia, the UN is reverting to its classic peacekeeping  function, and not combat operations. Germany can take part in  anything that is undertaken within this peacekeeping framework.  But just like any other country, including the United States,  in every single case we reserve the right to check whether  German involvement is expedient or not.    [Opitz] That sounds just like Hans-Ulrich Klose's demand for  blue helmets and more.    [Verheugen] This is not a question of deploying blue  helmets. It is something that has developed in the UN. For  years, it was widely believed in Germany that the blue helmets  do nothing except monitor cease-fires, whereby people tended to  forget that the blue helmets have the right and duty to perform  their job with reasonable force if necessary.    [Opitz] That is a clever way of putting it. Even so it  sounds surprisingly like what the SPD was saying months ago.    [Verheugen] The SPD learned a lesson that was reflected in  our party resolution in Wiesbaden. We are going one step  further than the UN. We want to see the use of blockades as a  means of preventing or stopping wars. In such a case, blockades  can be backed up militarily.    [Opitz] But you will have problems with a potential  coalition partner. Since the Mannheim decision by the Greens  that they would leave NATO, the idea of a red-green Federal  Government is a nightmare for the United States.    [Verheugen] The SPD does not want a coalition partner that  calls for withdrawal from NATO and the abolition of the  Bundeswehr. There will be no such coalition. The Bundeswehr  retains its classic defense function. We want to provide it  with a certain future. In any case, NATO will be needed until  we have a stable all-European system of security that involves  the United States. Scharping will tell the United States in no  uncertain terms that there is no German partner for the kind of  policy that the Greens formulated in Mannheim. Our U.S. friends  can count on it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the city of Nampula today, the police were  involved in violent clashes with former militiamen who guarded  the Mademo wood company. The militiamen and Mademo workers have  been on strike since yesterday, demanding the payment of salary  arrears. The clash occurred when the police tried to disperse  the demonstrators that have been gathering outside the  Provincial Agriculture Directorate building since yesterday. A  child and his mother were seriously wounded during the clash.  Two policemen, including the commander of the city's police  headquarters, were hit by bullets fired by their colleagues.  Reports say the demonstrators had seized three firearms from  policemen, but decided to return them following talks with  mediators from the Provincial Agriculture Directorate.    Meanwhile, the mediators and workers' representatives have  begun reviewing salary arrears dating back to 1991. The  Ministry of Agriculture was today scheduled to send a check  corresponding to the amount demanded by the workers.    Many of the city's shops remained closed today and road  traffic suspended due to the demonstration involving some 90  Mademo workers as well as former militiamen.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALE OF POKER CLUB DELAYED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> The sale of the Horseshoe Club, one of Gardena's three poker clubs, was put on  hold this week when the City Council voted to table a proposal from a group of  investors who balked at the city's requirements for a license transfer.  </P> <P> City officials on Tuesday told prospective buyer Herbert Stern and his partner,  Leonard Baum, that before the city would approve issuing a license to the  group, five conditions must be met, including the establishment of a $180,000  escrow account to cover four weeks' pay for the club's 250 employees.  </P> <P> The city also requested a letter of credit for $6 million. Stern, former  president of an investment group that owned the Commerce Club, must also sever  all ties with that club.  </P> <P> Officials said the conditions were necessary to ensure the club's solvency  during an extensive remodeling of its facilities at Vermont and Rosecrans  avenues.  </P></p>

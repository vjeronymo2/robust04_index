			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. DEUKMEJIAN, LEGISLATORS END BUDGET IMPASSE  </P> <P> How do we avoid our annual state budget snafu?  </P> <P> Set up a referendum providing that pay for our legislative bodies and the  governor expire with the budget -- irrevocably.  </P> <P> This would include all perks -- lease cars go into the garage, no meals, no  travel allowance, etc. What do you think the odds would be that we would never  again have one budget expire without another one approved?  </P> <P> WALTER C.

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: A lifeline for the South Bank - The rebuilding of London's riverside arts centre must be uncompromising For three shillings and sixpence in 1951 it was possible to buy A Pocket Guide to Modern Buildings in London by Ian McCallum, who was then the editor of the Architectural Review. In this elegant little guide book the author wrote about the buildings of the Festival of Britain beside the Thames. 'On the South Bank particularly can be shown how brilliance, colour, drama, surprise and even prettiness are fully within the range of modern architecture, for so long considered proficient only in the limited field of austere puritanism. For the public this means not only light and warmth but a way of life that has once again some glamour in it - green things, pleasant textures, colours, vistas, urbanities which were once the perquisite of privilege.' How wrong can you be? The philosophy that informed the Festival of Britain was supposed to extend to the permanent development of the South Bank site once the exhibition buildings had gone and only the Festival Hall remained. Today the South Bank remains untouched by urbanity and, to a large degree, ruthlessly ugly. Although the Royal Festival Hall does remain a distinctive modern building of some quality, there is little else of any merit on the site. Last week I walked around the whole of the 27 acres, which comes under the control of the South Bank Board, with Nicholas Snowman, the board's chief executive. The Board has decided under its recently appointed chairman, Sir Brian Corby (chairman of The Prudential), to hold an international competition to find a master planner for the long overdue transformation of the site. My walkabout was a grim experience not unlike a tour of a part of a city that had been partly destroyed in a war and then occupied by a motley group of tramps and culture vultures. We started our walk by Waterloo station where in a few months the first of the anticipated 15m annual visitors from Europe will emerge from their Channel Tunnel experience. Will they notice any difference as they burrow beneath the railway arches (some of them blitzed or occupied by tramps) and struggle to reach a glimpse of the river? At present it is impossible from ground level to find your way with ease to any of the cultural destinations. If you stray too far you may well find yourself in the 'cardboard city' of the homeless that still disgraces the huge sunken traffic island near Waterloo Bridge. Once you get near to the foothills of the Hayward Gallery, the only real hope you have of reaching the light is by climbing what look like concrete fire escapes leading to the concrete uplands of the world of the walkways. As far as I know no one finds this environment acceptable. Access is confusing and the quality of the public spaces is visually repellent. It is worth dwelling for a while on the merits of the three main cultural buildings. First of all the Royal Festival Hall - she sits amidst all this concrete squalor like some faded starlet who has seen better days. She has had her make-up renewed and one or two transplants so that she can keep that air of 1950s refinement and slight apartness from her cruder neighbours. I think people like the old girl because she is not aggressively modern and has a definite sense of style and lightness. Nowadays she has to carry the burden of being a Grade I listed building - and it is encouraging that her owners see her virtues and are trying to remove some of the detritus of commerce that litters the spacious foyers and detracts from the sense of transparency and light that makes it an intriguing and festive building by day and at night. Then there are the two ugly sisters - the Hayward Gallery and the Queen Elizabeth Hall. They never got to the ball in 1951 because they were born too late. The tragedy is that they were not aborted. As architecture, they are not only without distinction but they are a product of the 1960s when a cell of LCC/GLC architects thought it was clever and avant-garde to insult both the city and the public by the erection of monsters. The present regime at the South Bank Board and their immediate predecessors seem prepared to tread the path of mere expediency. They feel they have to try to do something to improve these horror buildings simply because they are there. There is only one solution to humanise that part of the South Bank and that is to destroy these vile creatures of the 1960s by demolition. Only then can the true value of the site be appreciated again and only then can a master plan of any real civic value be achieved. Today is the last day for any architect, designer or urban planner in the world to submit his two sheets of A4 paper about 'the role of cultural centres in the 21st century'. Their names will be vetted by a pretty sinister committee of taste that comprises eight people - four of them part of the South Bank Centre; three architects and an artist. The architects are Eldred Evans (designer with her husband of the St. Ives Tate Gallery); Alan Stanton, a good exhibition designer who is currently sadly wrecking the Ashmolean in Oxford; and the amusing and possibly liveliest member of the group, Christian de Portzamparc, a chic favourite of Parisian architectural circles. The artist is an inevitable Turner Prizewinner - Anish Kapoor. I pin my hopes for a sane solution upon the down to earth skills of Sir Brian Corby. Ten names will be chosen to go ahead and be given the full brief, and by the middle of August three shortlisted 'winners' will have produced their schemes for our delectation. Will the public have any involvement? These decisions are too important to be left to an artistic clique. I do not feel that the South Bank Board realises that so much of the site has to be completely rethought. The monsters have to be taken away to some Jurassic Park for architectural relics and a major town planning exercise must be carried out that involves the whole capital city. New bridges, new Tate Galleries, new sport facilities, and above all new landscaping and new thinking about cultural ghettos are essential if some feeble compromise of expediency is to be avoided. The proposed budget is almost pathetically inadequate - of course you can improve things for Pounds 50m over five years but there is a real danger that British compromise and philistine parsimony will produce a result that lacks real vision and architectural quality. Something more than a few gestures are needed in this graveyard of brutalism.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said a pay increase for members of  Congress should be included in the pay package President Bush has proposed for  federal judges and top executive branch officials. Speaking at the National  Press Club, Foley said the "traditional linkage" between executive and  legislative branch pay "should not be broken." An attempt earlier this year to  pass a 50% pay increase for Congress and other top officials was shelved  because of public protest. Bush since has proposed raises of up to 25% for  judges and executive branch officials. Bush made no proposal for a  congressional pay raise, but Foley said he does not think the President opposes  an increase. Lawmakers currently earn $89,500 a year.  </P></p>

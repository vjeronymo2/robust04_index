			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Proposed buy-out of Univa meets opposition THE CDollars 41bn (USDollars 32.5bn) Caisse de Depot, the investment arm of the Quebec public pension plan, disagrees with a CDollars 11 a share buy-out of Univa, the Quebec-based food distributor, proposed on February 9 by Blackstone Group, the New York investment bankers. As the owner of 17.3 per cent, fully-diluted, of Univa, the Caisse says the Blackstone offer does not recognise Univa's potential for recovery from the downward cycle in food distribution. While the Caisse uses the word disagree, it leaves little doubt it will oppose the potential offer. The Caisse is an independent agency of the provincial government but usually works with public policy. The proposal, worth CDollars 1.03bn, was made by Blackstone Capital Partners and Mr Bertin Nadeau, chairman of Univa and its biggest shareholder with 26 per cent of the equity. Blackstone offered CDollars 11 a share for all Univa's 94m common shares. As part of the deal, Mr Nadeau would re-acquire a 20 per cent interest in Univa. Univa is Canada's second biggest food distributor and has an affiliate in California and several non-food subsidiaries. Mr Nadeau's stake is held through Unigesco, his own heavily-indebted holding company. The Blackstone proposal is being studied by a committee of Univa's board. One problem is that the proposal is structured as a leveraged buy-out and Univa would be saddled with well over CDollars 1bn debt. The Caisse says the proposal does not assure the integrity of Univa.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Christopher comfortable in a job he's sticking with: Jurek Martin talks to a much maligned US secretary of state with some foreign policy victories to show off Suddenly, Mr Warren Christopher does not look or sound like a man who is winding down his portfolio. Maybe it is progress in the Middle East or fruitful relations with Russia, or perhaps it is the more mundane prospect of two weeks off in California starting this weekend. But, with the Clinton administration under so much fire on so many fronts, the much maligned US secretary of state seems relatively perky these days. A one-on-one interview, part of a small series with the media, was designed to show a man in command of his brief and not about to leave it. He had already this week earned the high praise, on the Middle East if not Bosnia, of a frequently severe critic, Mr Anthony Lewis, the New York Times columnist, who also had been given an extensive interview. Mr Christopher was ready for the one question that had to be asked about his security in office. 'The president and I are working on a number of problems with a very long time line ahead. Under his direction and with his strong support, I expect to be working on them for some time . . . (pause and small smile) . . . with the grace of God.' He goes on: 'Preoccupation with my future is one I don't share.' The second message was directed at Europe - and perhaps (though never mentioned by name) Dr Henry Kissinger, who just that morning had unleashed one of his regular broadsides accusing the administration of neglecting the Atlantic alliance because of its over-emphasis on Russia. The word is that Europe matters, as witnessed by three presidential trips this year and many more by Mr Christopher himself. 'The irony is I've spent more time on European security than on the Middle East,' which is widely considered to be the leitmotif of his tenure. Towards the end of last year, he says, the US was looking at a 'sulphurous' trade conflict with western Europe. But the Gatt agreement 'lifted the cloud' and contributed, along with a lot of leadership from Mr Manfred Worner, the late Nato secretary general, to the improved climate that brought about Nato's Partnership for Peace programme of co-operation with the former Warsaw Pact nations. (Mr Christopher is delivering a eulogy at the memorial service for Mr Worner tomorrow.) The search for 'new or renewed architecture' had been a constant imperative. Mr Christopher sees nothing wrong in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which Dr Kissinger commended as the best vehicle for working with Moscow. But he maintains that building mutual confidence between Nato and the former Warsaw Pact ought to be based on the practical experience that PFP was intended to foster. In any case, the direct Washington-Moscow channel had worked well enough in attempting to resolve the status of Russians still in the Baltics. 'Never forget, too, that it was the Europeans who came to us in January' for help on Bosnia, he says. The Bosnian 'contact group' had done much good work. 'It was worth taking time to keep the Russians on board,' while, with Britain and France 'we can't turn away from our longstanding friends.' It took time, also, to establish 'the Moslem bottom line'. Yet he does not deny the possibility of another crunch with the allies if Mr Clinton follows the will of Congress and ends, unilaterally if necessary, the arms embargo on Bosnia early in November, assuming the Bosnian Serbs have not by then signed up to the peace plan. 'No one is ready to give up on the possible acceptance of the contact group plan,' he insists, but adds that it would be unwise to pin too many hopes on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia delivering the signature of the Bosnian Serbs. 'He will take some steps, but not too many,' partly because of the sort of pressure from his ultra-nationalists that led him to reject the posting of UN monitors on the border with the Bosnian Serbs. In that event, 'it will be time to ring up the sums'. It had always been clear, he says, that 'there might come a day when the time would come to lift the embargo.' Even the Russians, he implies, understand this. If that renders the presence of Unprofor in Bosnia untenable, then, in effect, so be it. Mr Christopher suggests that such a decision might in any case 'coincide' with domestic pressure in Britain and France for a withdrawal of their Unprofor contingents. The secretary of state is not given to sweeping visions or grand strategic concepts, which frustrates his critics. Even when addressing human tragedies such as Bosnia and Rwanda, he still speaks like the lawyer he is. Thus Bosnia, he repeats, is 'an important - but not vital - interest to the US'. Rwanda and Burundi could be placed in the same category, though Haiti, as a potential hemispheric source of instability, is of a different order. With some hope, he says, 'we could well be working out an approach more akin to case law than the enunciation of great principles'. He takes encouragement from the fact that the proposed Bosnian war crimes tribunal has already indicated its willingness to extend its jurisdiction to Rwanda. Somalia, he goes on, 'showed us what we can do (bring relief) and what we can't do (nation-building)'. Preventative diplomacy is always worth a try - and is now being applied by the US in Burundi, with envoys stressing the 'lessons of integration'. Similarly, the US is urging the Algerian government 'to press for a dialogue with Islamic groups committed to a non-violent future'. But in a democratic society such as the US, 'we don't have an inexhaustible supply of support or patience' for efforts to solve distant and intractable problems. In Africa, especially, it does not help that regional engagement is so weak, with Nigeria, the 'former backbone of the OAU (Organisation of African Unity)' in 'such a dangerous situation', and with the new South Africa probably ill-advised 'to spread its resources too thinly' elsewhere in the continent. Even closer to home, he remains quintessentially cautious. Asked if there was not now an opening to engage Cuba's President Fidel Castro he merely acknowledges domestic political constraints, though hopes there may be 'signs of movement' among Cuban Americans committed to the overthrow of the Havana regime. But in the hierarchy of US responses nothing can compare with attacks on the US itself, its citizens and its allies, none of which, he notes with some pride, has 'really happened' (except arguably in Somalia) since he has been on the job. In the second tier come issues related to nuclear non-proliferation, be it the threat posed by North Korea or the dismantling of former Soviet missiles stationed in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. 'I don't believe we've been given enough credit for handling these problems,' he says. Only on Washington politics would Mr Christopher go off-the-record and then only to respond with a grin and the words 'no comment'. That is, at least, one proven way of surviving in the capital.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BILL TO MERGE TRANSIT AGENCIES CLEARS PANEL  </P> <P> The state Senate Transportation Committee on Tuesday approved a compromise bill  designed to lead to the merger of the Los Angeles region's two feuding transit  agencies.  </P> <P> The bill, sent to the Appropriations Committee on an 11-0 vote, allows Los  Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, his appointee and the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors to serve on both the Southern California Rapid Transit District  Board and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> The measure, by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), also requires Bradley and  the county supervisors to attend four joint meetings of the two panels each  year instead of sending alternates. Further, the legislation directs the two  agencies to approve a consolidation plan by 1992.  </P> <P> Previous efforts to reorganize the two agencies have sparked sharp controversy  and have either been vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian or stalled in the  Legislature.  </P></p>

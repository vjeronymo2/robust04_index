			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: Lindi's broadcast It sounds as if there is a little disagreement behind the cameras about the content of what could be Britain's most exciting party political broadcast this year. If Lindi St Clair, founder of Britain's Corrective Party, can raise a minimum 50 candidates willing to stand in the election, her party will qualify for an election broadcast. St Clair envisages a broadcast replete with brothel scenes - featuring 'lots of condoms, disinfectant and clean sheets' - to lend credence to her main policy idea - legalising prostitution. 'The clean side of a brothel has never been shown on the media,' she says. That is not quite what the BBC has in mind. Margaret Douglas, the Beeb's chief political adviser, was thinking more in terms of producing something similar to the swansong put out recently by the now defunct SDP. That broadcast, featuring the twin talking heads of John Cartwright and Rosie Barnes - the two remaining SDP MPs, was by common consent among the dullest of recent times. It would be a supreme test of even the former Miss Whiplash's daunting communications skills to make such a format interesting.</p>

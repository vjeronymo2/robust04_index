			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSION BAY'S LENNAN BETTER THAN WEATHER  </P> <P> Like any pitcher, Mission Bay right-hander Tony Lennan prefers to minimize his  time on the mound by throwing as few pitches as possible.  </P> <P> But Wednesday against Clairemont, Lennan didn't mind spending a little extra  time on the mound -- it was all he could do to keep his blood flowing.  </P> <P> A game that began at 3 p.m. with the sun shining and the temperature quite  pleasant ended with a biting wind whipping across the diamond, a slight drizzle  and a temperature at least 10 degrees cooler.  </P> <P> Somehow, Lennan stayed focused and warm enough to win his 10th game against one  loss, 7-2 over host Clairemont.  </P> <P> "The weather conditions were horrible," Lennan said. "I was just trying to keep  warm between innings. It seemed like every time I went out to the mound, it  took me forever to get loose again. I just wanted to get it over with."  </P> <P> Second-ranked Mission Bay (20-3) improved to 11-1 in the City Western League  and kept its one game lead over USDHS, which beat University City, 2-1. Mission  Bay meets USDHS next week in a game that will probably decide the league title.  </P> <P> Clairemont (11-12) fell to 7-6 in league play and remained third.  </P> <P> "This is the part of the season where it's a struggle," Mission Bay Coach  Dennis Pugh said. "The kids are really looking toward the playoffs."  </P> <P> Lennan, who had never pitched a high school game until this season, allowed six  hits and struck out five.  </P> <P> "It just shows you that you can take a great athlete and turn him into in a  pitcher," Pugh said. Lennan, who pitched in Pony League, had played other  positions in high school before this season.  </P> <P> Lennan surrendered his two runs in the second on two walks and a misplayed fly  ball that the Mission Bay outfield turned into a triple. Clairemont had mild  rallies in the third and sixth, advancing runners to second and third each  time. In the third with two outs, a groundout to shortstop ended the threat,  and in the sixth with no outs, Lennan struck out the side.  </P> <P> Mission Bay tied the game in the bottom of the third on three walks, a  sacrifice fly by Tommy Lefevre and a single by Guillermo Aviles. It went ahead,  4-2, in the fourth on a walk, a hit batsman and three consecutive hits. Brandon  Farley drove in the go-ahead run with a double down the left-field line, and  Aviles knocked out Clairemont starter Brandon Garland and knocked in the other  run with an opposite-field triple to the alley in right center.  </P> <P> Pat Betancourt and Brian Moranda broke open the game with home runs in the  sixth and seventh innings, Moranda's for two runs.

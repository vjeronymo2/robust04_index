			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Power Corp ready to deploy up to Dollars 2bn MR PAUL DESMARAIS, chairman of Power Corp of Canada, said he is ready to deploy most of the USDollars 2bn in cash that his holding companies control in both European and North American financial services and industrial growth sectors. Speaking after Power Corp's annual meeting, he said Pargesa Holding, which he jointly controls with the Albert Frere group of Belgium, has well over USDollars 1bn to invest in Europe. Power Corp, through Parfinance, a Pargesa affiliate, has linked with two French financial groups to pool voting interests and become the largest core shareholder group in Compagnie Financiere de Paribas, the banking, financial services and industrial holding company. Mr Desmarais said the two Canadian holding companies he directly controls, Power Corp and 70 per cent-owned Power Financial Corp, are now actively negotiating potential deals in financial services and several industrial sectors in North America. 'Capital is very scarce the world over and we are getting proposals from all quarters, including Asia and the former east bloc,' said Mr Desmarais. 'We time our moves carefully, but we would be ready to invest in forest products, for instance, despite the industry's present problems. 'We do not rule out energy. Petrofina, which we control through Pargesa, is returning to upstream oil and gas in Canada and will grow further in the US. 'We have been burned before in energy and we prefer someone with direct experience to manage expansion in that field.' In financial services the thrust of expansion, will be partly through Great-West Lifeco, a full service life company with half its USDollars 20bn assets in the US. Mr Desmarais, 64, chief executive and architect of the Power Corp group for 24 years, said he will be easing his workload gradually. He appointed his son Andre, 34, president and chief operating officer of Power Corp. His other son, Paul Jr, 36, already chairman of Power Financial Corp, the financial services subsidiary which also holds 25 per cent of Pargesa, becomes vice-chairman of Power Corp.</p>

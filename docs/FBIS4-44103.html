			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed by "A.F.": "Independent Republican Party </F> Group: Much Ado About Nothing"]    [Excerpt] The elephant gave birth to a mouse. After any  number of meetings, confabs, and minipsychodramas, the tension  was finally released in the Republican Party [PR]. Charles  Millon and [Trade and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet  prevented the party from breaking away from the Union for French  Democracy [UDF] group in the National Assembly. The PR  president, as well as Honorary President [and Defense Minister]  Francois Leotard, had been nonetheless rather in favor of this  idea. Faced with the division that this initiative caused,  however, Gerard Longuet chose the path of prudence and kept the  party within the UDF.    Defusing the crisis that began on 14 June, the party  deputies, meeting in the presence of the industry minister on  Wednesday evening [22 June] therefore unanimously voted to adopt  a motion defining the aims and strategy of the PR in the light  of the upcoming presidential election. In the text adopted at  the end of the meeting, which lasted more than one and a half  hour, the deputies confirmed that they wanted to prepare for the  presidential election of 1995 "in the best possible conditions,"  in order to avoid the fratricidal and bloody battles that marked  the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections. For them, this means  supporting the candidate for the majority, a principle that had  been adopted, they stressed, by the UPF (UDF and RPR [Rally for  the Republic]) in 1990. Speaking yesterday on the RTL station,  Philippe Vasseur, PR secretary general and deputy for the Pas de  Calais region, stated: "The union candidate can be anyone within  in the majority (...). We must stop saying that it should be  the prime minister." [passage omitted]</p>

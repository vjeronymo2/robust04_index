			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The foreign share of  Japan's semiconductor market surpassed 20 percent in the final  quarter of 1993 but failed to meet the benchmark in terms of  yearly average according to an American calculation, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced Friday  [18 March].    Foreign-made semiconductor chips seized 22.1 percent of the  Japanese market in the October-December quarter, based on a  calculation formula favored by Japan, up from 19.7 percent in  the preceding quarter.    The share stood at 20.7 percent on another calculation  method  devised by the United States, up from 18.1 percent.    As a result, the average foreign chip share in Japan in the  full year of 1993 came to 21.2 percent under the Japanese  formula, up from 18.7 percent the previous year, but slipped  below 20 percent to 19.4 percent under the American calculation  method, up from 16.6 percent.    Japan "substantially" boosted foreign chip buying during the  reporting quarter, a MITI official told a press conference.    The latest results represent "a steady improvement" in  foreign access to the Japanese chip market, the official said.    Under the 1991 bilateral chip accord, Japan expressed  "expectations" that foreign chip shares in the country would be  more than 20 percent.    In the third quarter of 1993, the share was below the  threshold by both calculation methods, dropping from 21.6  percent in the second quarter under the Japanese formula and  from 19.2 percent under the American method.    The new statistics were calculated after Japan-U.S. talks in  Hawaii that began Wednesday.    The 1991 pact incorporates two different methods for  calculating the foreign market share in Japan. The U.S. relies  on a system that counts only the sales of foreign chips in the  open market. But the Japanese formula uses a broader  measurement that includes so- called "captive" sales of foreign  companies to their Japanese subsidiaries and those by Japanese  companies under foreign brand names.    In the Japan-U.S. semiconductor trade talks in January this  year, Washington urged Tokyo to formulate a new action program  on chip trade that would augment the 1991 pact, stating the U.S.  is seriously concerned about Japan's commitment on the trade.    But Tokyo rejected the demand, saying it sees no problem in  Japan's foreign chip-buying efforts.    "The Japanese perception remains unchanged," the MITI  official said.    The chip accord does not bind Tokyo to achievement of the  stated trade figure, the official said.    The pact says the two governments agree that the 20 percent  figure "constitutes neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a floor  on the foreign market share."    Sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan, calculated in  value  terms, kept growing during the whole of 1993 according to both  calculation methods, MITI said.    But foreign shares fluctuated, affected by swings in overall  chip demand in Japan stemming from seasonal factors, the  official said, noting that foreign share is calculated by  dividing sales of foreign chips by overall demand.    Japanese chip users are stepping up buying from foreign  makers, the official said, citing the recent increase in  "design-in" contracts between foreign chip suppliers and  Japanese users.    The number of design-in deals featuring partnership from the  initial stage of development exceeded 3,000 cases in 1993, up  from 500 in 1986, the official said.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Observer: Summers' bright day? Not all Washington DC gossip focuses on the doings of the Clintons. Sometimes it stoops to such things as the World Bank. The town's movers and shakers reckon that Lewis Preston, 68, will soon step down as the bank's head; he had heart surgery last year. Jostling to replace Preston is Larry Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs and a youthful 40. Summers, a former Harvard economics professor and chief economist at the World Bank, obviously has useful experience, having advised governments in far-flung places such as Indonesia and Mexico. But has he the necessary diplomacy? His brusque manner sometimes upsets people. Moreover, is his contacts' book fat enough? Summers is not Wall Street's favoured candidate. The bankers apparently desire one of their own, when the time comes for Preston to retire. Australian-born James D Wolfensohn is thought to fit the bill. Wolfensohn is a good tennis-player; a skilled fisherman; he fenced for Australia in the 1956 Olympics; and a serious amateur cellist. More to the point, he has powerful allies in the financial world, numbering in his circle both Sir David Scholey, SG Warburg's chairman, and Paul Volcker, former US Federal Reserve chairman. In 1987 Wolfensohn hired Volcker as chairman of his eponymous boutique merchant bank. Wolfensohn even took out US citizenship in 1980. What more could be asked?</p>

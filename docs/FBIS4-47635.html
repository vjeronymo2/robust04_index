			<p>Protesting      Seoul's role in the recent escape of a group of North  Korean lumberjacks from a Siberian logging camp to South Korea,  Pyongyang is demanding the "unconditional and prompt" return of  the "kidnapped" loggers to the North, warning that the South will  "pay dearly" should it reject the North Korean demand.  In a  "telephone message" conveyed to the South through the North-South  Liaison Office at Panmunjom on 21 May, the Committee for the  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) called the  "kidnapping" of the six loggers a "shameless, inhuman, and  barbaric act" that cannot be "tolerated" (KCNA).  The message by  the CPRF, a quasi-official organization Pyongyang often uses to  register its position on inter-Korean issues, also signaled  Pyongyang's concern about possible future defections by warning  of unspecified "grave consequences" in "North-South relations as  a whole," if the South "continues kidnapping" North Korean  loggers.     Against the backdrop of increasing South Korean reporting of  sensational accounts of the "inhuman" treatment of North Korean  loggers in Siberia, some of whom had allegedly fled the camp and  were seeking asylum in South Korea, Pyongyang, in recent months,  has repeatedly accused Seoul of attempting to "kidnap" its  workers.  A Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 9 April,  for example, warned of an "immediate" and "decisive  countermeasure" should the South abduct North Korean workers  (KCNA).  Subsequently, as South Korean reporting about the  alleged plight of North Korean loggers continued, another Foreign  Ministry spokesman's statement on 11 May indirectly warned of the  adverse effect on DPRK-Russian ties should the Russian  authorities allow the South Koreans to carry out their  "kidnapping plot" (KCNA).  Reflecting the Pyongyang regime's  sensitivity to the possible domestic repercussion of the loggers'  defection, monitored Pyongyang domestic media have not reported  or commented on the issue.

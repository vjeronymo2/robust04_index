Provincial leaders,  including Mao Zhiyong, Wu Guanzheng, Lu Xiuzhen, Shu Shengyou,  Shu Huiguo, Huang Zhiquan, Zhong Qihuang, and others, attended  the conference.    Wu Guanzheng, provincial party committee deputy secretary  and  provincial governor, delivered a speech at this morning's  meeting presided over by provincial party committee Secretary  Mao Zhiyong.    In his speech, Governor Wu Guanzheng called on the party  organizations and comrades on the province's propaganda and  ideological front to focus on the following three aspects of  work:    1. To clearly understand the current situation,  further enhance a sense of mission and a sense of  responsibility, and successfully carry out propaganda and  ideological work,    2. To take account of overall interests, focus on key  work aspects, and comprehensively accomplish propaganda and  ideological work tasks,    3. To strengthen leadership, brace up, and raise  propaganda and ideological work to a new level.    Wu Guanzheng said: In order to strengthen leadership over  propaganda and ideological work, it is imperative to cultivate a  new train of thought, adopt new work methods, closely integrate  propaganda and ideological work with economic and other types of  work, and enable propaganda and ideological work to promote and  contribute to economic construction and other types of work.  Specifically speaking, we should make redoubled efforts in the  following three aspects: 1. To arm the whole party with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and unify the ideology of the broad  masses of cadres and people with the party's basic line; 2. To  constantly serve the people and socialism, strive to unite all  forces that can be united, and mobilize all positive factors to  build socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3. To step up  theory, public opinion, ideological education, cultural, and  artistic work. To this end, party committees at all levels in  Jiangxi should place propaganda and ideological work high on the  agenda, frequently analyze each and every major social and  ideological trend, provide regular guidance to propaganda and  ideological departments, and carry out regular examination and  supervision of propaganda and ideological work.    At this morning's meeting, Lu Xiuzhen, provincial party  committee deputy secretary, also delivered speech in which she  called for conscientiously implementing the spirit of the  recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work  conference, and comprehensively carrying out both the basic  principles and four basic types of work in the propaganda and  ideological domain. [passage omitted]    In the end, provincial party committee Secretary Mao Zhiyong  delivered a speech in which he said: The propaganda and  ideological front is an important front, while propaganda and  ideological work has a crucial impact on the overall work. Over  the past few years, the province's propaganda and ideological  work front has done a lot of work by adhering to economic  construction as the center, thereby pushing ahead with the two  civilizations building. The new situation has set higher  requirements on the propaganda and ideological front.  Therefore, we should attach greater importance to rather than  neglect, further strengthen rather than weaken, and further  improve rather than leave unattended propaganda and ideological  work. Now that we have propaganda and ideological work  principles to follow, the crux of the matter lies in how to  implement these principles to the letter. We should  conscientiously carry out province-wide propaganda and  ideological work by implementing the basic principles and four  basic types of work spelled out by Comrade Jiang Zemin, arm the  mind with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and focus on studying and  publicizing Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, this being a fundamental ideological work task.  We should also persistently, actively, comprehensively, and  correctly implement the party's basic line and basic central  work principles and consciously submit to and serve the overall  interests of grasping each and every excellent opportunity to  deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and  maintain stability. We should make every possible endeavor to  mobilize the broad masses of the people to support and  participate in reform, continually strengthen unity, maintain  stability, boost morale, conduct mainly positive propaganda,  correctly guide public opinion, publicize the spirit of the  central authorities, win people's hearts, strengthen confidence,  step up spiritual civilization and relevant infrastructure  building, further increase input in propaganda and cultural  undertakings, and gradually improve propaganda work conditions.    Secretary Mao Zhiyong emphatically stated: Party committees  at all levels across the province should strengthen leadership  over propaganda and ideological work by showing concern for  overall interests, carrying out in-depth investigations and  study, summing up experiences, and constantly improving and  heightening ideological work standards.    The provincial propaganda and ideological work conference is  now being attended by prefectural and city party committees  deputy secretaries and propaganda departments directors,  provincial work committees deputy secretaries, comrades in  charge of various propaganda units directly under the provincial  authorities, and comrades in charge of the relevant units.    This morning's meeting was attended by persons in charge of  the relevant provincial units, those at the on-going provincial  foreign- related propaganda work conference, those at the  on-going provincial conference of radio and television bureaus  chiefs and radio and television stations chiefs, those at the  on-going provincial conference of cultural affairs bureaus  chiefs, those at the on-going provincial news and publication  work conference, as well as those at the on-going provincial  conference of prefectural and city party committees organization  departments directors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite the negative reaction reported at the lower  chamber regarding the 10 April resolution demanding the  installation of the president of the Court of Cassation, the  president of the Senate opposition office, Bernard Sansaricq,  shows great optimism. For Senator Sansaricq, the text of this  resolution will receive the approval of the deputies. He warns  the populace against rumors of [someone's] taking the office of  Justice Jonassaint. Sen. Sansaricq specifies that the Senate he  leads is expecting a green light from the deputies.    [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] I am very optimistic, and I  believe the Chamber of Deputies will definitively shoulder its  responsibilities and pass the resolution. We have many deputies,  I repeat, who agree with this resolution; I think it will be  passed this week or, at latest, next week, and we are waiting  for its passage so that the resolution has full impact. If the  Chamber of Deputies commits the mistake, before history, of not  approving this resolution, then at that time we will think of a  solution to take, but not now. Right now, we are optimistic that  it is going to be passed by the Chamber of Deputies.    [Reporter Francois] Have you already contacted Justice  Jonassaint in that regard?    [Sansaricq] I can tell you that officially we were waiting  for the result of the vote on the resolution in the Chamber of  Deputies in order to contact Justice Jonassaint. Unofficially,  contacts with him have been made by some senators. I can tell  you that Justice Jonassaint is a patriot, a nationalist, a man  who definitely will fulfill the duty that he must fulfill toward  the nation. It is a page of history that we are writing, and I  do not think that the Chamber of Deputies is going to shy from a  constitutional duty.    The Legislative Palace is also ours. It was built by  President Dumarsais Estime for the use of both chambers. No one  can prevent us from entering our home. There are all kinds of  rumors spreading about how so-and-so will be appointed prime  minister; the installation will take place today. No! We are  doing what is right, a historic action for the nation, and we  want to come out great in the eyes of history and the Haitian  people. We ask the populace not to believe those rumors and to  remain calm. [end recording]</p>

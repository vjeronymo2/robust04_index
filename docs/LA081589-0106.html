			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> NOMINATION PERIOD FOR SOME OFFICES EXTENDED  </P> <P> The nomination period for candidates in several district elections has been  extended until Aug. 16, county Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney said  Monday.  </P> <P> The extension from the original deadline of Aug. 11 was called for elections in  the Orange Unified School District, trustee areas 4 and 7; the Santa Ana  Unified School District; Anaheim School District; Three Arch Bay Community  Service District and the Silverado-Modjeska Park and Recreation District.  </P> <P> The election is Nov. 7.  </P> <P> Beverly Warner, an election section supervisor, said the extension was granted  because a number of incumbents had not filed their nomination papers by Aug.  11. Incumbents are barred from filing during the extension period. "Some people  do not wish to run against an incumbent," Warner said.  </P> <P> The extension, therefore, is intended to give people the chance to file knowing  whether the incumbent has decided to seek reelection, she said.  </P> <P> The papers are to be filed at the registrar of voters office, 1300-C S. Grand  Ave., Santa Ana.  </P> <P> For information, call the registrar at (714) 567-7600.  </P></p>

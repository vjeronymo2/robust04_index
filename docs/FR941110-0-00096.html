			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA monitors the accuracy of a State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's findings by performing validation surveys and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviews. Accuracy means not only that the State team has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately cited all the deficiencies that existed, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also that it has not cited a deficiency when no violation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a requirement has occurred. HCFA conducts random surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurrently with the State surveys as well as independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys within 2 months of the States' surveys, and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducts indepth reviews of selected State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation. If HCFA discovers that a State is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systematically citing unfounded deficiencies, HCFA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider there to be inadequate survey performance and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply any of the sanctions provided for at &sect;488.320(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule, Sanctions for Inadequate Survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Performance, in the case of Medicare facilities. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of Medicaid facilities, HCFA cannot reduce FFP as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified at &sect;488.170(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have concluded that section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not accommodate such action under this scenario. The two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of the FFP reduction formula at section 1919(g)(3)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act are: the total number of residents in nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities surveyed by HCFA during a quarter; and, the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of residents in nursing facilities found pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA surveys to be noncompliant. The number of residents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing facilities which HCFA found to be compliant but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the State determined were noncompliant does not figure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the calculation; therefore, no FFP reduction can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken when the form of the State survey inadequacy is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citation of unfounded deficiencies, or indeed when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadequacy is anything other than the State's failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify deficiencies. However, the Act does allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to impose another sanction for the citation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfounded deficiencies in Medicaid facilities. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(g)(3) of the Act states that the Secretary may also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond to inadequate State survey performance in Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities by providing for the training of the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey teams. We are amending &sect;488.320 of the regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to indicate this and to clarify that the citation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unfounded deficiencies will be considered inadequate survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. An additional safeguard against the citation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unfounded deficiencies will be afforded to facilities by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their opportunity to engage in informal dispute resolution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as described in &sect;488.331.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters said that &sect;488.318 precluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities from informally challenging or expressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagreement with survey findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All States currently offer some opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for providers to refute survey findings. In one State, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is required by State law. It is State policy in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rest. Although these policies vary among States, they all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to State surveys of Medicare and Medicaid providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, HCFA's State Operations Manual requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States allow facilities to interact with the survey team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the survey, to discuss findings at an exit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conference, to raise unresolved issues to the State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency or the HCFA regional office, or both, and to record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their disagreement on the HCFA&hyph;2567. If none of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courses of action satisfy the provider, there are appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, whenever possible, we want to provide every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to settle disagreements at the earliest stage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before much time and money are spent by the provider, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency, and HCFA. Therefore, we are requiring, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.331, that States offer an opportunity for informal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispute resolution beginning with the provider's receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the official statement of deficiencies. Although inadequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey performance will not invalidate adequately documented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, neither the State's inadequate performance nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a resulting HCFA sanction imposed on the State will prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility from formally or informally challenging or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressing disagreement with survey findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One State was concerned that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagreement between the Federal and State agencies will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equate to inadequate survey performance on the part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

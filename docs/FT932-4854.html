			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / A judgment call for the Fed At some stage in every economic recovery, a responsible central bank has to start pushing up interest rates. Friday's unexpectedly strong employment report will have helped convince many economists that the US is now at this critical juncture. The significance of the jobs figures should not be underrated. Government statisticians have pulled the rug from under forecasters by rewriting economic history. The new figures show that non-farm payroll employment grew by more than 200,000 in both April and May, the largest consecutive monthly increases for three years. Figures for the year to March were revised up to show an average monthly gain of about 80,000 jobs, nearly double the previous estimate. Far fewer jobs were lost in the recession than previously thought. After two years of expansion, employment is standing at a record high of 109.99m, having finally surpassed the pre-recession peak reached in June 1990. Robust job growth and high levels of factory overtime strongly suggest economic growth is accelerating after the depressed first quarter, when output grew at an annual rate of only 0.9 per cent. Indeed, extrapolating from the number of hours worked in April and May, the economy could be growing at an annual rate of nearer 4 per cent than the 2 per cent projected by many forecasters. Speculation that the Fed wanted to raise rates began in earnest last month after the release of April inflation figures, the third bad set since January. These showed producer and consumer prices rising at an annualised rate for the year to date of 3.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively, a big increase from last year. A few days later press leaks indicated that the Federal Open Market Committee voted at its May 18 meeting to shift from a neutral posture on interest rates to a bias towards increasing them. At the same time, official minutes of the previous FOMC meeting revealed that two Fed governors - Mr Wayne Angell and Mr Lawrence Lindsey - were pushing for an increase in rates as long ago as March. In the light of the employment report, an early increase in rates may now appear unavoidable. Hawks argue that the Fed must move swiftly to nip inflation expectations before they get out of control. A small increase in rates now - maybe only a quarter or half point, would demonstrate that the Fed was serious about preventing higher inflation and perhaps head off the need for bigger and more disruptive increases next year. By reducing inflation expectations, an increase in short rates could actually bring down long-term rates, thus improving the outlook for growth. These arguments are powerful: if the Fed were the Bundesbank, it would already have acted. Yet Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, may still be hesitating. The reported shift to a bias towards higher rates is less significant than it sounds. The Fed has previously issued such directives without raising rates. Indeed, some Fed-watchers argue that, had the FOMC intended to move in the near future, it would not have leaked the news of a shift in its stance. On this view, the bias towards tightening was a sop to the hawks and a substitute for action: a way of letting markets know that the Fed was serious about controlling inflation without pushing up rates prematurely. After the disappointment of the first quarter, the argument runs, it would be foolish to rule out further economic setbacks. The economic data are not all encouraging. Factory orders have fallen for two months running. The index of leading indicators has stagnated. Consumer and business confidence remains fragile, partly because of uncertainty about Clinton's economic plan. Even the employment gains are not all they could be: the increases are skewed towards temporary and part-time positions in service industries and construction. Manufacturing is still shedding labour. At 6.9 per cent the jobless rate is still well above the levels historically associated with rising inflation. And while most forecasters agree that last year marked the low point for inflation in this business cycle, many believe price figures in the first four months were biased upwards. It is hard to believe that the underlying inflation rate could have risen from 3 per cent to 4 per cent or more so quickly, especially when the recovery was sluggish. Several distortions, such as erratic increases in food, tobacco and airline fare prices, appear about to unwind. If the Fed tightens now, it will be accused in Washington of wanting to push unemployment back above 7 per cent. Mr Greenspan would much rather justify a rate increase on the grounds that he has to rein back an unsustainably rapid economic expansion. If May producer and consumer price figures, due this week and next, are bad, the Fed will have no room for manoeuvre: it will have to push up rates in order to retain credibility as an inflation fighter. Bad probably means an increase in the consumer price index of 0.3-0.4 per cent. But if, as many forecasters (including some Fed economists) predict, inflation figures this summer are quite subdued, the Fed's decision will be far more difficult. Given his reputation for gradualism, there is a good chance that Mr Greenspan will choose not to act until the autumn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A second Council of Ministers meeting has been  concluded. At the top of the agenda was the government's  program and the appointment of the undersecretaries of state.  Mario De Scalzi reports from Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime  minister].    [Begin De Scalzi recording] The Council of Ministers has  appointed 37 undersecretaries: 13 of them come from Forza  Italia, 12 from the National Alliance, 10 from the Northern  League, and two from the Christian Democrat Center [CCD].  However, the CCD has managed to obtain a very high profile  appointment that is on a par with a ministry, in other words,  civil protection which will now be headed by Ombretta Fumagalli  Carulli.    The Council of Ministers also discussed the government's  program that will be announced on Monday [16 May] by Silvio  Berlusconi to the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies in order to  obtain the support of the parliament.    So far, there have been few leaks about the contents of the  program. What is known, is that the program document is at  least 50 pages long. The main topics will be employment, fiscal  policy, and privatization. The latter will, however, have to be  carried out within the framework of the regulations approved by  the old government that are valid until 30 May. [end recording]</p>

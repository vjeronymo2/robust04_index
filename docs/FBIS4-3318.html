			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed the conviction here  today that with joint efforts, the friendly ties of cooperation  between China and Cote d'Ivoire, based on equality and mutual  benefit, will enter into a new phase of development.    Qian, holding talks with Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister  Amara  Essy here this morning, described the bilateral ties in the  political, economic and trade, cultural and other fields as  "developing smoothly".    "This is embodied in the high-level exchanges between the  two  countries in the past two years and we are satisfied with it,"  Qian said.    Cote d'Ivoire is a major country in West Africa and "we  cherish our friendship with it," Qian said, adding that China  speaks highly of Cote d'Ivoire's wishes to develop ties with  China.    The Chinese Government appreciates the peace, neutrality and  non-alignment policy pursued by the Cote d'Ivoire Government, as  well as its tenacious efforts to maintain unity and peace in  Africa and its efforts for the setting up of a new world order.    Qian noted that China and Cote d'Ivoire share common views  on  many important international issues, and support and cooperate  with each other in world affairs. This is beneficial to both  countries under the current complicated and volatile  international situation.    He reiterated that it constitutes a major part of China's  foreign policy to develop its unity and cooperation with african  countries.    Qian said after the de-colonialization, Africa faces a major  task of developing its economy. And only after raising people's  living standards and satisfying their rights to survival and  development could it have the means to pursue other things.    Without sustained economic growth, it will be very difficult  for the continent to develop democracy, Qian said.    Qian voiced China's support for the efforts to strengthen  unity and economic integration in africa.    He also voiced its concern over the recent conflicts in some  parts of the continent. Peace is the first important thing to  these areas, Qian said.    Essy said his country attaches importance to its ties with  China and follows China's development with interest.    He congratulated his host on the constant lifting of China's  status on the international stage, and expressed appreciation of  China upholding justice in world affairs and safeguarding the  rights and interests of developing countries.    The Cote d'Ivoire Government is grateful to China for its  sincere aid and help, Essy said. He also reiterated the "one  China" stance of his country.    Essy and his party arrived here on Sunday [17 April] to  begin  a week-long goodwill visit to China as Qian's guests.</p>

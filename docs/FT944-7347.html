			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Turks call for straits radar bids - Contracts Turkey's TDI maritime agency has invited nine international companies to bid for a radar and communications system to control shipping in the Dardanelles, Sea of Marmara and Bosporus straits. Bids are to be submitted in January 1995. The companies include Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, Raytheon of the US, Mitsui from Japan and the UK's Marconi. Suppliers must provide their own financing for the system, which is expected to take three to four years to install at an estimated cost of Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m. The companies will also be asked to bid for a smaller initial phase of the project, limited to the Bosporus alone. Traffic in the straits, linking the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, has increased sharply since the collapse of the Soviet Union as newly independent states in the region increase trade with the rest of the world.</p>

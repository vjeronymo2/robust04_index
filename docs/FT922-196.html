			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Councils close to a deal with white-collar workers LOCAL authorities moved close to a pay deal with 750,000 white-collar workers yesterday as union leaders advised that rises of between 4 per cent and 4.4 per cent were the best that could be achieved through negotiation. The proposed deal will set the tone for talks covering 1m blue-collar workers. It would raise the pay bill by 4.1 per cent, although an earlier settlement covering residential social workers will add another 0.2 per cent. The offer is weighted to favour the lowest-paid, who would gain rises of 4.4 per cent. Those at the top end of the scale would receive 4 per cent. Although it would be the lowest settlement for white-collar workers in recent years - and below the inflation rate of 4.3 per cent - it comes at a time when workers generally are reluctant to take industrial action. Negotiators for Nalgo, the largest union among council white-collar workers, traditionally recommend strike action, but only once in the past seven years has their advice been heeded. Union leaders want to concentrate on winning a 'yes' vote for a merger with the Nupe and Cohse unions. The amalgamation ballot is scheduled to take place at the end of this year. Nalgo negotiators believe industrial action would achieve little. Mr Dennis Reed, Nalgo's local government officer, said the offer did not meet the union's objectives but members were presented with the stark choice of an unsatisfactory offer or strike action. The proposed deal will be be presented to the union's local government group on July 22.</p>

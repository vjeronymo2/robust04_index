			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD  </P> <P> I was pleased to note that The Times has taken a strong stand with regard to  the long overdue expansion of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> A county as large and diverse as Los Angeles requires its supervisors to be  responsive to and representative of its constituency. This is the reason I  introduced ACA 12, which has already passed two committees and is on the  Assembly floor. This legislation would prohibit any supervisor from  representing more than 1 million people.  </P> <P> I agree with The Times that the number of supervisorial districts must be  expanded. The easiest way to do so would be to put this issue on the ballot  where passage would require only a simple majority vote of the people in the  county. For this measure to be placed on a statewide ballot, ACA 12 would have  to pass both houses of our state Legislature by a two-thirds vote. This is very  difficult to achieve, particularly because this legislation really only affects  Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> If the choice is left to the people, I think equity and justice will be served.  </P> <P> TOM BANE  </P> <P> Assemblyman, 40th District  </P> <P> D-Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met and had a cordial and  friendly talk with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen  Norodom Monineath Sihanouk here this evening.    Li congratulated Sihanouk on his recovery.    On behalf of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng  and Chairman Qiao Shi of the National People's Congress Standing  Committee, Li extended cordial greetings and best wishes to  Sihanouk.    He described Sihanouk as an outstanding leader of the  Cambodian people, saying that over the past decades, Sihanouk  has made unremitting efforts for its state independence and  national liberation.    Especially in the process of seeking political settlement of  the Cambodian issue, he said Sihanouk has played important roles  and made precious contributions to the country's national  reconciliation.    Li said since last year, historic changes have taken place  in  Cambodia. Peace has been brought to the Cambodian people who  had experienced war sufferings for more than 20 years, and the  reconstruction work has begun in the country.    "Though there still are some difficulties, we believe that  under the leadership of Sihanouk and with the support of the  international community and the Cambodian people who are  diligent, brave and longing for peace, Cambodia can grow into a  country of independence, peace, neutrality, non-alignment and  strength. The future of Cambodia is bright," he said.    Li said: "We appreciate the king's important contributions  to  the growth of the Sino-Cambodian friendship, and the 'one-China'  policy and the friendly policy toward China that the king and  the Cambodian government have pursued.    "We hope for further strengthening of the Sino-Cambodian  friendship on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-  existence and for developing bilateral friendly ties and  cooperation in every field," he said.    Sihanouk said he thanked the Chinese Government and leaders  as well as doctors and nurses here for taking good care of him  while he was ill.    During the meeting he spoke highly of the Cambodia-China  friendship which he said can be traced back to ancient times.    He expressed the belief that under the new historical  conditions, the friendly ties and cooperation between the two  countries will be further boosted through common efforts.    Tang Jiaxuan, vice-minister of foreign affairs, attended the  meeting.    After the meeting, Li gave a dinner in honor of the couple.</p>

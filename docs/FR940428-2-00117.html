The licensee identified this misadministration during a review of the past treatment records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A patient was scheduled to receive brachytherapy treatment to the apex of her vagina in three fractions using a Nucletron Micro Selectron HDR remote afterloader. The prescribed dose was 500 centigray (cGy) (500 rad) for each fraction and the use of a ring applicator was specified. On April 13, 1993, the patient was administered the first fractional treatment. After an examination of the patient following the first treatment, the physician revised the written directive and prescribed a change from the ring applicator to a standard vaginal cylindrical applicator for the remaining two treatments. On April 23, 1993, during the administration of the second treatment, the therapist erroneously entered the catheter length of 920 millimeter (mm) (36.2 inch) into the treatment computer instead of the intended 992 mm (39.1 inch). The physician failed to identify this error during his review of the treatment parameters prior to the initiation of the treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this erroneous entry, a majority of the treatment dose was administered to an unintended region near the opening of the vagina, and the intended site received an underdose differing from the prescribed dose by more than 20 percent. The physician stated that no adverse clinical effects are expected as a result of the underdose to the target site because this treatment was intended to administer a booster radiation dose. The oncologist also stated that the patient is not expected to experience any adverse effects as a result of the 500 cGy (500 rad) overexposure to the wrong treatment site misadministration. The NRC medical consultant, in his report to Region I, also stated a similar opinion (that it is unlikely the patient will suffer any adverse effects from the misadministration). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third fraction of the treatment was administered to the patient on April 29, 1993, as prescribed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The referring physician and the patient have been notified. The licensee submitted a written report of the misadministration to NRC Region I on October 29, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cause or Causes_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The therapist did not enter the correct catheter length during initial setup for the second treatment. The licensee followed established procedures; however, the procedure did not require verification of all parameters at the time of the second check prior to each treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Actions Taken to Prevent Occurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Licensee_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The licensee has instituted a requirement that a medical physicist also review the final treatment plan prior to initiating the treatment. The treatment parameters for all brachytherapy (HDR) treatments will be transferred electronically to the magnetic card directly from the simulator. The output of this card will be reviewed by the medical physicist and the oncologist before the initiation of the treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Region I conducted a special inspection at Mercy Hospital on October 19, 1993. Inspection Report No. 030&hyph;02983/93&hyph;001, issued November 5, 1993, identified two apparent violations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Failure to require supervised individual to follow written quality management procedures (QMP) 10 CFR 35.25(a)(2); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Failure to include policies and procedures in the QMP to meet the objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive 10 CFR 35.32(a) After receipt and review of the medical consultant's report, Region I issued a Notice of Violation to the licensee on February 9, 1994, classifying the two violations at Severity Level IV in accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An NRC medical consultant has been retained to review this misadministration. The medical consultant's report was received by Region I on February 3, 1994. (The medical consultant's report is filed in Docket No. 030&hyph;02983 in the Region I Materials License Docket Room. Inspection Report No. 030&hyph;02983/93&hyph;001 issued November 5, 1993, and the February 9, 1994, Notice of Violation are in the PDR.) The medical consultant questioned the licensee concerning its identification of a radiation oncologist as the referring physician. After discussion with the NRC's medical consultant, the licensee identified the patient's physician as the primary referring physician and then agreed to notify the physician. Following a review of the medical consultant's report, Region I confirmed in a telephone conversation that the licensee had contacted the patient's physician regarding the misadministration. The licensee stated that both referring physicians have been notified of this misadministration. The radiation oncologist had discussed the misadministration with the patient on October 21, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 93&hyph;13&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, New Jersey <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic dose that results in any part of the body receiving unscheduled radiation can be considered an abnormal occurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

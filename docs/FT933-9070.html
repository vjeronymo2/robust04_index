			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / VW to cut list prices of cars VOLKSWAGEN, struggling to reverse a weakening sales performance in the UK, is cutting list prices of its cars by an average of 4.1 per cent from September 1, John Griffiths writes. But with the exception of diesel models, where prices are set to tumble by up to 11 per cent, the amount paid by customers is likely to be unchanged because the reductions are being achieved mainly by a cut in dealers' profit margins from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, reducing their scope for discounting. Volkswagen, which is among the last of the key players in the UK car market to cut dealer margins to 10 per cent, said it believed its rivals were about to launch an autumn round of price increases. VW is unlikely to impose a a rise before the end of this year.</p>

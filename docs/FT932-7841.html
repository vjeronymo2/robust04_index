			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: The Nederlands Dans Theatre 2 - Ballet Nederlands Dans Theater has a second, smaller, younger ensemble, NDT2, made up of dancers who are being groomed to join the main troupe. (NDT3, you may recall, also exists - a ghetto of performers who are identified as being old but still able to function on stage. The mind shrinks from the idea of what might be found in an NDT4.) NDT2 is at Sadler's Wells with a repertory all too familiar in its concerns. 'Never mind the steps; think of the message' is the motto for the NDT companies, but moral worth and, I suspect, political correctness, are fatal ingredients for choreography. I saw the second of two programmes on offer this week, and though it proposed the work of four choreographers, there was little differentiation between the pieces. Hans van Manen's Shorthand found three men and three women in figure-hugging shiny black plastic leotards - they looked like animated caviar - who struggled, posed, made duets (one, of course, for a couple of chaps) and behaved in rather stolid, and possibly Dutch, fashion. These activities sat rather oddly with Stravinsky's Gesualdo score, but I do not find that musical aptness is the banner under which NDT often sails. Two other works - Ohad Naharin's Passomezzo and Jiri Kylian's Stoolgame - I have reported on before. The first is an awkward courtship ritual between a hideously dressed couple - she tries to get her man with a display of sagging limbs and very determined winter underwear; he has forgotten to put on his trousers - while Tudor songs are sung. It lasts, thank Heaven, only ten minutes. The second is grimly determined about an individual fighting with a group and turning into a martyr, while a tiresome sound-track by Arne Nordheim is played. (The music is probably ideal for NDT because it was assembled as a result of Nordheim's having seen Soviet troops preparing to crush the Prague Spring uprising.) The angst hangs heavy on the vine. The closing piece of the programme is Paul Lightfoot's Step Lightly, in which four girls and two men fling themselves about on the ground - like Old Man River, they just keep rolling along - and suggest that they are enjoying really juicy nervous break-downs. It is accompanied by Bulgarian folk songs performed with steel-cutting timbre by a women's chorus. (My own belief is that peasantry are better employed doing something useful in the fields.) Much of this nonsense would be inadmissible were it not that the NDT2 dancers are very impressive. The men are uniformly excellent, moving with big, flashing dynamics, taut and clear in energy. Among them Urtzi Aranburu and Miguel Rodriguez are exceptionally fine. The women are pleasing - if generally less challenged by the choreography - and in Step Lightly I was very taken by the airiness and delicacy of Catherine Riesi's dancing. They all deserve better things. NDT 2 is at Sadler's Wells until May 22</p>

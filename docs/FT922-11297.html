			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / California rocked by earthquake A POWERFUL earthquake rocked the northern California coast on Saturday, destroying several buildings and injuring at least 50 people in small logging towns close to the Oregon border, including Petrolia (above), writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. The earthquake struck at 11am (Pacific standard time) and measured 6.9 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was about 250 miles north of San Francisco. It was the second strong earthquake in California last week. The first, on Wednesday, hit southern California near Palm Springs and measured 6.1 on the Richter scale. Seismologists said the two events were not related but served as a reminder that the state of California was riddled with fault lines. Ferndale, a small town with 1,600 residents, took the brunt of Saturday's quake. About 40 businesses and 20 homes were seriously damaged. Preliminary estimates put the cost of damage at about Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 1.97m).</p>

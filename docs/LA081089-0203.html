			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 200 CONGRESSMEN PETITION BAKER TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO BAT TAKEOVER  </P> <P> More than 200 members of Congress have signed a letter urging Secretary of  State James A. Baker III to express U.S. concerns about the hostile takeover  bid for BAT Industries PLC and its American subsidiary to the British  government.  </P> <P> London-based BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, also has significant  interests in financial services, paper and retailing -- including such U.S.  holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field department stores and  Farmers Insurance Group.  </P> <P> "Thousands of communities across America will be hurt by this hostile bid,"  according to the letter to Baker.  </P> <P> The letter, disclosed today by Kentucky's two senators, Mitch McConnell and  Wendell H. Ford, said the congressmen were "deeply concerned" about the bid  that they said would eventually "dismantle a company that is important to  hundreds of U.S. communities."  </P> <P> Last month, Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, British merchant banker  Jacob Rothschild and Australian investor Kerry Packer and other investors made  an offer for BAT valued at about $21.6 billion.  </P> <P> Among those participating in the cashless offer by Hoylake Investments Ltd,  which would be Europe's largest to date, is former U.S. Treasury Secretary  William E. Simon.  </P> <P> Simon reportedly may be interested in buying BAT's Farmer's Group Inc.  insurance division.  </P></p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Appointments: GE Capital's first mate Having sailed as a first mate with the Clan Line, looked after the computers at Fylingdales' early warning station, and sold furniture for Times Furnishing, 55-year-old David Stonehouse is switching jobs one more time. During a 15-year career at Great Universal Stores, one of Britain's biggest retailers, Stonehouse has become one of the leading figures in the specialist field of business information providers. One of the keys to success in retailing is the maintenance of a low level of bad debts and as chief executive of GUS's CCN group, Stonehouse was responsible for the growth of Britain's biggest credit reference bureau, the main competitor to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and the largest provider of credit scoring. He also pioneered CCN's overseas expansion. In the past two years GE Capital Retailer Financial Services - the world's biggest operator of in-store credit cards and one of Stonehouse's customers  -has established itself as the main player in the UK store cards market. It owns and operates credit cards for House of Fraser, Burton Group, Laura Ashley, Halfords, Dixons, and others. As chief executive of GE Capital's Retailer Financial Services business in Europe, one of Stonehouse's jobs will be to help his new employer break into the continental European market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey--Dangerous Adventurism"] </F>   [Excerpts] Following the killing and wounding of our  innocent compatriots when Turkish fighter planes dropped rockets  on villages on the Iranian border, some observations may be made  about bilateral relations and Turkey's regional situation:  [passage omitted]    The simultaneous presence of the head of the Zionist regime  in Ankara and the savage attack by the Turkish planes on  northern Iraq and our border regions indicate a dangerous game  initiated by the Turks, especially as the reports and news  available state that Zionist intelligence and military officials  are increasingly present in or visiting northern Iraq and  sending out the necessary information to Turkish militarists.  [passage omitted]    Turkey's overt declaration that Ankara and Tel Aviv are  cooperating on combating hizbollah indicates that gradual moves  by the Muslim combatants are taking shape in Turkey and in all  Muslim countries. [passage omitted]    Iran has displayed great restraint over Turkey's  irresponsible and provocative actions, which include its  cooperation with the various counter-revolutionary Iranian  groups. This restraint and tolerance has limits and Ciller's  government should ponder the dangerous consequences of these  adventurist actions. It is the Iranian people and Government's  rightful expectation that these aggressive actions are halted  and that the Turkish Government tenders an apology and a  guarantee that such incidents will not recur.</p>

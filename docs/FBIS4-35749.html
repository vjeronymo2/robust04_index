			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Victory of a Sort"] </F>   [Text] By-election results usually convey only a limited  message. Nevertheless, going by the number of seats it has won  in the by-elections, the Congress can afford to be in a  triumphant mood although the defeat it has suffered in certain  constituencies points to the long way it has still to go to make  its position sound and strong. The party can certainly pat  itself on the back for bagging five of the seven Lok Sabha seats  and five of the 10 Assembly seats. Its triumph in the Ahmednagar  and Baramati constituencies in Maharashtra signifies Chief  Minister Sharad Pawar's political clout in the State whereas in  Madhya Pradesh, where it has bagged both the Rajgarh Lok Sabha  seat and the Chachoda Assembly seat, the architect of victory is  in a large measure Chief Minister Digvijay Singh himself. In  Punjab, Chief Minister Beant Singh's hands have been  strengthened by the party's creditable performance in Nakodar.  The Bharatiya Janata Party can draw some comfort from its  victory in the Meerut Lok Sabha constituency in UP [Uttar  Pradesh] and in the Rajakhera Assembly constituency in  Rajasthan. But it has reason to feel disturbed over its dismal  performance in Madhya Pradesh and its loss of the Hamirpur  Assembly seat in Himachal Pradesh to the Congress. The  limitations of Hindutva card should dawn on the party.    Though the Left parties have not been put to a severe test,  the Revolutionary Socialist Party has fared well by winning the  Barampore Lok Sabha seat in West Bengal. Similarly, the Left  Front in Kerala can celebrate the triumph of the Independent  candidate backed by it in the Guruvayoor Assembly constituency.  But it was mainly Muslim politics rather than party politics  that decided the outcome of the by-election. What a pity that  in a state like Kerala both the Congress and the Left parties  unabashedly depend upon the communal forces for their survival  and votes! From Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh where the Congress  has defeated its Telugu Desam rival with a reduced margin, the  message is clear: Unless the Congress sets its house in order,  it will face a serious challenge from Mr N. T. Rama Rao's party.    The Congress has only itself to blame for finding itself in  a  hopeless situation in Tamil Nadu. It remains to be seen whether  the party can regain in the near future even partly the ground  it has lost. In the Perundurai Assembly constituency where the  AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] has registered  a spectacular victory, the Congress came only fourth. The same  is the story in the Mylapore Assembly constituency. The  Congress is thus highly vulnerable in the southern States which  were once its fortress. In Tamil Nadu, the party has paid a  heavy price for its dilemma whether it should align with the DMK  [Dravida Munnetra Kzhagam] or the AIADMK or stand on its own.  The sooner it adopts a united stand and spells out a definite  strategy, the better it is for the party. In Kerala, where  Chief Minister K. Karunakaran is becoming more and more a  liability to the Congress, a change in leadership may be worth  considering.</p>

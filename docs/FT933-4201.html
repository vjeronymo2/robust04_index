			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (21): Cheaper won helps exports  -South Korea SOUTH KOREA'S car industry is once again enjoying an export boom after several years of lagging sales abroad. The rapid improvement is largely a due to increased price competitiveness resulting from a cheaper Korean won, which has fallen by almost 20 per cent against the Japanese yen since the beginning of the year. Car exports during the first eight months of 1993 rose by 37 per cent to 358,000 vehicles and would have been still higher if a series of strikes between May and July had not disrupted production at Hyundai Motor, the country's largest carmaker and biggest motor exporter. There is growing optimism that exports may reach 560,000 vehicles this year, close to the previous export peak of 576,000 units in 1988. Exports have slumped during the past four years as the appreciation of the won and higher labour costs has pushed the price of Korean cars higher. Complaints about product quality in the late 1980s contributed to a big fall in sales in the US, the main export market. The drop in exports underscored the Korean carmakers' overwhelming dependency on the North American market - which accounted for 80 per cent of foreign sales in 1988 - and convinced them to diversify their markets abroad. North America remains the single largest overseas market, but its share of total foreign sales has fallen to 28 per cent this year. The Asia Pacific region has recently emerged as the second largest market, with a 26 per cent share, with China buying large numbers of Korean cars. But China's recently imposed ban on car imports to slow consumer spending has provoked worries that sales there may fall sharply. The biggest disappointment has been Europe. Hyundai in particular has concentrated on expansion in Europe during the past few years and the region overtook the US last year as the company's biggest export market. The recession caused Korean car sales in Europe to fall by 9.4 per cent this year, and reduced the region's share of exports to 23 per cent, against a 14.3 per cent increase for North America and a 98.9 per cent jump in Asia. The general improvement in exports is encouraging news for Kia Motor and Daewoo Motor, Korea's second- and third-largest carmakers respectively, as they try to challenge Hyundai's dominance in foreign markets. Hyundai normally accounts for two-thirds of Korean car exports. Until recently, both Kia and Daewoo have largely relied on supplying cars to other companies on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis for most of their exports. Kia produces the Fiesta for Ford, while Daewoo manufactures the LeMans for General Motors (GM). But the two are now venturing into foreign markets on their own. Kia is establishing an independent sales network in the US and recruiting local dealers in Europe. Daewoo, which ended its joint venture with GM last year in order to free itself from restrictions on overseas marketing activity, is initially concentrating on sales in the developing world. It plans to expand into the US and Europe once the GM-imposed marketing restrictions lapse next year. The two companies are also setting up factories, mainly in Asia and the Middle East, to assemble cars supplied in knock-down kit form. The sharp rise in exports comes at an opportune moment for the Korean car industry, which is confronting tougher market conditions at home. Domestic sales, which account for almost 75 per cent of total Korean motor sales, grew by 10.5 per cent during the first seven months of 1993 - much slower than the average annual rate of 40 per cent registered over the past six years. As the economy stumbles, consumer confidence has weakened. Carmakers are spending more on marketing and sales efforts to reverse the downward trend, while offering consumers generous financing terms that are placing further pressure on profit margins. The strikes affecting Hyundai, however, have benefited Kia and Daewoo, with both reporting higher sales during the first half of the year. Kia posted a 48 per cent rise in net profits to Won5.2bn (Pounds 4.3m) while Hyundai's net profits tumbled by 41 per cent to Won15.4bn. While the Big Three car producers are engaged in fierce competition in the compact and medium-size car segments, other companies associated with them have been successful in developing specialised niches, particularly in mini-cars and four wheel drive jeeps. These are the fastest-growing areas of the Korean motor market. Daewoo Shipbuilding began producing mini-cars in 1991. Its success is encouraging Hyundai Precision to enter the market at the end of year, using technology supplied by Mitsubishi of Japan. Kia is also considering producing mini-cars. Hyundai Precision, which also manufactures containers and tanks, began production of jeeps in 1991. Its Galloper jeep has cut into the sales of Ssangyong Motor, which is Korea's biggest jeep producer. Ssangyong, which suffered losses of Won8.8bn last year because of the challenge posed by Hyundai Precision, has responded by diversifying into passenger cars. Earlier this year, it signed an agreement with Mercedes-Benz to begin production of a new range of medium and luxury cars in 1996. The luxury car segment is rapidly becoming an area of competition among Korean carmakers. Hyundai and Kia already produce luxury car models and Daewoo is expected to join the field by the end of the year with a domestic version of Honda's Legend. The passenger vehicle market is in danger of becoming even more crowded with Samsung indicating that it wants to manufacture cars within the next few years. Although some analysts question whether Korea can support nine manufacturers of cars and commercial vehicles, the expansion is being encouraged by the government. Under its X-5 programme, the government is planning to make Korea one of the world's five biggest vehicle manufacturers by 2000. Korea is already the seventh-largest in terms of production, with 1.73m vehicles manufactured last year. The government estimates that it will cost Dollars 36bn to implement the X-5 programme, with 60 per cent of this devoted to factory expansion and the remainder consisting of research spending in such areas as electric cars. The programme is largely funded by soft state loans. 'It's nuts,' said one Seoul-based western industry consultant. 'The danger is that Korea is heading toward excessive production capacity. 'It may soon find its Asian market weakening as China builds it own cars. Sales at home could also stagnate because the nation's roads are becoming clogged with traffic and it may not be able to handle much more.'</p>

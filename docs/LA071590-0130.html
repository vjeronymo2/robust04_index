			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARY COLEMAN  </P> <P> I can empathize with Gary Coleman in his legal dispute with his parents. A  mental competency hearing is always a demeaning intrusion into one's private  life; it is even more agonizing when it is played out in the media.  </P> <P> It is particularly heinous when it is proved that the charge was warrantlessly  and maliciously brought before the court.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, it happens often. It is too easy for a relative who claims he or  she is simply acting out of concern -- when the truth is the person is acting  out of greed, jealousy or hatred -- to humiliate an individual by publicly  questioning his mental competency. Thankfully, most of the judges who preside  over competency hearings are not easily swayed by the numerous experts and  "reputable" witnesses the accuser presents to add credence to his or her  spurious case.  </P> <P> ADRIENNE AVERETTA  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

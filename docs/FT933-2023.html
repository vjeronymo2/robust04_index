			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Control Techniques contract THE ASSAULT by Control Techniques on the highly competitive market for the computer controls used on machine tools has received a boost through an important contract from Cincinnati Milacron. The Wales-based controls and drives concern is to supply a complete control package for a new low-cost machining centre launched last week by Milacron at the EMO machine tool show in Hanover. The package includes CT's FNC Flexible Numerical Controller, launched last year in an attempt to give the UK a presence in the computer numerical control (CNC) market - which is dominated by GE Fanuc and Siemens. Control Techniques has supplied the FNC to specialist machine tool builders in the UK, and to overseas suppliers such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Company. But Milacron is the first 'household name' in machine tool terms, to use FNC as the standard control package on its machines. Mr Philip Sewell, managing director of CT's automation side, said the company was in talks with other big machine tool builders. Milacron's new Arrow machine is aimed at the high-volume, low-cost end of the vertical machining centre market.</p>

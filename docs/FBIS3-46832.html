			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Isamu Yamashita, president of </F> Japan-Russia Economic Committee (adviser to Mitsui Shipbuilding,  top adviser to JR East Japan); Jiro Kawake, vice president of  Japan-Russia Economic Committee (chairman of Oji Paper); Jiro  Rokugawa, president of Tokyo Maruichi Trading; Jiro Aiko,  managing director of Sony Corp.; Kazuo Nukazawa, director of  Keidanren, moderator; place and date not given]    [Text] I. How To View the Current Russian Economy    [Nukazawa] The Keidanren's Japan-Russia Economic Committee  and the Russia-Japan Economic Committee, which centers on the  Russian Industrialists and Enterpreneurs Federation, held their  first joint conference in Moscow for four days beginning 2 June  1993, and discussed a variety of problems based on the present  new situation. The Japan committee also made efforts to grasp  the realities of Russia's economy and civilian life through  visits to plants and a tour of the city of St. Petersburg. These  activities were very helpful in increasing mutual understanding  between the two nations, and progress was made concerning a  number of problems.    Opinions about Russia's present economic conditions were  sharply divided between those who perceive an underlying  strength and those who see utter confusion. What are your  opinions?    [Yamashita] Russia's economy is said to be gigantic and  similar to an elephant. It is not a healthy elephant, but an  ailing elephant. We are small and have absolutely no idea why it  is flailing its trunk, or in which direction it is walking.  Although we attempt to view the present condition of the  elephant itself, it is extremely difficult to get an overall  view.    At present, the Yeltsin administration seems likely to  endure  for a while longer. Judging from the national referendum held in  April, we can perhaps conclude that he still holds the reins of  power. Conversely, we cannot debate anything unless we establish  such a premise.  <H5>  The Russian People Are Beginning To Enjoy Freedom </H5>   [Kawake] I believe it is realistic to say that present-day  Russia is difficult to understand. However, I received the  impression that, still, Russia is moving in a forward direction  in its own way. The strongest indication is the bright look on  the faces of the people we saw in walking through the streets  and in the department stores. The young girls wear miniskirts  and look stylish, which seems somehow to be a change.    I believe that they have begun to enjoy "freedom." Despite  the high prices of goods, with the money they earn, they can buy  anything without forming queues. This is natural for us, but it  is a great change for them. Their previous custom of buying food  and clothing at the state stores was similar to our distribution  of rationed goods during the war. Today, however, buying goods  at the GUM stores means shopping at one's option despite the  high prices.    I do not think that the "freedom" experienced by the people  can be easily taken away.    [Rokugawa] I also felt a brightness in their future. We  stayed in Moscow for a week before the conference, and later for  about a week in Vladivostok. It was the season of new greenness,  and the looks on the faces of the people walking by were  etremely cheerful. We met many corporate leaders who were really  gungho. They were full of ideas and eager to test them, saying  that they would like to trade and cooperate with us in joint  ventures.    After returning to Japan, I talked with Director Hisao  Kanamori of the Russia-East Europe Economic Research Institute.  He said that Russia's economy has declined compared to the same  period a year earlier, but it has improved when the  January-April period of this year is compared with the same  period last year, for example, and it made me feel optimistic.  Japan-Russia trade also has shown some definite signs of  monetary improvement during January-April.  <H5>  Russia's Present "Dual Economy" </H5>   [Aiko] From a macro viewpoint, after World War II, India,  the  USSR, and China--socialist nations that were under planned  economic management, that is, three regions with the world's  largest populations--were shut inside the socialist freezer. The  "energy" was released with the collapse of the system, and the  planned economy shifted to a market economy. As to which of the  three will get on track first, it is China. Next is India, and I  believe that today's Russia will require some time. I believe  that, in the future, every phenomenon of 21st century politics  and economics will result in an upheaval due to the "energy"  released in the three regions, and will be prescribed by it.    The present state of Russia's economy seems to be a dual  economy in which coexist an economy of the heavy industrial  sector, which has been encumbered by the shadow of the state-run  corporation, and a real economy, similar to the black market  economy in Japan immediately after the war. In looking at the  sector centered on the heavy industrial state-run corporation,  we become extremely pessimistic, but the real economy at the  grassroots is considerably more sound. I feel that the views  differ according to where the focus is placed. I received the  impression that confusion arises when observing Russia's  economy, due to the problem of where to focus one's sight.    [Nukazawa] What are your views on the observation that,  despite the privatization of the state-run corporations, it will  result in monopolies that deny the advantages of competition?    [Kawake] In a careful consideration of the nation called  Russia, companies in the real sense apparently did not exist  during the more than 200 years that include the tsarist era, and  I believe that a major problem lies in how Russia without such  experience should learn about the market economy. It is true  that, despite privatization of the state-run corporation, only a  monopolistic corporation will result. I believe that it is the  responsibility of Japan and other nations to advise them on how  to go about it and to think for them, which is more important  than capital assistance.    Regarding the formation of a framework, Japan and Germany  have a variety of experiences. Both have lost in war,  experienced inflation, and privatized state-run enterprises. I  believe that, as Russia's neighbor, Japan should provide such  assistance.  <H5>  Japan's Experiences Effective for Russia </H5>   [Nukazawa] I heard recently in Moscow that, among the 49  foreign advisers in the Russian Government, 48 were advisers  sent by the United States. However, in the case of the United  States, its experience in promoting the economy happened a long,  long time ago, and I believe that it is more useful to tell them  about Japan's experiences. It is important to send advisers from  Japan.    [Aiko] I believe that there are two major problems  concerning  the current reforms.    First, the effect of the same prescription is totally the  reverse, depending on when there is surplus supply capacity and  when there is a shortage. You say that virtually all of the  advisers are Americans, but the Americans have never experienced  an absolute shortage of supply capacity. Looking at Russia's  recent circumstances, it appears that they are trying to apply  the common sense of a nation with surplus supply to a nation  with a shortage of supply.    Regardless of price liberalization, there is no way for it  to  become an incentive for a rise in supply. If prices are  liberalized when there is an absolute supply shortage, goods  will sell regardless of how high the prices, so the prices will  merely climb without a rise in supply. Therefore, under such  circumstances, I believe that it is necessary to retain the  supply or control system to some extent, and to gradually  liberalize in accordance with an upgrading of the supply system.    Second, the previous system concentrated outstanding people  of talent in the Communist Party and formed a bureaucracy. In  one aspect, due to a personnel shortage, ignoring these people  and attempting to press for reforms will not work smoothly. In  fact, they must be asked to work together to achieve reform. In  Japan during the Meiji Restoration, the detectives and officials  of the Tokugawa shogunate were used adeptly for continuity.  During the last war also, in the process of discarding control,  the prewar government organization was used intact. Russia has  had a world-class bureaucratic system, and I believe that it  should consider pushing for reforms by cleverly using it with  its cooperation.    Regarding these two points, we could probably provide unique  advice by utilizing Japan's experience.    [Yamashita] If we narrow down the areas in concrete terms,  Russia has state-designated industrial product standards called  GOST [All-Union State Standard], which is like the JIS [Japan  Industrial Standards]. This is a huge organization that has more  than 50,000 members in the capital area and about 38,000 members  in the outlying regions. However, despite the large number of  members, application of the standards is quite lagging, and  Russia's standards have been omitted from the joint standards of  the ISO [International Standards Organization] which was started  by Europe. If it is unable to win ISO approval, as a practical  problem, Russian products, except military weapons, will no  longer be exportable to Europe. Therefore, if it adopts a joint  approach with Japan, which is slow to conform to ISO standards,  it will probably be able to win approval.    As this example illustrates, I believe that it is more  useful  to exchange advice on a specific theme.    [Nukazawa] However, perhaps because it has been exposed to  the view from Europe and the United States that "Japan has not  really become a market economy, and therefore it is not  advisable to learn from Japan," there was an atmosphere of an  element of caution against learning from Japan, was there not?    [Kawake] Conversely, there was a view that, for Russia's  sake, it is easier to accept the Japan-style economy than the  U.S.-style, and that it would serve as a reference. The problem  of privatization of the national railways is one not found in  the United States, nor is inflation in the United States so  conspicuous. I believe that Japan will of greater reference in  various ways.  <H5>  II. What Will Become of Russia's Economic Reconstruction? </H5>   [Nukazawa] In any case, inflation is quite serious. Today,  the dollar has risen much higher than 1,000 rubles, and it is  apparently rumored in Moscow that it may go as high as 3,000  rubles between this fall and the yearend.    The price of coal, which was deregulated on 1 July,  instantly  doubled, and is expected to rise six- to eightfold in the near  future. Incidentally, the coal miner's monthly wage will rise to  about 400,000 rubles or 10 times the general wage. With the  price of coal climbing, the prices of steel and other principal  raw materials will rise drastically. In terms of dollar prices,  they will surpass international prices. Therefore, if we  calculate in reverse to correspond with the international  prices, the ruble will drop considerably. Because the central  bank is granting state subsidies rampantly, inflation is fed  constantly. If this continues, one cannot afford to conduct  business selling rubles in Moscow. I feel that, before talking  about a market economy, there is a need to expel inflation.    [Nukazawa] When I hear about coal, steel, and subsidies, I  am  reminded of the postwar declining industries.    After the war, Japan restricted foreign exchange  transactions  and accumulated foreign currency. However, present-day Russia  has adopted no measures regarding foreign currency and its  capital is constantly flowing out. For example, there is  reportedly $400 billion worth of dollar deposits in New York  banks. Is it not rather strange that it wants to borrow money  from foreign countries while leaving that money there?    [Rokugawa] Actually, the Russian authorities themselves are  unable to control and regulate the foreign deposits of residents  in Russia. In Japan also, there are requests received by the  Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan [Zenginkyo] not to  accept such deposits. Based on this, Zenginkyo reportedly has  sent written requests to its subsidiaries not to accept the  establishing of accounts with such mysterious Russian funds.    [Nukazawa] In Japan since the war, the government has  strictly supervised the recovery of export payments through the  standard settlement system, checking how, when, and how much  payment is made during export, and where it is destined.  However, Russia is unable to do this.    [Aiko] They cannot do it unless they regulate by linking the  outflow of goods and the flow of funds. The transactions are  based on formal contracts, and they will be able to regulate to  some extent if they check the method of payment at the time of  the contract, and if a bureaucratic system functions to enable  the bank to back the entire payment. However, under the present  circumstances, they are unable to do so.  <H5>  Recovery of Ruble's External Convertibility Still in Future </H5>   [Rokugawa] In the case of exports to Russia, we dare not  export without prepayment or a form of barter, but bartering is  banned in Japan. Therefore, it is conducted under a quasi-barter  form of advance export by the Russian side.    From the standpoint of the ruble's convertibility, both  Russia and East Europe are confusing the convertibility of the  nonresident account with the resident account. Japan and the  West European nations have assiduously worked to promote exports  after the war, thereby accumulating foreign currency, and have  not recognized foreign currency holdings by the residents. They  also took considerable time to liberalize overseas travel. Once  a sufficient amount of foreign currency was accumulated, they  first restored the convertibility of accounts for nonresidents  and eventually the accounts for residents.    On the other hand, Russia left it up to the desires of the  masses. It did not adopt a policy of concentrating foreign  currency, but first recognized foreign currency holdings by the  residents. Despite the external nonconvertibility of their  currency, they restored domestic convertibility between  residents within Russia. Consequently, their hard-earned foreign  currency flowed outside, with the volume reportedly totaling $16  billion or even $20 billion.    Therefore, I believe that it should induct comprehensieve  foreign exchange management, concentrate the foreign currency  holdings of the residents in the central bank, and then  liberalize. It is surprising that the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund have completely overlooked guidance  in these respects concerning foreign exchange policy. Therefore,  restoration of the external convertibility of the ruble is still  far in the future.    [Kawake] The present cabinet is implementing to a  considerable degree two policies that could not be implemented  during the leadership of former Premier Kaidar--i.e.  tranquilizing the hyperinflation and controlling the central  bank. By beginning to cope seriously with these aspects, Russia  is seen as finally lining up on the starting line. Certainly,  its energy is extremely cheap by international standards.  Therefore, if Russia itself upgrades its system to cope with the  extremely difficult task of curbing inflation while raising the  prices of its energy, I believe it will be important, first of  all, for everyone to give support and offer advice.  <H5>  Black Markets, But No Corporations </H5>   [Nukazawa] Here and there on the street corners in Moscow  are  seen foreign exchange trucks which are remodeled buses. The  people all exchange rubles for marks, francs, and dollars, and  they deposit the foreign currencies. It is regrettable when the  people have a low regard for the currency of their own country.  The foreign exchange brokers, like the postwar black market  operators (in Japan), reportedly buy and accumulate coupons  which they trade for stock shares to be issued when the national  enterprises are privatized. Can sound privatization be realized  under such conditions?    In postwar Japan black marketeers were rampant, but the  established enterprises also remained. In today's Russia, there  are black markets but no corporate enterprises. How the other  advanced nations will support them in this respect is important.    If Russia's market economization makes progress, there may  be  a stage when further privatization of the national enterprises  will be attempted. At this stage, however, like postwar Japan  and Europe, or like the United States following the Great  Depression, it should aim for economic reconstruction with the  public sector as the business core.    Regarding the mode of management, it could probably bring in  enterpreneurs from Japan and the United States, and let them  take over management temporarily.  <H5>  Outlook of Japan-Russia Economic Relations </H5>   [Nukazawa] Regarding Japan-Russia economic relations, unpaid  trade payments and the freezing of foreign investment accounts  are two problems that weigh heavily and became the focus of  attention at the recent conference.    [Yamashita] The Russian side said that they will be reviewed  by a committee chaired by Deputy Chairman Shokhin. Although they  say that it will suffice to pay foreign debts with $150 billion  worth of foreign currency credits, it is rather difficult for  the money to be returned when the debtors are nations like Cuba,  Vietnam, and Angola. It is a hopeless situation to be told all  of a sudden that "your debtor is Cuba," or "your debtor is  Angola."    [Kawake] We would hope that the Shokhin committee will  carefully review the method of solving the problem of unpaid  foreign currency. However, I do not think the Japanese could go  in to participate in the discussion and suggest ways to go about  it. The position of the Japan side of the committee is to urge  and remind, but not to formulate concrete plans.    [Nukazawa] Regarding the clarification of authority and the  transfer of authority to the regions, which were mentioned  during the era of the Japan-Soviet economic committee, did you  feel that there has been some progress?    Until now, progress was made when the talks were held in  Moscow, but recently nothing could be achieved in Moscow alone.  As to whom the talks should be held with, it is the respective  enterprises or the local governments. However, they have no  legal backing. In effect, they have no authority.    In other words, adequate talks cannot be held in Moscow and,  although concrete talks can be held at the regional level, they  have no authority. Therefore, I believe that the direction of  the debate by the present constitutional council is extremely  important. If the constitution works out smoothly, not only will  the president's authority be enhanced to some extent, but the  regional authority will also be clarified. I believe it is  important for them to first form the framework.    [Aiko] A major problem is that it is not clear who the  competent persons in charge are. Regarding the 200 or 300  presidential decrees also, it is not stipulated at all who the  implementers are, or whether there are any punitive measures,  and we have heard that no one bothers to obey the presidential  decrees.    [Nukazawa] To begin with, there is apparently no concept  that  the infrastructure is the government's responsibility. Perhaps  they think that everything can be done by the stock company.  They must clarify the infrastructure of the public sector as  being responsible, because the basic role of the public sector  is based on social capital. They are mistaken in thinking that  such-and-such a port or harbor is the responsibility of  such-and-such a company.    [Kawake] For example, when considering joint ventures, if  the  company is asked to build not only a pulp plant but also roads  and a port, it will not be done.    [Nukazawa] There is a similar problem with respect to  Vietnam. If we say we cannot invest because there is no  infrastructure, they say: "Well, Japan can build an  infrastructure for us also."    [Yamashita] At least it is inconceivable for a private  company in Japan to provide such assistance. Unless there is  clearly an economic profit on this side, a private company  cannot do it. As you know, the time span is sometimes long and  sometimes short, and it cannot be done unless there is an  overall plus for the company.  <H5>  Japan Must Work for Far East Development </H5>   [Nukazawa] It depends on the direction of the constitution,  but if a certain degree of authority is transferred to the  regions and autonomy is increased, there will probably be a  arising mood in Japan to work for resources development in the  Far East.    [Kawake] Regions with expansive resources that can be  reached  by aircraft concentrate on the regions eastward from Siberia and  Irkutsk, and east of the Ural region. The Western nations are  making rapid inroads into western Russia, and entry by Japan  will not make a conspicuous mark.    [Aiko] It is something else if there is no potential in the  Far East, but there is a potential there in its own right. If  Russia does nothing and lets the status quo stand, I feel that  Russia's Far East region will become a center of competition  between China and Korea. If Russia itself has a certain amount  of strategy policywise for economic development, there is a  possibility that more Russians will be transplanted there. Thus,  for example, Russians who find life unbearable in Central Asia  and the Baltic countries will be given opportunities for  employment, and I believe it will be very good politically.    [Rokugawa] Japan's support should be a more visible form of  support rather than through the G-7 or IMF. Particularly  regarding the Far East region, ports and harbors come first.  Among those related to the development of the Tumen River in  East Asia, if we make efforts to improve the port facilities in  such places as Sarbino [as translitered], Vanino, and Sovetskaya  Gavan, they will stand out. Or, in view of the deterioration of  the Siberian Railway, I believe there are many things we can do,  such as improving the infrastructure of railway transportation.  Or, since it is a cold region, if we construct something like  the Tokyo Dome with a wholesale market, a supermarket and an  amusement center inside, it would probably be greatly  appreciated.    [Yamashita] Without transportation, construction requiring a  huge volume of materials would not be feasible in European  Russia. In that case, products that use less materials and are  easily transportable must be produced in European Russia. In  that sense, the upgrading of transport routes is urgently needed.    [Nukazawa] If the Far East builds a solid position as a  resource supply source for Japan, it will be very good for  Japan's security.  <H5>  A Realistic Investment Plan </H5>   [Kawake] After all, Japan itself should set priorities  regarding investment, trade and various development plans.  Russia is asking for projects worh tens of billions of yen. It  would be more realistic to take an approach toward small-scale  and really necessary projects, or to figure out how the present  facilities can be remodeled.    [Rokugawa] When we received a request for a survey on the  conversion of the Bulgarian military facilities to civilian use,  we asked Juki Corporation, the sewing machine maker which has  experience in this aspect, to conduct a review of various local  surveys, we found, for instance, that it is technically feasible  to produce 100,000 pieces of machines and equipment annually.  However, they say that they can sell 10,000 pieces, leaving  90,000 pieces which they want us to sell overseas. However, we  do not have the confidence to sell 90,000 pieces outside of  Bulgaria. Stymied by this, the idea was dropped. It is quite a  task when production is not possible without our thinking about  marketing and sales for them.    Therefore, regarding conversion of military facilities to  civilian use, they should not talk about such large-scale  projects as artificial satellites, but utilize the munitions  plants in the environs of Khabarovsk. For example, their casting  technology is reputed to be extremely good, so if Japan consigns  production of mechanical equipment and parts like flanges and  buys up the entire volume, or initially has them produce simple  communications facilities on a small scale, or seeks cooperation  on conversion of simple military facilities to civilian use, I  believe Russia will appreciate it. Conversion of high-level  military facilities on a grand scale is too costly and extremely  difficult to materialize, and it is clear from the standpoint of  productivity and cost that their products cannot possibly  compete with the products of Europe and the United States.    [Kawake] I believe that, in terms of the present relations  with Russia, it is important to understand the present  conditions. We must go over there to conduct fact-finding  surveys in order to formulate some kind of concrete plan.  Further feasibility studies are also a prerequisite.    [Rokugawa] When we went to a munitions plant in the  Vladivostok suburbs where they are working on general  telecommunications called "Radio Pribor" [phonetic], we were  told that we were the 98th company from Japan. It indicates how  many companies in Japan are conducting studies. They probably  all investigated and found it difficult to handle, so they gave  up.    [Nukazawa] Russia has broad territorial lands and is rich in  rsources, so the potentials are great. However, it is deterred  by its legacies from the past, so it is probably necessary for  us to advise them and make smooth circulation possible. However,  it is difficult to know where to begin.  <H5>  Image of Russia as a Great Power Must Be Dropped </H5>   [Yamashita] The problem is that the Russian side is not very  receptive to advice. They probably believe that they are smart  enough. In any case, all they want from Japan now is money.    [Aiko] When we listen to people in charge of projects for  overseas advancement, I believe the greatest point in a minus  sense is pride. Where pride exists, the situation is difficult.  Once that pride is put aside, the rest seems to go smoothly. In  a region which has previously produced TV sets, there is a fixed  concept of TV production and, if we try to introduce a  completely different method, there is terrific resistance.  However, in a region where they produce nothing except farm  products, there is no resistance, but a receptive attitude  toward new technology as is. In that sense, because Russia has a  high-tech industry in its own right and also a high level of  technical education, it is probably difficult for them to ask  for advice.    [Rokugawa] As a historical and diplomatic power, Russia has  looked down on Japan for a long time and, unless such power  consciousness is dropped, I do not believe that they can humble  themselves and ask for advice.    [Kawake] The Russian side approaches us by asking whether we  have an interest in their project. They do not say what they  would like to do, but what they want us to do. Because they  demand what our interests are, it is difficult for us to reply.    [Nukazawa] Even when we go to East Europe and Vietnam, they  say that many people come from Japan to see, but the talks are  not fruitful at all. Do you mean that the reason is on the other  side?    [Rokugawa] The Japanese side is very cautious, as you know.  We take pains to check before we invest.    [Kawake] The Americans often tell us that the Japanese are  not very decisive. However, once we decide, we follow through.  According to the Russians, the Americans invest very quickly,  but they also pull out quickly. Therefore, each side has its  merits and shortcomings.    [Yamashita] From Russia's viewpoint, they receive numerous  inquiries from America.    [Nukazawa] That point is important. Unless they understand  the difference, they get the impression that we go over merely  to browse and do not buy anything.  <H5>  Take Time and Start From the Feasible Aspects </H5>   [Kawake] Judging from my experience of having been interned  in Sakhalin, the Soviet system is bad, but the Russians people  are extremely nice, once you get to know them. Therefore, I  believe that it is vital to build human relations. However, the  remaining vestiges of the old system obstruct the forming of  human relations.    [Rokugawa] It will be better appreciated by the other side  if  we help them when they need it. After all, Japan has the most in  terms of personnel, money, goods and technology. I feel that, at  this stage, it will be more profitable for Japan's future if we  start by giving support and adopt the posture of solving various  issues including the problem of the Northern Territories.    [Yamashita] In such a case, based on Japan's present  situation, information on problems of the Far East region is  received relatively easily. Therefore, it is more practical to  begin with the solution of such issues, and it will probably be  more effective vis-a-vis the people of the region also. It is  with such an intent that we are offering railway passenger cars  for use in Sakhalin.    [Rokugawa] Also, it is a problem when they rampantly throw  nuclear wastes and bombshells into the Japan Sea. There should  be some change in order to eradicate such actions.    [Kawake] There are definitely problems in Japan-Russia  relations. In any case, it is a nation that can be reached by  plane in just over an hour, so I believe that, basically,  emphasis should be placed on our relations with them. At the  same time, it is of course important to take time and to start  with projects which are feasible.    [Aiko] Apart from economics and politics, Russia is a very  nice country.    [Nukazawa] Certainly, it is a wonderful country in terms of  its literature, music, ballet and sports. Also, the individual  Russian is a warm person with humane touches. Thank you all very  much.  <H5>  Recent Japan-Russia Relations </H5>   1992     -  9 September - Russian President Yeltsin announces delay of  Japan trip.    -  23 September - Foreign Minister Watanabe holds talks with  with  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev.

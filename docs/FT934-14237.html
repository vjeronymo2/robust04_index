			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / DTI advises Heseltine against Post Office sell-off THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is to recommend that the Post Office should not be privatised, despite the conclusions of its advisers who believe a sale would not jeopardise the nationwide delivery network. The recommendation to leave the Royal Mail, which is the letters division, and Post Office Counters in the public sector but with greater commercial freedom will be put to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, when he returns to work, possibly this week. He is not expected to overrule the department's recommendation. The DTI, however, is considering some options to give the Post Office greater commercial freedom in the public sector while introducing more competition. The sale of Parcelforce, already announced, will still go ahead. Kleinwort Benson, the government's adviser on the future of the service, believes a regulated, privatised Royal Mail could continue to deliver letters to every address in the UK without charging more in rural areas. However, many ministers fear that privatisation could provoke another unwelcome split in the Conservative party, similar to the row over the break-up of British Rail. The government would only have a slim majority of about one on the committee stage of any bill privatising the Post Office, which is regarded as too small to ensure success. The first sign of a backtrack came when Mr John Major sacked the junior industry minister Mr Edward Leigh, a strong supporter of privatisation, in his spring reshuffle. Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, believes the future ownership of the corporation is a matter for the government, but he has called on ministers to cut it loose 'from the stifling cash book culture of the public sector'. Last year the Post Office contributed Pounds 80m in cash to the Treasury. This year its target contribution has risen to Pounds 181m, described by the Post Office as a daunting challenge.</p>

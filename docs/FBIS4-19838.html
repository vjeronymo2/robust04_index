			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Unemployment Rising Faster Than </F> Ever To Over 500,000"]    [Text] Unemployment is rising faster than ever before, with  18,000 jobs lost every month. Such a rate of increase is the  highest since the war.    This is clear from the latest unemployment figures published  by the CBS [Central Statistics Office]. It is also the first  time that unemployment has topped the half million mark since  early 1986.    In an initial reaction to the figures, Social Affairs  Minister De Vries spoke of an "alarming growth." "Strictly  speaking, we are now facing an increase of 200,000 a year. It  is clear that although there is already some prospect of  economic recovery, the process of reducing jobs is still  continuing steadily and the end is not yet in sight," the  minister said.    De Vries believes that the new unemployment figures stress  the need to lighten the costs burden on companies and for a more  flexible labor market. "Also, employers and employees should  exercise the greatest constraint not only in the current round  of wage negotiations for this year, but also for 1995," De  Vries stated.</p>

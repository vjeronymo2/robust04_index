			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl"-signed report: "CDU/CSU: Compromise Reached on </F> Repurchasing"]    [Text] Bonn -- A team of experts from the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag  Group and new laender governed by the CDU have reached agreement  on the controversial repurchasing of agricultural and forestry  land as part of the law on compensation.    CDU Minister Friedrich Bohl, chief of the federal  chancellery, said he was optimistic that the liberals would also  approve the proposal on which a consensus has now been achieved  and that the reservations still being voiced by  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania would be dispelled.    The detailed provisions of the proposal are as follows:    -- Former owners who were expropriated in the years 1945 to  1949 as well as present leaseholders of agricultural and  forestry land can purchase land from the land holdings being  administered by the Trust Agency at a favorable rate  corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the current market  value;    -- About 73 percent of the land being administered by the  Trust Agency has been reserved for eastern German leaseholders  under the settlement program. An arbitration agency will be  established for settling possible disputes between parties  having interests in the land.    -- The possibilities envisaged by the draft law enabling  former owners to repurchase land will be strengthened and take  the form of a provision stating explicitly that such an option  is available. There will be no claims to specific tracts of land.    -- As in the case of all others who are entitled to  compensation, the level of compensation to be provided to former  owners who wish to repurchase land will be verified and former  owners will then receive bonds that can be redeemed until 2004.    -- Former owners who wish to repurchase land must apply for  the purchase of land within six months of receiving a bond.    -- Valuations connected with the purchase of land will be  conducted in accordance with criteria that are the same as those  to be used for establishing the base rate for compensation.  This means that the value of agricultural and forestry land in  1935 will be multiplied by a factor of three.    -- However, the compensation provided in connection with  repurchasing will be lowered, before the previous receipt of  compensation for losses is considered, to take account of the  possible loss of interest resulting from the early redemption of  a bond and the general degressive reductions in compensation  envisaged by the compensation law.    In concrete terms, this means that a former owner who lost  50  hectares of land can use compensation worth 57,000 German marks  [DM] to repurchase 19 hectares of land. In the case of 100  hectares, the compensation will amount to DM87,000, and the area  of land to be repurchased will total 29 hectares. In the case  of 500 hectares, the corresponding amounts are DM252,000 and 84  hectares, and DM402,000 hectares and 134 hectares in the case of  1,000 hectares.    -- To partially finance the repurchase of land on  preferential terms, the 10-percent investment bonus (which  amounts to DM1 billion) for the reinvestment of compensation in  the new laender will be abolished.    Where the additional expenditure of DM1.5 billion is to come  from still requires final clarification.</p>

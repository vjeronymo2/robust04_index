			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Explosion hits China's commercial satellite launch plans An explosion at China's space centre, which destroyed a Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) advanced weather satellite and killed at least one person, has dealt a significant blow to the country's ambitious efforts to break into the world commercial satellite launch market. The accident is likely to damage China's image as one of a handful of countries capable of competing in the Dollars 1bn a year commercial satellite launch business by stirring doubts about the reliability and safety record of its space industry. The Chinese Aerospace Industry Corporation, successor to the former space ministry, confirmed yesterday that an 'accidental event' had occurred on April 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in the south-western province of Sichuan on the edge of the Tibetan plateau. China has been seeking to win western business by offering cheaper satellite launches at between 30 and 50 per cent of the cost of equivalent European or US launches. Russia has also sought to win business in spite of a recent agreement with Washington not to undercut western prices by more than 7.5 per cent. The explosion killed at least one person, injured more than 20 and destroyed a laboratory as well as the Chinese Dollars 75m Fengyun 2 meteorological satellite. The satellite was originally due to be launched on a Chinese Long March rocket. The Chinese authorities released no details of the accident and said investigations into its cause were continuing, but western diplomats suggested it occurred during final preflight testing, with the explosion probably provoked by a leak in the satellite's on-board fuel system. However, China acknowledged the explosion would affect its satellite launch schedule for the rest of this year. China had planned to launch five domestic and foreign satellites this year. The setback comes at a particularly delicate time for the Chinese because it coincides with increasing competition in the commercial satellite launch business. 'The market remains difficult with an average of 15-18 new commercial satellite launch opportunities a year,' explained Mr Charles Bigot, the chief executive of Arianespace, the European satellite launch company which currently commands about 60 per cent of the commercial market. China's Long March rocket currently has a backlog of seven commercial satellite launch orders compared with 39 for Ariane, 21 for US manufacturers and officially one for the Russian Proton rocket, although Russia recently indicated it had won up to 13 commitments.</p>

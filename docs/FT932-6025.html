			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / End of immigrant housing drive may decelerate growth in Israel THE BANK of Israel said yesterday that economic growth could slow down in the country because of the end of a house building boom, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. It also urged the government to accelerate the sale of public companies, increase competition and reform the labour market. A government building drive to house an influx of immigrants from the former Soviet Union had boosted the economy for two years but the fillip was over, said the central bank said in its 1992 report. It said gross domestic product rose 6.6 per cent (revised from 6.4 per cent) in 1992, compared with 6.2 per cent (revised from 5.9 per cent) in 1991. Exports had displaced housing as the key growth factor, rising 14.4 per cent in 1992. But the report said this was, in part, compensation for a decline of 1.5 per cent in 1991 exports, prompted by the Gulf War when activity was slowed by Iraqi Scud missile attacks. Unemployment, which the central bank called the government's main economic problem, rose to 11.2 per cent in 1992, from 10.6 per cent in 1991. Inflation was in single digits for the first time in 23 years - 9.4 per cent compared with 18 per cent in 1991. 'Not enough was done this year in the area of privatisation, increasing competition and making the labour market more flexible,' the 350-page report said, echoing charges in January by Mr Haim Stoessel, Tel Aviv Stock Exchange chairman, that the government had missed an opportunity by not selling more companies in 1992. The sale of shares in three state companies raised 1.1bn shekels (Pounds 256m) in a year when the general stock market index rose by nearly 74 per cent on doubled volume. 'There was room for increasing competition in the communications, public transport and banking branches. 'In the banking area, (there is a need for reform) that will increase competition, while reducing potential conflicts and maintaining banking stability,' the report said. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has reshuffled the cabinet to quell a government crisis which, he said, could have disrupted the Middle East peace talks. Mr Rabin, convincing ministers in his Labour party to cede portfolios to the leftist Meretz bloc on Sunday, ended the crisis that had begun last month when the ultra-religious Shas party demanded he remove Ms Shulamit Aloni, outspoken education minister.</p>

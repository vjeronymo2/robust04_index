			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Exhibitor of good connections - Richard Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission On the wall of Mr Richard Breeden's office in Washington DC, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has hung various photographs of himself in the company of President George Bush: conferring intently over a meal; at a black tie gathering; and so on. Nothing unusual in that, you may think: offices the world over are hung with vanity pictures of their occupants consorting with the rich, powerful or famous. Yes, but . . . this is just the beginning. Amid the blinking computer terminals and clocks showing the time around the globe, a good part of the wall space in the SEC chairman's office is devoted to images of Mr Bush, with or without Mr Breeden. Here is the president playing a homely game of horseshoes; there he is looking windswept and nautical; and here he is being sworn in to office. Several photos are the size of oil paintings. Mr Breeden's admiration for Mr Bush is hardly surprising: he was plucked to head the SEC from within the Bush White House and served on Mr Bush's vice-presidental staff in the early 1980s. But the display also sends a forceful message, intentional or not, that Mr Breeden has good connections in the most important domestic residence in the land. And for an SEC chairman, that is a position unusually close to the centre of power - bringing both advantages and disadvantages. The connections were no doubt helpful back in 1989 when, at the age of 39 and with no direct experience of working inside a securities company, Mr Breeden was named to head the SEC, the government agency that oversees Wall Street. In the two and a half years since then, he has stamped his own mark clearly on the commission, through an energetic spate of regulatory initiatives. These have been widely praised, but have also prompted accusations of ruthless empire-building from other parts of the Washington bureaucracy. The past week and a half have produced a particular flurry of activity: Mr Breeden has unveiled proposals for the first significant shake-up of the fast-growing US mutual fund industry in half a century - a package that could, among other things, make it easier for foreign funds to offer their products in America. Wearing his hat as 'Wall Street's top cop', he has also announced swingeing fines and restitution, totalling Dollars 290m, which Salomon Brothers will have to pay because of its breach last year of Treasury bond auction rules. The events highlight two of the most important features of the Breeden regime. One is a series of moves to rid the securities industry of needless regulation and encourage financial innovation. Sipping from a coffee mug bearing an 'Office of the Vice-President' seal, Mr Breeden says: 'I have sought to promote in as many ways as possible better opportunities to raise capital at lower cost and to identify and remove artificial barriers . . . to the use of security markets for primary capital raising.' He speaks in a rather formal, guarded manner, like an ambassador on parade, and displays nothing of his reputation for abrasive and overbearing behaviour. Another feature of the Breeden SEC is its toughness in enforcing the rulebook, following the wild financial excesses of the 1980s. The Salomon settlement, for example, was higher than Wall Street had been expecting. It was Mr Breeden who wrote an unusually blunt letter in 1990 to the judge sentencing Mr Michael Milken, the former junk bond king, for securities crimes, arguing that he deserved a 'substantial term of incarceration'. Mr Breeden says he thinks any other SEC chairman would have done the same, but adds: 'I have a very strong personal view that just because crime is committed by someone who is dressed more nicely, it does not justify turning your back on it.' A securities lawyer by background, who dresses in the conservative, pin-striped manner of his ilk, Mr Breeden made his name in Washington as President Bush's top aide in the bail-out of the savings and loans industry. In what was arguably the worst scandal of the 1980s, large parts of the sector were made insolvent by crookery and crazy lending practices. The federal government, which insures deposits placed with the S&amp;Ls, as it does with US banks, had to pick up the tab. Mr Breeden says the principal culprit of both the S&amp;L disaster and the current weakness of the US banking system is this deposit insurance system: 'I do not believe in asking the taxpayers of the US to stand behind every dumb decision made by a lending officer. That ought to be the bank's and the shareholders' responsibility.' He points out that there is no such safety net for the US securities industry, which remains a world leader in both size and innovative techniques. Market disciplines, he says, are stronger and more omnipresent than any number of rule-setting bureaucrats and bank examiners. 'Markets don't go to sleep.' The US securities markets have, however, been displaying a tendency to fragment, with the once dominant New York Stock Exchange giving up more and more of the pie to electronic dealer-driven markets or computerised, intermediary free networks. Despite the protestations of the New York exchange, Mr Breeden's SEC has given a host of innovative high-tech trading systems the regulatory green light. He is involved in another public dispute with the New York exchange, which wants the SEC to relax its strict financial disclosure requirements for foreign companies in the hope this will encourage more of them to list in the US. Mr Breeden says he is anxious to make the US securities market more accessible to foreign companies, and hints that there is a little room for manoeuvre on disclosure requirements with the New York exchange. But he rejects the argument that 'if a given regulatory system is good enough for some country it ought to be good enough for the US. That's just a race to the bottom. That's what we would call competition in laxity.' Much of the argument centres on German companies, which have a radically different accounting system from the US, and one, says Mr Breeden, which 'denies the basic proposition that public investors have a right to know how the company is doing'. US investors, he says, must be given an 'information bridge' which enables them to compare the performance of US and foreign companies. He finds it strange that Volvo of Sweden, Honda of Japan and Fiat of Italy, all of which have American listings, can comply with the US standards 'yet we're told we have to throw our whole system out of the window to accommodate Mercedes-Benz. Well, that is not likely to happen.' His achievements in putting more muscle into the SEC have led him into clashes with other regulatory agencies - for example, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (over who should regulate stock index futures) and the Federal Reserve (over bank accounting methods). Such fights are only natural in an era where financial markets are converging and, therefore, so are the bureaucracies that police them. More serious are accusations, including some from current and former SEC commissioners, that Mr Breeden has recently been politicising the institution - which has always been carefully aloof from the party fray - by tilting policies towards the White House line. His critics paint a portrait of a man consumed by political ambition, aiming for a seat in the cabinet. Mr Breeden has repeatedly denied compromising the agency's independence, while the 'politically ambitious' label infuriates him. He would prefer to be seen as a lawyer from the private sector doing his bit of public service. But it is easy to see how such ideas multiply when you have the president of the United States as an office pin-up. And in any case, what is so bad about ambition?

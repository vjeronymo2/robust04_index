They touched upon various aspects of  French-Uzbek economic cooperation.    Regarding the two major projects in which French firms are  participating -- the construction of an oil refinery in Bukhara  and the modernization of Uzbek air traffic control systems --  Mitterrand expressed France's readiness to guarantee the credits  it needs to the sum of 700 million francs.    He stressed that France's participation in the modernization  of Uzbekistan's economy does not stop there. Many French  enterprises, whose representatives arrived in Uzbekistan  together with the official delegation, he said, have been  attracted by the possibility of cooperation with their Uzbek  counterparts in various sectors of the economy, such as sugar  and textile production, gas, the construction of airports,  interbank activities, and also in cotton growing and water  conservancy.    France will help Uzbekistan to acquire financial assistance  from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, as  well as credits for European technical assistance, the French  president stressed.</p>

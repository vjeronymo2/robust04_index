			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON;  </P> <P> SURREAL IMAGES;  </P> <P> A LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHER HAS SELECTED 40 PHOTOS FOR A DISPLAY DEPICTING THE SANTA  BARBARA FIRE.  </P> <P> Chris Gardner was one of the many media photographers in the nation to capture  on film the six days of the Santa Barbara fire last June.  </P> <P> "The fire was a tragedy to so many and obviously I wish it never occurred,"  Gardner said. "Yet it was very surreal, and terribly exciting, and it was  beautiful in a way."  </P> <P> Gardner, who lives in Santa Barbara and works for the Independent, a weekly  newspaper, said he wanted to put all the images of the fire in one room. So he  selected 40 photos from magazines and newspapers that show the tragedy, the  excitement and the beauty of the fire. The prints, from photographers with the  city's local newspapers and the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily News,  Newsweek magazine, Time magazine and National Geographic will be on display at  the Contemporary Art Forum now through Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Some of Gardner's favorite photos include a man running down his driveway just  as flames are about to engulf his house, and a couple embracing amid the rubble  that was once their home.  </P> <P> "It was a war scene without the bodies," Gardner said. "I will never forget it.  I feel honored to have been there. And at the same time I feel ashamed because  I sort of enjoyed it."  </P> <P> The exhibit is free. The gallery in the Paseo Nuevo shopping center is open  Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. A reception for "Fire on Film"  is scheduled from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday.

Past albums include "Ice On Fire" and "Changes," which featured the  1982 hit "Pass the Kutchie."  </P> <P> Tickets are $15, available at the Graduate, 685-3112, or charge by phone,  966-1466. Doors open at 7 p.m. Spencer the Gardener is guest artist.  </P> <P> The rise of the Black Panthers, the free-speech movement and the anti-war  demonstrations of the late '60s and early '70s are some of the events that  changed the course of American social and political life.  </P> <P> Six years in the making, the documentary "Berkeley in the '60s" was completed  this year. The production is an archival assemblage of raw footage from the  mass marches, demonstrations and confrontations of the 1960s. Interspersed are  recent interviews with 16 activists from that decade, including Black Panther  co-founder Bobby Seale and free-speech movement leader Jackie Goldberg, now  president of the Los Angeles Board of Education.  </P> <P> The film will be shown at the University of California's Campbell Hall at 8  p.m. Sunday.

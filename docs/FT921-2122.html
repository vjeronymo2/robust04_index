			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of discount rate cut push Nikkei above 20,000 REVIVED HOPES of a cut in the official discount rate prompted a surge in the futures market, and the Nikkei average recovered the psychologically important 20,000 level for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average regained 420.78 to 20,185.09 after a day's low of 19,732.84 and high of 20,213.95. Volume rose to 550m shares from 400m on cross-trading and bargain hunting by foreign and domestic investors. Advances outnumbered declines by 880 to 155, with 101 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks strengthened 43.36 to 1,451.14. Yesterday's recovery after a losing streak which had lasted 13 days relieved traders. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 5.71 to 1,131.50. Market participants were encouraged by news that the Japanese government would announce emergency measures to stimulate the economy by March 27. Speculation that the official discount rate might be reduced early next week also prompted short-covering ahead of the long weekend. The market is closed today for a national holiday. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said that an easing in monetary policy could be implemented before the new fiscal year. Window dressing for tokkin - specified money trusts - and fund trusts, which close their books today, also pushed up the Nikkei index. Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of Sumitomo Life's securities investment division, said more window-dressing buying could push the index up to 22,000 next week. Leading large-capital issues advanced on bargain hunting. Nippon Steel, which fell below Y300 on Wednesday for the first time since 1986, rebounded Y14 to Y310 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries moved forward Y14 to Y584. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, regarded as an indicator of market sen-timent, improved Y21,000 to Y663,000. Hopes of lower interest rates pushed up electric power companies, with Tokyo Electric Power rising Y190 to Y2,960. Financial issues were also sought, and Industrial Bank of Japan climbed Y80 to Y2,390 and Fuji Bank added Y70 at Y2,000. Brokerage houses rose on bargain hunting. The issues have been heavily sold recently due to concern about earnings. Nomura Securities added Y70 at Y1,190 and Yamaichi Securities advanced Y58 to Y580. However, Yamatane Securities, a second-tier broker, dropped Y55 to Y540. The company will post extraordinary losses due to its involvement in the tobashi scandals, which involved improving some clients' accounts by transferring loss-making investments to other clients. Investors were also discouraged by the resignation of the firm's chairman. In Osaka, the OSE average jumped 636.70 to 21,551.07 in volume of 542.8m shares. Roundup HONG KONG further retreated from last Friday's record high as yesterday's rally in Tokyo generally failed to encourage other Pacific Rim markets. Bombay was closed. Rumours in HONG KONG, later denied, that banks were planning to cut the limit on mortgage lending accompanied a fall in the Hang Seng index to below the 5,000 level. It closed above the day's worst but still a net 45.48 down at 4,990.59 in turnover of HKDollars 3.9bn (HKDollars 3.4bn). The property sector was depressed by the mortgage rumours, Henderson Land shedding 50 cents to HKDollars 16.20 and Hong Kong Land 20 cents to HKDollars 10.50. The banks remained active, with HSBC Holdings falling a further HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 40.25 as investors continued to switch into other banking stocks. Bank of East Asia gained 70 cents to HKDollars 22.70. AUSTRALIA closed ahead for the first time this week, the All Ordinaries index firming 3.4 to 1,571.4 in turnover of ADollars 167.4m. Bank and retail sectors were well supported, Westpac rising 4 cents to ADollars 3.83 and Coles Myer 16 cents to ADollars 11.16. BHP gained 12 cents to ADollars 13.26, but Western Mining fell 12 cents to ADollars 4.73, partly due to a strike at one of its operations. KUALA LUMPUR was pulled lower by Telecom Malaysia, off 20 cents at MDollars 11.40. The composite index dipped 2.44 to 597.96 in volume of 31m shares (34m). Gaming group Tanjong continued its strong run, adding 20 cents at MDollars 11.00. SINGAPORE declined amid selected selling of blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 5.45 to 1,436.39 in volume of 24.7m shares (24.2m). SEOUL had an early rise reversed and ended 1.69 down at 612.67 in turnover of Won314.8bn. Analysts said the market was likely to remain fairly static until after the elections on March 24. BANGKOK rose modestly, the SET index firming 3.29 to 811.78 in turnover of Bt6.9bn. TAIWAN remained weak in nervous trading ahead of today's National Assembly session on democratic reform. The weighted index fell 41.72 to 4,810.23 in turnover of TDollars 19.7bn, against TDollars 24.4bn. MANILA moved slightly ahead as activity remained low. The composite index rose 3.80 to 1,105.07 in turnover of 140.3m pesos. Philippine National Bank put on 2.50 pesos to 262.50, but Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which fell in overnight trading in the US, shed 5 pesos to 865. NEW ZEALAND lost ground for the third consecutive day, the NZSE-40 index slipping 9.47 to 1,439.19 in turnover of some NZDollars 10m. Telecom declined 3 cents to NZDollars 2.31.</p>

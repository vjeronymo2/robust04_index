A suction cup is used to obtain parotid saliva from the gland after the tongue is stimulated with citric acid. Although the parotid glands make the major contribution to the total salivary flow, the submandibular glands are the most consistently affected glands in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Measurement of parotid function may result in false-normal valuse. In Sjogren's syndrome, measurement of the submandibular/sublingual secretions are a sensitive indicator of salivary gland hypofunction. According to Fox et al12 alterations in submandibular/sublingual function have the greatest impact on the sensation of oral dryness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another useful technique for studying the salivary glands is lip biopsy. The technique is a sensitive and specific diagnostic procedure for Sjogren's syndrome. It is well tolerated and causes no disfigurement. The changes in the minor glands of the lower lip show a close correlation with those in the major salivary glands.11 In addition to confirming the diagnosis, biopsy allows quantification of the degree of lymphocytic infiltration and tissue damage. Aggregates of lymphocytes within the acinar tissue are scored. An aggregate of 50 or more cells represents a focus. The number of foci within 4mm2 of glandular tissue is determined and constitutes the focus score. A focus score of more than 1 is characteristic of Sjogren's syndrome.8 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Salivary scintigraphy, which measures the uptake, concentration, and excretion of technetium pertechnetate by the major salivary glands, is also a sensitive index of glandular function. However, it is expensive, requires exposure to a radionuclide, and has little advantage over the other two procedures.8 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth in the absence of any drug treatment or other disorder likely to be causal suggest a diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome.11 According to Talal8 the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome is based upon the confirmed presence of two of the following three criteria: (1) a focus score of more than 1 in the labial salivary gland biopsy, (2) dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), and (3) an associated connective tissue or lymphoproliferative disorder. The triad of dry eyes, dry mouth, and a connective tissue or collagen disease, usually rheumatoid arthritis, is termed secondary Sjogren's syndrome.11 Dry eyes and dry mouth in the absence of a collagen disease is referred to as primary Sjogren's syndrome. The use of diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs, antihistamines, antipsychotic, and antidepressants may diminish lacrimal and salivary gland function.13 Because the use of anticholinergic drugs as well as a number of other medications may be the single most frequent cause of xerostomia, it is essential to estsblish the presence of focal lymphoid infiltrates and autoimmunity in a patient suspected of having Sjogren's syndrome. Supportive serologic data would include the presence of antinuclear antibodies, an elevated erythrocyte sedimenation rate, and the presence of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatment of xerostomia is difficult and includes preventing caries, treating and retreating oral candidiasis, and attempting to relieve the symptoms of dry mouth by increasing fluid intake, replacing absent saliva with saliva substitutes, or stimulating the remaining glandular tissue to secrete. Patients presenting with milder stages of xerostomia may benefit from frequent small sips of water or other fluids such as fruit nectars, and this may be as effective as any other means of alleviating symptoms. Sialagogues such as vitamin C tablets, sugarless chewing gum, mints, or hard candies may offer temporary relief through masticatory or gustatory stimulation. For other patients, saliva substitutes may ameliorate symptoms and possibly increase salivary flow. Efforts at relieving the symptoms of chronic xerostomia through the use of salivary substitutes and by stimulating salivary flow usually offer only temporary relief from dryness. Nevertheless, appropriate management of patients with xerostomia requires that those patients whose salivary flow can be increased by means of sialagogues be distinguished from those patients whose salivary flow cannot be stimulated, or whose flow is insufficiently stimulated.14 Patient response can be tested with the use of a mechanical (paraffin chewing) or a gustatory (citric acid) stimulant.15 The placement of citric acid crystals or a 2% citric acid solution in the mouth will stimulate demonstrable salivary flow within a few minutes in responsive patients.12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> , <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Babcock wins Pounds 80m HK deal BABCOCK Energy, part of the UK's Babcock International Group, has won an Pounds 80m contract to supply heat-recovery steam generators for the new 2,400MW combined cycle gas turbine plant to be built at Black Point in Hong Kong. Babcock was awarded the contract by GEC Alsthom, which leads a consortium that is building the plant for Hong Kong's Castle Peak Power. Black Point will be one of the world's largest CCGT power stations. Heat-recovery steam generators are a crucial element in combined cycle power, as they use the energy from the hot gas turbine exhaust to generate steam, which in turn is used to drive steam turbines. Babcock said its advanced production technology at its Renfrew factory in Scotland helped it win contracts against international competition.</p>

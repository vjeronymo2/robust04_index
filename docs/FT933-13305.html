			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Heartache for Boots Now that Boots' wheezing pharmaceuticals strategy has finally collapsed, the company cannot avoid questions about the future of its drugs division. To put it at its highest, there has only ever been a tenuous connection between ethical pharmaceuticals research and retailing. Contract manufacturing and over-the-counter drugs may have a role in sustaining Boots, but any serious ambitions in new drug development seem to have expired along with Manoplax. Whether Boots' management can now summon the will to make a graceful exit is, however, another question. The board has a rigorous appraisal system for businesses, yet that process has not so far persuaded it to dump Ward White elephants such as Do It All. Even if it decides on a managed withdrawal, the route is uncertain. Demerging ethical drugs would have the advantage of putting its value in the hands of shareholders. There might, however, be difficulty in deciding just which assets should go into the demerged company. Selling the division to a larger drugs player would dilute earnings and raise worries about how the management would spend the proceeds. Shareholders have not yet forgotten how much value went west with the Ward White bid. Putting capital to work is a question for the group anyway, since the company's drive for cash may leave it with net cash this year. Currently the management's answer is expansion of Halfords, and growth in Boots the Chemist. Yet in a tough market BTC's margins look vulnerable, nor has it yet launched a market share initiative to rival the Marks and Spencers 'outstanding value' campaign. Halfords somehow looks an unlikely ground for Boots to prove the critics wrong.</p>

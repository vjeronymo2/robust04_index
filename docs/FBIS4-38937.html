			<p>BFN     [Text] In the first four months of this year the state  budget failed to receive about 300 million litas of planned  revenue. This was announced at a news conference today by  Bagaciunas, head of a branch at the Ministry of Finance's budget  department. The news conference was also attended by Feliksas  Kolosauskas, chairman of the Seimas budget and finance  committee, .    It is known that the approved national budget for this year  totals 4.3 billion litas. Attempts are being made to compensate  the deficit by borrowing from other funds and structures. Among  others, the head of the budget branch mentioned the state  privatization fund. The government is borrowing from the  commercial banks in Lithuania, too. The Ministry of Finance has  taken a short term loan of 15 million litas at a 60 percent  annual interest. According to Bagaciunas, an agreement was  signed recently on a short-term loan of 20 million litas.    Because of this deficit, planned expenditure must be limited  in the budget, too: wages, pensions, and grants. According to  Bagaciunas, there will be spheres of priority to which the  budget funds will be directed first of all.    The branch chief at the ministry's budget department is  pinning hopes on Value Added Tax [VAT]. With the help of this  tax, the Ministry of Finance expects to obtain about 150 million  litas this year.</p>

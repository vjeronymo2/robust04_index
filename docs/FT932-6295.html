			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (5): Chance for a switch - Telecommunications WHEN UBS (formerly known as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew), the merchant bank, moved to the Broadgate development near Liverpool Street station, London, in 1989, its telecommunications and information technology department had 20 months to prepare for the move, writes Mark Newman. So crucial are telecommunications to the modern-day business that a company move needs years of planning to ensure that the full range of voice, data, public and private telecommunications services continues to function smoothly during and after the relocation. An interruption to service - what the industry calls an outage - can cost tens of millions of pounds, even if service is resumed after only a few hours. Ms Sandy Malone is head of BT's Business Movers Programme - a team set up last year to look after the needs of customers who are planning relocations. BT allocates a project manager to a company planning to relocate, whose role ranges from providing expert advice and taking instructions from the client to masterminding and managing the project. BT, for example, managed the installation of telecommunications systems for Nissan UK at its Tyneside car plants. It has also managed a relocation for British Airways. Some companies outsource their moves to third parties, such as Andersen Consulting, because they do not want to be tied exclusively to BT or Mercury. At UBS, the in-house telecommunications and IT team managed the move itself. 'BT and Mercury were involved only on the periphery,' says Mr Graham Marriner, UBS director of communications at the time of the move. The main reason for keeping it in-house was that UBS had a chance to reappraise its telecommunications services and network strategy. Before the move, UBS was predominantly a BT customer but thereafter, it handed over most of its outgoing traffic to Mercury, keeping BT largely for back-up purposes. Nearly all large companies buy both public and private network services from BT and Mercury, both to encourage the two operators to compete on price and quality, and to provide a back-up facility in case of technical difficulties. But because switching to Mercury for incoming calls means having to change telephone numbers, many companies keep BT for incoming calls, and use Mercury for outgoing traffic. UBS would have had to change telephone numbers anyway. Its move involved bringing seven separate London offices under one roof and on to the same number. Switching to a new Mercury number, therefore, was no more of a problem than taking a new BT number. More than 70 per cent of the company's traffic now goes by Mercury. Mr Graham Marriner reckons that the move resulted in 20 per cent savings in annual telephone bills. This is partly due to the switch to Mercury. The Cable &amp; Wireless company has always been cheaper than BT for long-distance and international services, although the gap has closed over the last two years since BT introduced bulk discount schemes. BT's discounts packages Option 40, Option 50, Option 70 and Option 2000  - provide reductions on basic charges in return for additional quarterly payments. The higher the quarterly payment, the greater the discount on calls. Even with the discounts, however, Mercury remains on average 9 per cent cheaper than BT, according to the 1993 Octagon Guide to Telecommunications Tariffs, the independent price guide. And Mercury has responded to BT's packages by introducing its own discount scheme, the Frequent Caller Programme. As well as the savings from switching to Mercury, UBS managed to cut its phone bill by re-evaluating its use of private circuits. It replaced thousands of analogue private circuits with higher capacity digital circuits which, when broken down into individual voice and data channels, work out much cheaper. About 60 per cent of companies that relocate use it as an opportunity to re-evaluate their telecommunications strategy. This can mean switching from BT to Mercury, like UBS or vice versa. But not all companies want to shake up their internal systems, and BT is careful not to impose new services on its customers. 'Sometimes people get sentimental about their old equipment,' says Ms Malone. Most large companies plan their moves three to four years in advance, and give themselves plenty of time to arrange for the installation of telephone systems. But this is not always true of small to medium-sized companies. 'When people relocate, they often don't think about the time it takes to sort out telecommunications requirements. They forget to call the telephone company until very late,' says Ms Malone.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading UK actuary in talks on a US alliance: Watson move to strengthen international service R Watson and Sons, Britain's leading actuarial consulting firm, is in talks about 'an alliance' with US-based benefit consultants Wyatt and Co in a bid to strengthen Watson's service to its increasingly multinational clientele. A spokesman for Watson yesterday confirmed that discussions are going on but said 'they relate to an alliance, not to a merger or a takeover'. Senior partners are discussing what form the alliance should take and a formal announcement is expected next week. The move reflects the increasingly international nature of leading UK clients which are acquiring or being acquired by overseas companies. 'Increasingly businesses are multinational and they want to manage their employee liabilities from the core,' said one senior actuary involved in the talks. Also, clients are seeking other benefit consultancy services, such as the design of remuneration packages, which go beyond Watson's pension fund consulting expertise. An outright acquisition of Watson, valued by industry sources at Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m, could make millionaires out of several of its 94 partners. However, industry sources said that some of Watson's most senior partners, while anxious to broaden the firm's international consulting capacity, want to maintain its independence. 'Several of them have been going around saying 'Over my dead body',' said one actuary familiar with the talks. Watson becomes the third - and the largest - of the UK actuarial consulting firms to seek a link with a large US company in the past year. Noble Lowndes was acquired by insurance brokers Sedgewick late last year while US-based insurance brokers Alexander and Alexander acquired Clay and Partners in a deal estimated at Pounds 20m. Wyatt and Co, which is organised as a Delaware-based company whose shares are owned by its 3,700 employees, has a leading presence in the US. It specialises not only in pension consulting but in a broad range of employee benefit and pay packages. It also has a leading market share in the Australian, Hong Kong and Japanese markets. However, it has very few blue chip UK corporate clients. Watson, with 700 employees, has a commanding presence in the UK market where it acts as actuarial consultant to 40 of the 100 top pension schemes. However, despite a string of offices in Europe and Asia, it has little genuine international capacity.</p>

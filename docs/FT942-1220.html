			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Go-ahead likely for European atom-smasher Europe is on the brink of building the world's most powerful atom-smasher. The council of Cern, the European particle physics laboratory near Geneva, yesterday voiced strong support for going ahead with the Large Hadron Collider, which will hurl atomic nuclei together at close to the speed of light. The LHC will recreate the conditions existing a millionth of a millionth of a second after the Big Bang that created our universe. Two of the 19 Cern members, the UK and Germany, blocked the final go-ahead as they were not satisfied with the financial arrangements for the SFr2.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn) project. They want France and Switzerland - the countries that would derive most economic benefit from Cern, as host states - to provide extra funds. But council delegates expressed confidence that the budgetary issues could be settled quickly and the LHC finally approved later this summer. Mr Hubert Curien, Cern's chairman, said the French and Swiss governments had given 'very encouraging' signs that they would increase their support. Cern members also expect non-European countries - notably the US, Japan, Russia, Canada and India - to make substantial contributions, in return for their scientists working on LHC experiments. After the cancellation last October of the planned Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) US Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in Texas, Cern has emerged as the undisputed global centre for high-energy physics. Ms Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, is expected to propose measures to Congress early next month for mitigating the effects of the SSC cancellation on US physicists, through increased international collaboration. Cern officials believe that the US could contribute several hundred million dollars to the LHC. There are two reasons why the LHC would be much cheaper than the SSC. First, it will be squeezed into an existing tunnel - a ring 27km in diameter beneath the Jura foothills - that was built in the 1980s for Cern's current accelerator, LEP. A new 87km tunnel was being dug for the SSC. Second, the LHC will be less powerful than the SSC would have been. However, it will pack several times more energy into its collisions than LEP or the atom-smashers currently operating in the US - enough, scientists say, to discover several fundamental facts about the forces and particles that determine the nature of the universe. The LHC's most important single job will be to provide evidence to clear up the mystery of mass - what gives fundamental particles their mass and why some weigh so much more than others.</p>

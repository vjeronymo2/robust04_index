			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trading in Continental Air shares suspended THE American Stock Ex-change yesterday agreed to suspend trading in the ordinary shares of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since late 1990. Along with the ordinary shares, the public market in two debt issues will also be suspended, all with effect from this morning. Five other debt issues will continue to trade. The announcement comes after wrangling between the exchange and Continental, which has said it is anxious to protect investors. The move also highlights the difficulties in deciding whether to maintain a public market for a company's securities once it has gone into bankruptcy. Continental, for example, has filed a reorganisation plan which, if accepted by creditors and the bankruptcy courts, would render the ordinary shares worthless. Yet its common stock has continued to change hands, and still enjoys speculative flurries. Nor is Continental a one-off. A small British investor lost thousands of pounds by buying shares in Pam Am when the international carrier filed for bankruptcy in January 1991. Nine months later, Pam Am - like Continental - filed a reorganisation plan which would have eliminated the ordinary equity (although, in this case, the airline eventually folded). The American Stock Exchange, which is smaller than the New York Stock Exchange, said that 11 of the 850 companies listed with it were in Chapter 11. It admits there is no standard policy towards trading in bankrupt companies' securities - but justifies this on the grounds that every corporate situation is unique, and judgments need to be made on a case by case basis. One problem is the length of time that a bankruptcy can last - allowing for significant jockeying between creditors and changes in underlying trading fortunes. The Continental board, however, has now formally authorised the filing of an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to 'delist' its common stock. This is due to be lodged with the SEC shortly.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Bomb explodes in Tube station A BOMB believed to have been planted by the IRA exploded at Hampstead Tube station yesterday evening. It caused disruption to London Underground services and subsequent street closures by the police led to severe local traffic congestion, Jimmy Burns writes. British Transport Police said the explosion occurred at platform level at the bottom of a shaft. It happened within 30 minutes of a coded telephone warning to the Press Association news agency by a man claiming to represent the IRA. There were no reports of casualties. The incident represented a departure in the tactics being adopted by the IRA in its pre-Christmas campaign. Previous IRA attacks affecting the Underground system in recent months have taken place outside stations or have involved small incendiary devices placed in carriages before passengers have boarded trains. Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch and the security service MI5 have launched anoperation aimed at arresting an estimated three IRA units that are believed to be operating on the mainland.</p>

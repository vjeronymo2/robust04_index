			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TIGER INN WON'T ADMIT TIGRESSES  </P> <P> The last men-only dining club at Princeton University has voted to stay that  way despite a state Supreme Court order requiring it to admit female members.  </P> <P> The vote Tuesday by undergraduate members of the Tiger Inn also reverses the  club's decision earlier this year to admit women and end a 100-year-old  tradition.  </P> <P> "We all believe the right to freedom of association is an important and  fundamental aspect of life at any age," said Stockton S. Williams,  undergraduate president of the Tiger Inn.  </P> <P> In February, the Tiger Inn voted to admit women. However, club rules say women  can be admitted only if undergraduate members vote them in for two consecutive  school years.  </P> <P> The club said the earlier vote "was taken under severe pressure with pickets,  bonfires, rallies and other interferences."  </P></p>

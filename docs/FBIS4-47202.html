			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Andreyeva under the rubric </F> "Viewpoint": "Patches on the Wet Asphalt. Untimely Reflections  Evoked by L. Kravchuk's Visit to Lvov"]    [Text] To exploit the theme of painting the grass green and  other "Potemkinian" actions in preparation for the arrival of  important guests is banal to say the least. And to clean  house--your own personal one or our larger one--if someone has  been invited there is nice, and the citizens of Lvov could only  stand to gain from building up a pleasant square and cleaning up  the area near the Grushevskiy Monument. It is simply that I  recalled a line which seemed symbolic. They patched up the  asphalt on the streets through which the important guest was to  pass. They put hot patches on the pavement which was wet after  the rain. Specialists say that this method of mending is  pointless, because it will not last. The same sense of  necessity-hopelessness arose after the festive "commitment" of  the Halychyna to presidential candidate Kravchuk.    Gathered in the Polytechnical Institute, as they say in such  cases, were the community of the oblast. The main thing heard  there was an unequivocal promise from the lips of the  president's representative, Stepan Davymuka: The authorities,  the political organizations, and the majority of the population  of the Lvov area support presidential candidate Leonid  Makarovych. No objections followed. Moreover, one of the most  influential, as far as influence on the rank-and-file voter  goes, forces, the Greco-Catholic church, through the lips of  Bishop of Zborovskiy Mikhail, declared support for Kravchuk.  True, a veiled condition was imposed--that he complete the  process of rehabilitation of the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic  Church, which had been crucified and banned by Stalin. The year  on the calendar is not 1989, and it will not be difficult to  meet that condition.    Kravchuk was never one of the favorites in the Lvov area.  Moreover, Lvov politicians seem to have gathered points for the  opposition. And a week or two ago the breakdown looked  different: They were clearly inclined to support I. Plyushch.  When the crowd flowed out of the Polytechnical Institute onto  the street, I forced my way through to the chief of the Lvov  Rukh organization, Yuriy Klyuchkovskiy, to ask him a question:  In his view, did the president's representative have the right  to speak so unequivocally "on behalf of and on instructions  from" ? "Let me put it this way, he did not say anything so  terrible," Klyuchkovskiy answered. "Yes, Lvov Rukh members  support Kravchuk. This is in line with the opinion of the Rukh  high council: to make the decision independently in the local  areas concerning support of the candidate for the post of  president. To adopt a decision which will help block the  advancement of Kuchma and Moroz to the high position." The chief  of the secretariat of New Wave [preceding two words in Ukrainian  in original], Yuriy Shveda, put it this way: "We also support  Kravchuk. In opposition to Kuchma's pro-Russian position and  Moroz's pro-communist position, which are dangerous for Ukraine.  Incidentally, we are not withdrawing our complaints against the  current and potential president--failure to conduct economic  reforms and his personnel policy. But Plyushch? Well, anything  can happen, but in our view, Ivan Stepanovych lost the first  round in parliament. We see a real standoff between Kuchma and  Kravchuk."    I wanted very much to learn the opinion about what was  taking  place of Halychina's favorite, the clear winner in the last  presidential elections in the West, the eternal opponent and  severe critic of Kravchuk, V. Chornovol [as published]. I met  him on an empty street in the center--everyone had gone to the  Grushevskiy Monument, where the president was just about to  appear. Vyacheslav Maksimovych, judging from everything, was  headed there too. I am probably exaggerating and transferring my  creative-opposition sadness to others. But....on this street,  swept clean for the holiday for "welcoming the sovereign," I did  not approach this exhausted person. Our conversation took place  later, in the evening, in the packed theater imeni Mariya  Zankovetskaya.    But for now....you know, it is possible to get into a  "shotgun wedding" in all kinds of ways. But the Lvov authorities  were actually gleefully kicking up their heels. Respect for the  legitimate president is one thing, but the phrase spoken even  after the business conversations, the phrase of that same S.  Davymuka, in my opinion, caused even the main hero to cringe.  And so with a coquettish grin and almost a tear of emotion: "We  give you, Leonid Makarovych, the strictest possible instruction:  Win, please!"    The people love holidays. And "sovereigns." It is easy to  forgive them everything--for the holiday. The people gathered  there to see the president's earlobe, his shoe. The sun was  shining. It bathed the monument to the tragic president, who was  destroyed by the UNR [Ukrainian People's Republic]--Mikhail  Grushevskiy. The chorus sang "Chervona Kalina." The president  listened. On these cobblestones these same Lvov residents who  are actually and naturally devoted to the idea of state  independence five years ago were beaten with the militia's clubs  for singing "Chervona Kalina." At that time Kravchuk was  battling it out with Rukh for the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of Ukraine.    Enough sentiments. Leonid Kravchuk can count on the support  and love of the people of Halychyna if only because he has  unequivocally declared and repeated in Lvov: There is no turning  back. Ukraine can only be independent, only an integrated state.  Politicians, including those in the opposition, also like the  predictability of the actions of this president: A known  "disease" is always better than an unknown one. Here are the  words of Vyacheslav Chornovol [as published]: "The situation has  developed in such a way that it is necessary to support  Kravchuk. But not without reservation, it is necessary to make  several ultimatums. I am afraid of having Kuchma as president.  He wants to make us subordinate to the military-industrial  complex not only of Ukraine, but also of the former Union. Yes,  I am also afraid of having Kravchuk as president, but less so.  We already know which "buttons" to push in order to influence  this president in one way or another. But as Chornovil [as  published] the voter, I give my vote to Volodymyr Lanovyy."    There is no point in listing past sins. What do they have to  do with present sins? Kuchma, of course, would put Ukraine in  the hammerlock of the "older brother." The socialist Moroz would  put us back where we were before. In addition to everything  else, neither one is likely to lead the movement along the path  of radical economic reforms.    And Leonid Kravchuk? Let us hope that he will maintain  relative political stability, that through his flexibility and a  certain amount of international prestige, he will be able to  preserve the civil peace in Ukraine and peace on its borders.  Perhaps he will be able to be a candidate who is equally  acceptable to the East and West. And what about the reforms?  What about the team of those who could conduct the reforms? What  about the need to settle (judging from everything, with jobs)  with the left and the nomenklatura? After all, an effective  opposition is being formed, it will roll up its sleeves and  start looking for the "buttons"....    There was another interesting pre-holiday incident. Two days  before the monument was uncovered, at about 12 midnight, I saw  the sculpture bare, without its traditional cover, and an  alarmed group of militia officers on the square at night. Toward  morning the monument was covered as it should be. I do not know  how reliable this is, but an authorized person told me in a  personal conversation: That night the cover was simply ripped  off.    Aleksandr Blok. The poem "The Twelve." The year 1917.  Remember the text? The old woman is standing in front of an  immense banner and grieving: Many mothers were tormented,  saying, "So many foot bindings could be made for the boys....But  everyone was unshod and unclothed."</p>

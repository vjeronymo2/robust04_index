			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Compromise in Italian telecoms row Italian ministers yesterday attempted to defuse a row threatening to delay liberalisation of the country's mobile telephone sector with a compromise response to demands from Telecom Italia, the state-controlled operator. The committee of ministers proposed a reduction of the fee Telecom Italia pays to the Italian government, and said the company should have the freedom to set prices on the existing analogue mobile phone network, over which it has a monopoly. But the ministers said implementation of the new initiatives should be delayed, to prevent Telecom Italia exploiting its position and hampering the development of a competing digital mobile phone network. Stet, the state-controlled parent company of Telecom Italia, welcomed the solution as 'satisfactory and reasonable'. However, Omnitel-Pronto Italia, the international consortium which will build and manage the new digital mobile phone network, remained silent. Omnitel-Pronto Italia is headed by Olivetti, the Italian computer group, and includes US and Scandinavian partners. The consortium may well be concerned about a clause which allows for more flexible analogue tariffs in the period before full liberalisation. Omnitel had earlier expressed its concern that Telecom Italia would be able to take advantage of its head-start in the mobile phone market. It already has more than 2m subscribers to its analogue network. Telecom Italia has also built a digital network, but it was afraid that, with freedom to set prices, Omnitel-Pronto Italia would be able to poach analogue customers from the state-controlled company. Mr Francesco Chirichigno, managing director of Telecom Italia, yesterday signed the joint convention governing digital mobile telephone services, which was signed by Omnitel-Pronto Italia two weeks ago. Telecom Italia had withheld its signature pending a satisfactory answer to its demands. Full liberalisation of tariffs on the analogue mobile telephone network will only come into effect 18 months after Omnitel-Pronto Italia has begun operating. The gradual reduction of the fee paid by Telecom Italia for its monopoly over a range of services will begin after 1996. The row between Omnitel-Pronto Italia and Telecom Italia has taken a dangerous political turn in the last two weeks, with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, and his supporters publicly attacking Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti. Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group was part of the consortium defeated by Omnitel-Pronto Italia in the contest for the second digital mobile phone licence.</p>

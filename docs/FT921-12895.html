			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Politics comes to the Finanzplatz: The German government is out to shake up the country's fragmented capital markets In the space of a few days over last weekend, the German Finance Ministry published a project for sweeping reforms of the country's securities and money markets, and the Frankfurt stock exchange board aired plans to introduce computerised trading. Then Chancellor Helmut Kohl, no less, popped up in the city championing finance minister Mr Theo Waigel's reforms, computers for all, and nominating Frankfurt as the natural home of the European central bank. It was, said a man from the Finance Ministry, 'probably a coincidence'. Probably hogwash. Nothing much goes on in German economic life that is not carefully programmed. And what happened, suddenly last weekend, was that the government took the country's financial establishment by the scruff of the neck and gave it a thorough shaking. 'Nothing has happened for 30 years,' says Mr Paul Berwein, a leading Bavarian broker. 'But now everything is in the process of change.' Undoubtedly correct. Behind all three initiatives lies a concerted drive to get German markets out of their provincial backyards and up to the technological and service standards of competing financial centres in New York, London and Tokyo. The campaign slogan is 'Finanzplatz Deutschland' and the campaign base has moved from the boardrooms of banks and bourses all over Germany, to the former barracks which serves as a Finance Ministry in Bonn. Over the past two years, Finance Ministry officials from Mr Gert Haller's finance and credit department have listened to all the interested parties: banks, traders, investors, lawyers and politicians. Following a round-table session last October, Mr Haller selected from the disordered debate the elements which he considered crucial for the development of Finanzplatz Deutschland, bundled them up with a few ideas of his own, patched them together with a package of proposed legal amendments . . . and went public. Chancellor Kohl's immediate endorsement of the strategy gives Mr Waigel a formidable ally in the task of pushing it through. The politicians have now taken matters in hand after years of squabbling among the country's eight provincial bourses, which typically see any attempt at change as a threat to their supposed independence, an assault on German federalism, or further encroachment by the Frankfurt bully-boys, who already account for 70 per cent of securities turnover in Germany. The government view is that it is high time a more mature debate got under way. As Mr Waigel's paper said: 'As the third largest industrial nation in the world, Germany needs a fully-developed financial market.' It pointed to reforms in the US, Britain and Tokyo, and implied that unless Germany's financial industries kept pace they would lose more domestic business to outsiders. The fragmented and cumbersome nature of German markets and systems hampered participation in the development of global dealings. The country could be disadvantaged in the single European market and would be unable to assume its 'predestined pivotal role' in the financing of economic development in central and eastern Europe. On this last point it warned: 'The competition is already in position'. The ministry's strategy for re-arming Finanzplatz Deutschland comprises: Legal amendments to give investment trusts greater flexibility. These include permission for them to issue money market funds, and approval for securities lending. Supervision of securities markets by a national, self-regulatory authority, reinforced with new laws and sanctions for breaches of rules. Insider dealing, for example, would be punishable by up to two years' jail. Improvements in investor protection and information, and greater transparency of markets. Political support for the introduction of new technology, notably computerised dealing. Backing for an industry project for the establishment by the eight regional bourses of a Deutsche Borse AG, a company which would provide central services for all participants. All the necessary legal changes should be completed, and decisions taken on computerised trading and the Deutsche Borse, by the end of the year, the paper says. Implementation of the plan will serve two main functions: modernising antiquated market structures and plugging the gaping holes in the existing regulatory system. At present regulation of the eight bourses is split between state governments, the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in Berlin, and market participants. Confusing and opaque, this system's value and efficiency has been brought openly into question by several recent scandals. The Frankfurt exchange is currently investigating alleged insider trading at Deutsche Bank; the Finance Ministry in Hesse, home state to the Frankfurt financial services industry, is probing certain market practices, while the city's tax men are grilling 400 traders at leading banks and brokers over alleged tax evasion. Nothing much there to match the big securities scandals in Tokyo, New York and London. But bankers and the government agree that their collective impact is politically embarrassing and damaging to the industry's reputation. Moreover, the existing fractured structures mean that the country has no central, liquid stock market. 'Most of Germany's major stocks are quoted on all eight exchanges,' says Mr Berwein. 'There are different prices in Bremen, Stuttgart and Berlin. Arbitrageurs operate in between and what liquidity there is is divided between all eight. This is not to the advantage of the issuer or the investors.' The present federal structure, as one senior Finance Ministry official points out, is almost impossibly complicated: the country's stock exchanges are governed through inter-state treaties between all 16 German Lander, even those without stock exchanges, and 'too much argument and long-winded voting processes' for even the smallest adjustments. Mr Christian Strenger, managing director of DWS Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Wertpapiersparen, a Deutsche Bank investment management subsidiary with some DM50bn under its control, says: 'Looking in from the outside the existing system is not easy to understand. It is beautiful in some ways, but it has laborious ways of working and foreigners have a tough time understanding what is going on.' Mr Berwein, whose brokerage is part of the London-based Warburg group, agrees: 'It is lunatic for the supervision of a modern stock exchange to be handled in this way.' One result of this lunacy, according to local securities industry practitioners, has been the export of a big slice of the German securities market. Foreign investors seeking D-Mark assets, and put off by high costs and the intricacies of the eight-exchange German market, have turned to offshore sources. A large proportion of the trade in shares of the 30 biggest German companies is handled through Seaq International, a London-based telephone dealing operation. In 1990, for example, 16 per cent of all trade in shares of the Bayer chemical group was carried out through Seaq. A drop last year to 14 per cent, is attributed by bankers to an earlier welcome initiative from Bonn: the scrapping of stock exchange turnover tax at the start of last year. Bankers have warmly welcomed Mr Waigel's new package. Mr Fritz Losukow, a director of Commerzbank, for example, proclaims that it is 'sensational' that the government has at last taken the initiative and given more support to the capital markets. Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, a main board director at Dresdner Bank, is just as keen: 'We are very happy . . . the activities of German capital markets have never before been put in the limelight by the government,' he says. 'Recent scandals could have been avoided if we had had insider trading laws. With voluntary controls you have no weapon to hand when you come to a problem.' It is in part the scandals that have brought Germany's eminently conservative banking community to the point of favouring central regulation and a more powerful central organisation for the stock market. Another important factor is the realisation that European Community regulations on the free movement of capital are inevitable. Germany also needs new instruments and structures if it is not to surrender its role as a conduit of capital to east Europe and others. And then there are the immense capital demands for the reconstruction of the former DDR. But will the proposals stick? There are certainly some little local problems to overcome. In the past, for example, the independent Bundesbankhas opposed investment trusts being able to issue money market funds, on the grounds that they undermine its minimum reserve policy. Ministry officials claim the central bank is coming to recognise the need for more flexibility in capital markets. Commercial bankers, meanwhile, say that the Bundesbank has not changed minimum reserve requirements for years, and that they are obsolete. 'Money market funds are something the German market has been desperate for,' one said. A far greater obstacle is likely to be the entrenched opposition in the Lander to any loss of control over regulation. And since the opposition SPD governs most of the federal states, and controls the Bundesrat (the upper house through which all legislation must pass), Mr Waigel is not going to have an easy time. The Hesse Land government, for one, is adamant that it will oppose centralisation. 'We want responsibility for regulating bourses to remain at state level,' insists one local Finance Ministry official. 'We are not prepared to enter into any compromise which will reduce our authority.' But Hesse and the other states have already given much away. They weakened their hand - probably fatally - in 1990 when they asked the government to represent federal interests at the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, the world regulators' club. Mr Waigel also has a powerful and persuasive ally in the banks, which often have strong regional links. Many are part-owned by state governments, and are regarded as valued financial advisers as well as being sources of capital. It may thus take longer than the 10 months Mr Waigel has given himself to see his proposals in place, but most of the pointers indicate that Finanzplatz Deutschland will come into being sometime next year. Where will that leave the regional stock exchanges. A senior Finance Ministry official suggests they might keep some functions such as control of issuing licences to traders and firms. The ministry view is that their proper job is to act as gateways into capital markets for new flotations, or as specialists in particular regional industries. 'The regional bourses must take responsibility for their own competitiveness,' says the ministry paper. 'On the other hand, Finanzplatz Deutschland, if it wants to compete with the great exchanges of the world, needs a strong, internationally competitive central bourse (Deutsche Borse AG) at its disposal. In this sense, 'stock exchange federalism' must be further developed.' There is, in short, an unmistakeable head of political steam behind the current reform effort. 'The government's approach is extremely determined and this speaks for a quick implementation of the proposals,' says Mr Strenger of DWS. 'The minister is not equivocating, he is saying exactly what should be done.'

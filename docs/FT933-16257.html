			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: Data may back German rate cut - Economics A string of important economic figures in Germany will coincide with this week's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. The statistics, expected to highlight considerable domestic weakness in Germany, will back up the Bundesbank's decision to shave interest rates last week. In spite of the latest move by the German authorities, high European interest rates will be one of the issues preoccupying the prime ministers and finance ministers meeting in Tokyo. Even after the German cut, rates in continental Europe are perceived as being too high for this point in the business cycle and the US in particular has been urging Germany to ease monetary conditions. West German manufacturing orders for May are forecast to be roughly unchanged on the previous month, while jobs data will probably show another big jump in unemployment. Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London, believes there is a good chance that this week's data will indicate that the worst of Germany's recession is over. 'A fairly convincing case can now be made for suggesting that the rate of decline of west Germany's industrial production is slowing significantly. But I believe it is too early to suggest that industrial production may be rising on a trend basis,' she said. There are few figures in the UK this week, but the Treasury's panel of wise men issues its second report on the progress of the economy today. Consumer credit figures, also out today, will give some indication of consumers' willingness to borrow now that interest rates have come down. It is a relatively busy week for figures in the US. Car and truck sales in June are expected to have risen at roughly the same pace as in May. Consumer credit figures are forecast to confirm that consumer indebtedness as a proportion of income remains close to an all-time high. The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a financial information company.

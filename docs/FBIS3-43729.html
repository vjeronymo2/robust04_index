He  is the former agriculture and livestock minister. [passage  omitted]    After his election, our colleague, Celcius Nsengiyunva,  asked  the president about the meaning of the election and his  priorities to get the country of its crisis.    [Begin recording] [Ntaryamira] I am happy, just as all  Burundians are happy at this moment. I am happy with the step  we have attained in our efforts, which are still under way, to  restore peace and security to our country. [passage omitted]    [Nsengiyunva] Your Excellency, what will your priorities be?    [Ntaryamira] The first job in the coming days will be to  continue making peace among Burundians by continuing the work of  restoring the peace and security that have been interrupted in  our country. We must continue the work of restoring  understanding between Burundian brothers.    The next priority will be to return home those who have fled  their homes internally and abroad. Then we will place emphasis  on educating people about respect for human rights, which have  been trampled on recently. Many people have died, so this is a  very important job that we will stress. Other things to be done  soon will be to rebuild what has been destroyed. This is a lot  to do. You know well that many houses were demolished. [Words  indistinct] bridges, and many other things were destroyed during  the events. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'TREK' STAR A SINGER DEEP DOWN  </P> <P> Nichelle Nichols says she wasn't particularly interested when her friend Gene  Roddenberry insisted that she audition for a part in his new science fiction  television series.  </P> <P> That was in 1966.  </P> <P> Even now, Nichols considers "Star Trek" to be "just an interruption in my  singing career, a nice interlude."  </P> <P> Still, though Nichols is best known for her role as Lt. Uhura, she has never  abandoned her musical career. Her one-woman show, "Reflections," pays tribute  to musical legends.  </P> <P> Nichols, born in Chicago in 1936, was discovered by Duke Ellington, toured with  Lionel Hampton and danced with Sammy Davis Jr. Eventually, she was playing  successful engagements in European nightclubs.  </P> <P> Next thing she knew, she was decoding subspace communiques from Starfleet  Command.  </P> <P> But Trekkies need not fear. She and the old Enterprise crew "are still family,"  she says, and she is looking forward to "Star Trek VI."  </P></p>

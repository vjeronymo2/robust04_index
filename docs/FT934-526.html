			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing to crow about Sir, Your choice of cock-fighting for an article was disturbing ('A life of sex, food and fighting', December 18). It gave a favourable, even enthusiastic, description of the 'sport'. If your writer had expressed misgivings, or attempted to explain why such practices are banned in civilised countries, there might have been some mitigating circumstance. To describe death in 30 seconds as lacking in cruelty and comparable with a commercial poultry operation, shows a serious lack, or deliberate denial, of knowledge of both physiology and the poultry industry. Apart from the fact that death is not always instantaneous, additional pre-fight preparation by live plucking of leg feathers and other niceties were overlooked. The issue is not only that of needless cruelty to a sentient being, but the consequent brutalising of the participating audience, including, I suggest, your writer. The UK has a much respected image for its positive attitudes to animal welfare. Your author does nothing to strengthen this perception and can only tend to make it difficult for those of us who work in the international livestock and animal health markets. Bruce V Jones, managing director, Vivash-Jones International, Down Ampney, Cirencester, Gloucestershire GL7 5QW</p>

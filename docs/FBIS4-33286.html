			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Housing Institute has issued a  resolution regulating the donations and swaps [donaciones y  permutas] of houses to avoid illegal actions intended to deride  the current legislation. The most frequent illegal action is  that of buying and selling houses through donations and swaps.  The donation of houses among former married couples [ex  conyugues] is now regulated. The new resolution of 1994  regulates cases of donations among former married couples: The  transfer will not be authorized if they had no offspring and  were not married two years. The matter will be submitted to the  president of the National Housing Institute for consideration  when the donations are made to legal entities.    The inheritance of houses through wills:    The new resolution of the National Housing Institute states  that in all cases of legal entities inheriting houses through  wills, the acting notary public will obtain the authorization  from the president of the entity. The specialized sectors of  the housing system will receive and diligently investigate  possible illegal actions intended to deride the current  legislation. A complete report will be made when the  information received contains enough elements to suggest that an  illegal transfer of housing is taking place. The provincial  housing authorities will immediately take up the matter and will  coordinate with the proper departments of the Justice Ministry,  State Attorney's Office, and the Interior Ministry.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOROUGHBRED RACING;  </P> <P> EXCAVATE MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF  </P> <P> Excavate's odds in the Kentucky Derby future book crashed before some of the  Las Vegas casinos learned how to spell his name.  </P> <P> Probably because of a slip of the tongue by his trainer, Charlie Whittingham,  the 2-year-old colt had been listed as "Excavator" by at least two Nevada race  books.  </P> <P> Minutes after Whittingham's Golden Pheasant had won this year's Arlington  Million, the trainer was unexpectedly asked on national television about his  Kentucky Derby prospects. Whittingham stumbled over the horse's name, it came  out "Excavator," and that's the way it stayed in Las Vegas until recently.  </P> <P> But Excavate blew his cover last Saturday at Hollywood Park, running for the  first time and winning at six furlongs by five lengths. It was a debut that  gave Whittingham no reason to disbelieve that Excavate might complete the hat  trick that Ferdinand and Sunday Silence started for the 77-year-old trainer at  Churchill Downs.  </P> <P> Now, based on his one victory in a maiden race, Excavate's odds have dropped  from 30-1 to 3-1 at the Frontier's race book, making him the second choice for  next year's Derby, behind the 5-2 Fly So Free, winner of the Breeders' Cup  Juvenile at Belmont Park a month ago and a cinch to be voted the Eclipse Award  as divisional champion.  </P> <P> The Derby is five months and a jillion land mines away, but if Excavate would  give Whittingham that third sniff of the roses, he would be the most expensive  horse ever to win the race. As a yearling, the son of Mr. Prospector and Anne  Campbell, the Never Bend mare who also produced Desert Wine, was sold for $1.1  million at a Keeneland auction.  </P> <P> Wayne Lukas was the underbidder on Excavate, with Whittingham buying the  handsome colt for Dick Duchossois, the owner of Arlington International  Racecourse.  </P> <P> After the sale, Arthur Hancock, Excavate's breeder, bought 12% back from  Duchossois and Whittingham has become a 10% owner.  </P> <P> Like Whittingham, Hancock became a Derby mainstay in the last decade. He was a  partner in Gato Del Sol, who won the race in 1982. Then in 1989, Hancock,  Whittingham and another partner, Ernest Gaillard, bottled the lightning with  Sunday Silence.  </P> <P> "Excavate is big-boned and tough," Hancock said. "I've liked the horse from the  time he was a foal. I think that running across those 100-acre fields we've got  at Stone Farm (in Paris, Ky.) has really helped him."  </P> <P> Hancock turns out his mares when they're just in foal, and one day a group of  them took off running across one of those large Stone Farm fields.  </P> <P> "They were running full out and Excavate was running right with them," Hancock  said. "At the end, he beat them. He reminded me of a silver bullet that day."  </P> <P> For a horse with such little experience, Excavate has already worked up a mound  of ballyhoo. He has twice been featured on national television, besides the  brief, muffled notice Whittingham gave him that day at Arlington.  </P> <P> "I told Charlie about this horse when (Excavate) was still a weanling," Hancock  said. "Another thing I like about him is that he's smart. This is a horse  that's got a world of sense. If everything goes right, he could really be  something."  </P> <P> Some trainers might be tempted to thrust Excavate into the $1-million Hollywood  Futurity a week from Sunday, but not Whittingham, who frequently doesn't run  his horses at all when they are 2-year-olds.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence raced for the first time on Oct. 30, 1988, and broke his maiden  in his next race, Nov. 13. He had run four times before his first stakes race,  which turned out to be a victory in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita in  March of 1989. He had run just six times going into the Derby.  </P> <P> And Ferdinand, the Derby winner in 1986, didn't win for the first time until  Nov. 3 of the previous year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> There's something odd about this Sunday's promotion at Hollywood Park. The  track is offering airplane trips for 100 fans to Las Vegas, where the winners  will spend three days at the Riviera Hotel and Casino. Does it make sense for a  track to send bettors someplace else to bet? Did Macy's tell Gimbels? What's  more, the Riviera isn't even among the numerous Nevada horse books that  co-mingle their bets with the mutuel pools at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Go and Go, the winner of the Belmont Stakes but a disappointment in the Travers  and the Breeders' Cup Classic since then, has drawn the outside post in a field  of eight in Saturday's $100,000 Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park. Rial,  winner of the Oak Tree Invitational and then disqualified after finishing first  in the Burke Handicap at Santa Anita, is the high weight with 122 pounds. He'll  be running on dirt for the first time in this country, with Jose Santos riding  for the first time. Kent Desormeaux will be riding Go and Go for the first  time. Also in the field is Pleasant Tap, third in this year's Kentucky Derby  and eighth in the Breeders' Cup Turf.  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, the leading money-winning jockey this year with a lead of about  $850,000 over Santos, will be riding Aksar Saturday in the $100,000 Bay Meadows  Derby. There will be betting on the race at Hollywood Park. . . . Jerry Bailey  regains the mount on Plenty of Grace for Sunday's $200,000 Matriarch. Bailey  had another commitment at Aqueduct the day Herb McCauley rode the filly to  victory in the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita. . . . Caliente, which has been  closed because of labor problems, will resume racing on Jan. 19.  </P></p>

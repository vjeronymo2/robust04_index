			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Players may strike for level football field: Jane Fuller reports on the clash over cash between players and the Premier League THIS afternoon as 500,000 recession-hit football fans tread their weekly escape route to the local ground, they might be wondering why players earning up to Pounds 3,000 a week are contemplating a strike. The answer is that their action would be one of the last Robin Hood-style gestures in a world where redistribution of wealth is in decline. If members of the Professional Footballers Association have voted to strike - the result should be announced on Monday - it will not be to get more pay. A 'yes' vote would be used by the PFA's leader, Mr Gordon Taylor, to try to get a minimum of Pounds 1.5m from the new Premier League's television honeypot. He insists that not a penny of that sum, which is twice the amount the PFA receives now, would go on increasing players' wages. It would be used to benefit all 2,500 players at the 92 English and Welsh clubs through funds for training, medical insurance and hardship. Although the issue does boil down to cash, Mr Taylor plugs the moral argument. 'The whole concept of a football league with so many clubs comes down to the distribution of money.' The Premier League, of which the PFA has always been suspicious, is the latest attempt by a minority of big clubs to keep more cash for themselves. Democracy has not suited the 22 clubs that are about to switch from Barclays League Division One to the Premier League. As one manager put it, the First Division, 'which has the gates, the money and the power', was being outvoted by the other divisions. The row about television fees has come to a head because of the Premier League launch and because ITV's four-year agreement with the Football League is coming to an end. This season, payments from ITV amounted to Pounds 14m, of which the PFA got 5 per cent. Estimates of the amount that the Premier League contract might be worth next season start at Pounds 18m, but club chairmen have their eyes on a rather larger sum. Mr Ron Noades, at Crystal Palace in south London, mentioned 'a minimum of Pounds 30m'. The pulling power is illustrated by the viewing figures: between 7m and 9m watch The Match on a Sunday afternoon and more than 13m watched Manchester United beat Barcelona in the European Cup Winners Cup last year. And that other ingredient for a rise in fees is also there: an auction. ITV's Pounds 18m opening bid is believed to have been topped by a joint approach to the Premier League from British Sky Broadcasting, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, and the BBC. When ITV won its contract to televise league and League Cup matches in 1988, there was a big increase in the annual payment from Pounds 3m to Pounds 11m, since raised through an inflation link. Mr Taylor may now be regretting the PFA's decision to waive its right to 10 per cent of the proceeds and settle instead for 5 per cent, although if Pounds 30m is the eventual fee and the PFA settles for Pounds 1.5m the rate stays the same. Even with Pounds 3m of annual payments promised to the present Divisions Two to Four, it will be a poor substitute for the present arrangement, which sees Pounds 10m a year distributed on a formula not based on TV appearances. But before the chairmen of the Premier League clubs are consigned to the role of Sheriff of Nottingham, the pressures on them have to be recognised. Mr Noades said the new deal might add Pounds 900,000 to Crystal Palace's income, not to be sneezed at when last year's total turnover was Pounds 6m. Of that, Pounds 2.8m went in players' wages. He thinks the club does well to cover the wage bill with gate receipts. This is a position envied by Palace's tenant at Selhurst Park, Wimbledon FC, which routinely sells players to stem its losses. On the capital spending side, clubs face a double bind: investment in players to stay in the Premier League and investment in their stadia to meet the Taylor Report's all-seater demands. It is a coincidence born of the election campaign that, just as the lower division clubs face up to a loss of television income, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, have said they will consider relaxing the all-seater requirement. The estimated cost to the 92 clubs was Pounds 360m, with much less than half coming from grants. This has led to a series of bond schemes to raise extra funds. These have angered supporters, particularly at West Ham. The London club is in danger of being relegated out of the Premier League reckoning. And that sobering thought helps to explain why the glamour players in the top division, whatever it is called, have sympathy for their brethren. As Mr Taylor points out, '65 per cent of Division One players started in the lower divisions and 95 per cent of them finish their playing careers or start in management there'. Ballot Box, Page 7</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Swallowing Popcorn - Gary Mead peers into the future with a trend spotting guru ANYONE who chooses to change their surname to Popcorn risks not being taken seriously. And if the first name name is Faith, and the business is commercial futurology, then surely all hope is lost? Not so fast. Faith Popcorn is the author of 'The Popcorn Report' which has sold 80,000 hardback copies in the US. Popcorn's marketing advisory service, 'BrainReserve', has been employed to spot consumer trends for almost 20 years for big-name clients such as American Express, AT&amp;T, Colgate-Palmolive, IBM, Philip Morris and Procter &amp; Gamble. Popcorn's book, now published in the UK*, is a distillation of her marketing gambits, a gaudy collection of invented terminology wrapping up both real and fool's gold. Stuart Bull, chief executive of the advertising agency KHBB (part of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group), says the book's 'good commonsense nuggets are heavily disguised by 'PopSpeak', the illusion that putting two words together and retaining their initial capitals gives a thought proprietary gravitas'. One of BrainReserve's formulations is 'Advernews: A future customised newspaper, printed off your home computer screen'. Others include 'Foodaceuticals: A new food industry . . . Food, beyond simple nourishment - with medicinal qualities . . .'; and 'Trendbending: The process of 'reshaping' a product, business, or idea to the trends . . .' According to Popcorn, the book deals not just with current fashions but also future spin-offs: 'It's designed to give you a quick picture of the future so you can understand your present. It's like driving around at night without your headlights on. We just turn the headlights on.' So what are some of her views of the future? She says that 'virtual reality', that form of computer technology which gives its user a three-dimensional feel, will displace traditional supermarket shopping. She believes that consumers are becoming so enraged with allegedly socially irresponsible companies that they will be drawn towards competitors which offer added values, such as a healthier 'corporate soul', meaning acknowledging mistakes and making themselves more publicly accountable. She thinks 'Cause Marketing', whereby companies vouchsafe charitable donations when consumers make purchases, will expand. These ideas are hardly novel; Stuart Bull published an article on the impact of virtual reality technology  -in 1973. Popcorn says that 'Cocooning', perhaps her best-known formulation, and one which is arguably a real contribution to the marketing lexicon, is already with us; people are increasingly concerned to buy products and services which protect them from the harsh and unpredictable realities of the outside world. Some other trends she identifies are: Fantasy adventure: consumers looking for products and services which add spice to mundane existence. Small indulgences: small-scale luxuries which massage bruised selves. The vigilante consumer: whose pressure will manipulate marketing managers to re-think business ethics. Alongside the identified trends are many prescriptive acts of philanthropy, one being that companies should begin to appoint children to their boards. 'Children are very nervous about their future and I think they should have a vote. Kids should be on the boards that dictate and pollute their future,' says Popcorn. But is IBM, whose current corporate soul Popcorn thinks is 'not too great', likely to appoint a child as a non-executive director? 'Did we ever think that children would write to Tony O'Reilly and make them (Heinz) stop using drift nets to catch tuna? The kids wrote to him and he stopped. Then everyone follows. Maybe someone like Anita Roddick (of the Body Shop) will put a child on the board.' The book baldly states that the most important message for marketing in the 1990s is that we should be hopeful that tomorrow will be better than today. But that is of little practical help; according to Bell, what is fundamental to trend spotting is 'gauging the underlying level of consumer confidence'. Moreover, polishing a company's ethics ignores one basic obstacle; marketing managers have as their raison d'etre the principle 'sell more', which is rather difficult in a slump. But even in PopSpeak, some traditional values remain. 'We think 'doing the right thing' will be good for business. I couldn't ever tell a client to do something that wouldn't be good for business, it would be unfair. We really believe it sells product, the bottom line is about selling product.' That's good old fashioned faith. *The Popcorn Report - Revolutionary trend predictions for marketing in the 90s; published by Century, Pounds 14.99.</p>

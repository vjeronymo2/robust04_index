			<p>BFN     [Text] Although the National Commission for Atomic Energy  (CNEA) admitted only yesterday that negotiations had been under  way, the Canadian atomic energy company has affirmed that  Argentina signed a "memorandum of understanding" for the  installation of another nuclear reactor in the country.    Argentina's plans to acquire a new nuclear plant are  expressed in a document signed with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.  (AECL), which will be in charge of conducting a feasibility  study for installing a Candu-3 reactor, similar to the one  installed at the Embalse nuclear plant in Cordoba. The new  nuclear plant would cost about $600 million.    There are at least two curious things about this report. One  is that AECL Chairman Bruce Howe himself admitted before the  Canadian Congress that the economic viability of the kind of  reactor Argentina is interested in buying is "doubtful".    The second is that in response to CLARIN, the CNEA press  office admitted only yesterday that "negotiations have been  under way, although nothing has been signed." This contradicts  a report on the signing of the agreement, which published in the  17 March issue of NUCLEONICS WEEK, the most prestigious  publication on international nuclear industry matters.    Even more curious is the title of this article: "Despite the  Unclear Economics of Candu-3, Argentina Will Try." The article  states that "despite AECL's doubts about the economic viability  of Candu-3, the company is trying to sell it abroad (...). It  also announces the signing of a memorandum of understanding with  CNEA to conduct a feasibility study to interconnect a 450  megawatt reactor to the Argentine energy generator system.    According to biologist Raul Montenegro, chairman of the  Foundation for the Defense of the Environment [Fundacion para la  Defensa del Ambiente) (FUNAM), the idea of installing in  Argentina a reactor that "the Canadians themselves believe is  uneconomical shows that Argentina continues to be the test tube  for developed countries."    Although CNEA has officially denied the signing of this  agreement, an important CNEA researcher has confirmed the report  to CLARIN. He asserted that "no reactor of this kind is yet  operating in the entire world." This means that if this reactor  is installed in Argentina, it will be the first ever, that same  as happened with Atucha-1, which -- according to experts --  resulted in so many problems precisely because it was a  prototype whose manufacture was later discontinued, and which  had not been previously tested.    The report not only contradicts the international trend to  reduce the use of nuclear energy in the production of  electricity. It also seems to contradict the theory upheld by  some government areas: In the last issue of ECONOMIC NEWS  magazine -- issued by the Mediterranean Foundation, connected,  naturally, to Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo -- Economist Juan  Novara states that "contrary to what is publicized, nuclear  energy is not clean, cheap, or price competitive."    The "fourth nuclear plant," is, however, not as  contradictory  within the framework of the program to privatize all nuclear  plants. This idea is promoted by Cavallo himself, on the basis  of the deficit in this area: Because about $900 million per  year are invested in nuclear energy, and only $300 million  obtained from energy sales, this deficit could be decreased by  allowing private business to be in charge of selling electricity  and the government in charge of its control. A country that  offers four nuclear plants, instead of the two that are  currently operating, would be more attractive.    Perhaps all these doubts (economic efficiency,  privatization,  which is still resisted within the CNEA, and naturally, the  risks that nuclear energy entails) may have caused an apparently  simple commercial transaction to become a state secret.    The memorandum signed between Argentina and Canada does not  specify the work to be done, or where the future nuclear plant  would be installed. This will be the fourth nuclear plant if  Atucha-2 is ever completed. It can be ascertained, however,  that this information is being studied, as according to what  AECL reported in March, the agreement estimates that "the first  results will be provided by mid-year."    Half of the year has already elapsed, and CNEA has not even  reported the existence of this memorandum of understanding.    Raul Montenegro, former Cordoba Province energy under  secretary, has informed CLARIN, however, that "logical economics  on the output of this type of reactor state that it would be  viable only if it were situated next to the Embalse Rio Tercero  nuclear plant."    This is not an outlandish idea if we consider that the site  next to the Embalse Rio Tercero nuclear plant was preselected  about eight years ago, when the idea of installing a fourth  nuclear plant was still prevalent.    CNEA experts consulted by CLARIN agreed with this theory.  They said: "There are very few sites in the country where this  reactor would be economically viable. Embalse Rio Tercero is  one of them."</p>

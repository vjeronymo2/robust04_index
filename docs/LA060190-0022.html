			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FRANKENHOOKER': A FUN SLICE OF AMERICAN GOTHIC  </P> <P> Frank Henenlotter's hilarious, totally outrageous grin-and-gore comedy  "Frankenhooker" takes over tonight as the Nuart's Friday midnight offering,  replacing his "Basket Case 2."  </P> <P> It couldn't be more appropriate, because "Frankenhooker" is just as gleefully  perverse as his "Basket Case" pictures.  </P> <P> Shocks-and-yocks is what midnight shows are all about, and the gifted  Henenlotter supplies plenty of both.  </P> <P> Even before New Jersey power-plant worker Jeffrey Franken (James Lorinz) loses  his pretty but plumpish fiancee Elizabeth (Patty Mullen) to a runaway lawn  mower, you know he's weird, a guy who's been thrown out of three medical  schools and whose garage workshop/lab features a tank containing what looks to  be the living brain of a Cyclops.  </P> <P> Now Jeffrey has managed to salvage Elizabeth's severed head, and tries to  improve upon nature by assembling a new body for her from parts of New York's  sexiest streetwalkers.  </P> <P> Much of what happens defies description in its sheer grisliness, but never for  a second do Henenlotter and co-writer Robert Martin lose their all-crucial  sense of humor. Henenlotter may have had in mind a homage to Herschel Gordon  Lewis' cult classic "Blood Feast." However, where that film is disturbingly  morbid in its sex-and-violence equation, Henenlotter makes a comic point of  Jeffrey's puritanism and its bizarre consequences. Also, "Frankenhooker"  (Times-rated Mature) has lots of fun presenting an exaggerated fantasy view of  big, bad Manhattan.  </P> <P> As usual, Henenlotter gets extraordinarily well-sustained, straight-faced  portrayals from his stars -- and in this instance provides cameos for Louise  Lasser as Jeffrey's doting, innocent mother and Shirley Stoler as the  thought-she'd-seen-it-all proprietor of the lowest dive in New York. No doubt  about it, Henenlotter is an original, coming up with a piece of American Gothic  that has the primitive energy of Sam Fuller and the dark humor of David Lynch.  </P></p>

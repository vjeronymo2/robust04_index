			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Observer: Up and down at Barron's For 26 years his column has been among the best loved - and feared  - on Wall Street. But now Alan Abelson, the colourful 67-year-old editor of Barron's, has been sacked by his overlords at the mighty Dow Jones publishing group. To be fair, Dow Jones has only asked Abelson to resign as editor and wants him to continue writing his outspoken and market-moving 'Up &amp; down Wall Street' column under a new editor. But Abelson, who only this week was calling for the boss of IBM to quit and the company to be declared an official disaster area, knows better than most the various ways to get rid of people without calling it 'the sack'. Few financial journalists have been as influential as Abelson, who has edited Barron's since 1981 and has worked there for 35 years. Indeed, in the minds of many of Barron's 250,000 subscribers the weekly magazine is indistinguishable from the editor himself. 'I came out of the womb and the first thing I saw was the Barron's logo,' Abelson joked yesterday. So what happened? 'Two weeks ago I came to work and was told that Dow Jones wanted a new editor. It's a reasonable choice. It's their shop. I guess I'm a bit long in the tooth, although my teeth are still pretty sharp,' says Abelson. He would have liked Kathryn Welling, a protege and associate editor, to take over. 'But she is going into the business of mothering,' and has decided to 'take herself out of the loop, as George Bush would say.' The worry now is that Dow Jones will replace Abelson with a Wall Street Journal editor. If so, it could result in the sort of internal row which Abelson has so enjoyed reporting over the years. But for the moment he is behaving impeccably. 'I have never felt this good in my memory. All of a sudden the weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders.' Sounds uncharacteristically diplomatic for Abelson.</p>

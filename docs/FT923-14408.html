			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: National Grid Shares in the UK regional electricity companies bounced back yesterday in relief at the regulator's new price formula for National Grid. But while RPI minus 3 is indeed more benign than the regime darkly rumoured in the market last week, Offer's Professor Stephen Littlechild is hardly a soft touch. Even with minus 3, the grid will only be able to achieve real earnings growth provided it finds additional savings of 2 per cent on top of those already identified. No doubt there is a bit more up its sleeve, but it is worth remembering that half operating costs are outside its control. The other issue is what the professor has in mind for the Recs come 1995. National Grid's new formula implies a target rate of return of around 5.8 per cent on fixed assets, which compares starkly with the Recs' current range of 8.5-9.0 per cent. The clear message is to enjoy the real dividend increases while they last.</p>

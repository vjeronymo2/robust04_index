			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Mortgage benefit cuts to be limited Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will try to consolidate the housing market's fragile recovery in this month's Budget by introducing only limited cuts in mortgage benefit payments to people on low incomes. He is, however, expected to signal that there will be further cuts in the amount of mortgage interest relief to recipients of income support, encouraging householders to take out private insurance in future years. As the government prepares to cut about Pounds 5bn from its public spending bill in this year's Budget, the chancellor is expected to announce a reduction in the ceiling for which mortgage benefit can be paid from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 100,000. This is a smaller reduction than had been expected by mortgage lenders, who had assumed that the top limit would be set at Pounds 90,000. Treasury officials have accepted an argument from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, that a reduction of the ceiling to this lower level would hit the broad mass of mortgage holders and could amount to another serious setback for the housing market. Ministers believe that it would be politically difficult to implement drastic reductions in the mortgage benefit system, which costs taxpayers about Pounds 1.2bn per year. They have also said that they will shy away from announcing projected cuts for future years in this month's Budget. They have, however, made no secret of their long-term desire to phase out the system, arguing that it is difficult to operate because of constant changes in the level of interest repayments. As one official put it: 'It is unlikely we will set a target for the future. But we are sending out pretty strong signals that people should not rely on this form of support for ever. We'd be very keen on people taking out private insurance.' Earlier this month the Council of Mortgage Lenders warned that a cut in the top limit for relief to Pounds 90,000 would mean that more than 200,000 mortgage-holders would run a greater risk of having their homes repossessed. This would affect almost twice as many mortgage-holders as would be the case if the ceiling were reduced to Pounds 100,000. The CML, which represents banks, building societies and other lenders, is opposed even to this smaller change. Although the number of properties repossessed has been falling in the past couple of years, repossessions are still at historically very high levels.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT  </P> <P> Jose Jose's current BMG-Ariola album is aptly entitled "En las Buenas . . . y  en las Malas" (In Good Times . . . and Bad"), a reflection on the artist's past  personal and professional troubles. Now, things could not be better for the  charismatic performer, who kicked off the celebration of his 25th year in show  biz at the Greek Theatre, with an audience that included Mexican sexpot Olga  Breeskin. The singer, known as "The Prince of Song," continued his tour with a  series of concerts in his native Mexico.  </P> <P> Spain's Rocio Durcal, on a U.S. tour until December, is celebrating her 30th  year on international stages. She will perform at the L.A. Sports Arena Nov.  11, her second recent local engagement. Durcal's 46th birthday coincided with  her October appearance at Universal Amphitheater. A largely Mexican audience  there was treated to a repertoire of Mexican music, including cuts from her  latest album, "Si Te Pudiera Mentir" ("If I Could Lie To You"), produced by  Marco Antonio Solis of the musical group Los Bukis. Argentine pianist Raul Di  Biasio opened the concert.  </P> <P> Spectators at France's Deauville Film Festival selected "Aunt Julia and the  Scriptwriter," based on a novel by Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, as their  favorite American movie of the year. The film, which stars Peter Falk and  Barbara Hershey, recently opened nationally with its title changed to "Tune in  Tomorrow" for U.S. distribution. The romantic comedy is set in the 1950s, with  Falk playing an eccentric writer of radio scripts.  </P> <P> Julio Iglesias and Veronica Castro (who stars in Univision's soap-opera "Mi  pequena soledad") were chosen as the favorite performers of Latinos living in  the United States. The recent survey, conducted by Market Development Inc. in  six major cities, showed the top five "Favorite Musical Performers" to be:  Iglesias, Los Bukis, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, Jose Jose and  Jose Luis Rodriguez. The five leading "favorite actor/actress" ratings: Castro,  Charles Bronson, Vicente Fernandez, Sylvester Stallone and Lucia Mendez.  </P> <P> Top rated KTNQ-AM radio personality Humberto Luna received his star on  Hollywood's Walk of Fame, the first Latino radio announcer to be so honored.  Luna expressed his appreciation saying, "This award is important because it  shows the growing number of Latinos in Los Angeles. Spanish-language radio has  grown tremendously, and it is because of its amazing evolution that I am being  honored today." Another Latino entertainment figure, Puerto Rican recording  star Tito Puente, received his star in August. ELENA KELLNER  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed us of the Executive Branch's general policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.'' <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) the proposals must have the potential to be operational within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4) proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the United States and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary of the notification by the Commission in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Letter dated July 22, 1993, from Richard C. Beaird, Acting U.S. Coordinator and Director, Bureau of International Communications and Information Policy, U.S. Department of State to FCC Chairman James H. Quello. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 11. In accordance with the Policy Guidelines, we forwarded copies of the above-captioned applications to the Department of State and requested that it advise us as to its views. Pursuant to our request, the Department of State issued a follow-up letter dated May 23, 1994. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The Department of State found the IMTS portions of the applications to be fully consistent with the Policy Guidelines except for the $4.85 surcharge per call for collect calls. The Department found that the proposed surcharge was unreasonable and unjustified. It observed that the proposed surcharge far exceeded the approximately $.60 average rate for all countries in the region and the prevalent $1.00 rate for those countries having a surcharge. Therefore, the Department of State had no objection to our approval of the IMTS applications without the $4.85 surcharge provision. The Department of State, however, did state that it would favorably consider a surcharge provision that is determined by us to be based on costs, other international norms and practices, relevant ITU Recommendations, and our ISP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Letter dated May 23, 1994, from Richard C. Beaird, Senior Deputy U.S. Coordinator, Bureau of International Communications and Information Policy, U.S. Department of State to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 12. In light of the Department of State's letter, and our own review of the applications, we concluded that we would not process the applications as filed because of the agreements with EMTELCUBA for the $4.85 surcharge. Rather than dismiss the applications, we gave the applicants the opportunity to amend their applications to reflect a new agreement renegotiated with EMTELCUBA that provides for either no surcharge for collect calls, or a surcharge that was reasonable and justified. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter dated July 29, 1994 from Wendell Harris, Assistant Bureau Chief/International, Common Carrier Bureau, to all five applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. On September 6, 1994, LDDS amended its application to include a new operating agreement with EMTELCUBA that reflected a reduction in the proposed surcharge of $4.85 per call for collect calls to $1.00 per call. A week later, the other four applicants similarly amended their applications to reflect a $1.00 per call surcharge. We sent copies of these amendments to the Department of State, and requested their advice as to whether these new surcharges were in compliance with the Policy Guidelines. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  On October 3, 1994, we received a letter from the Department of State expressing its view that the new $1.00 per call surcharge was in compliance with the Policy Guidelines. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  The Department of State stated that the new proposed surcharge of $1.00 per call appears consistent with international norms and practices, relevant ITU Recommendations, and current surcharge rates in the region. The Department of State notes, however, that it hopes that this and other surcharge rates will generally be reduced or eliminated in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letters dated September 9 and 16, 1994 from Wendell Harris, Assistant Bureau Chief/International, Common Carrier Bureau, to Richard C.

Upon our own review of the applications, we agree with the Department of State that the five applicants' amended operating agreements with EMTELCUBA are in compliance with the Policy Guidelines. The $1.00 per call surcharge for collect calls is within the range of surcharges that other countries in the Caribbean region have for these types of calls, and reflects the cost to the originating country of providing the service. Accordingly, we find that this new surcharge is reasonable and justified. It is our desire, however, as it is the Department of States's, that this surcharge eventually be reduced or eliminated in the future. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOWL REPORT;  </P> <P> JOHN HANCOCK BOWL;  </P> <P> MARINOVICH MAKES TRIP, ERVINS DOESN'T  </P> <P> Tailback Ricky Ervins, the most valuable player in USC's 17-10 victory over  Michigan last Jan. 1 in the Rose Bowl, didn't even make the trip with the  Trojans Wednesday as they flew to El Paso for Monday's John Hancock Bowl  against Michigan State.  </P> <P> Ervins sprained his left ankle while gaining a season-high 199 yards against  Ohio State three months ago at Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> He returned briefly six weeks later, gaining 13 yards in two carries against  Oregon State, but reinjured his ankle and missed the Trojans' last two games.  </P> <P> "His ankle just hasn't responded," Coach Larry Smith said. "He really couldn't  do anything (in practice last week), so we met and I said, 'Do you want to go?'  He said, 'Well, I can't play, so I'd rather not.' "  </P> <P> Smith said that he didn't have "the slightest idea" who would start at  quarterback against Michigan State.  </P> <P> "We could start any one of four guys," Smith said, alluding to Todd Marinovich,  Shane Foley, Pat O'Hara and Reggie Perry. "I've opened it up completely. I've  even entertained the idea of playing all four -- one a quarter. It's not very  practical, but it's what I'd like to do."  </P> <P> Marinovich missed a week of practice because of an ear infection, but returned  for three days of pre-Christmas workouts.  </P> <P> "If we were playing the game today, he wouldn't be the starter because he's  missed so much work," Smith said.

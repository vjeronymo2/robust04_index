			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRASH PILOT WAS 'CAUTIOUS,' GIFTED EX-COMBAT FLIER  </P> <P> Pedro Duran's plane was his baby. The former Marine combat pilot and two  friends bought the Italian-made Siai-Marchetti a year ago, but it was Duran who  flew the high-performance craft most often.  </P> <P> At least twice a week he took off from Santa Monica Airport, often to perform  aerobatic stunts over the Malibu Hills or to practice landings at Oxnard  Airport. He spent many Saturdays at the hangar, waxing the brown and green body  of the single-engine plane or performing ritual acts of maintenance. He was  known as an extremely cautious pilot.  </P> <P> "He was a fanatic with that plane," said Michael L. Withem, one of the plane's  other owners. "I think he had more dates with that plane than his girlfriend."  </P> <P> Despite Duran's care, caution and experience, the 42-year-old medical  consultant known by friends as P.J. was killed Wednesday when the Marchetti  crashed in a Calabasas field. A 24-year-old flying enthusiast whom  acquaintances identified as Cameron Duke was also killed.  </P> <P> The plane crashed at 4 p.m. in a field off Lost Hills Road near Malibu Creek  State Park. The accident is being investigated by the National Transportation  Safety Board, but no cause is known yet, officials said.  </P> <P> Investigators on Thursday were still piecing together what caused the accident.  And friends of the pilot tried to understand how a skillful pilot like Duran  could "auger in."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County coroner's office did not release the names of the  victims. But Withem and Stephen A. Shoop, the third owner of the plane, went to  the crash site Wednesday and identified the victims as Duran and Duke, both of  West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Withem and Shoop, also former military pilots, described Duran as a gifted  pilot who had more than 5,000 hours of flying experience. He had survived being  shot down twice in Vietnam and had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.  </P> <P> "He was so incredibly cautious . . . He is just the last guy I ever expected  this to happen to," Shoop said.  </P> <P> "We probably will never know what happened," Withem said. "This was a guy who  flew F-4 Phantoms in Vietnam, was a very highly decorated Marine pilot."  </P> <P> Shoop and Withem disputed statements by witnesses who said the pilot leaped  from the plane as it began to plummet after developing engine problems during  an aerobatic maneuver.  </P> <P> Shoop, who was at the crash site before the victims were removed, said Duran's  body was found burned in the wreckage. Duke's body was about 20 feet from the  crash site. Both victims were wearing parachutes that had not been opened.  </P> <P> Shoop said a torn seat belt was still around Duran's body, suggesting that he  was still in the pilot's seat at impact. Shoop said that if someone tried to  jump from the plane, which had a side-by-side seat configuration, it probably  was Duke.  </P> <P> "P.J. would never have abandoned a passenger," Shoop said. "He may have ordered  his passenger to attempt to jump, but he would have never abandoned him."  </P> <P> An NTSB spokesman said investigators had not determined if anyone had jumped  from the craft.  </P> <P> Shoop and Withem said the $181,000 Marchetti was designed 10 years ago to be  used as a military fighter plane but was instead sold to private pilots. Though  not outfitted with weapons, the plane had instrumentation that included  switches for engaging guns and dropping bombs from wing racks. The body paint  was still the original military green and brown camouflage.  </P> <P> Duran had met Duke at the Santa Monica Airport, where it was believed the  younger man was taking flying lessons, Withem said. He often flew with Duran  when Withem and Shoop were unavailable.  </P> <P> "If there was an empty seat, P.J. would take someone," Withem said. "On this  day there was an empty seat, and Cameron took it."  </P></p>

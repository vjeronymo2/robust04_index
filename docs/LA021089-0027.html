			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE TO DISCIPLINE IBRAHIM AFTER TAUNT STARTS POSTGAME FIGHT  </P> <P> A day after his actions at the end of a basketball game Wednesday night between  Thousand Oaks and Westlake highs triggered a wild brawl that included players,  coaches, and spectators, Essam Ibrahim expressed regret while facing certain  disciplinary measures from Westlake administrators.  </P> <P> "It was kind of a classless act of mine," said Ibrahim, a junior on the Warrior  team.  </P> <P> After Todd Anderson of Thousand Oaks missed a free throw with no time remaining  that would have tied the score, Ibrahim ran onto the court and taunted Anderson  before continuing across the floor toward the locker room. He was dragged down  from behind by Thousand Oaks players, one of whom Ibrahim identified as  Anderson.  </P> <P> "I was cheering, heading toward the locker room, and they dragged me down,"  said Ibrahim, who was suspended from school Thursday. "But I didn't swing, and  I don't think anyone swung at me."  </P> <P> The incident sparked a minute-long fracas. 'It was quite a melee of hitting,"  Westlake Coach Greg Hess said.  </P> <P> "This is a good kid who used some pretty poor judgment," said Westlake Athletic  Director Bob Fisher, who was in attendance. "But I take a pretty hard line on  things like that."  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks Athletic Director Dale Ackerman said he did not expect that any  Lancer player would be punished. TIM BROWN  </P></p>

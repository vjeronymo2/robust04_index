Director Choko Takayama  of the Okinawa Governor's executive office said on 17 January  the information came from U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie,  55, a Democrat from Hawaii. At the house committee,  Representative Abercrombie is expected to question U.S. military  and government officials on "why U.S. Forces maintain such huge  military bases on Okinawa rather than returning the land to the  local people."    As part of a follow-up to Governor Masahide Ota's Washington  visit seeking a breakthrough on the U.S. bases issue, the  prefectural government last year invited Representative  Abercrombie and other U.S. officials to visit Okinawa.  Representative Abercrombie is known for his work in campaigning  for cutbacks to military bases in Hawaii. After observing bases  on Okinawa, Representative Abercrombie stressed the need to  review U.S. policy on military bases on Okinawa, saying: "We  should now review the significance of the military bases,  because the significance was determined 50 years ago. My duty  is to provide appropriate advice based on necessary information.  I promise I will fulfill the duty."    Mr. Gene La Rocque, a retired naval officer who is known in  Japan because he confirmed the possession by U.S. Navy vessels  in Japanese territorial waters of nuclear weapons, also visited  Okinawa at the invitation of the prefectural government. He has  produced television programs on U.S. base problems on Okinawa.  Representative Abercrombie has obtained three video recordings  of Mr. La Rocque's programs to show to other house Armed  Services Committee members.    A 30-minute program produced by Mr. La Rocque was broadcast  in the United States through the PBS Network, a nationwide  television network which has access to about 100 stations.  Viewers in Washington watched the program at the end of last  year, New Yorkers saw it on New Year's Day. A videotape of the  program has been sent to the prefectural government, and it  reportedly focuses on the financial burden of maintaining  military bases on Okinawa, saying: "Redevelopment of returned  U.S. bases would benefit the local community (Okinawa), and U.S.  taxpayers could save a lot of money."</p>

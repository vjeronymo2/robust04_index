			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hard bargaining looms at Opec - Deborah Hargreaves on this week's crucial ministerial meeting MINISTERS FROM the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will face their toughest session since the Gulf war tomorrow as they meet against a background of weak oil prices and stagnant world demand. The hard-pressed producers' club knows it must send a clear signal to world markets of its willingness to make meaningful production cuts if it is to avert a price collapse in the next couple of months. Producers realise they must cut production by at least 1.5m barrels a day to have any effect on prices. But for the larger producers, such as Saudi Arabia, a return to tight individual production quotas, on which Opec policy was based in the past, is anathema. Smaller producers such as Algeria want to see the higher prices that a large cut in output would bring. Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, Algeria's oil minister, said yesterday Opec must cut at least 1.7m b/d to 22.5m b/d and sustain this for a year. There will be some hard bargaining over the size of the overall output cut and the production level from which individual producers' will start to turn down the taps. Ten producers have already reduced their output by 420,000 b/d altogether, in order to give some support to prices. The voluntary cuts announced several weeks ago had little immediate effect on oil prices and have yet to feed through fully to the market, where prices have languished since November. But at least the market stopped falling. In fact, prices have edged up over the past week - as they usually do before an Opec meeting - and North Sea Brent crude for delivery in April rose by 40 cents yesterday to Dollars 18.80 a barrel. Traders are taking a sanguine view that Opec producers will agree at this week's meeting to stop pumping so much oil. If they fail to come to some arrangement, there is little doubt that prices will collapse to below Dollars 15 a barrel for Brent. No producer wants a price collapse as all of them are running budget deficits and all have based their financial plans for this year on a price for oil higher than the current Dollars 17 a barrel for the Opec basket of crudes. The state of emergency in Algeria and the attempted coup in Venezuela last month highlight the way depressed oil revenues can exacerbate political instability for some members. At the same time, Opec can no longer look to outside factors to buoy prices. World demand at just over 64m b/d has shown little more than a 1 per cent rise over the same period last year and most western countries remain in recession. In addition, exports from the former Soviet Union have stabilised after slipping slightly last year. In December, Opec pumped oil at its fastest rate for 11 years when production reached 24.4m b/d. This declined in January to 24.2m b/d. But estimates for the call on Opec oil for the second quarter are as low as 22.7m b/d. Discussion at the meeting will centre around a cut in production of 5 to 7 per cent or a similar formula that will avoid a direct reference to quotas. Saudi Arabia will insist that production cuts be shared evenly and not fall squarely on its shoulders even though it has raised output by far more than the others to compensate for the absence of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil from the market. Saudi Arabia has increased its market share from a quarter of Opec output to more than a third since the Gulf crisis. 'The more they define what the production cut will be and how it will be spread, the more credible the agreement will be to the market,' said Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson. But market-watchers are sceptical that a cut of 1.5m b/d will be enough to do more than put a floor under current prices. A cut of this size could push Opec prices to Dollars 18 to Dollars 19 a barrel, but not to the Dollars 21 a barrel target price. 'In order to raise prices, Opec needs to cut by 1.7m b/d to 2m b/d and not just say it, but actually cut it back,' said Mr Joseph Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. 'That is a pretty big task and I see little chance of it happening.' Indeed, Saudi Arabia's price objective is thought to be below Dollars 21 a barrel. The kingdom will try to steer a middle course between pacifying its hard-line colleagues such as Algeria by agreeing to pump less oil while at the same time, maintaining its policy of moderate pricing. In order to keep smaller producers happy, Opec ministers may agree that if, say, a cut of 7 per cent in output takes an individual country below the quota that was set in July 1990, it can continue to produce at quota. That way the agreement can skirt the issue of direct production quotas. Kuwait will, in any case, escape the overall requirements to cut output while it is still rebuilding its oil industry. The emirate plans to pump 1.5m b/d by the end of this year, which will take it closer to its production rate before the Gulf war. What the meeting is unlikely to do is to make any contingency plans for the return of Iraqi oil to the market. This is unlikely before the end of the year given the break-down of talks between Baghdad and the United Nations, which bought Opec a breathing space. When Iraq returns fully to the export market, other producers will be forced to cut much more deeply.</p>

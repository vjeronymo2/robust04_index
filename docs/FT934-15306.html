			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Mixed views on highs in Germany, Hong Kong European equity markets put in an impressive performance last week, rising at double the level of the FT Actuaries World Index, with several bourses hitting all-time highs. Mr Marcus Grubb of Salomon Brothers notes that increased buying by US investors was rumoured to be behind the rallies. Net sales of US mutual funds this year have reached Dollars 180bn, he says; during the last two months, the amount of new cash flowing into foreign funds has exceeded Dollars 1bn a week. He adds that some global funds have increased their weighting in foreign assets to more than 20 per cent. 'The bullish medium-term arguments for European equities are compelling,' he says. 'In a recessionary environment with high savings ratios, low inflation and falling interest rates, liquidity will flow towards long-term financial assets. This flood of liquidity will continue unless spending picks up on consumption, investment and real assets or, alternatively, inflation pressures build up, reversing the trend in interest rates. Neither of these scenarios,' he maintains, 'is likely to occur in Europe in the near future.' Germany was one beneficiary of the foreign investment process. The end of the fighting in Moscow triggered an 80 point rally which took the DAX index to a new all-time high above the 2,000 level. According to the UBS global research team, the low selling pressure during the course of the Russian turmoil indicated that investors were willing to hold their positions in German stocks. They say that stabilisation around the 2,000 level in the DAX seems likely in the short term. UBS expects financials to outperform but sees a good opportunity to take profits in the retailing sector, given the gloomy outlook for disposable income and consumer expenditure in Germany. Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson takes a more bearish view of German equities, believing that the German market 'has all to do with liquidity and little to do with valuations'. 'In all markets that are financed by a wall of foreign liquidity,' he says, 'there always remains the risk of a sudden reversal . . . With US mutual funds notoriously fickle, we prefer the liquidity situation in France.' Mr Edwards believes that the profits outlook will disappoint in Germany and that the fundamentals are falling into place for underperformance. He takes the same view of Hong Kong which surged to a succession of record high closes during the first four days of last week, and took itself to a new record high yesterday in response to increases in the weightings of the market by a number of US houses. Mr Edwards comments that, having previously convinced itself that no slowdown was in sight in Hong Kong, the market now believes that, although the economy is slowing, there will be a soft landing: 'Soft-landing is a word we used to hear a lot of in the late 1980s about western economies - and it came to nothing,' he says. 'The first two quarters of China's slowdown has come to an end and the current quarter should start to see the real pain beginning and intensifying in the first quarter of 1994. Cutting money supply growth from 50 per cent to 20 per cent will be a shuddering experience. Hong Kong,' he concludes, 'remains vulnerable from a draining of Chinese liquidity.' Norway was another strong performer last week after a month characterised by profit-taking in connection with the general election and weaker international markets. Ms Tone Varmann of Unibors in Copenhagen sees the market focusing this month on a crop of interim results and the new government's 1994 budget, due to be released tomorrow.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change   % change                  % change in local currency ??   sterling ??   in US                                                              dollars ??           -------------------------------------------------------------                 1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of  Start of                                            1993      1993       1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria          +3.58    +1.59   +26.88    +26.48   +25.31    +27.13 Belgium          +2.06    +1.86   +24.87    +20.40   +13.24    +14.88 Denmark          +1.49    +0.67   +39.31    +31.79   +25.21    +27.03 Finland          +6.46    +7.47  +158.67    +87.92   +68.96    +71.43 France           +1.84    +2.44   +31.09    +19.76   +15.90    +17.58 Germany          +4.78    +7.32   +36.35    +29.05   +28.44    +30.30 Ireland          +0.60    -0.76   +55.13    +41.19   +25.71    +27.54 Italy            -0.39    -0.75   +70.23    +43.11   +30.97    +32.86 Netherlands      +1.67    +3.60   +30.12    +25.61   +24.88    +26.69 Norway           +5.14    +5.49   +55.28    +33.71   +29.74    +31.62 Spain            +1.96    +2.06   +54.78    +37.44   +18.87    +20.60 Sweden           +2.76    +6.04   +89.69    +34.94   +17.63    +19.33 Switzerland      +2.14    +6.78   +36.06    +23.15   +26.57    +28.40 UK               +2.12    +2.04   +25.68    +10.93   +10.93    +12.54 EUROPE           +2.35    +3.32   +34.09    +20.54   +18.10    +19.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia        +2.89    +4.73   +33.55    +25.83   +18.77    +20.49 Hong Kong        +3.91    +5.06   +37.81    +42.95   +41.20    +43.25 Japan            +1.60    -1.00   +26.57    +25.67   +46.60    +48.73 Malaysia         +5.12   +11.19   +83.48    +64.51   +66.94    +69.37 New Zealand      +4.57    +2.10   +54.93    +35.84   +43.74    +45.81 Singapore        +2.26    +5.25   +62.25    +38.03   +42.34    +44.41  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada           +2.14    +1.52   +16.05    +12.86    +6.19     +7.73 USA              -0.28    -0.32   +12.84     +5.58    +4.07     +5.58 Mexico           +0.04    -4.65   +25.75     +1.39    +0.13     +1.58  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa     +3.50    +1.87   +29.18    +23.22   +40.73    +42.77  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX      +1.18    +0.63   +23.19    +16.05   +19.95    +21.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ??

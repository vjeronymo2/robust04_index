A U.S. diplomat was summoned to the Department of North  America of the Russian Foreign Ministry earlier today to receive  the following statement: "The Russian Foreign Ministry is  lodging a protest against illegal activities of the American  side with regard to an official representative of the Russian  foreign intelligence service who has been working in Washington  since the summer of 1993 by mutual consent" of Russia and the  United States, Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said.    "In this situation, we have to declare, on the basis of  reciprocity, a CIA officer in Moscow persona non grata and  demand that he leave the Russian Federation," the statement said.    "The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the fact that  there are special channels for settling issues arising on both  sides in connection with intelligence or counterintelligence  activity. These channels can and should be engaged. This will  allow (us) to find a mutually acceptable way out from the  current situation and avoid its politicisation," the statement  said.    The U.S. Embassy has been also presented with a diplomatic  note.    ITAR-TASS has learnt that Morris will leave Russia within  seven days.</p>

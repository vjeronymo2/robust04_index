			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / International Company News: Two US healthcare groups agree to Dollars 720m merger The spate of mergers among health maintenance organisations (HMOs) in the US continued yesterday with the announcement of a Dollars 720m all-stock merger of two groups with operations concentrated in western states. Foundation Health, a company based in California which has recently concluded a series of acquisitions in the south-east, said it had reached agreement to acquire Arizona-based Intergroup Healthcare. It is to pay Dollars 444m in stock for Thomas-Davis Medical Centres, which owns 63 per cent of Intergroup. In addition, Foundation is offering a choice of ordinary stock or convertible preference shares to holders of the remaining Intergroup shares. Together, the two would cover 1m individuals through their HMO operations and have annual revenues of Dollars 2.4bn, creating a company in the top dozen of that US sector. HMOs are rapidly replacing traditional health insurance companies in the US. Unlike insurers, they actively manage the provision of healthcare to the individuals they cover in order to bring down costs. The wave of acquisitions in the sector marks an attempt by the bigger organisations to spread their administrative and marketing costs across a bigger customer base, to increase their bargaining power with healthcare providers such as hospitals and to extend their networks into other regions in the country. The Intergroup deal appeared to mark the growing competition to acquire smaller HMOs. The price being offered was well ahead of market expectations the day before, when Intergroup confirmed it was in discussions with an unnamed bidder. Yesterday morning, its shares closed at Dollars 57 5/8 , up Dollars 10 1/8 , to Dollars 58 after a jump of Dollars 9 1/2 the day before. Foundation said the stock it had to issue in the deal would cut its earnings per share by 35 cents next year. But it expected lower costs and the opportunity to sell new services to Intergroup's customers.</p>

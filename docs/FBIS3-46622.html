The brain-drain to the private sector has gutted the pool of  experienced talent. There are at most 10 diplomats able to  negotiate at international levels, the ministry's Deputy  Permanent Secretary Pratyathan Dawi Tawethikun, told THE NATION.  "We now lack officials who are eligible to represent Thailand  at global-level negotiations."    "The permanent secretary is very concerned about the  matter,"  he said.    During the fiscal year Oct 1992 to Sept 1993, four C-10  diplomats left the Foreign Ministry, including the former  ambassador to Brussels Danai Dulalumpha, one of the few Thais  well acquainted with the European Community market. Three C-10  diplomats resigned the preceding three years. Senior officials  are urgently seeking a way to reverse the drain of talent, and  to train promising middle-ranking and junior staff.    Officials trace the start of the brain-drain back to 1990,  when the private sector's high pay strategy first began to  influence Thai society. The number of qualified applicants for  the annual intake of staff has also dropped. Not all ministry  officials, however, regard the situation as critical and say it  is only to be expected that the most experienced people, having  already fulfilled their ambitions within the ministry, should  look elsewhere for a fresh challenge.    "They have fulfilled their career goals. Now that they have  honour money and connections they can go into businesses or even  take a rest," a mid-level official said.    Another senior official also said the resignation rate  amongst senior officials, although high, was not of too much  concern.    "The situation is not worrying when compared to resignation  levels at other ministries," he said. He admitted, though, that  the number of resignations had also increased at the lower and  middle levels.    During the past three years, about 20 C-4 to C-8 grade  employees had resigned from the ministry, which now had a staff  of less than 1,200 and war, the smallest in the government.  However, he was not too worried and insisted the Foreign  Ministry was still an attractive career option.    "A career here is promising for people who want to be  diplomats, to travel and live overseas," he said.    There were about 70 C-10 positions in the ministry, and  ample  opportunities for people with ambition.    Another ministry source said there had also been a dramatic  decrease in the number of applicants for junior openings, at the  C-3 and C-4 levels, during the annual recruitment.    A decade ago when there were more than 4,000 applications  for  the approximately 40 openings each year, this year there had  only been 1,200. However, Pratyathan Dawi said the drop in  applications was not a problem as most of the new recruits were  highly qualified.    "It's not only the Foreign Ministry which attracts fewer  applicants. But we can take comfort that those entering the  ministry are capable," he said. However, in order to keep  experienced staff and attract quality recruits the ministry had  to compete increasingly with the private sector.    The ministry recently gave government scholarships to 60  people to continue their studies, some to PhD levels.    "This way we can ensure that these people will come back and  join the ministry," he said.    A C-6 official told THE NATION he was proud to work at the  Foreign Ministry and had no plans to quit.    "I am satisfied with what I am doing here, despite the low  income," he said. "Most of us here don't have any financial  problems. But if I was offered a salary of, say, Bt [baht]  50,000 by a private company, I might go," he said.    A C-4 staffer said she would not leave the ministry since  she  was accustomed to being part of the bureaucratic system, in  addition to the pride she had in her career. She said not all  of her colleagues shared her thinking. Several junior officials  had left the ministry during her three years there.    "The most popular reasons for resigning are the low wages  and  the boredom of working in a bureaucracy," she said.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move on Scots bankruptcies NATIONALISATION was being used by the government to derail a 'gravy train' that had provided millions of pounds for Scottish accountants engaged in insolvency cases, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, told the Commons last night. Mr Dewar supported provisions in the Bankruptcy (Scotland) bill to save taxpayers' money by expanding the role of a public official - the Accountant in Bankruptcy - to give a cost-effective sequestration service in Scotland. During an earlier discussion on the bill, Mr Dewar stated that in 1991 Pannell Kerr and Forster of Glasgow received sequestration fees totaling Pounds 3.427m, Ernst &amp; Young Pounds 2.2m, and Cork Gully Pounds 1.9m. Underlining the need to change the existing system Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said the cost to the taxpayer of financing the administration of individual sequestrations had risen from Pounds 13,000 in 1986 to Pounds 18.5m in 1991. The expenditure was accounted for by the payment of fees and outlays of the private-sector insolvency practitioners who undertook the work. Mr Lang estimated that if the historical trends in the volume and costs of sequestrations continued the expenditure would rise to some Pounds 50m by 1993-94 and over Pounds 80m by 1994-95. He said the level of insolvency in Scotland on a per-capita basis had changed from being broadly equivalent to the level in England and Wales in 1987 to some three times that level by 1990. Mr Lang insisted that the change could not be explained through relative economic prosperity or economic performance.</p>

It was characterized by high  abstentionism and an absence of major incidents.    The presidents of several voting tables in the urban and  rural areas estimated the turnout at 20-25 percent at closure  time.    One of the first tables to yield results in Totonicapan  reported, according to local reporters, 71 yes votes, 18 no  votes, and 35 void votes, and was marked by very high  abstentionism that was not quantified.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The permanent observer status  given to Poland by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Western  European Union (WEU) is unsatisfactory, head of the delegation  of the Polish Parliament for spring session of the WEU assembly  Deputy Longin Pastusiak said upon his arrival from a WEU session  in Paris. The present status makes it impossible for the Polish  delegation to cast votes, participate in committees' work and  forward amendments to reports.    Speaking to journalists Pastusiak said that Poland's full  integration with WEU, which under the Maastricht Treaty is to  become an armed organization of the European Union, remains one  of the priorities of the Polish policy. In his opinion, odds  are that efforts of Polish delegation to attain this goal will  bring results during the December session of the WEU  Parliamentary Assembly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Hong Song-kyu from London] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said that a  resolution regarding sanctions on North Korea will be included  in the agenda of the UN Security Council's discussion on the  North Korean nuclear issue, which is scheduled to begin this  week.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who stopped over in London on  4 June on his way to New York to attend the UN Security Council  meeting, and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who was  accompanying U.S. President Clinton on his visit to the UK, had  a telephone conversation for about an hour to discuss sanctions  on North Korea.    Minister Han said the U.S., UK, and ROK foreign ministers  agreed that it is time for the UN Security Council to impose  strong sanctions on North Korea and that special inspections  [tukpyol sachal] are necessary because North Korea already  passed the limit demanded by the International Atomic Energy  Agency.    Minister Han said he expected Russia and the PRC would  cooperate if the resolution concerning sanctions on North Korea  was included in the UN Security Council agenda.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Barclays Bank in first UK personal loan securitisation BARCLAYS BANK opened up a new sector in the UK's growing asset-backed market yesterday when it raised Pounds 280m through an issue of floating-rate notes (FRNs) backed by personal loans. The widely-expected offering marks the first securitisation of personal loans by a UK bank and follows on the heels of National Westminster's Pounds 300m issue of mortgage-backed notes launched last week. Securitisation is a funding process which allows banks to take loans off their balance sheet, thereby removing the risk of default and freeing up capital. This is achieved by the banks placing the assets in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling debt securities to investors. Interest payments on the 'mortgage-backed' or 'asset-backed' securities are funded by the loan repayments. The securitisation of personal loans has been widespread in the US but is just catching on in the UK. Syndicate managers could only remember one such securitisation prior to Barclays' offering, an issue of FRNs made by Cardiff Auto backed by car loans. Syndicate managers said many banks and companies, especially those which have leasing or hire-purchase activities, were keen to securitise the loans they had made to individual or business customers. 'Most are looking to securitise high-volume, low-value loans,' said one syndicate manager. Barclay's notes, which have an average life of 1 1/4 years, were issued through Gracechurch Personal Loan Finance. The portfolio backing the two-tranche offering consisted of unsecured loans of not more than Pounds 7,000 to Barclays' credit card customers, around 95 per cent of whom are of at least three years' standing and have not been in default for more than 30 days. The lion's share of the offering was made up by a Pounds 250m tranche of class A notes which paid 22 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). The pricing was seen to be on the tight side and the whole issue had not been placed by the end of trading yesterday. Lead manager BZW said that the notes were targeted at corporate investors rather than banks because of their 100 percent capital adequacy risk weighting. By contrast, NatWest's mortgage-backed notes, which yielded 20 basis points over Libor at launch, were only 50 per cent weighted. The remainder of Barclays' deal was made up by class B or subordinated notes, launched by UBS, which were priced to yield 85 basis points over Libor. The higher yield reflected the higher risk associated with these notes. Bank of Scotland also tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds 200m undated issue of subordinated notes. They were priced to yield 130 basis points over the 8 per cent UK government bond due 2013, in line with secondary market levels for similar paper. Joint lead manager Hoare Govett said the bulk of the issue had been placed with pension funds and insurance companies. The bonds were re-offered at the 99.204 issue price and were trading inside fees at 98.95 in the late afternoon. Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals company, is thought to be looking to raise Pounds 100m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds at a spread of around 100 basis points over UK government bonds. Turkey is also likely to raise 10-year paper in the Eurosterling sector next week at a spread of 200 basis points. Lex, Page 20</p>

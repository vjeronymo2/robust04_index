			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 June in Mexico, Cuban Foreign Investment  Minister Ernesto Melendez stressed the need to revalue the Latin  America Economic System [SELA] and adapt it to the new  international situation. Melendez heads the Cuban delegation to  the 20th SELA Ministerial Council.    The three-day meeting will focus on regional integration and  SELA's role in the 21st century. SELA will also discuss the  negative effect for Latin American economies of the increase of  bank interest rates implemented by Washington. Each added  interest point immediately results in a significant increase in  the already bulky foreign debt of South American countries.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Curbs 'mar free-trade stance' - Gatt takes US to task over barriers in bilateral disputes Gatt's latest report on US trade policies and practices, published yesterday, warns that domestic pressure for bilateral action against Japan and others threatens the openness of the US trade regime and the multilateral system. As the world's largest trading nation, with imports and exports at 14 and 12 per cent of world trade, 'any distortions stemming from trade intervention have significant adverse effects on world trade and the international economy,' Gatt says. The report, written before the latest flare-up in US-Japanese trade relations, says the growing role of international trade in the US economy, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the completion of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks have all helped to bring trade issues to the centre of domestic economic policy debate. By and large, the US remains a very open economy, the report makes clear. This has helped to boost productivity and competitiveness, smoothed the path of industrial adjustment and aided production and export growth 'without the dramatic employment losses experienced by other countries'. However, Washington's adherence to free-trade principles is marred by high tariffs and other trade barriers in agriculture and textiles, continued bilateral pressure to prise open foreign markets and a significant increase over the past two years in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions. Gatt notes that, despite improved competitiveness and higher US export earnings, falling US saving rates, 'largely associated with federal budget deficits', have generated current account deficits. This has resulted in pressure for protection against high-saving countries with which the bilateral deficits are greatest, the report says. Gatt takes a generally dim view of recent US agreements aiming to increase access to Japanese markets. Though most of these refer to imports from all sources, they are focused on sectors of particular export interest to the US. Two industry-to-industry deals relate specifically to US-made goods, notably one on car parts concluded in January 1992 under which Japanese carmakers agreed to double imports of US components between 1990 and 1994. The report says the US has recently made 'relatively restrained' use of its unilateral trade powers under Section 301 of the US Trade Act and related legislation. Only six new Section 301 cases were initiated in the two years to June 1993 compared with an average of nearly five a year since 1974. Nevertheless, the existence of these procedures remains a running sore with trading partners who, as the report remarks, point to 'the contradictions inherent in laws aimed at opening markets based on threats to close the US market'. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions - increasingly labelled the protectionists' weapon of choice - have increased in the past two years, partly due to a flurry of steel suits brought after voluntary export restraint arrangements expired in 1992. The number of anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders in force rose from 204 and 70 respectively in June 1991 to 268 and 86 in June 1993. The share of imports subject to orders grew from 0.2 to 0.9 per cent of total goods imports between 1988 and 1992. Alleged bias in the operation of US laws has led to a rising number of challenges under Gatt's anti-dumping and subsidies codes. Accusations of trade harassment are given some credence by the fact that 80 per cent of investigations result in preliminary findings of dumping under semi-automatic procedures. However, when brought to the International Trade Commission of the US, nearly half the cases are thrown out because the alleged dumping has not been shown to cause injury to the domestic industry.</p>

A search of Mulat's luggage produced a large wooden  crucifix,  religious material and a notebook containing verses copied from  the Bible, as well as photographs of the man's family. The  hijacker told investigators that he was a Copt and was of a very  religious nature.    The 43 passengers and crew on board the Ethiopian Airlines  Boeing 757 (not 747 as stated previously) will be flown to Addis  Ababa on the same aircraft at around midnight (2300 GMT) Monday  night.</p>

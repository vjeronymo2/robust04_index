			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner to build multi-media cable network TIME WARNER, the US media group, yesterday announced plans to build in Orlando, Florida, the most ambitious inter-active cable-based home entertainment and communications network yet attempted in the US on a commercial basis. The company, which runs the second-largest cable television business in the US, said it would eventually integrate this new operation, which it calls a 'full service network,' into its other cable markets across America. The move is an important step in the gathering battle over which industry - cable television or local telephone companies - will be the main conduit providing multi-media services to the home. Mr Gerald Levin, chairman of the group, said that the move 'clearly establishes cable's technology as the primary pathway for information and entertainment.' Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said the full service network being introduced in Orlando would allow consumers to call up movies on demand, as well as interactive games and full-motion video shopping. It would also give access to distance learning. The company has also applied for an experimental licence to test personal communications services - a kind of mobile telephone system, similar to cellular telephony - in the Orlando area and also planned to offer customers access to long-distance telephone service providers. This is a direct threat to local telephone companies, which derive a large proportion of their revenues from access charges to link local customers to long-distance telecommunications groups. Orlando is one of Time Warner's main cable television markets, with some 500,000 subscribers. The service will operate initially in an area with some 4,000 residential customers. Mr Levin said the network would be in operation for demonstrations by the end of 1993, and would start serving residential customers early next year. The move draws on experience gained in a well-publicised experiment in the Queens area of New York city over the past year, where Time Warner has been delivering 150 television channels to customers. Cable TV broadcasts into the home using coaxial cable, which until now has been limited both by the the amount of information it can handle and problems in delivering an individual service to customers. Time Warner said it had overcome these problems by installing fibre-optic trunks to small neighbourhoods of a few hundred homes, by advanced information switching techniques, and by digital video compression technology.</p>

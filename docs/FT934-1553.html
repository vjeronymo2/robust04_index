			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Yeltsin in bid to appease opponents Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday displayed signs of compromise with conservatives following the electoral setback for reformists at the hands of ultra-nationalists and communists. In a gesture to the state-owned-industry and agriculture lobby, he signed a decree re-introducing subsidised loans for producers of agricultural machinery, which, along with lending at rates well below inflation, were supposed to have been phased out. In an attempt to pre-empt the crackdown on law and order which will almost certainly be demanded by the new parliament, he issued a decree promising tough new border controls, including the checking of identification papers and of asylum requests. Yeltsin aides have already advised him to try to beat Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist who wants to be Russia's next president, at his own game, for instance by taking the lead on law and order. On foreign policy, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, has said Baltic republics should help Moscow improve the lot of Russians on their territory to counter support for extremist politicians such as Mr Zhirinovsky, who has promised to defend Russians everywhere. In an attempt to appear to be dealing with hidden unemployment which has not yet translated into open job losses, Mr Yeltsin also cut Russian companies' ability to hire labour from former Soviet republics and further afield. Insisting that Russians should have priority on job vacancies, the decree said companies must pay the equivalent of the minimum monthly wage for work permits. Mr Yeltsin also issued another decree to the effect that the central bank had to obtain consent of the Finance Ministry to license banks to conduct operations involving gold. The ministry is headed by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical who wants to unseat the central bank chief.</p>

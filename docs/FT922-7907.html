			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Star wanes for the 'upstart' investor from Bombay TO MILLIONS in Bombay, the success of Mr Harshad Mehta in making the jump from low-paid office clerk to financial magnate, and self-proclaimedly largest taxpayer in the country, has provided proof that there is an escape from urban squalor. But Mr Mehta is now under investigation by police for alleged improper use of money from the interbank market in government securities to fund his equity dealings. His rise and fall mirrors the best and the worst of the Bombay stock market. As the market climbed this year from under 2,000 on the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index to a peak in April of 4,467 largely under the pressure of Mr Mehta's relentless buying (yesterday it closed 36.65 lower at 3,394.48) he became the symbol of the path to easy wealth. In Bombay's rather stuffy financial community, he was an upstart. The son of a cloth trader, he was proud of having done badly at school and college. He mocked the Indian education system by describing himself as a 'B Com, 37 per cent'. He quit working for an insurance company in 1982 and set up a portfolio investment company called by the characteristically aggressive name of Growmore. He liked the wealth that came from success - buying a large fleet of cars, and installing himself in a bungalow overlooking the sea that has a small golf course attached. The establishment eventually accepted him. Shortly after being raided by income tax officials, he was invited by state-owned television to offer his budget night comments. He was immensely well-connected among politicians, bankers and senior civil servants - buying and selling shares for them in transactions that could now come under close scrutiny. He became a legend for the way he could push up share prices, focusing on what he considered undervalued shares and sticking with them. Mr Mehta purchased 5 per cent of Associated Cement Corporation - helping to push up its share price from Rs350 at the beginning of 1991 to an April peak of Rs11,500. He bought similar 5 per cent portfolio stakes in other groups such as Appollo tyres or Piramal luggage - driving up their price as well. Part of Mr Mehta's success was that he knew the inner mechanism of an archaic market structure. The other reason was that he never seemed to lack funds. Last month part of the reason for this emerged when State Bank of India, the largest commercial bank, discovered that it had paid out Rs6.2bn (Pounds 122m) for securities or bankers' receipts (promissory notes in the interbank securities market) which it had never received. State Bank forced Mr Mehta to settle his account - a move that showed up the strains in Mr Mehta's finances. He seems to have turned to help from National Housing Bank, headed by Mr M J Pherwani, who has since resigned. A large cheque issued by National Housing Bank to ANZ Grindlays, India's biggest foreign-owned bank, was endorsed on the back to be credited to Mr Mehta's account. Mr Mehta is a quiet 37-year-old, full of charm. He holds his own in conversation, partly because of the power of his wealth. But as police investigators hover around him, he will have great difficulty in preserving all that he has gained.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (9): Whirlwind of change - Developments in the US - The US telecom scene is in rapid transition with advances in technology, structural changes and intense competition between service providers TEN YEARS after the break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in an anti-trust court settlement, the regulatory framework imposed then on the US telecommunications industry is rapidly breaking asunder as the country braces for the new world of multimedia, inter-active communications. The sector is facing a period of extremely fast change, technologically and structurally, which will produce both big winners and losers. Under the 1984 settlement, AT&amp;T was divested of its local telephone business, which was divided up into seven regional 'Baby Bell' operating companies, each enjoying a monopoly in its own area. Because of their monopoly status, these businesses were prevented from entering the long-distance market, the manufacture of telecommunications equipment, and information services. The rump AT&amp;T business was left with its long-distance and equipment manufacturing operations. However, the long-distance operations had to compete against upstart rivals like MCI Communications on a much more level playing field than before. Technological change is starting to render these distinctions anachronistic. In particular, the ability to translate video, audio and data information into digital form and then transmit it along fibre optic lines is blurring the distinction between the telecoms, computer and media businesses. The biggest changes are taking place in the local telecommunications industry where the monopolies enjoyed by the Baby Bells, as well as the patchwork of non-Bell local telephone companies, are starting to come apart. Several factors are at work here. One is the growth of so-called Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) - companies which establish themselves in metropolitan areas and operate highly efficient fibre optic networks, creaming off bulk traffic from business customers. The Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the industry, has greatly increased the business potential of these firms by giving them the right to inter-connect their networks with those of the local telephone companies. Another is the inroads being made by long-distance companies, which resent the heavy access charges they have to pay local companies to complete the last few miles of call. Many states are now starting to allow long-distance carriers to compete in the lucrative market for intra-state medium distance calls, once monopolised by the local companies. An important development here occurred in August when California, the largest telephone market in the nation, announced that it wanted to open up these short-haul toll calls to competition. Thirdly, the rapid growth of cellular telephone communication is breaking down the monopoly, since it offers an alternative to the local phone company's wired network. Admittedly, the regional Bell companies are among the most important players in the cellular market, since each of them was granted one of two cellular licences in their service areas when these were handed out in the early 1980s. However, they do face competition from independents ,which is likely to be even stronger in the years ahead, following AT&amp;T's launch in August of a Dollars 12.3bn agreed bid for McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest cellular company in the US. This deal has the Baby Bells particularly concerned, for they fear it will eventually enable AT&amp;T to by-pass their lines, thus stripping them of part of their huge access fees. They are complaining that it represents AT&amp;T's return, after a 10 year absence, to the local service market, and they are redoubling a campaign they have long waged to be allowed access to the long-distance market. They are also aggressively trying to improve their position on other fronts. After years of lobbying, they managed in 1991 to get a relaxation of the ban which prevented them entering the information services industry. This prepared the way for Southwestern Bell, which serves Texas and neighbouring states, to make the telephone industry's first big investment in the cable television industry last February, when it agreed to buy two cable systems in suburban Washington DC for Dollars 650m. US West, which serves the Rocky Mountain states and Pacific Northwest, has recently followed that up by making a Dollars 2.5bn investment in the cable entertainment operations of Time Warner, the second largest cable operator in the US and a leading producer of filmed entertainment. The FCC has also helped the phone companies move into this area by agreeing last year that they can provide ' video dial tone' - that is, the transmission of television programmes over their own lines for third parties. But the phone companies still face a big stumbling block to full participation in the cable industry, since the 1984 cable act forbids them to provide cable programming in areas where they also provide a phone service. Still, in a potentially important legal breakthrough, Bell Atlantic, the phone company serving the mid-Atlantic region, won a court case in August which could pave the way for it to offer cable television in its own area. A US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, declared the provisions of the 1984 act unconstitutional, since they violated Bell Atlantic's right to free speech under the first amendment to the US constitution. The case seems set to go to appeal, but it is a clear indication of the way barriers are tumbling. The cable companies, for their part, are keen to muscle into the local telecoms business. Many of the CAPs are owned by cable companies, some of which are also developing plans to enter a new type of radio-based telephony, personal communications systems (PCS), which is expected to begin operating in the US over the next two to three years. All this is putting big pressures on the local telephone companies to improve their efficiency, through jobs cuts and re-organisation of their working methods. A recent example of the trend came in September, when US West announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its workforce, as part of a modernisation programme which will consolidate hundreds of local operating centres into 26 regional ones. It was, said the company, a 'fundamental response to competition that is here, and is going to evolve through this decade.'</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Guinness For the fundamental investor, one of the year's most curious revelations has been that of Mr Warren Buffett's Dollars 265m purchase of Guinness shares. 'Guinness,' Mr Buffett observed last month, 'earns its money in much the same way as Coca-Cola.' As it happens, Mr Buffett owns 7 per cent of Coca-Cola. When he disclosed his stake three years ago, the shares were on the same historic multiple of 17 which Guinness now enjoys. Coca-Cola's multiple has since risen to 34. Is it conceivable that Guinness could go the same way? The criteria on which Mr Buffett invests are a matter of record. The business should be simple, with a strong market position, proven management and a history of consistent earnings growth. Guinness fits the description admirably. The question is how far the market undervalues those qualities. Coca-Cola and Gillette have outperformed the US market by 140 per cent and 80 per cent respectively since Mr Buffett bought into them three years ago. But in the preceding three years, both shares had performed only modestly. In the three years before the Guinness stake was disclosed, Guinness had trebled against the London market. On that basis, Mr Buffett seems a little late for the party. But his record argues against dismissing him lightly. A case might be made as follows. The top four spirits companies in the world - Guinness being the largest - account for only around 15 per cent of world spirits consumption. There are markets in the Far East, South America and Eastern Europe yet to be fully exploited. Even in more developed markets, there is room for a further shift to international brands. Much of Guinness's recent growth has come from jacking up the price of Scotch. That is plainly a finite process; but Scotch is by now only half the business in profit terms. While spirits margins levelled out last year, margins in beer jumped from 12 per cent to 14 per cent. Plainly, Mr Buffett is right to value Guinness's management. Perhaps the most important qualification is that Guinness shares, like those of Coca-Cola, enjoyed their strongest run when the markets put the highest value on growth combined with defensiveness. As pharmaceutical stocks on both sides of the Atlantic have shown lately, the markets can change their minds sharply about that when the business cycle starts to turn up. Then again, stocks like Merck and Glaxo were on very demanding multiples. After Guinness's own modest setback recently, its p/e ratio of 17 is just one point above the average for the London market. Guinness seems unlikely to prove one of Mr Buffett's star investments. He could be on to something just the same.</p>

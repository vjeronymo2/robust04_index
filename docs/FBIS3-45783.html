Wang Yuqing, director of the Planning Department of the  State  Environmental Protection Agency, said that China's environmental  protection action plan -- a ten-year agenda -- will contain the  general objectives of environmental protection, main targets of  pollution control and the protection of the ecological  environment in China by the year 2000.    China's economy has doubled during the past 15 years -- and  is to grow at an estimated 10 percent annually -- which has  caused an acute shortage of power and increasing energy  consumption, 70 percent of it coal.    Speaking at an international seminar on environmental  protection action plan, Wang said that China now faces seven  pressing environmental problems, including water pollution, air  pollution in cities, harmful industrial waste and garbage  pollution in cities, lack of water resources, soil erosion, low  afforestation percentage and grassland degradation, and decrease  of species.    "These environmental problems have greatly affected the  health of the people, hindered the improvement of their living  standard and economic development," Wang said.    He noted that China will formulate industrial and economic  policies for sustainable development, enhance environmental  legislation and law enforcement, and improve existing  environmental protection agencies.    "As a developing country with limited human, material and  financial resources, China will have to set priorities of its  environmental protection work," said the official.    He said that China will focus on environmental protection in  cities, especially 52 major cities on the government's list for  environmental protection, in which the focus should be on the  control of water, air, solid waste and noise pollution.    He disclosed that China has selected about 9,000 major  polluting enterprises as the targets for pollution control.    As far as the protection of nature is concerned, priority  will be given to the protection of biological resources, such as  forests, grassland, desert plants, animals and particularly  precious and endangered species.    Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the State Environmental  Protection Agency, told the seminar yesterday said that it  "still remained an arduous task" for China to create an ideal  environment in the coming years because of its huge and growing  population and rapidly expanding economy.</p>

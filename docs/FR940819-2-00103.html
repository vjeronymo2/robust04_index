			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1981, Microsoft introduced a PC operating system called the Microsoft Disk Operating System (``MS&hyph;DOS''), the original version of which Microsoft licensed to IBM for use in IBM's PC. As IBM's PC experienced considerable commercial success, other OEMs also used MS&hyph;DOS in order better to emulate the IBM PC. In 1985, Microsoft introduced ``Windows,'' a more sophisticated PC operating system product designed for use in conjunction with MS&hyph;DOS. Windows allowed users to give instructions with a ``mouse'' or similar device and also to run more than one application at a time. Microsoft quickly gained a monopoly in the market for PC operating systems worldwide. For almost a decade, Microsoft's market share has consistently exceeded 70%. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, Microsoft's MS&hyph;DOS operating system constituted approximately 79% of the operating systems sold to PC manufacturers. PC&hyph;DOS accounted for approximately 13% of such sales, OS/2 constituted approximately 4%, DR&hyph;DOS constituted approximately 3%, and Unix operating systems constituted approximately 1%. A chart showing these market shares is attached as Exh. 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Development, testing, and marketing of a new PC operating system involves considerable time and expense. A new operating system faces additional barriers to entry, including the absence of a variety of high quality applications to run on the system; the small number of people trained on and using the system, which discourages customers from buying it and software companies from writing applications to run on it; and, since the overwhelming majority of PCs are sold with a pre-installed operating system, the difficulty of convincing OEMs to offer and promote the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Microsoft has used exclusionary and anticompetitive contract terms to maintain its monopoly. OEMs believe that a substantial portion of their customers will want a PC with MS&hyph;DOS and Windows, and therefore feel that they must be able to offer their customers MS&hyph;DOS and Windows. With thin profit margins, OEMs want to obtain these products at the lowest possible cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive ``per processor'' licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased. In fiscal year 1993, per processor licenses accounted for an estimated 60% of MS&hyph;DOS sales to OEMs and 43% of Window sales to OEMs. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Collectively, the OEMs who have such per processor contracts are critical to the success of competing operating system vendors, but those OEMs effectively are foreclosed to Microsoft's competitors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Per processor licenses accounted for an increasing proportion of Microsoft's operating system sales in the 1988&hyph;1993 period. Twenty per cent of all units of MS&hyph;DOS that were sold to OEMs in FY 1989 were sold pursuant to per processor licenses. That percentage increased to 22% in FY 1990; 27% in FY 1991; 50% in FY 1992; and to 60% in FY 1993. A chart showing this increasing use of per-processor licenses is attached as Exh. 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft has further foreclosed the OEM channel through the use of long-term contracts with major OEMs, some expiring as long as five years from their original negotiation date. In some cases, these contracts have left OEMs with unused balances on their minimum commitments, which Microsoft can allow to be used if the contract is extended, but which would be forfeited if the OEM does not extend the contract. These practices have allowed Microsoft to extend the effective duration of its OEM contracts, further impeding the access of PC operating system competitors to the OEM channel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to using anticompetitive OEM licenses, Microsoft has also employed anticompetitive restrictions in certain of its non-disclosure agreements (``NDAs''). Microsoft anticipates commercially releasing Chicago, the next version of Windows, in late 1994 or early 1995. In preparation for its release, Microsoft has allowed certain third parties, including independent software vendors (``ISVs'') who write applications, to have access to pre-release versions of Chicago, a process known in the software industry as ``beta testing.'' This permits Microsoft to receive feedback from the beta testers, and the ISVs to begin writing applications for Chicago prior to its release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In connection with beta testing Chicago, Microsoft employed, as it has in prior beta tests, NDAs prohibiting disclosure of confidential information. In this instance, however, Microsoft sought to impose on certain leading software companies far more restrictive NDAs than it had previously used. These NDAs would have precluded developers from working on competitive products and technologies for an unreasonably long period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through these practices, Microsoft has excluded competitors by unreasonable and anticompetitive means, thereby lessening competition and maintaining a monopoly in the PC operating system market. Microsoft's licensing practices deter OEMs from entering into licensing agreements with operating system rivals and discourage OEMs who agree to sell non-Microsoft operating systems from promoting those systems. By depriving rivals of a significant number of sales that they might otherwise secure, Microsoft makes it more difficult for its rivals to convince ISVs to write applications for their systems, for OEMs to offer and promote their systems, and for users to believe that their systems will remain viable alternatives to MS&hyph;DOS and Windows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Microsoft's exclusionary contracts harm consumers. OEMs that sign Microsoft's exclusionary licenses but offer consumers a choice of operating systems may charge a higher price, in order to cover the double royalty, for PCs using a non-Microsoft operating system. Even consumers who do not receive a Microsoft operating system still pay Microsoft indirectly. Thus, Microsoft's licensing practices have raised the cost of personal computers to consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

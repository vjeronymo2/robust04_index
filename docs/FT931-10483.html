			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Charterhouse deal confounds the sceptics: Robert Peston explains the latest cross-border banking marriage There was no shortage of doubters in the City of London last year when Mr Victor Blank, chairman of Charterhouse, said he was hoping to marry his UK merchant bank to a consortium of continental financial institutions. The UK recession and the lukewarm commitment of the British government to the cause of European monetary union had caused some continental banks and investment firms to reassess whether they really needed a substantial presence in the City. However, Mr Blank was yesterday able to announce that Credit Commercial de France, the French Bank, and the German Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank had agreed after months of negotiation to buy jointly a 90.1 per cent stake in Charterhouse. The deal has a complicated structure. Royal Bank of Scotland, which has owned Charterhouse since January 1985, will retain a holding of just under 10 per cent. The Scottish clearing bank will also keep the capital markets division, which trades debt securities, and the Scottish part of its development capital business, which finances company buy-outs. RBS will receive Pounds 149m in cash, and a separate dividend of Pounds 12.2m. Mr Ken Thompson, RBS finance director, said it was receiving slightly less than the book value - the value in its balance sheet - of Charterhouse's assets. 'In the current economic climate, I think we did well to get that price,' he said. There has been a reappraisal of the value of UK merchant banking businesses since autumn 1989, when Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading bank, paid Pounds 950m to buy the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell. That price was equal to 2.7 times the book value of Morgan's assets. However, Charterhouse would always have sold for relatively less than its rival, because Morgan has a much stronger presence in the highly valued corporate advisory market and Charterhouse has a stronger position in development capital, which traditionally sells at a discount to book value. A third factor militating against a high price for Charterhouse is that a glut of merchant banks has come on the market in the past year. Henry Ansbacher, the small merchant bank, has just been sold to First National Bank of South Africa and Brown Shipley is in the process of being sold to Kredietbank of Luxembourg. Meanwhile TSB Group has said it would sell Hill Samuel if offered an acceptable price - which many have interpreted as a coded invitation for bidders. Kleinwort Benson, on the other hand, has had sporadic talks with Banque National de Paris of France - which already owns 4.8 per cent cent of KB - and Dresdner Bank of Germany about the possibility of those two banks taking significant stakes in it. The Charterhouse deal also highlights two other City trends: The clearing banks which bought or invested in merchant banks and stockbrokers in the mid-1980s, to take advantage of the deregulation of the UK securities market, have been re-appraising those investments. UK merchant banks are increasingly striving to establish links with their continental peers to take advantage of the growing demand from companies for advice on cross-border deals within the European Community. The value of cross-border takeovers within the EC last year was Pounds 29.1bn, 51 per cent up on the previous year, but below the peak of Pounds 33.5bn in 1990, according to Acquisitions Monthly. Mr Blank said that a desire to win a greater share of this market was one of the strongest motives for all participants in the sale of his bank to the two continental institutions. There are precedents for the success of such merchant banking links. Mr David Verey, chairman of the City firm Lazard, said: 'A domestic presence combined with a strong multinational presence is essential to doing the job effectively.' Lazard's success in the cross-border market stems in part from a close relationship with its sister business in Paris, Lazard Freres. Morgan Grenfell's chief executive, Mr Michael Dobson, said it had been 'enormously helpful' to have Deutsche as parent. He said: '75 per cent of our corporate finance deals last year were cross-border deals. In 1987, the proportion was 16 per cent.' However, a close relationship with a powerful continental bank is not essential to success. SG Warburg of the UK and Goldman Sachs of the US are two of the most consistently successful in advising on cross-border deals. Both have tapped the market as independent operators. Meanwhile the investment banking operations of the UK clearing banks have not been notably successful either in their domestic markets or internationally. The clearers have therefore been deciding whether to sell or close these operations or try to integrate them more closely into their commercial banking operations. Both Barclays and National Westminster Bank have taken the latter course, though NatWest's reorganisation of its investment bank has been the more radical of the two. Lloyds closed its merchant bank last year. RBS would have absorbed Charterhouse into its banking operations if it had been unable to find a buyer for it. Charterhouse's executives, who thrived on the autonomy given to them for years by RBS, are therefore relieved that the sale is going through. Mr Blank's next trick, generating new business following the takeover, will be tougher.

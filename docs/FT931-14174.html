			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Japan's bank system unsettled by bad loans: Rescue operation under way A BUILD-UP of up to Y5,800bn (Pounds 30.68bn) in bad loans at loosely regulated non-banks could pose a serious threat to the Japanese financial system, according to a report by the research arm of Nippon Life Insurance, the country's largest insurer. Many of the non-banks are affiliated to commercial banks and large industrial groups. Non-banks are regulated by local government officials rather than the ministry of finance. They lend but do not take in deposits from savers and are usually financed by loans from larger financial institutions, mainly banks. The report by the NLI Research Institute says an extensive rescue operation is under way to prevent any large non-bank from going bankrupt. The non-banks have loans worth Y98,000bn outstanding, about 40 per cent of them to the real estate industry which has been badly hit by the fall in land prices over the last two years. Non-banks had loans worth about Y3,000bn to corporate clients which went bankrupt between autumn 1991 and December last year, the report says. In addition they had loans worth about Y2,000bn to clients which NLI classified as having borrowed excessively. The report says that at least 50 non-banks are being supported by their larger financial affiliates, which have reduced the interest rates they are charging on loans to non-banks. These include 25 non-banks which are affiliated to commercial banks and seven housing loan companies. Of the 50 non-banks which NLI identifies as receiving financial support, about 33 have been given interest rate exemptions and reductions on borrowings worth about Y6,600bn. The report puts the annual value of these interest rate reductions and exemptions at Y2,590bn. The report estimates that 34 of these financially troubled non-banks have bad loans, mainly to property companies, which are worth Y5,800bn. According to finance ministry figures the top commercial banks had bad loans worth about Y12,300bn at the end of September. However this is widely believed to be an underestimate of the extent of bad loans in the financial system, as it does not include bad loans at regional banks and among non-banks.</p>

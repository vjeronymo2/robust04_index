			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Latin American issues tumble Mexican bonds slumped following the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the country's leading presidential candidate. In early trade they fell by more than five points, though they later bounced off their lows in thin volume. Other Latin American debt markets suffered in sympathy. Mexico is considered a benchmark in the LDC market, and weakness there often spills over into neighbouring markets. However, losses in neighbouring markets were not as dramatic as in the Mexican market. In general, the more liquid and volatile Brady bonds fell more sharply than Eurobonds, said Mr Denis Loubignac, a trader at Paribas Capital Markets in London. Mexico's benchmark Brady bond, the 30-year par bond, fell by more than 5 points in hectic New York trading, hitting a low of 66 1/2 before bouncing back to close at 69 1/2 , down from 73 on Wednesday. The Mexican benchmark Eurobond, a 10-year dollar-denominated bond for Bancomext, fell from 90 to 86 1/4 , but rose from its intra-day low of 84, he said. Argentina's benchmark par bond fell one point to 57 1/2 , while its global Eurobond due 2003 fell by about a point to 90 1/2 . Venezuela's par bond slipped by two points to 53 5/8 . Market participants now hope the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party will quickly name a new presidential candidate to reduce political uncertainty and calm the markets. Although the fundamentals of Latin American haven't changed dramatically, the events served as a reminder that 'we are dealing with very volatile emerging markets: there are large risks and large returns,' said Ms Ingrid Iversen, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> YMCA GETS $8,500 GRANT FOR DAY CARE  </P> <P> County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez presented an $8,500 grant to the North  Orange County YMCA on Wednesday to help subsidize its child-care center.  </P> <P> Money from the grant will be used to help pay the five day-care attendants who  work at the center at 1414 S. Brookhurst St. The center provides care for about  25 children in before- and after-school programs.  </P> <P> Sue Kaiser, senior program director for North County YMCA, said the grant was  very much needed. Kaiser said the center primarily serves children from  single-family homes where money is tight and the mother works.  </P></p>

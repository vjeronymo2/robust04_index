He told Interfax Monday that the telephone lines in the  building had been put out of order by hot water from a broken  pipeline. As a result, some telephones were cut off and some  only receive calls from the city, while calling from them is  hopeless.    Officials in the Communications Ministry confirmed for  Interfax the fact of a breakdown in the pipeline which resulted  in disruption of telephone links with the government  headquarters.    City utility services on Monday intended to pump water out  of  the trench where the cable is laid. The cable itself is to be  dried out Tuesday and the damage repaired. If need be, the  entire lines will be replaced.</p>

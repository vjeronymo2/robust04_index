			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sprint improves despite costs SPRINT, the third-largest US long-distance telephone company, yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in second-quarter net income. The improvement came despite a sharp drop in profits from its long-distance business because of new product marketing. The company reported net income of Dollars 94m, or 43 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.28bn, compared with income of Dollars 89m, or 41 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.21bn, in the same period of last year However, its long-distance income totalled Dollars 45m on revenues of Dollars 1.38bn, down from Dollars 73m on revenues of Dollars 1.36bn last year. Long-distance time bought increased by 3.3 per cent. Mr William Esrey, chairman, blamed the profits decline on increased sales, marketing, and advertising expenses in the launch of three new products, aimed mainly at the residential and small business markets. Those products, in turn, reflect the intense competition for market share between Sprint and its larger long-distance rivals, AT&amp;T and MCI. Sprint's local telephone operations, which are shielded from full competition, reported a 7 per cent increase in operating income, from Dollars 166m to Dollars 178m, on revenues up from Dollars 696m to Dollars 743m. The company said access lines had grown at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent during 1992. The company's other businesses produced operating income of Dollars 16m on revenues of Dollars 219m, up from Dollars 15m on revenues of Dollars 217m. For the first half, Sprint reported net income of Dollars 230m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, up from Dollars 173m, or 79 cents, in the first half of last year. The 1992 figure was helped by an accounting change worth 17 cents a share. Excluding that, net income was up 12 per cent. Revenues totalled Dollars 4.49bn, against Dollars 4.37bn.</p>

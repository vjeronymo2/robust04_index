			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cristina Karrer] </F>   [Text] Salah al-Din, Northern Iraq, May 13 (AFP) -- More  than 100 people have been killed in the past two weeks in  clashes between the two main Kurdish groups which have split  northern Iraq, leaders from both sides said.    The fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK  of  Jalal Talabani) and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK of  Mas'ud Barzani) ended early this week, they said.    The DPK has taken the control of the northwestern of  Kurdistan around the town of Dahuk, while the PUK had seized the  southeast, around al-Sulaymaniyah, an AFP correspondent said.    The two groups share with the Iraqi National Congress (INC)  the province of Irbil in the middle of the Kurdish-controlled  area of northern Iraq.    The INC, which says it represents all the Kurdish and Arab  factions opposed to Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, brokered a  ceasefire agreement on Sunday. It is based in Salah al-Din near  Irbil.    The fighting erupted after a private quarrel, the PUK said.    The only clause of the ceasefire so far implemented provides  for INC militiamen to control checkpoints in the Irbil province,  along with equal numbers of PUK and DPK fighters.    INC official Kan'an Makkiyah told AFP Muslim Shiite fighters  from southern Iraq were chosen to be deployed on the checkpoints.    The two remaining clauses of the May 8 agreement, that have  not been yet implemented, provide for prisoner exchanges and the  handing back of captured offices.    Makkiyah said the PDK [as received] has given the INC, which  is to supervise the prisoners exchange, a list of 93 people were  being held by the PUK.    A DPK official denied his group attacked the PUK in Dahuk.  "We only surrounded their offices to force them to surrender  peacefully," he told AFP.    PUK spokesman Muhammad Tawfiq said his faction "has taken  over" the DPK offices in al-Sulaymaniyah only after its own  offices in Dahuk were attacked.    Most of the casualties followed the PUK assault on Qal'at  Dizah and Raniyah, near the Iranian border, on May 2, sources  from both parties said. Twelve were killed in al-Sulaymaniyah  and 12 in Salah al-Din.    The official Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Monday  that  2,800 were killed in the fighting.</p>

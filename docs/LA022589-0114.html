			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH CHATSWORTH PROJECT  </P> <P> After reading Gabe Fuentes' article (Jan. 11) on the environmental impact  report of a proposed $2-billion, 1,300-acre residential and commercial  development in Chatsworth, I felt a need to comment.  </P> <P> According to the report, the estimated 164,840 daily traffic trips generated by  the year 2010 would have a negligible effect on traffic because the builder  plans to extend many unfinished roadways near the project. Who is he kidding?  Is he going to build a second level on the freeways surrounding Chatsworth or  does he think every resident will work within a one-mile radius of the project?  </P> <P> Also, the builder says he will pay $15 million for new schools. Won't children  be bused to these new schools, further aggravating traffic conditions?  </P> <P> I realize that all growth should not and cannot be stopped, but if this is an  example of a favorable environmental impact report, something is wrong with the  system.  </P> <P> LAURA GINDY  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

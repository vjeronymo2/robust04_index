			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Unions warn Blair on plan to modernise Labour The leaders of the two largest Labour-affiliated trade unions yesterday warned Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour party leader, not to pursue his modernisation strategy at their expense. Mr Bill Morris, leader of the 950,000-strong TGWU general union, said the 'jury is still out' on the Blair leadership and described as 'a bit of an insult' Mr Blair's recent description of the unions as a pressure group like any other. 'We are more than a pressure group, we have a special constitutional link with the party,' he said. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, which has 830,000 members, said: 'Tony has chosen not to speak in the traditional tones of the Labour party, he does not use the time-honoured formulas. That gives rise to anxieties.' Mr Blair, who will not speak at the congress but will address TUC leaders at a private dinner this evening, is expected to resist pressure to give public support to striking rail signal staff. But after the blood-letting at last year's Labour conference over the issue of diluting union influence in party elections, neither the union leaders nor Mr Blair want another row. Mr David Blunkett, Labour party chairman, underlined in a speech to the TUC congress yesterday that this should be a period of 'consolidation'. He said: 'We have renewed our links, now it's time for consolidation and continuity . . . we work in complementary avenues, side by side.' Friends of Mr Blair said he was in 'full agreement' with Mr Blunkett on the role of the unions in the modernised Labour party. Substantial arguments over policy are not likely to arise until next year, when a number of Labour policymaking commissions report. The unions will want to hold on to the commitments made by the late John Smith at last year's TUC congress for a substantial re-regulation of the labour market and an economic policy emphasis on full employment. Labour and the unions are likely to differ over the level of the minimum wage, Labour's economic strategy and Mr Blair's plans for changes to the shadow cabinet. The unions fear they will be marginalised in forming Labour policy. However, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, who shares Mr Blair's view that greater distance is in the mutual interest of unions and party, yesterday endorsed Mr Blair's union policy of 'fairness, not favours'.

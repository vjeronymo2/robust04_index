			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo April 26 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] --  A Japan-Korea emergency round-table conversation on the  denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the nuclear issue  was held in Nagoya city on April 13 under the sponsorship of the  Aichi Prefectural People's Council for Japan-Korea Friendship.    Mitsudoshi Omatsuzawa, secretary general of the Aichi  prefectural headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party,  addressing the round-table conversation, said the joint  declaration on the conversion of Northeast Asia into a  nuclear-free, peace zone, which was issued between the Japan  Social-Democratic Party and the Workers' Party of Korea in March  1981, is of weighty significance at present.    Noting that the Japan Social-Democratic Party assumes a  heavy  responsibility in making the Japanese Government approach the  settlement of the problem with a right stand under the overflow  of the informations slandering the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea over the nuclear issue, he stressed the Japan  Social-Democratic Party would support the independent, peaceful  reunification of Korea.</p>

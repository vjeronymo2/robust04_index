			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O. Pronina: "What Saburov Is Saying and Meshkov </F> Is Writing"]    [Text] Rumors to the effect that the price of bread has  doubled in Crimea is unfortunately not an April Fool's Day joke.  Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov was forced to start his practical  activities with that highly unpopular step--elimination of  subsidies for most popular bakery products. He is categorically  opposed to artificial restraints on prices for bread at any  cost, which is what was practiced here, since he believes that  this threatens the bread industry with complete stoppage and  society with a social explosion.    "I am for sensible prices which make it possible to heal the  sick economy," Ye. Saburov stressed at his first press  conference. "We should not drive the disease inward. People must  overcome their fear of reforms, unpopular measures and harsh but  necessary steps."    In order to soften the April-first blow, in accordance with  a  decision of the government, individual payments for purchase of  bread have been increased, primarily for families with many  children and for low-income citizens, by 26,000 karbovantsy a  month. According to data available for March there were 350,000  such people in Crimea. That figure will probably go up in April.    As readers of PRAVDA UKRAINY probably know, more than 100  industrial enterprises in the republic found themselves being  threatened with closure and the dismissal of workers on a mass  scale. The council of the union of entrepreneurs advised the  Supreme Council of Crimea of that and demanded immediate  convocation of an extraordinary session to adopt its own law on  taxation and prevent such a compulsory measure which will bring  concealed unemployment into the open forcing the budget of the  republic into unavoidable bankruptcy. As commonly known 110,000  persons, every seventh Crimean engaged in production, supported  a lockout.    This blow as well will apparently have to be sustained by  the  government of Yevgeniy Saburov until a new Supreme Council is  elected since the current one, completing its last few days, in  accordance with the declaration of its chairman, has no  intention of accepting the terms of the ultimatum.    In reply to the question as to what mechanism the government  has, after all, for resolving the economic problems, Yevgeniy  Saburov stated that an entire package of presidential decrees on  tax policy, currency regulation, banking, and foreign economic  ties is purportedly being readied, which will make it possible  to halt the drop in production. According to the vice premier  all of them are coordinated in general terms with the leadership  of Ukraine and are not contrary to its interests.    By the way, the hope that the prime minister would bring a  team of reformers with him did not materialize. Very few of  those willing to exchange Moscow for Simferopol could be found.  Saburov will therefore have to rely mainly on local cadres.    The content of a message sent by President of Crimea Yuriy  Meshkov to the President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk pertaining  to the shutdown of one of the lines supplying the peninsula with  electric power and a cutback in the supply via two other lines,  became known in journalistic circles.    The Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, it states, is demanding  payment of the debt for delivery of electric power which amounts  to 300 billion karbovantsy (eight million U.S. dollars) a third  of which is the debt of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This  circumstance should be taken into primary account in resolving  the question concerning delivery of electric energy.    The message also notes that in connection with this  sanatoriums and resorts as well as establishments of the  Ministry of Defense of Ukraine are being crippled, and the  broadcast of UT-1 and UT-2 television programs will become  impossible.    "Further developments in this complex situation depend on  your practical actions," the president of Crimea underscores in  his letter to the president of Ukraine.</p>

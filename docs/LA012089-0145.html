			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> CHAPMAN WILL DROP 6 SPORTS AND STAY IN NCAA DIVISION II  </P> <P> Chapman College will eliminate six sports from its athletic program while it  continues to compete on the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II  level, school officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Men's volleyball, women's tennis, men's and women's cross-country and men's and  women's track and field will be dropped beginning the 1989-90 school year.  </P> <P> The decision by the school's board of trustees came after months of speculation  that the school would drop to Division III. Some school officials felt that the  college would be more competitive at the lower division.  </P> <P> "We have a much clearer direction and a mandate from the board which we've not  had in a long time," Chapman's acting President Jim Doti said Thursday. "We can  put behind us the ongoing questions about what level we should be at."  </P> <P> Men's and women's basketball, women's volleyball, baseball, men's and women's  soccer, softball, men's tennis and water polo will remain as intercollegiate  sports.  </P> <P> Coaches of the eliminated sports will not have their contracts renewed, Doti  said. Charlie Appell is the coach of men's and women's cross-country and men's  and women's track and field, John Hancock is the coach of women's tennis and  John Burns is the coach of men's volleyball. Only Appell was a full-time coach.  </P> <P> Appell's contract expires on Aug. 31, Hancock's and Burns' contracts end May  31.  </P> <P> "Even though we're remaining Division II, it's not a day for celebration,"  Athletic Director Walt Bowman said. "We're losing some good friends."  </P> <P> Appell said: "They didn't tell me why (my sports are being cut), they never do.  I have already done my scheduling for next fall. Until 2 days ago, I didn't  think there was anything to worry about."  </P> <P> Doti said the decision to cut the sports was based on student involvement and  spectator appeal.  </P> <P> "Those sports did not enhance -- as others do -- the student life on campus,"  Doti said. "The programs we kept have the potential for success."  </P> <P> By eliminating the six sports, the school will be in a better financial  position, according to Bowman.  </P> <P> However, men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball and baseball  will be the only sports to offer scholarships.  </P> <P> Bowman also said the women's basketball coach would become a full-time position  next year. Current women's Coach Paul Kahn is a part-time employee. Kahn has  guided the Panthers into the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament in  each of his 2 seasons at Chapman.  </P> <P> But Bowman said the school will conduct a "nationwide search" for a women's  coach, as well as a men's basketball coach to replace Kevin Wilson, who was  fired in November.  </P> <P> "I feel I've earned the full-time position," Kahn said. "But, so far Walt  hasn't talked to me about the situation."  </P> <P> Bowman said that Kahn and Rich Prospero, who is the men's interim basketball  coach, were welcome to apply for the positions.  </P> <P> The other sports that have been retained -- softball, men's soccer, men's  tennis and water polo -- will receive funding, but beginning next fall,  athletes in those sports will not receive scholarships. Athletes already under  scholarship will continue to receive funds.  </P> <P> There are no athletes under scholarship in the sports that were eliminated,  Bowman said.  </P> <P> Bowman did not say how many scholarships the school would offer next school  year, only that "it's below the NCAA limit."  </P> <P> The announcement ends weeks of speculation and concern among the members of the  school's athletic department.  </P> <P> "This place has been extremely tense for days," one coach said. "Everyone's  been on edge."  </P> <P> School officials said they delayed the release of the decision until everyone  in the athletic department could be informed. Bowman met with coaches Thursday  afternoon and then with the student-athletes.  </P> <P> "We wanted our people to hear about it from the school first," Bowman said.  "And we wanted time to anticipate any questions."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> correspondent Jaroslav Reznik; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Reznik] The government's  policy statement has been adopted, following a marathon  discussion in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. A  big part of it concerns economic issues. What are the specific  steps the government is to take in this sphere in the near  future? What problems do you perceive as priorities? Is it at  all possible to tackle Slovakia's current very complicated  economic situation without breaking a very fragile social peace?    [Moravcik] Our cabinet has already taken certain steps. It  is  very important that all the measures taken by the cabinet are  taken in the interest of strengthening fiscal discipline and  stabilizing our budget. [passage omitted] Other steps are aimed  at those abroad; we hold talks with our foreign partners to  create better conditions for foreign investors to come here.  The other sphere where we want to make the cabinet's activities  more dynamic is the sphere of privatization. [passage omitted]  Another aspect concerns social peace -- we hold very intensive  talks with our partners on a new general agreement. I can say  that our partners have shown a very positive, constructive  attitude. I am convinced that we will succeed in securing and  preserving social peace.    [Reznic] The Matica Slovenska leadership held a session in  Cadca and adopted a statement calling on political entities  represented in the government of the Slovak Republic to explain  the participation in the coalition talks of ethnic Hungarian  parties and movements -- despite the fact that they are not  represented in the coalition government. What is your view on  this problem?    [Moravcik] I have had an opportunity to discuss this problem  with the Matica Slovenska officials. It is included in our  coalition agreement -- Hungarian political parties support the  government's policy statement and they have expressed their  support by their vote, too. [passage omitted] There is nothing  else, no other document the content of which would be different  from the government's policy statement. According to our  coalition agreement, the representatives of the ethnic Hungarian  political parties are being invited to our talks -- that is,  they have an opportunity to express their view. I think that,  given the fact that they support the government's policy  statement, there is justification to inviting them to  participate in talks. [passage omitted]    [Reznic] Another fundamental sphere is the sphere of foreign  relations. [passage omitted]    [Moravcik] One of the conditions for our integration into  the  European Union, and possibly into other political and security  systems in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, is stability in Central  Europe. We must secure stability in Central Europe and we have  certain outstanding issues in this sphere, above all as regards  our relations with the Hungarian Republic. The problem is  similarly perceived in Hungary, and thus we would like to use  this period to progress a little with the tackling of this  problem. [passage omitted]</p>

At an extended meeting of the cabinet in the Kremlin, the  cabinet chief said that although a market economy already  existed in Russia it needed to progress, taking into account the  fundamental differences in the economic and political situation  which have been created since the beginning of 1994. "We must  pay attention to the lessons learned from the government's  mistakes and earlier programs," he added.    President Boris Yeltsin told the meeting that Russia's  economic situation will remain complicated this year and social  and political conditions quite tough. "The government is  facing very complicated challenges." he said.    The meeting, attended by cabinet members, leaders of the  state executive bodies, parliament chamber speakers and local  leaders, was called to discuss the economic situation in the  country and plan this year's government reform tasks.    Chernomyrdin said he fully agreed with Yeltsin's objective  of  strengthening the Russian state as defined in his state of  nation message to Parliament last Thursday [24 February].    He described it as the basis for continuing reform which  would put an end to the crisis by restructuring the economy and  creating conditions for economic, political and social stability.    "We see no possible grounds for radical changes in the  course  we are pursuing. The government will take guidance from the  program adopted last August and approved by the president, we  shall stick to this program and implement it no matter how  difficult it maybe, " Chernomyrdin stated.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Dollar under pressure despite rate rises The dollar came under pressure on foreign exchange markets yesterday despite Tuesday's increase in US short-term interest rates and efforts by senior Clinton administration officials to talk up the US currency. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates by half a point should help underpin the dollar. Mr Lawrence Summers, the senior official on international affairs, repeated earlier assurances that the Treasury saw 'no advantage to an undervalued dollar'. In late trading in New York, however, the dollar was down more than 1 1/2 pfennigs at DM1.6565 and down just over a yen at Y103.48. Analysts said the dollar was being sold because the positive impact from the tightening of US monetary policy had been more than offset by a Fed statement signalling that short-term rates were now close to a 'neutral' level. The belief that US short-term rates would not be raised again in the near future had reduced the dollar's attractions relative to other leading currencies, economists said. Mr Henry Kaufman, bond market analyst, said the dollar's weakness also reflected the US Treasury's failure to state categorically that further depreciation was unacceptable. It was also depressed by capital outflows and a perception that the German economy was recovering faster than expected. The main aim of the Fed's statement had been to bolster confidence in the US bond market by convincing investors that they did not face a sequence of future rate increases. Yesterday, however, analysts were worried that the Fed's remarks could backfire in foreign exchange markets, where central banks are attempting to stabilise the dollar. 'The downside risk for the dollar went up hugely following the Fed's statement,' said Mr Paul McCulley, chief economist at UBS Securities in New York. He said traders speculating against the dollar had weighed the risk of a rise in US short-term rates and the possibility of central bank intervention to support the dollar. Now they faced only the risk of intervention. US stocks were mixed yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 12.28 at 3,732.89 as weakness in some key cyclical issues prevented the blue chips from building on the previous session's 49-point rally.

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE PREVAILS, 40-39, DESPITE BEING OUTGAINED, 554-243  </P> <P> In a wild offensive show in which Pierce College was outgained, 554-243, in  total offense, the Brahmas still managed to pull the rug out from under East  Los Angeles on the Huskies' synthetic turf Saturday night in the teams'  nonconference opener.  </P> <P> Pierce, which a year ago finished last in defense in the Western State  Conference, salvaged a 40-39 victory when Danny Dolan misfired on a 39-yard  field goal attempt as time expired.  </P> <P> The Brahmas, who had forced just one punt all night, earned a reprieve less  than two minutes earlier when Scott Schaeffer intercepted Larry Razo's pass at  the Pierce six-yard line with 1:51 remaining.  </P> <P> "I've never seen an interception that was any better. I'm not sure he trapped  it or what," Pierce Coach Bob Enger said. "I guess I've got to fire my  defensive coordinator."  </P> <P> Pierce's Louis Vann scored on three two-yard touchdown runs and rushed for 122  yards in 28 carries.  </P> <P> There were four lead changes in the second half and the Brahmas took the lead  for good on Jamie Grossman's 13-yard touchdown pass to Shannon Culver with 4:55  remaining.  </P> <P> Pierce led, 21-14, at halftime and built the lead to 28-14 when Ronnie Harrison  returned the second-half kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Both teams moved the ball virtually at will in a penalty-filled first half.  East Los Angeles was flagged seven times for 70 yards and Pierce was penalized  six times for 52.  </P> <P> The Huskies scored on the game's opening possession, marching 64 yards in eight  plays. Adan Avina, who rushed for 95 yards in the first half and finished with  259 in 27 carries, scored on a 17-yard sideline run and Dolan's kick put East  L.A. ahead, 7-0.  </P> <P> Pierce countered on its first possession, driving 68 yards in 13 plays and  scoring on Vann's two-yard run. Andrew Munoz's extra point tied the score, 7-7,  with 3:45 left in the first period.  </P> <P> East L.A. went ahead on its next possession as quarterback Razo scored on a  six-yard bootleg.  </P> <P> Pierce answered on its second possession as Vann scored again on a two-yard run  to cap a 57-yard drive.  </P> <P> Grossman's 28-yard pass to wide receiver Chad Zeigler with 44 seconds left  rounded out the first-half scoring.  </P></p>

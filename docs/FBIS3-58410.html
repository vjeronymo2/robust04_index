			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michel Jobert, lawyer, former minister of state, </F> and former minister of foreign affairs: "Europe and the United  States: Since They Are Leaving..."]    [Text] They? The Americans. Europeans (and all others)  should start being persuaded and light up their lantern.  However, the evidence has still not hit people's minds.    And yet, the fall debates on the GATT were indeed revealing  of the new behavior of the United States. This fortress,  surprised that its "I want" was not greeted with the customary  obedience, brandished the threat to turn away from Europe and  isolate itself from it. The Uruguay Round ended without leaving  any breathing space to a future world trade organization.  Commercial universality has become the myth and regional blocs  the reality of the next few years. Monetary heresies, cruel for  some and delicious for others, evidently have not been put into  question.    This apparent immobilism contrasts with the strategic  evolution taking place, but silently so given that comments are  rare and hence deserving of note. "The year 1993 will remain  perhaps as important as 1989. Discreetly, without warning, the  Americans have started to disengage themselves from Europe."  This is the opinion, for instance, of Defensa-Eurostrategie's  Philippe Grasset. The fact that under Clinton the reduction of  the U.S. military budget has accelerated has not escaped  attention. In eight years, with the help of inflation, its  purchasing power suffered a three-fourths loss (from $126  billion to $46 billion); how is it possible to limit the demands  of the military-industrial complex, stop waste ($20 billion),  revise an imperial strategy to confine oneself as much as  possible, note the impossibility of simultaneously conducting  two large-scale military operations, give up arms sales, notably  in the Middle East, and no longer hope to have others  finance--as was the case in the Gulf war--operations that are  mainly in Washington's interest? These are questions--perhaps  anguished ones--that caused the fall and departure of U.S.  Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. Yugoslavia, Somalia, Haiti: all  are contemporary failures revealing a deep and durable malaise.  The mid-January meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin at a time  when Russia and its annexes are boiling like a witches' caldron  will add more confusion than clarity. All the more so since the  Americans, in risking money in this mess, have been particularly  tight (20 percent of Western assistance, compared to 80 percent  for Europe).    On the other hand, one must pay attention to the NATO  January  summit. Since the meeting in August 1993, the United States has  lost, in this sacred precinct of its world influence, the  primacy for which it actually did not fight much. Somehow, this  is a historic session: Americans are completely isolated on a  proposal to carry out air strikes in Bosnia under the sole  control of NATO and without a Security Council decision. Since  then, the Clinton administration, increasingly rebellious  against foreign affairs that only interest 2 percent of the  American people, seems to be encouraging Europe to assume  responsibilities and obligations to facilitate its own  disengagement. Slyly opposed yesterday, the Eurocorps has now  become an interesting prospect, perhaps even a model, that  should be developed. Let us not forget to mention Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's hostile statements on Europe, or the  gesticulations of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  summit in Seattle. All these signs seemingly open a less  difficult road for the Western European Union (WEU), which was  vegetating since 1948 and is now progressively becoming a  strucuture of reflexion, liaison, and mobilization for European  national forces.    An entire apparatus, long immobile because of the Cold War  and afterwards the U.S.-Soviet condominium, has begun to move.  However, many seem not to have comprehended this: witness those  French parliamentarians pleading for a return of our country to  NAT0 under the old conditions, an astonishingly blind proposal.  What one should notice, above all, is the mutation and the  departure of the abusive dry nurse, both so reassuring and so  bothersome. The foreign and common security policy explicitly  contained in the Maastricht Treaty ought to be the answer to  this henceforth new situation for the nations of the European  Union. Everything now leads them to act as adults, together if  possible, with everyone assuming full responsibility. Europe's  defense, its strategy, its resources, its sovereignty and that  of its member states will become full-fledged obligations. 1994  will be a demanding, even trying year. To face it standing up  after laying low for so long, is not that an enviable fate for  the peoples of Europe and the best example they can set?</p>

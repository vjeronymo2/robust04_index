			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Personal View: Why Rio must deliver World leaders meeting next week in Rio to discuss the environment and development must come up with concrete solutions to the problems which beset the planet. If Rio is simply a breast-beating session or a stage on which politicians may strut, it is doomed to failure and our planet with it. The context in which the conference takes place is not promising. The developing countries are suspicious of the motives of the developed world. They claim, rightly in my view, that the richer countries will have to put their money where their mouthes are if the poorer countries are to sacrifice their short-term vision of development in favour of more sustainable solutions. Add to that the appalling problems faced by eastern and central Europe and you have a potentially explosive mixture. What are the prospects for success? At the last preparatory meeting in New York, agreement was reached on the 27 principles of the proposed Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. More than three-quarters of the Action Programme called Agenda 21 was also decided upon, including the crucial chapter on the institutional follow-up to the conference. On the negative side, however, the preparatory conference was unable to resolve the finance, technology co-operation, forestry, atmosphere, bio-diversity and bio-technology chapters of Agenda 21. The forestry principles, which the European Community believes should serve as the basis for the negotiation of a legally binding forestry convention after Rio, are still a long way from completion. And omens for the bio-diversity convention are not encouraging while talks on the climate change convention also give cause for concern. The EC supported and will continue to support the establishment at a global level of clear targets for stabilising carbon dioxide emissions, along the lines of the year 2000 target as agreed by the Council in October 1990. We cannot afford to compromise on this. The intransigent position adopted by some countries has resulted in a vague draft convention with many exceptions which verges on the void. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, in some cases, the welfare and perhaps the survival of the planet is being sacrificed to short-term electoral or economic gain. The present weak draft was precipitately accepted by the eco-diplomats of the participating states, perhaps in the hope of a trade-off in another forum, such as the Gatt. In any case, the Rio conference should sound the death-knell for eco-diplomacy as it has been practised up until now. The European Commission will continue to press for a more ambitious and binding convention. The run-up to Rio must be used to strengthen the text. A last effort by the 12 EC member states and by the European institutions should be launched, notably in two key areas of finance and climate change. In finance, the world is looking to the EC to break the deadlock on increased funding to promote the transition to sustainable development in the Third World. Member states now need to put their money on the table, in particular by setting a date for reaching the 1970 UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance. The Commission has been urging member states to agree a EC-wide commitment to attain the 0.7 per cent target by 2000, but some governments refuse to set a clear date. Without this, the EC's commitment to partnership with developing countries will look hollow. So far, the Community's strong negotiating stance in the climate convention negotiations has been intimately linked to its high-profile interest in the use of economic mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, to achieve the necessary changes in production and consumption patterns. There is a firm decision on the Commission's part to introduce a Community carbon/energy tax. The proposal represents a revolutionary departure for our environmental policy since, for the first time on such a supranational scale, a system of prices and market mechanism is to be used for the defence of the environment. Criticism has been voiced, by the European Parliament in particular, of the conditionality of the tax. The conditionality proposed by the Commission represents, at this stage, an efficient way, on the eve of Rio, of drawing the attention of all other states to their responsibilities. Rio is not the end of the race but a timid passage of a new process. Its content, with its reticence and silence, notably on population growth, is not commensurate with the size and the gravity of the problems. The EC has to a large extent already gone beyond the solutions of Rio. We must now open new talks to arrive at additional protocols which will put flesh onto the bare bones of the climate convention. These protocols will thus result in concrete decisions with binding obligations to achieve precise targets. The Commission will not spare its efforts to achieve that.

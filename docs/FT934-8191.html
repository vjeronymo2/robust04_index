			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: China signs Dollars 700m order for six A340s CHINA yesterday signed a contract to buy six Airbus A340 long-range airliners worth about Dollars 700m. The deal, signed between the European aircraft consortium and the China Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC), is a breakthrough for Airbus in the fast growing Chinese aviation market. Airbus expects Chinese airlines to buy about 620 aircraft between now and 2011 to replace older aircraft and provide capacity for growth currently averaging about 30 per cent a year. China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest in Xian and China Northern in Shenyang, are already Airbus customers and operators. China Eastern has already ordered the new A340 aircraft, while two Chinese manufacturers - the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation and the Xian Aircraft Company - are supplying parts for Airbus aircraft. The four-engine A340s ordered by China are powered by CFM56 engines jointly manufactured by General Electric of the US and Snecma of France. However, Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, which also makes engines for the Airbus, yesterday won business worth about Pounds 70m to supply engines, spares and maintenance support for nine Fokker twin engine regional jets ordered by British Midland, the UK's second largest scheduled service airline. The deal is part of a four-year Pounds 275m fleet acquisition plan announced by British Midland. The UK airline is acquiring on lease arrangements 17 jets including five Fokker 70s, five Fokker 100s, and eight Boeing 737-500s to replace 13 older McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and four Boeing 737-300s. Rolls-Royce also won a Dollars 140m order for engines when United Parcel Services (UPS), the US freighter airline, decided to buy ten additional 757 cargo aircraft worth Dollars 600m. The new order will bring to 65 the number of 757s operated by UPS.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE SOCKERS: 1990 MISL CHAMPIONS;  </P> <P> SOCKERS' TITLE OVERSHADOWED BY NAGGING QUESTIONS  </P> <P> A championship, a trophy, champagne and hundreds of people cheering at the  airport are nice. For a while. Then reality returns and the flaws begin to roll  across and block a bit of the sunshine.  </P> <P> A question went unanswered all season by the Sockers. Why were they so mediocre  at times? Mediocrity isn't becoming to a team that has been atop the MISL for  so many years.  </P> <P> Friday in Baltimore, they won their eighth indoor championship, defeating a  Blast team that had a record of 32-20 during the regular season, best in the  league. The Sockers were 25-27.  </P> <P> If the championship helped heal the bruises, it didn't exactly answer the  question.  </P> <P> That bothers defender Kevin Crow.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of problems this year," he said. "That all gets covered up  because you win. I don't think that's right. You can't forget we were 25 and  27. There's no good reason for it. We definitely should have been a much better  team during the season."  </P> <P> Why they weren't successful is difficult to explain. Things certainly improved  in March, when Zoran Karic was traded to Cleveland for Paul Wright, who gave  the Sockers added speed and a more complete defense. But the Sockers took their  time even after Wright's arrival. They waited for the playoffs before lifting  their game and mystifying their opponents the way they have done so often in  the past.  </P> <P> Crow thinks the Sockers are due for a few adjustments.  </P> <P> "I just think there's got to be a fresh and a new attitude brought into this  team," he said. "I think we can definitely become a better team next year."  </P> <P> To do that, he suggests a more structured training schedule.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying we have to run like dogs," he said. "I'm saying we have to  become better players. And that comes down to training."  </P> <P> The guy in the middle of all of this is Socker Coach Ron Newman. Newman has won  eight championships, but the bottom line is he still doesn't command a lot of  respect from his team.  </P> <P> "There's not enough respect all the way down to the rookies," Crow said. "And  that's something that's got to be addressed."  </P> <P> It has often been said that Newman would be lost without all the talent. He has  a response.  </P> <P> "My answer is, this isn't the only team I've ever won with," Newman said. "I've  won without (these players)."  </P> <P> True enough. He has championships in both the American Soccer League and the  North American Soccer League. Newman's strengths have always been his knack for  knowing when to leave players alone, his keen eye for talent and his ability to  use the rules to his advantage.  </P> <P> But Newman has been criticized for not providing necessary technical  instruction to younger players, and not being capable of motivating and  communicating with the team on a consistent basis.  </P> <P> With one-year remaining on his contract, Newman said he fully expects to be  back next year. Right now, he isn't sure about when he wants to retire and  wonders if he wouldn't be bored without the pressures and challenges of  coaching. He said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of coaching for another  team.  </P> <P> "A brand new franchise," he said. "Somewhere where there are no ghosts. It  would be an interesting challenge."  </P> <P> Then again . . .  </P> <P> "I'd have to weigh the pros and cons. As you get older, you're really not that  much of a gypsy. I've really always felt that I'd like to stay here for good."  </P> <P> Without question, his job isn't simple. Problems started before this season  began when Socker Owner Ron Fowler and President Ron Cady decided that Steve  Zungul should be signed to a preseason contract as a reward for his  contributions to last year's championship.  </P> <P> As it turns out, Zungul, who is 35 and has arthritic hips, wasn't willing to  accept his role as a reserve player and Newman wasn't willing to play him on  the basis of his clipping file. Zungul and Newman's strained relationship  smoldered all season and had an adverse effect on midfielder Branko Segota, who  really only played to his potential during the championship series.  </P> <P> The Sockers managed to escape their problems this season, but Crow isn't sure  they can continue to do that unless key players such as Segota can turn in  better performances earlier in the season.  </P> <P> "Branko and some of these guys have got to realize it's not like the old days,"  Crow said. "You can't go on cruise control during the regular season."  </P> <P> Cruise control won't do in the off-season either. There are problems to solve.  Crow said there will likely be a 10% to 15% reduction in the salary cap,  currently at $875,000. Maximum player salaries will go from $90,000 to $70,000.  </P> <P> That means the Sockers of today won't all be the Sockers of tomorrow. Many  players deserve raises, but with the cap going backward rather than forward  some veterans with higher salaries might have to be gone.  </P> <P> "I think it's just a pretty unfortunate situation," midfielder Brian Quinn  said. "You win a championship and you'd like to reward everybody, but you can't  because of the financial problems in the league."  </P></p>

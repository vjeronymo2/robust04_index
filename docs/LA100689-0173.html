			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION FIRES BACK AT CRITICISM OF FAILED COUP;  </P> <P> NO REGRETS SAYS THE PRESIDENT  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today launched a vigorous defense of its handling of  the failed coup in Panama, saying it would not have done anything differently  and that "we did the best we could with the information available."  </P> <P> Privately, Administration officials said the United States was guilty of  shortcomings in intelligence matters and other areas. "I hope we will have  learned some things from this and be a little better next time," said one  senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Publicly, the White House said President Bush was satisfied with the U.S. role  but disappointed that rebels had failed to depose Panamanian ruler Manuel  Antonio Noriega.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Not Regretted  </P> <P> Bush said today that he does not regret his decision against intervening  militarily, adding, "There was never a chance to have (Noriega) handed over to  us."  </P> <P> "We reviewed all the information, and I don't see anything now that would have  made me make a different decision then," Bush told reporters as he emerged from  Walter Reed Army Medical Center after minor surgery on his finger.  </P> <P> As the Administration mounted its defense, the nation's top military leaders  went before Senate committees investigating the Administration's actions,  including whether rebel troops sought U.S. support while the uprising was in  progress.  </P> <P> The Intelligence and Armed Services committees met in closed session with  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, to press for the details.  </P> <P> After the three-hour session, Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) quoted Cheney and  Powell as saying they "basically . . . would not have changed their decision  and recommendations to the President, based on what they know today."  </P> <P> The two panels planned to issue later today an analysis of issues that remain  in dispute surrounding the events in Panama and contacts between the rebel  officers who organized the coup and U.S. officials.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of things in dispute" said Armed Services Committee Chairman  Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), referring to media and other accounts that he said are "all  over the lot." He declined further comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Best We Could'  </P> <P> At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush "feels that we  did the best we could with the information available and he feels he made the  right decisions."  </P> <P> Bush, after meeting with Republican senators at the Capitol earlier today,  denied that there was a lack of communications during the coup attempt. He  added that senators "don't feel that way either."  </P> <P> For the first time, the Administration publicly pinpointed the wife of coup  leader Maj. Moises Giroldi as the person who tipped off U.S. officials about  the planned coup. She contacted U.S. officials last Sunday, Fitzwater said,  disputing a Wall Street Journal report that she had made contact three weeks  ago.  </P> <P> The newspaper said Adella Bonilla de Giroldi on Sunday night arranged for a  meeting between her husband and two officials from the CIA. It said the CIA had  confidence in the rebels but the U.S. military did not.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Euro MPs to debate Irish policy on abortions THE European Parliament will press ahead with a debate on Ireland's abortion policy today, despite the Irish Supreme Court's decision yesterday to overturn a High Court ruling preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from terminating her pregnancy in Britain. The parliament's legal affairs committee will debate the issue on the grounds that it has raised important issues of principle for the European Community. Mr Willi Rothley, the German socialist MEP who called for the debate last week, said that the supreme court's decision was 'only an individual solution'. Mr Geoffrey Hoon, the British Labour MEP and a member of the committee, added: 'I hope the court has decided the case on the principle that it cannot interfere with the right of Irish citizens to travel freely to other parts of the Community'. Mr Gerhard Schmid, a German socialist MEP, was emphatic. 'We must redefine conditions for EC membership. I propose that only states which have experienced the Age of Enlightenment could be members of the Community. I doubt whether in fact Ireland can stay in the Community'. Ireland's Supreme Court registrar said the injunction against the girl had been set aside but the legal reasoning would not be given for several days, leaving open the possibility that the controversy may be far from over. The decision was cautiously welcomed by Irish politicians. The Irish government is paying the estimated Pounds 50,000 cost of the family's appeal and Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said last night that the decision 'may have other implications and I want to examine the judgment in detail before commenting on it. But if the appeal has been allowed, then this case is now out of the way.' Mr Reynolds, visiting London for Anglo-Irish summit talks with Mr John Major, added that it was up to the rape victim and her family to make up their minds what to do next. There is concern within the EC that ratification of the Maastricht treaty could be in jeopardy, because of the special protocol excluding Ireland from EC law in cases where it contradicts Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion. Mr Alan Shatter, the opposition Fine Gael justice spokesman, argued this week that if the Maastricht treaty was ratified with the protocol included in its present form, it could put the controversy back to square one, despite yesterday's Supreme Court ruling.

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple turns in small profit as revenues soar to record level APPLE Computer reported a small profit for its fourth quarter as gross margins on its personal computer products slid from more than 40 per cent to about 26 per cent amid industry-wide price cutting. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 2.7m , or 2 cents a share, down from Dollars 97.6m, or 81 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.14bn, the highest level in the company's history and up 21 per cent from Dollars 1.77bn in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992. To compensate for lower gross margins, in its third fiscal quarter Apple announced a sweeping restructuring. As a result of these changes, fourth quarter operating expenses were reduced by Dollars 80m or 13 per cent, the company said. 'We have challenges ahead of us, but I believe we are beginning to turn the corner,' said Mr Michael Spindler, president and chief executive. 'Our new prices for Macintosh computers . . . led to brisk sales and market share gains during the quarter.' For fiscal 1993, Apple's net income was Dollars 86.6m, or 73 cents a share, down from Dollars 530.4m, or Dollars 4.33 a share, last year. The company took a pre-tax charge against earnings of Dollars 321m in the third quarter. Revenues rose to Dollars 7.98bn from Dollars 7.09bn in 1992.</p>

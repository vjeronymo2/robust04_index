			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Saatchi chiefs subscribe to Pounds 5m open offer Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, yesterday formally completed its emergency recapitalisation package and announced that 240 of its senior managers had subscribed to a Pounds 5m open offer for shares, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Late last month Saatchi concluded weeks of tense negotiations by securing shareholders' approval for the recapitalisation. It involved a Pounds 55m rights issue and preference shareholders swapping their stock for ordinary shares, after which Saatchi's ordinary share capital has increased nearly tenfold to about 1.54bn shares. The Pounds 5m management offer, which was underwritten by Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, involved issuing 28.49m shares at 17.55p each. Mr Louis-Dreyfus, who had pledged to buy at least Pounds 1m of shares in the management offer, now holds 8.79m shares.</p>

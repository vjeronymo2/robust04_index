			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Weng Hsu-yuan (5040 0650 0954): "Lu Ping </F> Speaks on Financial Arrangements for New Hong Kong Airport,  Hopes Chris Patten Can Leave Hong Kong by Chek Lap Kok Airport"]    [Text] Beijing, 24 May--Lu Ping, director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said here today:  We hope to resolve the issue of the new airport's financial  arrangements as quickly as possible and then discuss outstanding  issues in the Airport Corporation Bill. He added: The Chinese  side hopes that the new airport can be completed by 1 July 1997  so that Chris Patten can return to London by plane from the new  Chek Lap Kok airport at Lantau.    When meeting with the 60-plus representatives of the alumni  association of Hong Kong's Pui Kiu Middle School at Diaoyutai  State Guesthouse today, Lu said: The Airport Committee meeting  was held a few days ago. The Chinese side hopes that the  financial arrangements for the new airport can be settled at an  early date. Lu pointed out: "We have repeatedly made clear that  the new airport will belong to the special administrative region  [SAR] government after 1997, that the central government will  never take any money from Hong Kong, that the SAR does not have  to hand over any taxes to the central government, and that it is  completely independent financially." Lu stressed: In arguing  with the British side, the Chinese side is arguing for the Hong  Kong people. The increase in the SAR's financial reserves from  HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] at the start of the  Sino-British talks to HK$25 billion is the result of the Chinese  Government's haggling with the British side. This is in addition  to the Land Fund, which is estimated to be HK$100 billion by  1997. Beijing has thus created a fairly good condition for the  future SAR government and laid a fairly solid financial  foundation. Therefore, if the airport's debts far exceed the  financial reserves left for the SAR government, is it not the  case that the SAR government will get nothing in the future?  How can it get along then? Lu said this was not a numbers ploy.    Lu said: We hope to resolve the airport financial  arrangements at an early date and then discuss the draft  regulations for the Airport Corporation. There are a lot of  issues, such as who will administer the airport and how?  According to the provisions of the memorandum, the airport will  be administered by the Airport Authority which, as a legal  person, has independent management rights. But this right must  be subject to certain checks. It should not be outside the  supervision of the SAR government, which must be responsible to  the Hong Kong taxpayers.    Lu said: After 1997, the Hong Kong people will run Hong  Kong. The work of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] and the  Preparatory Committee is all aimed at the joint participation of  Hong Kong people. They provide assistance to Hong Kong people  to realize the future administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong  people. He said: Deng Xiaoping has said to us on several  occasions that it is absolutely necessary to believe that Hong  Kong people can run Hong Kong well.    At the meeting, some people raised the question of high  property prices in Hong Kong. Lu replied: The PWC economic  sub-group is discussing this issue. It should be resolved  properly but it should not lead to a slump in property prices.  If a large quantity of land is supplied now, many buildings  will just be completed in 1997 and this will affect the SAR  government. Before 1997 this issue is handled by the British  Hong Kong Government. Lu said: The Chinese Government hopes to  avoid great fluctuations in property prices in Hong Kong before  1997. It is hoped the issue can be solved properly so that the  people's livelihood and Hong Kong's status as an international  financial center will not be affected by high property prices  and that the SAR government will not be greatly affected.    As for the transition of civil servants, Lu reaffirmed that  the PWC did not ask civil servants to make known their  positions. The Basic Law has stipulated the transition of civil  servants. With the exception of 20 or so senior officials who  should be nominated by the SAR chief executive and appointed by  the central government, other civil servants may continue to  serve the SAR government. Lu said: The British Hong Kong  Government wants to select the principal officials of the future  SAR government before 1997. This is impossible because this is  tantamount to selecting principal officials in place of the SAR  chief executive and violates the principle of Hong Kong people's  autonomy.    At the meeting, some members who are indigenous residents of  the New Territories raised the question of the amendment to the  New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill. According to a Hong Kong  Government official, after comprehensive amendment, the bill  does not violate the Basic Law. Lu said that it is necessary to  read this bill clearly. If the amended bill approved by the  Legislative Council contradicts the Basic Law, it will be  proclaimed null and void after 1997.    Lu said: The Chinese side is still striving to cooperate  with the British side but what is more important is to focus our  attention on the Hong Kong people. If there is no cooperation,  work in the transition period will be more difficult, but the  Chinese side is confident a stable transition can be achieved by  relying on Hong Kong people.    Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese  Affairs Office, who attended the meeting with Lu Ping, spoke  highly of the contributions made by the Pui Kiu Middle School in  training talented people for Hong Kong. The visiting delegation  of overseas alumni of Pui Kiu Middle School is headed by Chang  Hua-feng and Ling Wen-cheng.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Jaguar Cars to cut staff in US by 10% JAGUAR Cars, owned by the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday it is cutting its US staff by 10 per cent immediately, agencies report. Jaguar said the move followed a 12-month review of the company structure, after an intensive reorganisation in mid-1991. The luxury carmaker blamed the cuts on the depressed car market, saying sales in the prestige sector were not improving. Ford Motor Company posted a Dollars 158.9m loss in the third quarter of 1992. Its European operations were dragged down by the Jaguar unit, which posted a Dollars 100m operating loss in the three-month period. Ford said it was continuing to wring costs out of Jaguar which it bought in 1990, but was having difficulty curtailing the operating loss due to the continuing fall in car sales.</p>

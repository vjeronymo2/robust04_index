			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Observer: Facing the music The only glitch in the first of the Breakfast With Frost programmes on BBC yesterday morning was that it ended with Britain's prime minister being cut off while he was trying to answer the final question. Surely the 9.15 start of the next children's programme could have been delayed by a few seconds so that the PM could have been thanked for getting up so early to give Sir David Frost's flagship show its first exclusive? The Beeb, whose time keeping on its own news bulletins is hardly perfect, says that the PM was in 'such good form' that he just carried on talking too long. As for Sir David, dubbed by some snooty BBC types as their answer to CNN's unctuous Larry King, he blames the music, or rather the lack of it. Normally, the playing of the final signature tune is a cue for the interviewee to shut up. Unfortunately, it was barely audible. Sir David promises louder music in future.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Telecoms weigh on Brazil and Mexico BRAZILIAN equities stayed weak yesterday, the Bovespa index falling 2.1 per cent to 23,112 at noon following a drop of nearly 6 per cent on Monday, writes Bill Hinchberger. Fresh corruption allegations involving President Fernando Collor de Mello compounded the fall on Monday, triggered by the expiry of stock options. The Sao Paulo market's poor performance was also put down to a shying away by investors, both foreign and domestic, from shares in Telebras, the state telecommunications company. Telebras was down 2.7 per cent by midday yesterday, after a 6.8 per cent fall on Monday. Investors sold Telebras shares at the start of June when the government suspended the company's ADR offering. There have been rumours that the government may privatise Telebras's subsidiaries, instead of selling off the holding company. Telebras has also announced disappointing profit figures for April. Meanwhile in Mexico, Telmex, the telephone company and bellwether stock, pushed the market down 3.7 per cent on Monday, the largest fall this year, writes Damian Fraser. While the stock was marginally higher early yesterday, the market is more than 8 per cent below the peak of 1,907 on March 26. Mr Jorge Mariscal, of Goldman Sachs, attributed Monday's 3.7 per cent drop in Telmex to fears about the free trade agreement, and the weight of new equity that the market will have to accommodate. Next week, Banacci, the financial group comprising Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, will offer Dollars 1.5bn worth of stock to domestic and international investors.</p>

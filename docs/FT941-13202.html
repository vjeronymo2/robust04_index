			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Public-sector wages strike brings disruption to Lisbon A 24-hour national strike by Portuguese public-sector workers yesterday seriously disrupted hospitals, schools, courts, public transport and other services. Unions said the action was backed by up to 90 per cent of workers concerned. The strike was in protest against a proposal by the centre-right social democrat government to limit 1994 pay rises in the public administrative sector to 2 per cent. Unions are demanding a 9 per cent increase. The strike was the first to be jointly backed by both the communist-led CGTP-Intersindical and socialist-dominated UGT union confederations. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, has made clear that his government aims to set an example for private-sector employers by keeping pay rises low. This follows the collapse of efforts to negotiate a national wage pact between unions and employers. Union leaders said yesterday they were prepared to call a jointly backed one-day general strike if the government refused to negotiate a compromise on pay. The government is concerned that a public-sector pay increase above 2 per cent would fuel inflation and increase the budget deficit, which is forecast to fall from 8.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993 to 6 per cent this year. Public-sector unions claim that the government pay offer represents a sharp cut in real earnings, given that the forecast inflation rate for 1994 is 6 per cent.</p>

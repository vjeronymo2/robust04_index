			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Friday he is not considering any immediate steps  to counter the U.S. decision to reinstate the "Super 301" trade  retaliation provision.    "No, none at this moment," Hosokawa said when asked if the  government may take action against the U.S. move announced  Thursday.    Hosokawa said he was informed of the U.S. decision in a  telephone call by President Bill Clinton.    "We agreed to deal with the matter coolly," he said.    Hosokawa later ordered cabinet ministers to give priority to  opening the telecommunications market and the distribution  system in working out economic deregulation to provide foreign  firms wider access to the Japanese market, government officials  said.    The officials said Hosokawa issued the order at a meeting  held after a regular cabinet session.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi told the meeting that  the  government's emphasis on deregulating housing and real estate  would not help improve overall relations between Japan and the  United States because Japanese imports of housing-related goods  are limited, the officials said.    Hosokawa said deregulation of the telecom market and  streamlining the distribution system should be added to the list  of priorities, they said.    In a related development, Posts and Telecommunications  Minister Takenori Kanzaki told reporters Friday he is not sure  whether a dispute with Washington over mobile phones can be  settled quickly in private-sector negotiations.    He said the talks are nearing a conclusion, but it is not  known if they will bring about a quick solution.    Motorola Inc. of the United States and Nippon Idou Tsushin  Corp. (IDO) of Japan have been discussing U.S. demands for  boosting foreign access to the Japanese cellular phone market  since Washington announced plans in mid-February to retaliate  against Japan over the dispute.    Washington, accusing Japan of breaching a bilateral 1989  trade pact, has threatened to raise its tariffs on imports of  Japanese telecom goods and possibly other products.    It has set March 17 as the deadline for unveiling a list of  Japanese imports to be targeted for retaliation.    Japanese business leaders deplored the U.S. Administration's  decision to reinstate the super 301 clause.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), said super 301 runs counter to the  spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aimed at  freer world trade.    He called on the Japanese Government to promote the opening  of Japan's market.    Kosaku Inaba, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said the Clinton administration apparently wants to  use the clause as a tool to take the upper hand in its trade  negotiations with the Japanese Government.</p>

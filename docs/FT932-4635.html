			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softens after big boost THE DOLLAR softened slightly against the D-Mark yesterday following the US currency's powerful performance on Friday in the wake of the May payroll report, writes James Blitz. Friday's non-farm payroll figure, showing a net rise of 209,000 on the month, was well above market expectations, and the dollar rose 3 pfennigs that day to close at DM1.6225 on what dealers said was a huge volume of dollar buying. However, at least one dealer talked of some selling into the dollar rally on Friday evening, and that mood continued yesterday as bank dealers took profits following the big move. The dollar lost 35 basis points on the day in London to finish at DM1.6190. In New York it ended trading at DM1.6195. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, believes the dollar's next move against the D-Mark is still upwards, because of the familiar problems of the German economy. But he also thinks that President Bill Clinton's political problems are becoming an increasing hindrance to the dollar's rise in the short term. The Democrats' loss of Texas in last weekend's senate by-election may make it more difficult for the president to get his energy tax bill through Congress. At the same time, the president has been facing new difficulties getting officials nominated to key posts in the administration. 'Some of Mr Clinton's political problems need to be cleared up before the next big move upwards,' said Mr Hannah. The D-Mark continued to look soft against most European currencies yesterday, above all the peseta, which rallied powerfully in the wake of the victory for Mr Felipe Gonzalez's PSOE in the Spanish elections. Foreign exchange dealers had assumed that Mr Jose Maria Aznar's Partido Popular would have aggressively cut interest rates had it been elected. The assumption in the markets yesterday was that Mr Gonzalez would be more cautious about rate-cutting, and Spanish money market interest rates were unchanged yesterday. The peseta closed at Pta76.84 to the D-Mark from a previous finish of Pta78.27. It remained in second place in the ERM grid with a divergence indicator of plus 49 percentage points. The French franc again performed well against the D-Mark, ending at FFr3.370 from a previous FFr3.372. Sterling weakened against the D-Mark in Monday's early Asian trading as dealers continued to take the view that there could be a near term cut in UK base rates. However, although the pound touched DM2.45 in trading in Australia, rate-cutting fears dissipated in Europe. Sterling finished at DM2.4650, up 1/4 pfennig on the day. Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, believes the pound is likely to retain a floor at DM2.45, considering economic difficulties in Germany.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: POSTER/CABINET CAN KEEP MUSIC BEHIND THE SCENES  </P> <P> An Arizona company has introduced an inconspicuous way to store compact discs  and cassettes at your home or office -- in a wall cabinet hidden behind a  framed poster.  </P> <P> Behind the Scenes Storage Frames are customized metal-framed posters and  storage cabinet combinations that open to reveal a music storage cabinet,  similar to a medicine cabinet. The poster "door," which is hinged to the hidden  cabinet, opens with a magnetic touch release. And the cabinet is constructed of  melamine-covered, almond-colored particle board.  </P> <P> The poster/cabinet combination, which protrudes only 4 3/8 inches from the  wall, comes in eight sizes. Available in horizontal and vertical, the smallest  poster sizes are 18 1/2 by 20 inches; largest, 32 1/4 by 36 inches.  </P> <P> The artwork ranges from museum quality to pop art, from Picasso to Nagel.  Though there are also many signed, limited edition posters available, customers  may supply their own posters or original artwork to be made into storage  cabinets.  </P> <P> Behind the Scenes Storage Frames for compact discs can be ordered to hold 36,  48, 54, 60, 72, 90 or 96 cases. CDs fit in clear acrylic holders -- each stores  6 -- that give you front viewing, and also swing out for a side view of the  five CDs behind.  </P> <P> The cabinets for cassettes can be ordered in 63, 84, 93, 105, 124, 126, 155 or  168 cases and feature shelves to store tapes vertically.  </P> <P> Prices for Behind the Scenes Storage Frames start at $179.95 for CDs; $139.95  for cassettes. To order, contact Parallel Productions, 919 W. Mission Drive,  Chandler, Ariz. 85224; phone, (602) 899-8057.  </P> <P> Get a Handle on Grocery Bags  </P> <P> A new handle to help shoppers carry more than one plastic bag at a time without  hurting their hands is so simple it's a wonder no one thought of it before.  </P> <P> Grocery Tote, designed by Eric Stoft and Bill Cloonan of Sylmar, is a  heavy-duty blue plastic handle with hooks at each end to keep the shopping  bags' plastic handles locked in place. Stoft advises shoppers to place the  heavier bags on the tote handle first, so they can easily balance a large  number of bags at the same time. The underneath portion of the handle has  finger grooves to give shoppers a comfortable grip.  </P> <P> Grocery Tote weighs a few ounces, so it's lightweight enough to carry in a  purse or back pocket. It retails for about $2 and is available at Ralphs  markets or by mail order from Castech Enterprises, 13145 Bromont Ave., Suite 7,  Sylmar 91342; phone, (818) 367-4474.  </P> <P> Lean on This  </P> <P> Back pain bothering you? You might want to try a German-built inflatable lumbar  support cushion that was designed for cars but seems to work just as  effectively in airplane or train seats, or on office furniture.  </P> <P> Zender Aerodynamiks of North America, based in Anaheim, is offering the durable  cloth-covered cushion, originally constructed to fit current model Volkswagen  seats and other high-performance auto seats, for about $38.  </P> <P> The inflation bulb attached to the cushion works like the armband machines used  to test blood pressure: You turn the valve slightly and pump up the pillow to  the desired firmness; to deflate it, turn the valvee the other way.  </P> <P> Said a Zender representative, "I use one in my chair at the office for back  support."  </P> <P> The cushions are available at any of Zender's 2,200 nationwide auto accessory  dealers. If you don't have one of the company's dealers in your area, contact  Zender Aerodynamiks of North America, 2267 Via Burton St., Anaheim 92805; or  call (800) 672-6060 in California, (800) 421-5544 outside California.  </P> <P> Parenting Advice  </P> <P> On Sept. 7, the National Parenting Center, a new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week hot  line began offering parents expert child-rearing guidance in seven categories  -- pregnancy, newborn, infant, toddler, preschool, preteen and adolescent. The  service can be accessed only from touch-tone telephones.  </P> <P> Television director-producer David Katzner, who also runs an independent  production company in Los Angeles, began working on the concept for the center  shortly after his daughter Alana, 2 1/2, was born.  </P> <P> "Suddenly I found myself searching everywhere for information on how to be a  parent," Katzner explained. "The National Parenting Center was a natural  extension of my own search for child-rearing information."  </P> <P> Callers to the center will receive child care information from one-minute tapes  made by nine of the country's top physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists,  psychologists and authors on subjects ranging from teething to temper tantrums  to truancy.  </P> <P> After listening to the tape, the caller can cut through to a voice-activated  response system, which includes the option to leave a question for an expert  and receive a written opinion.  </P> <P> Cost for calling the center is $1.95 for the first minute; $.95 for every  minute thereafter. Parents also may buy memberships via phone for $19.95 a  year, which includes a touch-tone phone, a monthly newsletter with updates on  new topics, novelties, brochures, and discounts on books and videos. To reach  the center, call (900) 246-MOMS. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

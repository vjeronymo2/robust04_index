			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hamlet listing with Pounds 20m tag HAMLET GROUP, which imports clothing to supply the UK retail trade, is planning to come to the London market next month with a share offering of about Pounds 20m. More than half the shares on offer are expected to be placed with institutions, with the rest to be offered through intermediaries. Beeson Gregory are the sponsors. Hamlet, which began as a family concern in east London in the late 1960s, was acquired in 1987 by Southend Property Holdings in a cash and shares deal worth more than Pounds 14m. In 1992 a management buy-out was completed, leaving the management and Causeway Capital with 80 per cent of the company and Southend Property with 20 per cent. About one third of the Pounds 20m listing proceeds will be new money; another third will be used to repay preference capital; and the remainder will go to existing shareholders who are sellers. Causeway is not selling any of its ordinary shareholding of about 35 per cent. After the flotation, existing shareholders are expected to have about half the company. Mr Aharan Nathan, managing director, said the proceeds would be used to reduce debt and increase working capital for future expansion. In the year to the end of March, Hamlet reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 3.1m) on turnover of Pounds 58.9m (Pounds 32.8m). About a half of Hamlet's business is in budget priced menswear, with 35 per cent in ladieswear and the remainder casual clothing. Its customers include C&amp;A, Top Shop, Freemans and Dorothy Perkins. Aside from one of its subsidiaries, no single customer accounts for more than 5 per cent of turnover. At the same time no single supplier accounts for more than 10 per cent of its supplies. Overseas suppliers are situated from Hong Kong and China to the United Arab Emirates, Greece and Portugal.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / US sends high-powered team to meet ministers The US has rediscovered the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the Paris-based forum for economic policy co-operation among the world's top industrial nations was of declining interest for Washington, although the US is its biggest shareholder. But this year's annual ministerial meeting, which finished yesterday, attracted an unusually high-powered US delegation. Mr Warren Christopher was the first US secretary of state to attend an OECD ministerial meeting in over 10 years. He was flanked by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary; Mr Ronald Brown, Commerce secretary; Mr Robert Reich, Labour secretary; Mr Mickey Kantor, US special trade representative, and Ms Laura Tyson, head of President Clinton's council of economic advisers. Mr Christopher made clear the Clinton administration had high ambitions for the OECD. It could 'be a model and an instrument of wider integration in the post-Cold war world', rather like its predecessor, the OEEC, in Europe in the early post-war years. The OECD, through its policy analysis and co-ordination, could help more countries enter the community of advanced industrial nations, Mr Christopher said. It could 'assume a new importance in the architecture of the global economy, as a bridge between the Atlantic and Pacific industrial economies.' Mr Christopher and Mr Brown praised the efforts of the OECD in recent years and the role of its secretary-general Mr Jean-Claude Paye. But the sudden enthusiasm of the world's largest industrial state for the OECD is a mixed blessing for Mr Paye, who is seeking another five-year term from the end of September after 10 years in the job. US officials stressed yesterday they were determined to maintain their support for Mr Donald Johnston, Canada's candidate for the post. As expected, the meeting failed to reach consensus on the appointment, leaving OECD ambassadors to continue talks on the merits of Mr Johnston, Mr Paye, Mr Nigel Lawson of Britain and Mr Lorenz Schomerus of Germany.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Upjohn places freeze on wages, hirings UPJOHN, the US pharm-aceuticals group, is implementing a temporary freeze on hirings and salary increases from today as it completes a lengthy strategic review of the business. A company spokesman said the policy review, designed to improve the company's operating performance and margins, might be completed by the end of the month. Upjohn's shares have been subject to periodic merger rumours, but an Upjohn spokesman said yesterday that its 'strategic vision' included the belief that it was 'in the best interests of all stakeholders to remain an independent pharmaceuticals company.' Analysts noted that patents on three of Upjohn's leading drugs - including Halcion, the sleeping pill recently banned in the UK - were due to expire in the next two years, suggesting Upjohn would need to clamp down on costs.</p>

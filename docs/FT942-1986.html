			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / BAT unit accused of boosting nicotine in tobacco The US subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries is using a genetically engineered form of tobacco with high nicotine content in some of its cigarettes. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco publicly admitted the use of the high-nicotine tobacco yesterday after Mr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug Administration, accused it in Washington of secretly developing the strain. Mr Kessler told a House of Representatives sub-committee that officials at B&amp;W had instructed contract researchers who helped create the genetically altered tobacco plant, code-named Y-1, to mislead his agency about its existence. He said Y-1, which is grown in Brazil, contained more than twice the nicotine found in normal tobacco plants. Nicotine, a toxic substance, is a stimulant in small doses and is also addictive. Mr Kessler's accusation is the latest in a series of potentially damaging charges against the tobacco industry. The House sub-committee is seeking to determine whether the FDA can legally regulate tobacco as a drug. The FDA chief also said some chemicals on a list of tobacco additives released by six cigarette manufacturers in April were used to increase nicotine levels. Tobacco companies, for example, routinely added ammonia to cigarettes as an 'impact booster', doubling the amount of nicotine a smoker inhales. Mr Kessler said: 'The findings lay to rest any notion that there is no manipulation and control of nicotine undertaken in the tobacco industry.' B&amp;W officials admitted privately to the FDA last week that this high-nicotine tobacco had been used in its Raleigh, Richland and Viceroy brands, according to Mr Kessler. Those were 'distributed nationally in 1993'. B&amp;W said last night that Y-1 had been originally developed by the US Department of Agriculture in the late 1970s, in an attempt to find a tobacco that would yield less tar for a given amount of nicotine. The company had taken up the work and applied unsuccessfully for a patent for Y-1 in 1991. It said the brands in which Y-1 was used represented less than 0.5 per cent of the total US market last year. Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, said last night that cigarettes containing Y-1 had proved unpopular and had been largely withdrawn. Mr Kessler said yesterday that 'several million pounds' of Y-1 tobacco was currently stored in warehouses in the US and could be used at any time. Philip Morris wants to change, Page 30</p>

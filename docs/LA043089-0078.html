			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THIS FOOT PATROL STALKS BEAUTY AND SERENITY ON LONG MARCH TO THE SEA  </P> <P> He would appear in the late afternoon, walking south through the hills toward  Mulholland Drive -- a man in his early 60s in ordinary street shoes, his head  covered by a terry cloth cap.  </P> <P> He carried no water, and Jill Swift of Tarzana, coming down the mountain from  her afternoon hikes, was curious and concerned.  </P> <P> "Where are you bound for?" Swift finally asked one day. Just walking home, he  replied, to the other side of the mountains.  </P> <P> His name was Chris Clegg, and he was an Englishman who had competed as a race  walker on three continents. For exercise and diversion, Clegg would hike from  the San Fernando Valley through the Santa Monica Mountains to Pacific  Palisades. There were many ways to do it, and he was so familiar with the  network of fire roads and trails that he sketched his own maps.  </P> <P> Swift, a Sierra Club member, was impressed by this and something else: Clegg  did not have a car. He came by bus to the Valley to start his hikes and walked  or rode a bus to his Beverly Hills apartment after reaching the other side.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Unique Outdoor Experience'  </P> <P> "I had never known anybody who did not have a car and was able to get around on  the mountains this way," Swift recalled. "To me, he epitomized some of the  things that we're lacking in the Los Angeles area in terms of . . . using  public transportation and being able to get to some of these natural areas for  a very unique outdoor experience."  </P> <P> And Swift also thought: "If he can do it, we can do it too."  </P> <P> Swift's meeting with Clegg more than eight years ago inspired the  "Valley-to-the-Sea" hike, now something of an institution among local hiking  enthusiasts.  </P> <P> One Sunday a month, hikers meet at the end of Reseda Boulevard for the trek to  Pacific Coast Highway, a distance of 10 to 15 miles depending which trails are  used. And although a few hikers leave cars on the other side, most return to  the Valley by RTD bus -- as rare an adventure for some as the hike itself.  </P> <P> "It's a destination hike," said Swift, 60, who usually serves as leader.  "People love to be able to say, 'I've walked from the San Fernando Valley to  the ocean.' "  </P> <P> "When you tell people, 'I walked from my house, practically, to the ocean' . .  . I love the reaction," said Ruth Reingold of Woodland Hills. "I mean, they  didn't know it could be done."  </P> <P> Normally about 25 hikers show up, with others choosing from a smorgasbord of  hikes the Sierra Club leads in area mountains on Sundays. But to avoid  competing with volunteer trail building last Sunday at Point Mugu State Park,  the selection of hikes was limited, creating a heavy turnout for  "Valley-to-the-Sea."  </P> <P> A mob of 48 hikers showed up last Sunday at the trail head at the end of Reseda  Boulevard in day packs, lug soles and T-shirts exhorting "Support Your Local  Cat House" and "Save the Chocolate Mousse." They were from Northridge,  Chatsworth and Woodland Hills, but also Long Beach, Pico Rivera, Fullerton and  Costa Mesa. There were college professors, aeronautical engineers and  homemakers, a bank teller, a real estate salesman, a film projectionist and  others. And although a majority were in their 40s and 50s, others were in their  60s or 70s.  </P> <P> Most did not look their age, which one man attributed to hiking.  </P> <P> "I'm actually 150 years old," he quipped.  </P> <P> "And I'm his father," another said, "that's the amazing part."  </P> <P> The group moved out just after 8 a.m., heading south along Fire Road 28. The  dirt road climbed gently along the floor of Caballero Canyon, past sycamores  lining the sandy bed of Caballero Creek. In the early morning damp, the land  was like an herb garden, with the pungent smell of wet sycamore and sage, and  showy white blossoms, called pearly everlasting, leaving a lemony smell on the  fingers when touched.  </P> <P> In less than a mile, the road crossed into Topanga State Park, bent sharply  southeast and climbed steeply to the hard earthen surface of Mulholland Drive.  In front of the hikers, Rustic Canyon, loaded with dense, green growth, opened  to the south, while at their backs, Reseda Boulevard etched a line across the  Valley to the Santa Susana Mountains, rising in pale blue haze to the north.  </P> <P> It was 8:45 a.m., and time for the day's only speech. Swift pointed to a nearby  ridge that is to be heavily graded for a housing development. "I want you to  look at that ridge and remember," she said. "When the bulldozers come, please  don't call me and say, 'Why didn't you do something?' "  </P> <P> Crossing over Mulholland Drive, the hikers turned southwest along the Bent  Arrow Trail, a rugged footpath clinging precariously to the wall of Rustic  Canyon. Much of this trail was built by a man who was going through a divorce  and by another then separating from his wife.  </P> <P> Swift would come up the canyon with sandwiches and drinks and hear them  pounding away. They had no choice but to cut the trail along a steep slope,  "with all kinds of impediments to construction, such as rocks, tree stumps,  poison oak . . . ticks etc.," Swift said.  </P> <P> "It was great therapy," she said. Their need "to work off negative energies is  quite evident in the construction of that trail."  </P> <P> It may be the sweat and physical exertion, the riot of sights and smells, or  maybe just the lack of indoor plumbing, but hiking seems to bring out a certain  earthiness in otherwise proper people. One man stopped along the Bent Arrow  Trail, announcing as he waved on the last of the women hikers: "Go ahead, I've  got to water my lily."  </P> <P> About 9:15 a.m, the hikers reached a saddle, a low point between hills, and  paused briefly in an open meadow knee-high in wild oats. Then they turned south  onto the Garapito Creek Trail, which corkscrews to the bottom of Garapito  Canyon, a deep cleft full of bird song and dense, jungle-like greenery.  </P> <P> The trail turned to the southwest as it climbed from the base of the canyon,  opening up to beautiful views of the summits to the west. Just before 10:45  a.m., the trail turned onto Chocolate Ridge and reached Eagle Rock, a huge tan  outcropping of conglomerate rock that, at 1,957 feet above sea level, was the  highest point on the hike.  </P> <P> Turning down a fire road and then onto the Musch Trail, the group tramped  through hilly grasslands into the heart of Topanga State Park. Often during  this season, these meadows are ablaze with color, but this has not been a good  year for wildflowers. Still, scores of flowers and plants were on display along  these trails, including: nicotiana, purple filaree, wild mustard, yellow and  sticky monkey flower, golden yarrow, fireweed, deadly nightshade, mountain  lilac, wild cucumber, buckwheat, chemise, yucca, morning glory, solanum, showy  penstemon, lupine, Mariposa lily, prickly phlox, blue-eyed grass, bird vetch,  wild rose and Chinese houses.  </P> <P> By noon, the hikers had covered seven miles, reaching Trippet Ranch, the area  of the state park that is accessible by car. Just beyond, they turned onto the  East Topanga Fire Road, where the ocean came into view. Ascending a narrow neck  of land dividing Topanga and Santa Ynez canyons, the hikers looked down on a  study in contrasts: Topanga with its rugged, largely unspoiled green slopes,  and Santa Ynez, with its red-tiled roofs in cookie-cutter housing tracts.  </P> <P> On another day -- say, of torrential rain or 109-degree heat -- these people  might have wished they had slept in. But this was a day of brilliant sunshine  and cool breezes, and a mood closer to rapture. Asked why they go hiking, here  is what some of them said:  </P> <P> "It's very invigorating. It's a basic thing," said John O'Sullivan of Woodland  Hills. "You go from point A to point B, and you feel like you've accomplished  something. And you've done it without a skateboard or turbo power."  </P> <P> "I like the exercise. I like the fresh air. I like the people," said Dave  Morafka of Los Angeles. "There's a sense of accomplishment in making it to the  sea. It's sort of impressive to look on a map and see the difference between  your starting and ending points."  </P> <P> "Every weekend I go on a hike at least 10 miles long," said Doug Demers of  Canoga Park. "I burn off excess energy from sitting in an office all week . . .  I like this hike because when I'm done I can soak my feet in the ocean."  </P> <P> "If you're mentally depressed or you have a heartbreak or something that's  bugging you . . . a good hike just seems to clear your mind," said Reaven  Barnes of Reseda.  </P> <P> "I hike once a week, and I hike for the beauty," said Cathy Govaller of Pico  Rivera. "This is my beauty fix . . . Then also there's the camaraderie of  kindred spirits, all out for the beauty of it."  </P> <P> "I can't get to the Sierra very often, but I have this in my own back yard, and  I feel very fortunate," said Marcia Ehrlich of Tarzana. "We wear our old  comfortable clothes . . . and whatever our titles are during the week that our  jobs bestow on us, we're all people interacting, enjoying the same thing --  nature."  </P> <P> "I get out every Sunday. I've taken many 12-, 14-, 16-mile hikes," said Robert  Shoemake of Northridge. "It changes a person's outlook so much . . . I can get  home, and I feel like maybe I've been on two or three weeks' vacation."  </P> <P> Said Richard Pardi of Woodland Hills: "That's the purpose of the whole hike: to  get to Gladstone's" fish restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway "for a cold beer.  After 15 miles, they're waiting . . . The mug is in the ice. They see me  coming. They just pour."  </P> <P> About 1:30 p.m., the hikers reached Parker Mesa above Pacific Palisades. To the  south and east, foam piled up along the beach and boats scooted in front of the  fog-shrouded hump of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The Century City skyline stood  out to the east, with the towers of downtown Los Angeles beyond.  </P> <P> No one would have confused the scene with Yosemite or Alaska, but it was very,  very nice. In the middle of one of the world's biggest cities, the hikers had  covered a dozen miles of semi-wild lands, accompanied by bird song and  astonishingly little trash. Even the austere steel buildings on the horizon did  not mar the panorama, conveying instead a sense of natural possibilities in the  heart of urban sprawl.  </P> <P> Turning off the East Topanga Fire Road, the hikers descended steeply through  dense thickets and a garden of ferns to Los Liones Drive.  </P> <P> A short distance beyond, Pacific Coast Highway served up a rude dose of  reality. It took a full five minutes for a red light to part the sea of cars  rushing by at near-freeway speeds. But finally there opened a path to the  beach, and a chance to dip tired feet in the ocean.  </P> <P> It was a little after 2 p.m. All over Los Angeles, people were coming off the  back nine, or battling the crowds at shopping malls, or watching the game of  the week. And 48 hikers were completing a walk from the Valley to the sea.  </P></p>

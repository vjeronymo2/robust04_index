			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hochtief, Holzmann draw interest in Frankfurt The continental bourses went their own diverse ways yesterday for no apparent reason. FRANKFURT retreated a further 1 per cent but turnover was low. The Dax index fell 21.97 during the official session to 2,096.76, recovering slightly in the post-bourse to 2,100.55. Turnover was DM5.5bn. Some brokers have become cautious on Germany as the shadow of the federal election on October 16 has begun to be cast over the country's financial markets. Merck Finck remarked that since December 1993 the Dax had moved in a range between 2,000 and 2,270, while during that same period volatility had risen. It expected this sideways trend to continue ahead of next month's polling. BNP analysts were more positive on a six month view, having upgraded weightings in cyclical and financial shares, underweighting domestically-orientated companies, and observing that the market remained attractive on an earnings yield basis. BNP had a target of 2,660 for the Dax by the end of next year. The main news was an announcement in the contruction sector that Hochtief intended to raise its 20 per cent stake in Holzmann to 30 per cent. The former's shares put on DM4 to DM1,030, while the latter rose DM19 to DM882. Hochtief said that it would purchase the stake from BfG Bank. Holzmann, the country's largest construction group, later said that it was willing to co-operate with Hochtief, but would maintain its independence. PARIS edged down a notch as investors awaited tomorrow's budget, even though most of the proposals have already been factored into prices. The CAC-40 index lost 1.72 to 1,922.87. JP Morgan commented that given the expected neutral stance of the budget there was unlikely to be a significant effect on sectors. Investors were instead keeping an eye on the presidential elections, scheduled for May 1995, after which key decisions on reducing the deficit would be made. ZURICH turned higher with Roche and Nestle leading the way and Wall Street's morning performance also providing a late fillip. The SMI index rose 11.4 to 2,614.7. Nestle registered rose SFr13 to SFr1,213 in response to Friday's first half figures and as Goldman Sachs raised its rating to moderate outperformer from market performer and also increased its earnings estimates for this year and 1995. Nestle said yesterday that its purchase of Alpo Petfoods in the US from Grand Metropolitan of the UK was aimed at complementing its existing product line in pet care in the US. Roche certificates, SFr110 higher at SFr6,070, found fresh favour with foreign buyers after their lower trend in recent sessions. Ciba bearers climbed SFr4 to SFr774 while Sandoz bearers ended SFr6 weaker at SFr678. Swissair declined SFr5 to SFr850 ahead of the release today of consolidated first half results, with estimates ranging from a loss of SFr25m to a profit of SFr30-35m. AMSTERDAM moderated slightly, the AEX index drifting down 0.49 to 407.09, after testing the 405 support level. Heineken went against the trend, improving Fl 2.90 to Fl 241.00. on news that its was to build a new brewery in China at an initial cost of Dollars 67m. MILAN picked up in the wake of a strong performance from Fiat as expectations grew of favourable first half figures. The Comit index dipped 3.96 to 674.53, but the real-time Mibtel index finished 42 higher at 10,826 as Fiat picked up L100 to L6,600. Among other industrial stocks following Fiat's lead, Montedison edged L7 higher to L1,427 after Friday's 3.2 per cent advance in the wake of half year figures. Snia added L45 to L2,190 while Pirelli added L65 to L2,565. Olivetti, launching a new company, Olivetti Telemedia, to focus on activities in telecommunications and multimedia, dipped L10 lower to L2,035. STOCKHOLM closed the session lower, but recovered from opening lows on news that the Social Democrats had not secured a parliamentary majority. The Affarsvarlden general index closed the day 6.2 lower at 1,443.1, having earlier fallen by 1 per cent. Brokers remarked that comments Mr Ingvar Carlsson, prime minister designate, that he intended an early implementation of proposals to tighten the budget-making process, helped to calm nerves. Turnover was SKr2.4bn from Friday's SKr3.7bn. COPENHAGEN was becalmed ahead of tomorrow's general elections, with dealers seeing no revival until after the vote is over. The top-20 KFX index closed just 0.06 higher at 97.16 but turnover fell to a meagre SKr320m. ISTANBUL fell 3.8 per cent as political uncertainty was triggered by the prospects of a parliamentary by-election which could lead to the collapse of the three year old coalition government. The composite index fell 900.72 to 22,785.09.

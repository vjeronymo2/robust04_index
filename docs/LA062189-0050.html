			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP CONSULTANT ADMITS USING INFLUENCE TO OBTAIN HUD GRANT BUT DEFENDS ACTION  </P> <P> A Republican political consultant acknowledged Tuesday that he used his  influence to obtain a $43-million Department of Housing and Urban Development  rehabilitation and rent-subsidy grant for a developer client, but he insisted  that he acted "within the system."  </P> <P> The testimony by Paul Manafort at a sometimes stormy hearing of a House  Government Operations subcommittee came after local officials from New Jersey  who were affected by the HUD decision complained that they were never consulted  in advance about the grant and did not want it.  </P> <P> Manafort's high-powered lobbying and public relations firm received a $326,000  fee for its work in getting HUD approval of the grant largely through personal  influence with Deborah Gore Dean, an executive assistant to former HUD  Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Became Partner  </P> <P> Later, Manafort became a 20% partner in the development firm that acquired the  326-unit apartment project that benefited from HUD's grant to provide improved  housing for low-income people. The firm bought the units in the Seabrook  subdivision of Upper Deerfield, N.J., two weeks before the New Jersey Public  Housing Authority was notified that HUD had approved the funding.  </P> <P> Manafort said that Lawrence Gay, an associate in his consulting firm, talked to  Dean on Nov. 14, 1986, about the grant and told her that it had the support of  the New Jersey housing authority. She asked that agency to file an application.  Six days later, at the urging of another of Manafort's associates, New Jersey  officials complied and the grant was approved by HUD the following February.  </P> <P> "A very smelly, sleazy business," said Rep. Christropher Shays (R-Conn.). "I  feel it wasn't a meritorious project. People who knew how the system worked  were able to get their project approved even if it wasn't meritorious."  </P> <P> Manafort, a former Republican campaign adviser, replied: "We worked the system  as it existed. I don't think we did anything illegal or improper."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1,000 an Hour  </P> <P> At one point, Manafort said that it was logical to infer that his firm charged  $1,000 per hour for its work on a project involving low-cost housing and  low-income people that he said came to about $100,000 a year for three years.  </P> <P> "By Washington standards, that is not very high," said Manafort, who has never  visited the New Jersey housing site. He said that his consulting firm normally  accepts clients only if they pay a $250,000 annual retainer.  </P> <P> Previous witnesses before the subcommittee have testified that Pierce  controlled grants for a moderate rehabilitation program through his office,  with Dean playing a central role. Dean invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege  against self-incrimination when she was subpoenaed by the House panel, but she  indicated that she may testify later if she gets access to HUD documents about  the program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Not Consulted  </P> <P> Unlike another celebrated case in which former Secretary of the Interior James  G. Watt received a $300,000 fee for obtaining a similar grant for an Essex,  Md., low-income housing project, however, local officials were not consulted  and did not back the proposal.  </P> <P> Bruce T. Peterson, the mayor of Upper Deerfield, said that neither he nor his  predecessor was consulted about the rehabilitation plans and were not informed  by the state housing agency when the grant was made.  </P> <P> Most of the units, originally constructed during World War II as temporary  quarters for farm workers, were in such bad condition that they should have  been torn down rather than rehabilitated, Peterson said.  </P> <P> In addition, the rents proposed for the renovated units are much higher than  for comparable apartments in the area, he said, with a corresponding increase  in the amount of federal subsidies that HUD will have to pay to supplement the  partial rents paid by low-income residents.  </P> <P> "I think it's a horrible waste of taxpayers' money," Peterson said, adding that  he would rather have received half of the $43 million to spend as the community  wished on low-income housing.  </P> <P> Manafort insisted that the mayor did not understand the program. He said that  his development firm took a risk by buying the Seabrook apartments because the  New Jersey housing agency advertised for other bidders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Ad Placed  </P> <P> Members of the subcommittee, however, noted that a single ad was placed in the  Millville (N.J.) Daily on May 18, after Manafort's firm had acquired the  property and less than two weeks before Manafort's firm was awarded the  rehabilitation contract on June 1.  </P> <P> "This was a sham and illusion that this was publicly advertised," said Rep. Tom  Lantos (D-San Mateo), the subcommittee chairman.  </P> <P> Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) put it more bluntly, telling Manafort: "They  could have cut out all this language and written: 'The fix is in.' "  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS LAWNDALE;  </P> <P> RED CROSS FEELS HEAT FOR LETTING CANDIDATE PUT NAME ON FLYER;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN: CITY COUNCIL HOPEFUL RON MAXWELL SAYS HE GOT PERMISSION TO PUT A  POLITICAL MESSAGE ON AN EARTHQUAKE SAFETY HANDBILL. THE RED CROSS SAYS IT WAS  ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.  </P> <P> The American Red Cross helps victims of earthquakes, floods and fires, but the  group has found itself in the middle of a political firestorm after allowing a  Lawndale City Council candidate to put his name on an earthquake survival  flyer.  </P> <P> The handbill has the Red Cross' popular public service announcement, "27 things  to help you survive an earthquake," on the back of a political statement by  candidate Ron Maxwell.  </P> <P> Noting that he printed a disclaimer on the announcement stating that the Red  Cross does not support political candidates, Maxwell, 27, says he is bewildered  by the attention the flyer has received.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do it as a public service . . . for the benefit of the community,"  Maxwell said. "I was surprised, if not a little shocked, that my opponents  would be against my informing people how to better prepare themselves for an  earthquake."  </P> <P> Red Cross spokeswoman Peggy McGinley said Maxwell received permission to hand  out copies of the earthquake announcement under the words "Distributed as a  public service by Ron Maxwell, for City Council." But she said Red Cross  officials did not know he was planning to put the message on the back of a  campaign flyer until they received calls about the matter from angry council  candidates and city officials.  </P> <P> They also didn't know the group's logo would appear on the flyer in black  rather than red, in violation of the copyright, she said.  </P> <P> Maxwell, who spent $400 to print 15,000 copies of the flyer, has agreed to Red  Cross officials' request that he stop distributing it and has retrieved several  bundles of flyers from campaign volunteers who were helping him pass them out.  </P> <P> "We've had nothing but cooperation from Ron Maxwell," McGinley said. "It simply  seems to be a misunderstanding or miscommunication."  </P> <P> The controversy nevertheless comes at a sensitive time for Maxwell, who is  considered an underdog candidate in the November election.  </P> <P> Maxwell is one of four candidates vying for a council seat that was left open  when former Councilman Harold Hoffman was elected mayor in April. Also running  for the seat are Bob Cerny, Norm Lagerquist and Gary McDonald.  </P> <P> In an attempt at control damage, Maxwell has spent extra time walking precincts  to explain his case to the voters, a tactic he said has brought good results.  </P> <P> But Councilwoman Carol Norman, who has endorsed Lagerquist in the race and is  among those who complained about the flyer, remains skeptical about Maxwell's  intentions.  </P> <P> "He's either extremely dumb or he (did) it intentionally," Norman said. "I  don't think politically it was the smartest thing for him to do because it  shows him to be less than honorable in his campaigning."  </P> <P> Norman also said the flyer controversy echoes an incident last year in which  Maxwell sent out a mailer urging people to vote and using his title as a parks  and recreation commissioner. Although Maxwell maintained that he did nothing  wrong in sending out that mailer, the City Council nevertheless voted 3 to 2 to  remove him from the commission.  </P> <P> Maxwell has made earthquake preparedness a key issue in his campaign for the  council seat. In his campaign literature, he contends that the city lacks its  own emergency plan in case of an earthquake and that the county's disaster plan  is inadequate to address Lawndale's needs.  </P> <P> City Manager Charles Thompson acknowledged that the city does not have "any  elaborate organization" and that it would be "largely dependent on county  police, fire and public works" in the aftermath of an earthquake. But he said  the city does have an emergency plan that describes the chain of command and  procedures city officials should follow to set in motion state and federal  funding.  </P> <P> Maxwell said he decided to distribute the earthquake instructions only after a  campaign volunteer received authorization to do so from Peggy Brutsche,  director of emergency services planning and training for the Los Angeles  chapter of the Red Cross.  </P> <P> The campaign worker, Bill Foss, said he gave Brutsche two copies of the  two-sided flyer three weeks ago, before any were passed out, and that Brutsche  told him it would be OK to use it.  </P> <P> "I put it in her hand and specifically pointed to the disclaimer, and she saw  the other side had a political message on it," Foss said. "I really, honestly,  feel that we covered our bases as best we could. We really tried to do the  right thing."  </P> <P> Both Maxwell and Foss said they were shocked later to learn that Red Cross  officials were upset about the flyer. Both said Brutsche must have been unaware  of the organization's policies when she gave Foss permission to pass them out.  </P> <P> Brutsche was out of town. But McGinley, who said she spoke to Brutsche on  Friday about the incident, insisted that Brutsche did not know the announcement  was going to be distributed on the back of a political statement.  </P> <P> McGinley also disputed the contention that Brutsche was unaware of the  organization's policies and said Maxwell simply misunderstood the rules.  </P> <P> Brutsche "is our expert on the guidelines," McGinley said. "She deals with  these kinds of requests very routinely. . . . She was very familiar and very  well qualified to make these decisions."  </P> <P> Kevin Ilion, the South Bay district spokesman for the Red Cross, said he  received several angry calls about the flyers before he asked Maxwell to stop  distributing them.  </P> <P> But he added: "We're trying to downplay the incident because it sounded like a  misunderstanding on Mr. Maxwell's part, and we know it's election time and  didn't want this to be a negative reflection on him."  </P></p>

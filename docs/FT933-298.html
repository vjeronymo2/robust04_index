			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (6): Sell-offs will pay for improvements - Sally Bowen watches privatisation speeding up FOR a year widely billed as 'Peru's year of privatisation' 1993 has been surprisingly uneventful so far. But the closing three months should see a clutch of important state company sell-offs. Barring unexpected hitches, the attractive, partly-developed copper deposits of Cerro Verde will be sold on October 13. This will be only the second big public auction of the year - and a full nine months since January's sale of flag-carrier Aeroperu to a Mexican-Peruvian consortium for Dollars 54m. Cerro Verde's potential - with reserves to keep a 40,000 tonne per day concentrator plant busy for 50 years - has drawn a collection of international mining companies to register for pre-qualification. Big names include Cyprus Minerals and Magma Copper from the US; Lac, Cominco and Placer Dome from Canada, Japan's Mitsui and Marubeni and Outokumpu of Finland. Morgan Grenfell, the UK-based investment bank, is promoting Cerro Verde in addition to Mineroperu's three other production units and a collection of as yet undeveloped mineral deposits. It is also under contract to handle December's auction of the telecommunications duo Entel (the 100 per cent state-owned long distance operator) and CPT (Lima's telephone company, in which the state has a controlling 20 per cent). 'We see this as a very exciting market,' says Mr David Suratgar, deputy chairman of Morgan Grenfell International, on an early September visit to Lima. 'Anyone who saw what happened in Argentina - and in Mexico before that  -must find Peru very interesting indeed. We thought it better to be involved at an earlier date.' When the Fujimori government assumed office in July 1990, 11 of the country's 12 largest companies were owned and operated by the state. Heavily overstaffed, protected from international competition and often incompetently managed by the recipients of political favours, the companies  -more than 200 of them - were costing a bankrupt nation about Dollars 2.5bn a year. 'The principal impulse to privatise came from the need for total structural reform of the state,' says Mr Daniel Hokama, mines and energy minister and president of Copri, the small, agile, government privatisation commission set up early last year. 'It has taken an enormous effort to rationalise public companies, reduce staff and make them viable for sell-off.' So far, sales have netted a little over Dollars 250m in cash. But future investment commitments by purchasers will raise that figure enormously. The Shougang Corporation of the People's Republic of China is to spend Dollars 150m on upgrading iron producer Hierro Peru in the next three years; Mantos Blancos, the Chilean subsidiary of South African mining giant Anglo American could invest up to Dollars 500m on developing the copper deposits of Quellaveco, which it picked up for just Dollars 12m last December. Government officials also consider foreign investment through privatisation the only viable way to improve Peru's run-down infrastructure. After years of macro-economic mismanagement, local companies are severely decapitalised and have long been unable to meet expanded demand for public services. Telephones are a striking example. Peru has the worst level of provision in the Latin American continent: 2.4 lines per hundred inhabitants. December's sell-off of the two telecommunications companies should, if the buyer complies with terms of sale, ensure that Dollars 1bn is poured into an expansion programme over the next five years. During the five-year period of exclusivity (or, as Copri prefers it, 'transition to full competition') the winning bidder will expected to double the existing 630,000 lines. Every town with more than 500 inhabitants will be provided with telephone services. And the waiting time will be cut from the present - unbelievable - 10 years to one year by 1996, and to one month by the year 2000. The companies which have already registered their interest are ATT, GTE and South-Western Bell of the US; the UK's Cable and Wireless; France Telecom; Telefonica de Espana; STET of Italy and Korea Telecom. They are likely to form bidding consortia with already established suppliers such as Siemens, Alcatel, Northern Telecom and Kanematsu. 'We're enthusiastic and we're on schedule,' says Mr Suratgar. 'With every week that passes, international interest in Peruvian privatisation is growing.' Not all has been plain sailing. The institutional coup of April 1992, when Mr Fujimori closed congress and suspended the constitution, threw the incipient flow of foreign investment into reverse gear. For a six month period, several sell-offs flopped. Successes were confined to a series of relatively small auctions on the floor of the stock exchange where a handful of local entrepreneurs and some bold Chilean investors picked up bargains. Peruvian privatisation has also suffered its share of errors and near fiascos. Sometimes, exaggerated base prices scared away potential bidders. On other occasions - notably with the sale of Aeroperu - technical errors in the back-up documentation required by Copri raised doubts over procedural transparency. But the privatisers seem to have learned from their mistakes. 'The government undoubtedly overestimated its capacity to handle sales,' comments Mr Augusto Alvarez, an economic analyst and specialist in privatisation. 'But the process is now being managed much more professionally - I foresee no serious problems.' If all proceeds on schedule, Cerro Verde, the telecommunications companies and Centromin, the mining and refining giant, will be transferred to the private sector before the year's end. So will a series of smaller but still important state holdings in two cement companies, the Miski gold mine, the tomato-processing plant of Chao and the Bolivian branch of the Banco Popular. While Mr Hokama expects these to be readily saleable, state utilities (particularly water and parts of the electricity network) will be a tougher proposition. 'Some of the distribution networks are uneconomic or located in areas where security problems remain,' says Mr Hokama. 'The Chileans are hugely interested in the more attractive sectors, but we need to find other bidders to compete with them.' One privatisation card yet to be played is debt paper. Mr Fujimori has long been reluctant to countenance its use, fearing it would mean a field day for speculators. But Copri has its plans laid and is 'ready to handle it the moment we're given the political green light,' said one senior official. Copri now predicts that all Peru's main state-owned companies, with the possible exception of Sedapal, the water company, will be transferred to the private sector by September 1994 - well before the next round of congressional and presidential elections. 'But whatever happens politically, the privatisation process is already irreversible,' says Mr Hokama.</p>

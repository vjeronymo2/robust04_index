			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Scotch industry demands tax change THE SCOTCH whisky industry, faced with a fall in UK sales of 1m cases a year and a spate of job losses, is pressing for a radical reform of drinks taxation. Heavy excise duties have been a significant factor in the accelerating decline of whisky's share of the drinks market, the Scotch Whisky Association says in a pre-Budget submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Since 1979, whisky sales have fallen 30 per cent while wine consumption has increased 60 per cent. The association said: 'The chancellor must act now to remove or reduce the differentials between the duty on spirits and the duty on beer and wine.' It urged the practice of index-linking duty on spirits to be discontinued and that there should be no increase in duty until differentials have been substantially eroded. The association said the UK drinks market had changed markedly since the 1960s and the government response to the changes had been 'woefully inadequate'. While alcohol consumption per head had remained largely unchanged, consumers could now choose from a wider range of products. Whisky had to compete against heavily marketed white spirits such as gin and vodka, a greater variety of beers and, in particular, a much wider selection of wines. A single whisky and a glass of wine contain the same amount of alcohol - but the whisky carries 23p duty compared with wine's 12p. 'High excise duties must have a substantial adverse impact on sales within a depressed market,' the association said. 'Market trends indicate that imported wines have been the main winner - Scotch whisky the main loser.' In the 1960s, Scotch accounted for 60 per cent of UK spirits sales and 10.5 per cent of total alcohol consumption. It now represented 41 per cent of spirits, and 8.6 per cent of the total alcohol market. The association said this decline in sales had led to falling returns to the exchequer. Real excise duty revenue raised from Scotch had fallen by 44 per cent since 1979 and by 26 per cent for other spirits. 'If the chancellor wants to maintain the real value of excise duties from alcoholic drinks, he must switch the burden of taxes from spirits to beers and wines,' it said. Discrimination against spirits in the domestic market had wider implications for the industry, it added. So long as Scotch attracted heavier taxes than beer and wine in the UK, other European Community states were unlikely to ease the tax burden on the product. Beer review dropped, Page 10</p>

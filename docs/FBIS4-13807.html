			<p>BFN     [Text] At today's cabinet session, the ministers learned  that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres disagree with regard to several understandings reached in  the 'Arafat-Peres meetings in Bucharest last week. Foreign  Minister Peres presented Prime Minister Rabin with the  understandings this morning at Ben-Gurion Airport and several  ministers told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that the meeting  between the two men had been difficult.    According to one of the reports, Peres, speaking at today's  cabinet session, said that the whole thing may not work.    After the cabinet meeting, Environment Minister Sarid  asserted that there was no disagreement between the prime  minister and the foreign minister. Sarid said that if  accelerated, the negotiations could be concluded within two  weeks. Sarid stressed that it had been agreed that no  Palestinian prisoners with blood on their hands would be  released.    Finance Minister Avraham Shohat told the cabinet of progress  in narrowing the differences between Israel and the PLO at the  economic talks in Paris. He stressed that Israel was opposed to  the Palestinian demand that every time a closure was imposed,  Israel must fund busy work projects in the territories in order  to compensate the workers subsequently left unemployed.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 24 April  reports  that "Israel agrees to permit three Palestinian police  battalions to enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho 24 hours after  the signing of the autonomy agreement. These battalions  comprise 1,050 policemen. This was reported by our political  correspondent Udi Segal." Our correspondent adds that "at  today's cabinet session, Police Minister Moshe Shahal criticized  the Army for not including the police in the discussions on  security arrangements with the Palestinians. Acting Prime  Minister Shim'on Peres expressed fears that 'Arafat's arrival in  the territories would not be felt sufficiently and fail to  herald a change in the eyes of the residents of the  territories." The report notes that "Peres stressed the need to  conclude the negotiations rapidly. Several ministers reported  that the prime minister was adamant in his refusal to make any  concessions on issues pertaining to the symbols of sovereignty  sought by the Palestinians, such as stamps, Palestinian  currency, and passports."</p>

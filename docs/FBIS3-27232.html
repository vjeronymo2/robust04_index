			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 19 (CNS)--China's State  Information Centre has issued its economic forecast in the first  quarter of this year.    The industrial increase will remain the same as in the last  quarter. The industrial output value of township level and  above will increase by 22 percent over the same quarter of last  year, but will be the same as for the last quarter of last year.  Light industry will continue its increase and remain three  percentage points up over heavy industry.    The increase in fixed assets investment will slow down and  infrastructural construction investment by state-owned  enterprises will increase by 36 percent while technological  renovation investment will be 40 percent up. Both, however,  will be down compared with last year.    There will be a slowing down in money supply, but currency  in  circulation will recover its increase. Various loans will  increase by 22 percent over the same period of last year and  currency in circulation will be 25.4 percent up.    The adverse balance of foreign trade will be improved with  exports expoected to be 18 percent greater than in the same  period of last year while imports are expected to be 21 percent  up. The difference between exports and imports will fall to  three percentage points from 14 percentage points for the first  quarter in previous years. [sentence as received]    Based on the above forecast, the State Information Centre  has  proposed keeping the emphasis on macro-level control. The too  rapid increase in investment should be controlled before the  estalishment of a self-control system for investment.  Speculative capital should be carefully controlled and  restricted. A variety of economic reform measures being newly  implemented should be gradually improved and coordination  strengthened. While disparities between people's earning power  remain, fairness in the distribution of wealth and the raising  of living standards of lower-income earners will need to have  close attention paid to it. The establishment of the social  security system should be speeded up and the income of retired  and unemployed people should be guaranteed.</p>

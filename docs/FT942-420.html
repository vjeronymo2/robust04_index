			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Perverse pensions proposal Sir, As noted in your reports, 'Pensions: the white paper' (June 24), the government's proposals to abolish guaranteed minimum pensions will bear most heavily on early leavers from pension schemes. As a group they can be expected to suffer a significant reduction in the rate of revaluation applied to their deferred pensions. For at least two reasons, it is perverse that this group should be chosen to be the main losers in the current round of reforms. First, the 'early leaver problem' - the poor level of revaluation applied to early leavers' deferred pensions - was the focus of a previous pensions controversy a decade prior to the Maxwell affair. Thus, a problem partially addressed in the mid-1980s is to be exacerbated a decade later. Second, it is widely recognised that employment patterns are becoming more fragmented, with an increasing preponderance of short-term employment over 'jobs for life'. In the course of a career, most employees can now expect to be early leavers from several pension schemes, each providing a modest deferred pension which will be progressively eroded in real terms relative to earnings inflation. Thus, changes in the labour market, coupled with the white paper's proposals, will mean that the early leaver problem will become both more widespread and more severe. It is strange that a package of reforms with the stated intention of restoring confidence in occupational pension schemes should accentuate their prime disadvantage relative to personal pensions, and thus serve to accelerate the ascendancy of the latter. But perhaps this is the ulterior purpose which the government has in mind? Guy Thomas, lecturer in actuarial science, University of Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NF</p>

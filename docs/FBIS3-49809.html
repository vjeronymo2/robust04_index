[passage omitted] "Since the rockets fell  in areas controlled by the Bosnian Army, it appears that the  raids came from the other side," he said. Aikman said the  attacks had not been confirmed by either the UN or NATO, but  that the two air raids had been witnessed by UN forces on the  ground. [passage omitted]    David Owen, the European Community's negotiator in the  Bosnian conflict, said "a very substantial part" of the Croatian  Army was operating in Bosnia and called on the international  community "to react more firmly." Geneva conference spokesman  John Mills refused to comment on the raids Friday [14 January].    A Bosnian Croat HVO spokesman in Mostar said he did not know  to whom the helicopters belonged.    "All I know is that these past few days Moslem forces have  overflown Mostar, the Neretva river and Vitez," spokesman Veso  Vegar said. "We suppose that the helicopters seen yesterday were  Moslem, since the Serbs fired on them." [passage omitted]    In the meantime, two people were killed and 23 wounded by  shelling in Sarajevo Friday, hospital officials said.</p>

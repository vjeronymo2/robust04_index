			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Newsletter by XINHUA reporter Wang Jingcheng (3769 2417 </F> 6134): ``A Flower of Nuclear Science and Technology Jointly  Cultivated by China and Algeria'']    [Text] Algiers, 24 Dec (XINHUA) -- At a little past 10 AM  on 21 December, a special Boeing-767 plane landed on (Ain  Wusela) military airfield 250 kilometers south of Algiers.  Nearly 200 excited passengers, including Algerian government  officials, most foreign diplomats in Algeria, and foreign and  Algerian reporters, walked off the plane and continued the  journey by bus toward a vast stretch of wilderness. Half an  hour later, a cluster of beige buildings appeared on the horizon.    This is the site of (Ain Wusela) Science Town, so named in  Algeria's development plan. The first group of buildings  completed in the science town are those of the 15,000-kilowatt  heavy water reactor built by Algeria in cooperation with China.  On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the establishment of  diplomatic relations between China and Algeria on 21 December,  the Algerian government held a grand inauguration ceremony for  the reactor.    The multi-function heavy water reactor was completed after  five years of close cooperation between Chinese and Algerian  scientists in overcoming various difficulties. China provided  Algeria with technology and a complete set of facilities [she  shi 6080 2457], and trained relevant Algerian scientists and  technicians. During the one-year warranty period, the reactor,  operated by Algerian scientists and technicians, has shown that  it is up to the designed standards in all functions and  composite indexes [zong he zhi biao 4844 0678 2172 2871].    Djebbar, minister of national education of Algeria, presided  over and addressed the ceremony. He said that the Algerian  government is satisfied with the effective cooperation between  the two countries in the high-technology field. During the  ceremony, Algerian Foreign Minister Dembri said the reactor is  entirely for the purpose of scientific research on the peaceful  use of nuclear energy. For this reason, he solemnly declared in  the name of his government: ``Algeria is preparing to join the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.'' His declaration immediately  won warm applause from among the foreign diplomats, and Algerian  and Chinese scientists and technicians present.    The reactor, named ``(As Salam),'' is an important means to  raise Algeria's science research level, as well as an  indispensable installation for training Algeria's nuclear  scientists and technicians. During the course of construction,  scientists and technicians of the two countries combated  sand-storms and droughts, and completed the reactor and  supportive structures on schedule. Moreover, they planted trees,  landscaped the surroundings, and laid a foundation for further  development of the science town in the vast wilderness. During  the course of cooperation, they established a profound  friendship and took pride in cultivating, with toil and sweat, a  flower of nuclear science and technology in Algeria's scientific  and technological field.    The host showed the reactor and its control system to  foreign  diplomats and reporters. In the control center where various  lights were flashing, the visitors listened attentively to a  briefing by an Algerian staff member with a PHd degree. While  shaking this reporter's hand, the Congolese ambassador to  Algeria said: ``I wholeheartedly wish China and Algeria success  in this cooperative project.''    After the visit, Li Dingfan, head of the Chinese delegation  and deputy director of the State Atomic Energy Agency [guo jia  yuan zi neng ji gou 0948 1367 0626 1311 5174 2623 2845], who  made a special trip to Algeria to attend the ceremony, wrote in  the visitors book: ``May the flower of nuclear science and  technology jointly cultivated by China and Algeria bear rich  fruit soon.'' After learning of the meaning of Li Dingfan's  inscription, (Madani), spokesman and director of the information  department of the Algerian Foreign Ministry, said: The  inscription fully reflects the aspirations of the Algerian  people and Chinese people, and the project which symbolizes  Algerian-Chinese friendship will surely further promote friendly  cooperation between the two countries.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Mondale reassures Japanese Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, yesterday attempted to quell Japanese anxiety over the shooting of two Japanese college students in a Los Angeles suburb over the weekend. The two died on Sunday. Mr Takuma Ito and Mr Go Matsuura, a Japanese American, were each shot in the head by a gunman during a car hijacking outside a supermarket last Friday. The shootings, the latest incidents of violence involving Japanese in the US, have sparked a public outcry in Japan. In October 1992 a 16-year-old exchange student was shot dead after going to the wrong house looking for a Hallowe'en party. Over 3m Japanese travel to the US every year, including 50,000 who go there to study in American schools. Mr Mondale said he hoped the incident would not discourage Japanese from visiting the US. 'Most everyone lives a safe and fulfilling life in the United States and are untouched by such horrible criminal behaviour.' He said the recent killings were tragic from every standpoint, including the fact that they gave an 'entirely distorted picture of life in the US,' adding that violent incidents had never happened to him although he had lived and travelled extensively around the country.</p>

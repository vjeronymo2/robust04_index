			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: US side curbs growth at Dawson A 36 PER cent fall in US profits for Dawson International, Britain's third biggest textiles company, almost wiped out gains made in luxury clothing brands such as Pringle and Ballantyne. The company plans to close more US factories in an attempt to reverse its fortunes. For the year to March 27 1993, turnover rose 4 per cent from Pounds 415m to Pounds 431.7m. Pre-tax profits increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 32.1m against Pounds 23.2m, restated in accordance with FRS 3. On the old accounting basis, pre-tax profits rose 6 per cent. US profits fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 11.8m. These figures were flattered by the strength of the dollar. If currency translation effects are stripped out, sales and profits were almost unchanged in real terms. Sir Ronald Miller, chairman, said that the improvement seen in trading a year ago 'had evaporated as the recession regained its grip in the UK and gained momentum in the important continental European and Japanese markets.' The company's mainly US-based Consumer Products division saw sales fall in dollar terms. West Fleece, which makes garments such as jogging suits, lost 'a seven-figure sum' after price competition and technical problems hit supplies to one of its largest customers, US retailer K-Mart. Consumer Products' operating profits fell 30 per cent to Pounds 15.6m. It closed three North Carolina plants last year with the loss of 300 jobs, and is planning further closures, probably in knitting and dyeing. Dawson's other division, Premier Brands, which includes its mostly cashmere-based luxury goods business, saw gains in sales and market share. Dollar strength helped both, and the division reported operating profits 60 per cent up at Pounds 21.56m (Pounds 13.52m). Mr Nick Kuenssberg, chief executive of Premier Brands, said that order books were 'quite good, but shorter than we would like them to be.' Earnings per share rose to 13.3p (11.5p) and the dividend is held at 9p via a proposed unchanged final of 6.1p. Dawson shares fell 6p to 215p. COMMENT Dawson's good businesses are very good and its bad ones are appalling. Can the company turn the failures round while insulating the successes from recession? It will not be easy. The problems in the US are more structural than cyclical: retailers learn to use just-in-time delivery to force suppliers to carry the risk of holding stocks, while the North American Free Trade Agreement threatens to increase competition from low labour cost plants in Mexico. The prospects for the luxury garment are better thanks to the strength of the brands, but still depend on the willingness of the wealthy to splash out. Even with the help of a stronger dollar, the company will do well to make Pounds 36m in pre-tax profits this year. The p/e ratio should be a little more than 15 1/2 , a 10 per cent plus premium to the industrials which seems hard to justify.</p>

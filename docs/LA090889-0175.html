			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS '89;  </P> <P> A LOOK AT THE RAMS' 1989 OPPONENTS  </P> <P> ATLANTA FALCONS  </P> <P> Sept. 10, 10 a.m., Fulton County Stadium  </P> <P> Oct. 8, 1 p.m., Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 5-11.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series, 32-10-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: A tossup between quarterback Chris Miller and running  back John Settle. Miller is a superior athlete who brought an extra dimension  to a dismal passing offense last year. Now if he can only stay healthy.  Meanwhile, the Falcons traded Pro Bowl rusher Gerald Riggs to the Washington  Redskins, leaving Settle as the primary running threat. As gambles go, this  wasn't much of one. Settle rushed for 1,024 yards last year.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: First-round draft choice Neon Deion Sanders, a defensive  back, got all the off-season headlines, but linebacker Aundray Bruce will  finish the year with the most accolades. Bruce finished the year with five  sacks and two interceptions.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . the greening of a Falcon team that  features lots of young, potentially terrific players. Think of the  possibilities should Sanders, wide receiver Shawn Collins, Miller, Bruce,  running back Kenny Flowers and linebacker Marcus Cotton blossom this season.  </P> <P> INDIANAPOLIS COLTS  </P> <P> Sept. 17, 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 9-7.  </P> <P> Series record: Colts lead series, 20-15-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: Could it be anyone but The Goggled One, running back  Eric Dickerson? Dickerson churned out another 1,000 yard-plus season (1,659 to  be exact) and 14 rushing touchdowns. He also caught 36 passes, which tends to  keep defensive coordinators a bit more honest when scheming to stop Dickerson.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Linebacker Duane Bickett, who has emerged quietly as one  of the American Football Conference's most consistent defensive players.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . Dickerson dashing up and down the field  Sept. 17. Dickerson thrives on this sort of situation: lots of pressure,  national attention. Nothing would give him more pleasure than sticking it to  his former team, especially Coach John Robinson and vice president John Shaw.  </P> <P> GREEN BAY PACKERS  </P> <P> Sept. 24, 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 4-12.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series, 40-33-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: Wide receiver Sterling Sharpe caught 55 passes last  year, no small feat considering that the Packers haven't had a decent  quarterback since Lynn Dickey called it quits a few years ago. But Sharpe will  have to do something about his catch-to-touchdown ratio, which was an  unbelievable 55-1. Then again, the Packers will have to do something about  their quarterback situation.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Little-known linebacker Tim Harris, who led the Packers  in both tackles and sacks last year. Expect to see Harris in the Pro Bowl soon.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . mammoth offensive tackle Tony Mandarich  taking his place on the Packer line. Mandarich would instantly improve an  anemic running game, to say nothing of the pass protection he would provide.  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS  </P> <P> Oct. 1, 1 p.m., Candlestick Park  </P> <P> Dec. 11, 6 p.m., Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 10-6.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series, 46-30-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: Where do you start with this team? Quarterback Joe  Montana is still the heart and soul of the 49ers. He threw 18 touchdown passes  last year and added another three via the run. Running back Roger Craig emerged  as the National Football Conference's dominant runner in a season that saw him  gain a remarkable 1,502 yards. Add to that Craig's 76 receptions and you have  the game's most complete back. And then there's receiver Jerry Rice, who merely  averaged 20.4 yards every time he caught one of his 64 passes.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Change that to starters. Nose tackle Michael Carter is  the best in the business at clogging the middle of offensive lines. Safety  Ronnie Lott has few, if any, peers among NFL defensive backs.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . Montana dropping into the pocket. The  man just kills the Rams. The same goes for Craig, who scored three times  against the Rams in 1988.  </P> <P> BUFFALO BILLS  </P> <P> Oct. 16, 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Rich Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 12-4.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series, 3-1.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: The Bills won 12 games last year despite a sub-par  season by quarterback Jim Kelly (15 touchdown passes, 17 interceptions). Just  think if he gets his act together and Coach Marv Levy lets him throw downfield  on occasion.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Hard to find a better group of defenders. End Bruce  Smith and linebacker Cornelius Bennett combined for 20 1/2 sacks in 1988.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . The Bills giving the ball to Robb  Riddick on a fourth-and-goal from the 1. Riddick scored 12 touchdowns in 1988,  many of them on goal-line situations.  </P> <P> NEW ORLEANS SAINTS  </P> <P> Oct. 22, 1 p.m., Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> Nov. 26, 5 p.m., Superdome  </P> <P> 1988 record: 10-6.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series, 25-13.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: An easy call -- kicker Morten Andersen, who has  redefined the importance of field-goal accuracy. Andersen missed only a single  extra point last year and 10 of 36 field goal attempts. He is the closest thing  to a Pro Bowl lock in the league.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Attention has to be given to the Saints' four  linebackers -- Sam Mills, Vaughn Johnson, Pat Swilling and Rickey Jackson.  Mills made the Pro Bowl last year, but the honor could have gone to any of the  four.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing. . . . Multipurpose running back Dalton  Hilliard. Nor are they in any big hurry to see how good running back Craig  Heyward might be if he can keep his weight down to manageable levels.  </P> <P> CHICAGO BEARS  </P> <P> Oct. 29, 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Soldier Field  </P> <P> 1988 record: 12-4.  </P> <P> Series record: Bears lead series, 42-28-3.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: With Jim McMahon gone, quarterback Mike Tomczak inherits  the pressure and prestige that comes with leading the Bear attack. If he can  handle Coach Mike Ditka and the full-time responsibilities, the Bears will  challenge once again for the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Why ask? Linebacker Mike Singletary directs a unit that  was ranked first against the rush and second overall in the league.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . the trio of Dan Hampton (9 1/2 sacks),  Richard Dent (10 1/2 sacks) and Steve McMichael (11 1/2 sacks).  </P> <P> MINNESOTA VIKINGS  </P> <P> Nov. 5, 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Metrodome  </P> <P> 1988 record: 11-5.  </P> <P> Series record: Vikings lead series 12-11-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: It didn't much matter if it's Tommy Kramer or Wade  Wilson throwing the ball, wide receiver Anthony Carter is the big-play player  on a big-play team. Carter set a team record for reception yards with 1,225 on  72 catches, and at 5-11, 165-pounds is the patron saint of short guys  everywhere. The last time the Rams saw Carter, in the NFC Wild Card game won by  the Vikings last December, he caught four passes for 102 yards.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Though the Vikings are great up front -- defensive end  Chris Doleman, tackle Keith Millard and nose tackle Henry Thomas combined for  22 sacks -- the killer on this team is in the secondary: Joey Browner. Browner  is a big hitter in the mold of Ronnie Lott and has a knack for making big  plays.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . anyone of their defensive backs turning  on their heels and madly chasing after Carter.  </P> <P> PHOENIX CARDINALS  </P> <P> Nov. 19, 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 7-9.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series 21-16-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: Whoever ends up at quarterback. This is a team that  scored 11 more touchdowns receiving (26) than it did rushing. Receivers J.T.  Smith and Roy Green each finished third and tenth, respectively, in the NFC in  receptions. But they need someone to get them the ball. Neil Lomax was the  NFL's seventh-rated passer last season, but an arthritic hip might have ended  his career. So find some space in the margin and write Gary Hogeboom/Tom  Tupa/Timm Rosenbach.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Safety Tim McDonald led his team in tackles with a  whopping 115, almost twice as many as the next in line, defensive end Niko Noga  with 62. McDonald had two interceptions, two sacks, forced four fumbles and  blocked an extra point, a punt and a field goal. This is a busy guy.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . anyone of the triad of quarterbacks, or  Lomax himself, getting into a cozy rhythm with Smith and Green.  </P> <P> DALLAS COWBOYS  </P> <P> Dec. 3, 12 p.m.  </P> <P> Texas Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 3-13.  </P> <P> Record against Rams: Series tied at 7-7.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: Running back Herschel Walker was second in the NFL in  rushing, with 1,514 yards, and is the NFL leader over the last two seasons in  rushing-receiving yards, with 3,625. With a rookie-either Steve Walsh or Troy  Aikman-almost guarenteed of being the Cowboys' quarterback, it's important for  this team to have someone to depend on.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Is this really applicable? This is a defense that  allowed an average of 23.8 points per game and ranked 20th in total defense in  the NFL. The team had only 10 interceptions; Atlanta's Scott Case did that by  himself. If we must, Bill Bates should be the guy. He led team in tackles with  124 and was second in special team tackles with 22. A bona fide football  madman, Bates is a little bit of chaos needed on a defense often found dozing.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . wide receiver Michael Irvin about to  catch the ball with room to run. As a rookie, Irvin averaged 20.4 yards a  reception.  </P> <P> NEW YORK JETS  </P> <P> Dec. 17, 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Anaheim Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 8-7-1.  </P> <P> Series record: Rams lead series 3-2.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: The Jets can put points on the board-they ranked third  in the AFC in scoring last season-but half of their games were decided by a  touchdown or less. It's those situations that demand a good kicker, and the  Jets have one in Pat Leahy. Leahy made 23 of 28 field goal attempts and all 43  PATs. He has made 52 of his last 54 field goal attempts inside the 40, and his  81% accuracy rate over the past four seasons ties him with the Saints' Morton  Anderson for second behind Kansas City's Nick Lowery (82%).  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: As a rookie last season, safety Erik McMillan led the  AFC in interceptions (8) though he played in only 13 games. He was also named  to the Pro Bowl, the first Jet rookie to be selected since Emerson Boozer in  1966.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . quarterback Ken O'Brien with plenty of  time to spot Al Toon, who led the league in receptions with 93.  </P> <P> NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS  </P> <P> Dec. 24, 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Sullivan Stadium  </P> <P> 1988 record: 9-7.  </P> <P> Series record: Patriots lead series 3-1.  </P> <P> Key offensive starter: All running back John Stephens did as a rookie was rush  for 1,168 yards and get selected to the Pro Bowl as well as be named the NFL's  Rookie of the Year. How important was Stephens? His rushing yardage was nearly  three times as much as New England's No. 2 ground gainer, Robert Perryman, who  ran for 448 yards.  </P> <P> Key defensive starter: Linebackers Johnny Rembert and Andre Tippett are as good  as any twosome. Rembert had 137 tackles, including 98 solo. Tippett, often  compared to Lawrence Taylor, missed four games but still had 50 tackles and  seven sacks.  </P> <P> The Rams could do without seeing . . . quarterback Doug Flutie with his hands  on the ball, late in a close game. Flutie, though his statistics have paled in  the pros, has always had a knack for winning the close games.  </P></p>

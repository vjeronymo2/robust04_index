			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Management: Key to future is nation of first-stop shopkeepers - Plans to establish a network of advice centres for entrepreneurs Britain can no longer afford to waste its collective energy on 'turf battles' between the different agencies delivering help and advice to small businesses, according to Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade. Heseltine outlined his views last week when he announced the establishment of an initiative designed to bring greater coherence to the delivery of advice and counselling services to small businesses. A network of 'first-stop shops' is to be established, eventually totalling 200, which will bring together under one umbrella most of the existing agencies that provide help to businesses. These include Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), local enterprise agencies and chambers of commerce. Tecs will be responsible for getting the shops established. Introduced two years ago to revolutionise training in the UK, Tecs also have some responsibility for promoting the growth of small companies. Their brief includes the development of business information and advice services, administering the enterprise allowance scheme and providing training provision for small businesses and support for exporters. Tecs are also charged with bringing greater unity to the many strands of help available and ensuring that any gaps in services are filled. Resolution of this complex role in what is already a crowded area, has been one of the critical issues facing the movement. A number of Tecs have been skilled at working with the other agencies. Barnsley and Doncaster Tec, for example, contracted with Doncaster Enterprise Agency to provide its enterprise allowance scheme, which offers unemployed people financial help to start their own businesses. Birmingham Tec, with several partners including the City Council's economic development department and Birmingham Chamber of Commerce has set up what it calls a 'one-stop shop' which has information about a wide range of services. But Tecs have come into conflict with the existing providers, most notably chambers of commerce, which are largely supported by voluntary subscriptions. The chambers have been annoyed that some Tecs, supported by public funds, have set up rival services and membership schemes drawing on the same client base. The problem was not helped by the fact that the activities of the Departments of Employment and Trade and Industry were not co-ordinated. But responsibility for a block of activities operated by Tecs, including business skills training, has been transferred from the DOE to the DTI. The DTI is vigorously promoting the new 'first-stop shops'. Over the next few weeks, a working party will set-up models for the shops and the DTI has hinted that if successful, the first shops could take on a number of its responsibilities for giving business advice.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Gambler's biggest risk - Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA, the aircraft-leasing company, talks to Paul Betts Most men carry a wallet in their back pocket. What Mr Tony Ryan keeps in his is a schedule of spending commitments totalling Dollars 20bn over the next 10 years. 'This is the list I live with,' he says, pulling out a tiny piece of paper showing that GPA, the aircraft-leasing company he founded in Shannon, Ireland, 17 years ago, currently owns 411 airliners and has another 500 on firm order or option. The numbers are staggering, and send shivers through investors at a time when the air transport industry is suffering its worst recession in 40 years. Airlines are struggling to make money and financial institutions are increasingly wary of funding new aircraft purchases. Mr Ryan says he is relaxed. 'I often tell people I sleep like a baby. I wake up every 10 minutes screaming.' Mr Ryan will need all his apparent confidence as he embarks on perhaps his greatest challenge since launching GPA as a small aircraft leasing outfit and transforming it into the world's leading aircraft leasor with about 50 per cent of the market. Not only is he having to ride out turmoil in the aircraft industry, but he has also chosen this moment to float his company. His decision is based on GPA's performance last year. 'I did not welcome 1991 when we were hit by a series of circumstances we never predicted, like the Gulf war,' he says. 'But it also offered us an opportunity to show how we operate. I told my staff at the time that if we can work out of this recession it will be a great way of convincing investors we can manage risks well.' The company's performance, though disappointing when compared with its earlier double-digit profits growth, has been better than might have been expected. GPA recently reported slightly higher net profits of Dollars 196.5m for the nine months to the end of December 1991 compared with Dollars 195.8m in the same period in 1990. The financial markets will still need considerable reassurance if the flotation in June is to be successful. 'It's not so much GPA but the state of the industry which concerns me,' says Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at Shearson Lehman. 'The question is whether they can buck the trend in a business facing a lot of problems,' he adds. According to an Airbus executive, the recession was expected to hit aircraft-leasing companies harder than others in the industry: they would have too many aircraft and too few customers. Other observers point to a string of further worries: the question of how GPA would finance future aircraft purchases as banks grow more reluctant to provide funding; the quality of the company's earnings in the light of its heavy dependence on profits arising from aircraft sales in the secondary market; and whether its equity base is strong enough in relation to its huge, long-term aircraft order commitments. Mr Ryan, who describes himself as 'just a Tipperary farmer', will have a lot of explaining to do in coming weeks. 'If people are frightened by our order book they should take comfort. We placed 165 aircraft last year in the worst ever period in aviation,' Mr Ryan says. He concedes that GPA is a difficult company for analysts and investors to understand but that aircraft are inherently more attractive assets than tankers or property. 'My fundamental belief is that an aircraft as an asset is inherently profitable. If a client has a problem, you can move the asset elsewhere. The mobility of the aircraft is a great joy,' he says. But he acknowledges there is likely to be a 'heavy fall-out' in the aircraft-leasing industry, while stressing that GPA will not be a casualty. 'We've built up a robust structure. Our fleet is made up of new aircraft. If we had 400 old ones we would not be going public and we probably wouldn't be going anywhere.' GPA took a calculated risk in its aircraft-buying spree of the late 1980s, though it managed to negotiate 20-25 per cent discounts from manufacturers because of the big orders. 'We've sculptured our orders from now to the end of the century to mirror the customer base of the big manufacturers,' Mr Ryan says. Airlines have over-ordered aircraft in recent years and manufacturers have over-produced, so manufacturers are now reducing production by 25-33 per cent. 'We traditionally pick up about 8-10 per cent of annual production. When production is adjusted we will go down to about 10 per cent of the new rate,' Mr Ryan says. The biggest problem is not too many aircraft but not enough financing. 'Money rather than aircraft will be the scarce commodity of the 1990s,' Mr Ryan says, adding that GPA has tackled the short-term problem with a line of credit facilities worth Dollars 8bn, equity of Dollars 1.2bn and its forthcoming public offering which is expected to raise between Dollars 550m and Dollars 700m in fresh money. 'In the longer term we are going to have to find some other method of financing until the banks come back because of the magnitude of money necessary to finance aircraft during the next 10 years,' Mr Ryan says. He first planned the June flotation five years ago with the idea of going to the market in 1990-91 to give greater liquidity to his shareholders. But he decided to wait until this year after the company had shown it was capable of riding out last year's sharp downturn. Mr Ryan believes the securitisation of aircraft will become a growing trend. 'What we are increasingly doing is buying an aircraft, selling it to a customer for a profit. He is then entitled to the lease income while we get a fee for managing the aircraft. At the end of the lease we can either sell the aircraft and share the proceeds with the owner or release it for him.' He forecasts a further development will be the setting up of aircraft investment funds to attract smaller investors. 'We are setting up with Citibank a Dollars 500m international fund for this purpose,' he says. 'We've got smaller funds in several countries. We also have plans for a Dollars 1bn fund.' He says the geographical spread of GPA's portfolio has also helped the company hedge itself during the recession. 'The first six months of last year were very rough. About 25 per cent of our customers were in serious trouble.' But the other 75 per cent around the world 'continued to send money in: there was good traffic in places like south-east Asia and Latin America'. Mr Ryan admits, however, that GPA took a a few blows on the chin. 'We clearly gave Braniff (the bankrupt US carrier) too many planes and we lost money.' But GPA has limited its exposure to the US market to 10 per cent of its business. 'I was never comfortable with the draconian US bankruptcy laws,' Mr Ryan says. Preferring to scout the world in search of business, or to farm his estate in Tipperary where he owns a pub called Matt the Thrasher, rather than adopt a high public profile, Mr Ryan will find himself in the spotlight in coming months. He will have to persuade investors that GPA is a good long-term bet and that the sheer quantity of aircraft it has on order are sound assets. 'The question is whether you believe flying by aircraft is the best way to get from A to B. If the answer is no, I would have a problem,' he says. His family history leads to his firm beliefs. 'My family has been in the transport business for 1,000 years.' This is a slight exaggeration. His father was a train driver, his grandfather a station master, and his two sons now own the airline Ryanair. Perhaps the best message he can give the financial community will be his commitment to stay at GPA as chairman at least until 1996 and not sell his shares. At a flotation price of Dollars 20-Dollars 25, Mr Ryan's 8 per cent stake would be worth Dollars 188m-Dollars 235m. 'But since we started, I have never sold a share.' The Irish tax authorities pose a bigger personal problem. The new Irish government's tax regime is ending exemptions on dividends to shareholders like Mr Ryan in Shannon-registered companies. Mr Ryan confirms he is considering becoming a foreign resident. 'I have places in Spain, Mexico and Monte Carlo,' he says. As an expert risk manager, he might even be tempted to try to break the bank.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1936 Born in County Tipperary, Ireland. 1956 Joins Aer Lingus. 1975 Forms GPA in conjunction with Aer Lingus and Guinness Peat Group. 1979 GPA buys first aircraft. 1987 Honorary doctorate, Trinity College Dublin. 1988 Ryan buys 4.9 per cent stake in Bank of Ireland. 1989 GPA orders 308 aircraft worth Dollars 16.8bn. 1991 Ryan sells Bank of Ireland stake. 1992 GPA flotation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

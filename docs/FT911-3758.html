			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: FFr10bn order for trains THE FRENCH SNCF rail board yesterday placed orders for FFr10bn (Pounds 990m)-worth of double-decker high-speed trains with a consortium led by GEC-Alsthom, the Franco-British engineering group. This is one of SNCF's biggest orders and aims to boost capacity of its near-saturated domestic Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) routes in the second half of the decade, so cutting the need for new track. This will be greeted with relief by environmental groups, which have protested against plans to extend the 10-year-old Paris-Lyon TGV line to the Mediterranean. The double-deckers will take the expected strain on the Paris-Brussels TGV route, two years after it opens in 1993, but will be too large for the UK end of the Channel Tunnel line. The order comes as GEC-Alsthom is negotiating against Italian, German and Swiss competition for four overseas TGV contracts, in Canada, the US, South Korea and Taiwan. The double-deckers will carry 520 passengers, 35 per cent more than existing single-deckers, but cruise at the same 300 kmh as the newest TGVs now in service. Each train includes eight carriages, with a locomotive at each end. The contract includes firm orders to develop and produce 45 trains, with 55 more under option. Other consortium members include ANF Industries, France's second biggest maker of railway rolling stock, and De Dietrich, the French electrical engineering and household appliance group.</p>

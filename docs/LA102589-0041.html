			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SLAPS ZSA ZSA WITH 3 DAYS IN JAIL  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor, who turned a routine traffic stop into a slap heard around the  world, Tuesday was ordered to serve three days in jail, to pay fines and  retribution totaling $12,937, to perform 120 hours of community service -- and  to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.  </P> <P> "If I could let emotions enter into this, Ms. Gabor, I can assure you that you  would spend a far longer time in county jail," Beverly Hills Municipal Judge  Charles G. Rubin said after a four-hour hearing before a packed courtroom.  </P> <P> In his strongly worded ruling, Rubin said he decided against a longer jail  term, in part because of the actress's age -- she is reportedly 66 -- and  because she brought no physical harm to Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul  Kramer when she slapped him with her open right palm on June 14.  </P> <P> But the judge expressed outrage over Gabor's behavior throughout the three-week  trial, which attracted worldwide attention last month. The usually placid Rubin  accused the former Miss Hungary of "milking" the criminal justice system to  publicize herself and unfairly attacking Kramer and the Beverly Hills Police  Department.  </P> <P> Gabor lashed out at Kramer repeatedly during the trial, accusing the motorcycle  officer at one point of having several gay lovers. She also contradicted  herself numerous times while on the witness stand and claimed that police  videotapes of her made after her arrest were doctored to show her using vulgar  language.  </P> <P> Rubin ordered Gabor to pay the largest single chunk of her retribution --  $10,000 -- to Beverly Hills police to help offset the department's cost of  conducting the trial. He made it clear that the award was an unusual one,  handed down because of Gabor's "aggressive verbal attacks" on the department.  </P> <P> Gabor was fined $2,350 for slapping Kramer, $352 for driving without a license  and $235 for possessing an open container of alcohol -- a flask of Jack Daniels  -- in her Rolls-Royce.  </P> <P> In ordering her to undergo psychiatric evaluation, Rubin said he saw in Gabor  evidence of "hyper" or "manic" behavior -- although not enough to stand as a  legal defense against her crimes.  </P> <P> "She has demonstrated an attitude of continual contempt for the legal system,"  Rubin said. "Miss Gabor, in this case, not only slapped the face of Officer  Kramer out there on Olympic Boulevard. But by her vituperative and denigrating  comments, she has verbally slapped the faces . . . of almost every prosecution  witness that appeared in this case. And she was not satisfied with that, but  she turned around and slapped the face of every American by claiming that the  United States is worse than Communist Russia. . . ."  </P> <P> Sits Silently  </P> <P> Gabor, who conceded she was nervous before sentencing, sat silent and  motionless as Rubin commented on each of the three misdemeanor counts.  </P> <P> At one point, apparently seeing Gabor smile, Rubin warned her, "You laugh, Ms.  Gabor. . . ."  </P> <P> Quickly, Gabor said, "I'm not laughing."  </P> <P> Moments later, Gabor defended her comments during the trial by saying, "I have  said the gospel truth -- I don't know if you know what that means."  </P> <P> Rubin responded by describing her courtroom demeanor as "a continuing tantrum,"  adding: "It's time for you to stop it and begin acting like the kind of lady  you so repeatedly say that you are."  </P> <P> Gabor has 30 days to appeal the sentence, but her attorney, Harrison E. Bull,  declined to say whether such action would be filed. "The options are open to  us," he said. "I don't want to comment on his (Rubin's) comments."  </P> <P> Gabor said, "Thank God it's over," and added, "I am a very good American. I  love America, I will say that," before leaving the third-floor courtroom.  </P> <P> But the actress, who regularly spoke to reporters throughout the trial, eluded  a crowd of about 60 media representatives waiting on the courthouse steps,  apparently leaving via a rear exit.  </P> <P> Her husband, Prince Frederick Von Anhalt of West Germany, left the courthouse  alone, calling the sentence unfair and saying he would volunteer to serve time  in her place.  </P> <P> He was greeted by a street band, Hello Disaster, whose three members wore black  leather jackets and played a specially written song, "Let There Be Justice,"  celebrating Gabor's jail sentence.  </P> <P> "I'm just happy she got something," said band member Shaun Kay, 21. "I think  she really could have gotten more of a sentence."  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner had sought a 30-day sentence. But at a press conference  Tuesday afternoon he expressed pleasure that the judge "did recognize, and in  strong terms, that she must go to jail.  </P> <P> "Zsa Zsa Gabor tried to make a mockery out of the idea of equal justice,"  Reiner said. "She has an unfortunate history of trying to turn everything into  farce and to mock everything.  </P> <P> "You know, this did not start out as a particularly important case," Reiner  added. "It started out as a minor incident. But what elevated this beyond . . .  a minor case was her conduct over that three-week period during the trial where  she made a mockery out of everything. And it wasn't just a mockery of the  criminal justice system . . . the judge, the police officers, the court  personnel, the prosecutors, the entire system, which she dismissed as a  Nazi-type system because anybody would presume to judge Zsa Zsa Gabor."  </P> <P> Beverly Hills police spokesman Lt. Robert Curtis said that Police Chief Marvin  D. Iannone called the sentencing "eminently fair."  </P> <P> "The chief feels that the department has been truly vindicated and that the  judicial process has run its course," he said, noting that Kramer was not  expected to comment.  </P> <P> Rubin pronounced sentence after denying a bid by Bull for a new trial, based on  assertions that Gabor's trial lawyer had improperly solicited her business and  was unsuited to handle the case.  </P> <P> Bull, hired by Gabor earlier this month, argued that the actress's former  attorney, William Graysen, violated state Bar Assn. policies by volunteering to  handle the case free because of the publicity it would bring him.  </P> <P> In addition, Bull argued that Graysen violated similar policies by  "guaranteeing" to Gabor that she would not go to jail, thus implying that the  actress could speak out or act any way she chose during the trial, which cost  $30,000.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox, however, noted that Graysen was not involved in  Gabor's appearances on "Entertainment Tonight," "The Arsenio Hall Show" and  other television and radio shows in which the actress appeared to seek  publicity after her arrest.  </P> <P> In denying the motion, Rubin said, "It is clear to the court that Ms. Gabor is  a very aware and sophisticated person who . . . could have chosen any attorney  she wanted to. She chose Mr. Graysen above all others."  </P></p>

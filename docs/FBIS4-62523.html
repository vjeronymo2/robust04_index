			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 16 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Our main task is to  put an end to military activity and only then will it be  possible to settle the political questions, said  Nagorno-Karabakh's Foreign Minister Arkadiy Gukasyan. In an  interview with the Yerevan newspaper AZG, he said he does not  think Azerbaijan is ready today for a cease-fire and that the  leaders of that republic are unable to abandon the illusion that  the Karabakh problem can be settled using force. The  Azerbaijani authorities, A. Gukasyan said, hope that military  victories will create political conditions, which will act in  their favor during subsequent talks. But Azerbaijan's  leadership will very soon have to acknowledge the real situation  that has taken shape and sit at the talks table with the leaders  of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, the minister believes. "I  do not rule out that it will be a new Azerbaijani leadership  [that sits at the table]," the Karabakh representative said.    The issue is whether they in Azerbaijan can find the  strength  in themselves to renounce force as a means of settling the  conflict, A.Gukasyan said, and since Geydar Aliyev cannot do  this, there is a likelihood of developments leading to a change  in Azerbaijan's leadership, the Karabakh minister said.    We have to take into consideration the international  community, the opinions of various states and organizations, and  the norms of international law, the head of Karabakh's Foreign  Ministry continued. Karabakh believes that if the fighting on  the battlefields can be brought within the framework of a  political struggle, then Stepanakert will have the opportunity  to present its arguments, which, the people of Karabakh believe,  suffice to justify recognition of the independence of the  Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh.    A. Gukasyan also said that full peace in the region will  only  be possible after the issue of Karabakh's status had been  settled once and for all. Without this, there will always be  the danger that military activities will be resumed, he said.  Peace is not possible without settling the issue of Karabakh's  status, the minister said.</p>

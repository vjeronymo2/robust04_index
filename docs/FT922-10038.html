			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / England's knight of the square table: When Nigel Short beat former world champion Anatoly Karpov inthe world chess semi-final this week Dominic Lawson was in his corner FIVE minutes before Nigel Short's decisive final game of his match against the former world champion Anatoly Karpov, I was sitting with him and his second, the Czech-born Grandmaster Lubosh Kavalek. My own stomach was aching with tension - and I was not the one about to face destiny or despair against a Russian with a machete for a brain. The world now knows that Short won, to clinch the world championship candidates' semi-final by six games to four. This put him within one match of meeting Garry Kasparov for the world title. But at the time Short was only too well aware that a win for Karpov in the last game would have tied the match and forced a speed chess playoff - the chess equivalent of the penalty shoot out. Short had his own way of coping with the tension: he grabbed his much-travelled guitar and began playing a punk song: 'I don't care.' When he stopped Kavalek said 'OK. Good. Now you must have piss.' I agreed with Kavalek that Nigel did need to have a moment of peace before the most important game of his life. 'No, not peace, piss,' said Short's trainer. He was simply trying to make sure that his charge did not waste time emptying his bladder during the game. In fact this routine was unvarying before every game. Similarly Kavalek  - who was Bobby Fischer's second in the 1972 match against Boris Spassky - always woke Nigel at 11.30am - and the three of us would take the same walk around the town of Linares singing the same song: 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun'. Then we would eat lunch at exactly 1.30pm in the same restaurant, and Nigel would order the same dishes every day. Dinner would also be governed by routine. The point, as Short explained, was this: if every aspect of normal life is deliberately made mind-numbingly predictable then all thought and capacity to absorb stress is devoted to chess, and Nigel could sit down at the board against Karpov with the maximum of mental energy. This all sounds very rational, but routine is closely linked to superstition, and in my experience superstition is endemic among chess grandmasters. Nigel's took relatively mild forms: certain tables in restaurants were thought to be lucky, because we had sat at them before a victory. Karpov's superstition amounted almost to a disease: he did not like to play on a Monday; he would not wash his hair unless he lost a game - fortunately he lost quite a lot in the match. And for the final game Karpov wore an immaculate blue suit that he only wears during particularly vital games. He calls it his 'executioner's suit', according to his great rival, the world champion Garry Kasparov. Nigel's biggest concession to irrationality was, on our walks, to enter the main Catholic church in Linares, and, in spite of his professed atheism, to offer up a prayer before each game. Once I asked him what he was praying for. 'At first I said 'please God let me win this game', but then I realised that was asking too much. So instead I asked 'God, please give me the strength to beat this shit-head'.' Yet science rather than religion was at the heart of Nigel's victory. The depth of his preparation astounded not just me but also the grandmaster pundits. Kavalek's tennis player forearms were constantly bulging with the strain of carrying around a 120 megabyte computer containing - so he told me  -1m games of chess. Karpov's games were logged in fantastic detail, evaluating his successes and failures by openings, middle game positions and endings. At a switch of a button Karpov's games would appear on the plasma screen of the computer in diagram form. Nigel would spend hours glued to the flickering screen absorbing the complete history of his opponents's chess psyche at enormous speed: each game would last about a minute, with Nigel only occasionally muttering to Kavalek 'Let me see that in slow motion' and the pieces began to move at a speed which my naked eye, at least, could follow. The benefits of this were seen especially clearly in the wonderful eighth game, the best of the match, and one of the most brilliant ever at this level. Nigel took only an hour for all his moves. Karpov had used that much time by his 18th move, at which point Nigel, so he later told me, was still in the analysis prepared for the game. This is not to say that Nigel's success is all about hard work. He is a chess genius, as we all suspected when at 12 he beat a former 12-times British champion, Jonathan Penrose. But last week he has proved what we also know from other sporting champions: that genius without discipline is only an elegant way of finishing second. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

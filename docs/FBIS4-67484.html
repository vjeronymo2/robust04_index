			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Economic Planning Agency  [EPA] on Monday [9 May] called for effective measures to control  pollution such as introducing an environment protection tax and  product recycling systems.    The agency made the appeal in releasing the results of a  survey on environmental protection measures, including a deposit  system for recyclable resources such as cans and bottles.    The survey showed that it is possible to make environmental  preservation and economic activities compatible through the  implementation of various measures, such as the introduction of  an environmental protection tax and regulations under the  existing law, the agency said.    The EPA said the survey centered on the merits and demerits  of pollution control measures, including a levy on environmental  protection and penalties against pollution.    The taxation and penalty method will be effective for  environmental protection depending on tax rates and penalty  fees, but it will raise the possibility of boosting prices of  products, leading to a decline in consumer demand, it said.    The agency said government subsidies will be effective in  helping factories install pollution control equipment, but it  creates a problem of how to secure necessary funds.    A U.S. system which allows factories to purchase the right  to  discharge harmful carbon dioxide is effective in controlling  pollution but it entails high costs for working out such a  system, it said.</p>

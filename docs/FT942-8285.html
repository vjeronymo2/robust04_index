			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / E Germans win compensation Germany's lower house yesterday finally agreed on a compensation package for former owners whose property was confiscated by the Nazis or communists in eastern Germany. At the same time, a limited compensation fund has been granted to former land owners whose property was expropriated by the Soviet authorities between 1945 and 1949. The long-awaited decision removes a major obstacle hindering investment in eastern Germany. It also ends four years of amendments, debates and divisions within the governing Christian Democratic Union coalition, and between eastern and western German deputies about how to compensate former property owners. Under the terms of the unification treaty, former owners whose land was confiscated by the Nazis between 1933-1945 and by the communists between 1949-1990 are entitled to restitution or compensation. No similar rights were extended to the large aristocratic landowners whose property was expropriated by the Soviet authorities. The new measures involve the setting up of a DM18bn compensation fund, issued in bonds. Some DM12bn will be allocated to former owners whose property was confiscated between 1933-1945 and 1949-1990. The amount of compensation for each individual will be based on the 1935 value of property, and multiplied by several factors depending on whether the property was land or housing. The bonds will not be fully redeemable until 2004. In addition the Bundestag yesterday put aside DM3.4bn compensation, and will allow former landowners to buy back a percentage of their property at below market prices. A further DM2bn has been granted to east Germans who had suffered under the Nazis but received no compensation under the communists.</p>

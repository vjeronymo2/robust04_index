			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> There was no need to remind Domino's downtown delivery force that Southern  Californians were supposed to stay out of their cars Thursday.  </P> <P> Since January, the shop's 20 intrepid pizza porters have operated exclusively  on bicycles.  </P> <P> "There are just too many traffic and parking problems using cars," said  supervisor Mario Betancourt. "We tried having them just drive at night when  there was less traffic, but even that wasn't as effective as delivering on  bikes."  </P> <P> The pizza pedalers still must adhere to Domino's guarantee that the order will  be delivered within 30 minutes, or $3 will be docked from the price. But  there's a catch. The messengers will only venture six blocks from the ovens at  545 S. Olive St. (a fitting location for a pizza shop).  </P> <P> There are dangers even in that limited area, though.  </P> <P> "We give our people locks, now," Betancourt said. "Some of them have had their  bikes stolen."  </P> <P> At least when you get stuck in an elevator, you have a bit of privacy. Not so  the unfortunate woman who was caught inside a revolving glass door Thursday  morning at Bunker Hill's California Plaza. The door malfunctioned, according to  witnesses. Plaza officials had no comment on the matter. The woman was trapped  about half an hour at the entrance to the (otherwise) futuristic office tower  until workers freed her by removing some of the door's panels.  </P> <P> Some Wilshire residents have objected to the proposal of Los Angeles school  authorities to build an "Ambassador" high school.  </P> <P> The nonprofit Wilshire Stakeholders would rather have the bankrupt Ambassador  Hotel converted into a development.  </P> <P> But perhaps it's all a misunderstanding, and residents and school officials  aren't really at odds.  </P> <P> As the Stakeholders' Bruce Dworshak points out, there is a second proposed site  that his group finds more preferable.  </P> <P> It's a few blocks north of the Ambassador Hotel. One of the businesses  currently occupying this site is the Ambassador Dog &amp; Cat Hospital.  </P> <P> "Editor: I am compelled to bring to your attention an example of literary  desecration that occurred recently in the 'Only in L.A.' column," begins a  friendly note from Stephen Pastorkovich of Arlington, Va.  </P> <P> The same desecration also prompted a faxed message from Sam Gamgee of Santa  Barbara, who no doubt wanted the error corrected as quickly as possible.  </P> <P> Here it is: In discussing a Los Angeles street sign with the tongue-twisting  name of "111st St.," we speculated that the sign painter was inspired by Frodo  Baggins, who celebrates his "eleventy-first" birthday in Tolkien's "Lord of the  Rings."  </P> <P> Alas, as Pastorkovich and Gamgee point out, Frodo does no such thing. It's his  cousin, Bilbo Baggins, who hits that milestone. (Of course -- Bilbo!)  </P> <P> Eleventy-one slashes for your columnist.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert of the </F> Hungarian Socialist Party, by Pal Emod; place and date not  given: "The Country's Foreign Solvency Might Become Endangered  in 1995"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Emod] Would the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] be able to implement its programs on its  own?    [Bekesi] Even if we assume that the MSZP will adhere to its  program -- which in itself is brave, but I hope that this is  what people voted for -- it is very dangerous to launch it on  its own. It is true that we have a mathematical parliamentary  majority, but the MSZP will have to keep this 54 percent,  otherwise the one-party government will fail. Out of the 209  deputies, 149 won in individual districts and it is their moral  obligation to firmly assert the interests of their own district  already at the beginning of the cycle. Therefore, they will  make serious demands on distribution: area development and  infrastructural demands, the need to support unviable  enterprises, and so on. However, we do not have the resources  for this at the moment, and will not have them in 1995, either.    [Emod] Can the trade unions also make similar demands?    [Bekesi] Obviously. In addition to this, a social pact will  have to be drawn up. If the MSZP governs on its own then it  will have to yield to the powerful trade union demands, whether  it likes it or not, which will obviously lead to  overdistribution. Therefore, it is possible that the MSZP will  deviate from the program's line to preserve the majority -- in  the wake of unavoidable, well-meant compromises. This can  result in the country's ability to meet its foreign payment  obligations becoming endangered by the end of 1995.    [Emod] Is it because this danger can only be avoided with a  coalition that you will not accept a ministerial post in a  one-party government?    [Bekesi] It is. In my view, the coalition is not simply a  parliamentary requirement because there is no such thing. It is  not a political exigency, either, because this does not exist  either. The coalition is a strategic necessity for the MSZP, the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the country, too. This  is the reason I am saying that I do not see a guarantee for the  program that I drew up to be implemented without a coalition.  [passage omitted]    [Emod] The most serious dilemma has not been solved because  the structure of state spending has hardly changed. Do you  agree with this?    [Bekesi] Yes, nothing much has happened. The basis is the  same; the budget is financing the same institutional system and  tasks as in 1990. [passage omitted]    [Emod] If this is so then the question seems superfluous:  Can the reform of state finances be delayed any longer?    [Bekesi] Not a minute, if we assess the consequences; later  we can also look at the causes. The planned consolidated  deficit of the state finances will be 330 billion forints.  [passage omitted] As the population's savings will not be more  than 220-240 billion forints even in an optimal case, a  100-billion-forint gap can already be seen. As for foreign  financing, let us look at the current payment balance. Data of  the first four months show a $1 billion deficit, so a $3-billion  to $4-billion deficit can develop by the end of the year.  [passage omitted]    [Emod] I believe you wish to continue with the debt  servicing, which is extremely high....    [Bekesi] More than $4 billion. In other words, $4 billion  plus $3 billion in fresh money has to be brought into the  country this year whether we like it or not. If we presume that  we can sell some concession rights, that the privatization of  medium-size enterprises is started, and that foreigners even buy  from the share packages of some banks, then we can bring in $2  billion at best. Therefore we still have $5 billion which is  nearly impossible to be brought in from abroad.    [Emod] Do you still maintain this if we manage to make a new  medium-term agreement with the IMF?    [Bekesi] This is what I wanted to continue with. The new  government will obviously announce a serious stabilization and  modernization program. This is only realistic in the case of a  coalition government because this is what the two parties  represent, therefore, it can be the basis of the joint  government program. On this basis, we can complete an agreement  on financing a medium-term modernization with the IMF.  Naturally, this can only be successful if we can make the IMF  accept our 1995 and our longer-term economic program.    [Emod] In an optimal case, how much can we borrow from  abroad in 1994?    [Bekesi] If the above conditions are met then we have a  realistic chance to borrow $2 billion to $3 billion in the rest  of the year. [passage omitted]</p>

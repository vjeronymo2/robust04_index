			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Arts: Souvenirs of the Grand Tour - Patricia Morison reviews an exhibition of Mengs' work for his British patrons LIFE MUST have been wonderful for the young 18th-century English nobleman on his Grand Tour. All the pleasures of Italy, sensual, artistic, social and intellectual, were his for the taking. These were wonderful, unrepeatable years and so, looking for a permanent reminder, the rich milord sat for his portrait.  If in Rome his choice lay between two enormously famous artists. Was it to be Pompeo Batoni at the Via Boca di Leone, or his deadly rival at the foot of the Spanish Steps, Anton Raphael Mengs? Anton Raphael Mengs and his British Patrons at Kenwood House is a follow-up to the Batoni exhibition of a decade ago. And yet, whether it can rescue Mengs's reputation as Batoni's has been, I rather doubt. Batoni was a theatrical painter, whose sitters are stylish creatures who dispose themselves elegantly against a background of the sacred ruins of Rome. Mengs was ever the phlegmatic German. He appealed to rather solemn, intellectual patrons who were undeterred by the German's farouche manners - he insisted on singing and whistling as he painted Pope Clement XIII. Like many an ambitious artist of the day (Ramsay, Piranesi, Robert Adam, Reynolds, to name but a few), he published a treatise on how modern art was to save itself. He was diligent in his study of antique art, partly because this was what his patrons expected. Above all, however, he doggedly emulated those artists he admired; Correggio, Guido Reni, Van Dyck, and of course, his namesake, Raphael. Mengs was an infant prodigy, pushed by his father who was court painter at Dresden. This exhibition is too incomplete to give a full account of his work, since several of the most important paintings in British collections are too large or fragile to travel. Moreover, Mengs's huge reputation in the eyes of fellow artists was due above all to the frescoes he painted in Rome and as court painter in Madrid. Even so, there is quite enough in the exhibition to show that here was an artist whose talent was stifled by his own fascination with his great models. There was calculation as well as conviction in the models Mengs chose. The dealer and fellow-artist Thomas Jenkins advised him that few English lords and ladies could resist the chance to dress in Van Dyck costumes, such as we see in portraits of the Marquess of Londonderry and Lord Brudenell. An attractive half-length portrait of the latter in Van Dyck lace colour and wrap-around cloak may be by Mengs, or it could be a rare work by Jenkins himself. It makes an interesting contrast with the grandest portrait in the exhibition, also of Brudenell, whose Grand Tour lasted over a decade. The nobleman is seated in his study, beneath a bust of Cicero, open book in his hand, every inch the student. And yet, the dog at his side and the glimpse of parkland beyond hints at the pleasures available to the man of property. For once, Mengs attempted something truly original in his portrait of another lord steeped in his love of antiquity, in this case, of architecture. From Prague comes the 'Allegorical Portrait of Lord Charlemont', a painting of 1755 which is definitely comical (Charlemont has a huge chin and Pinnociesque nose) but well shows Mengs as the forerunner of neo-Classicism. The bare-breasted figure of Architecture is gesturing to the amateur architect that he must imitate Palladio, whose bust looms above him. And yet, inevitably, he must lean on the achievements of Vitruvius, on whose sarcophagus he has rested his sketch-pad. Confrontations between two figures were a favourite compositional device of Mengs'. Had his 'Noli Me Tangere' from Oxford been available for the exhibition, this point would have been still better made. As it is, visitors must make do with a head of Christ, which like the 'Penitent Magdalene' and 'St John the Baptist' shows Mengs was well able to churn out heavily sentimentalised devotional images. However, when one looks at his dreary 'Lamentation' from St John's College Cambridge, and his 'Holy Families', it becomes clear that grouping people was the German artist's weakest point. However intensely he looked back to Raphael, the effect was woefully clumsy. And yet, precisely because Mengs's faults are so evident, this is an exhibition which makes us aware of the effects for which 18th-century artists and patrons strove - to cite the present in relationship to the giants of the past. Kenwood House, where the permanent collection of the Iveagh Bequest is full of souvenirs of the Grand Tour, is an excellent venue to explore more fully the full range of art which the English went abroad to find. Until September 11 at Kenwood House, Hampstead Lane, NW3. 081-348-1286</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian contractor likely for Siberian copper project RUSSIA'S BIGGEST copper deposit, at Udokan in eastern Siberia, is expected to be awarded on Monday to a group of Russian enterprises as part of the government's attempts to help its ailing industrial plants find new business. Only two companies finally submitted proposals in an international tender to draw up a feasibility study for the project after six large western mining companies dropped out of the race citing either a lack of time to prepare properly or complaining about the content of the copper. The two remaining contenders were Australia's BHP and the Udokan Mining Company, which is considered the Russian participant in spite of being half-owned by two little known foreign companies. UMC is backed by a group of Russian industrial plants which want to provide the equipment for the Dollars 1bn development. It is almost certain to win, given the Russian government's desire to help factories switch from military production to civilan output and a market system. UMC's lack of experience of a big mining project is being compensated for by advice from Fluor Daniel, the San Francisco-based mining consultancy, which has already submitted a detailed feasibility study for the project. Under Fluor Daniel's proposals, the project would be financed through a combination of fund-raising by a New York investment bank, copper concentrate sales to China, and export credit guarantees to finance imports of machinery from the West. Under the terms of a tentative contract, UMC has arranged to sell 200,000 tonnes of concentrate from the mine, once it comes on stream around 1997, to China's National Non-Ferrous Metals Company. Under the 25-year agreement, China, which is connected to Udokan by the Baikul-Amur Railway, would in turn dispatch the concentrate to smelters which it will build specially to cope with the concentrate's high sulphur content. The resulting copper would then be used within China or re-exported. In keeping with UMC's original purpose, the bulk of equipment to build the mine and accompanying infrastructure is to be produced by more than a dozen Russian companies plus Belaz, the Belorussian vehicles producer, all grouped in a consortium led by Uralmash, the Urals heavy engineering plant. The tender committee was due to produce its recommendations on the competing proposals today, leaving the final decision to be taken by the Russian president and government. The winner is expected to be announced on Monday.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORTH'S TRIAL OPENS AFTER MANY DELAYS;  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR CALLS HIM A LIAR; DEFENSE CITES HIS PATRIOTISM  </P> <P> Oliver L. North's criminal trial opened today with the prosecutor calling him a  liar who "places himself above the law" and with North's lawyer defending him  as a patriotic Marine who obeyed the orders of the nation's highest officials.  </P> <P> Prosecutor John Keker told the jury that North had lied time and again to his  President and to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> North's chief defense lawyer countered that the defendant, a former top  National Security Council aide, worked in a secret world where "he always acted  with the approval of his superiors; he acted always with the best interests of  his country."  </P> <P> Thus the two sides squared off for the oft-delayed first trial to come out of  the Iran-Contra affair, a trial that may take as long as five months to  complete.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intense Interest  </P> <P> Nine women and three men chosen as jurors in the case were sworn in by U.S.  District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell at 9:38 a.m.  </P> <P> North followed the opening statements of Keker and chief defense lawyer Brendan  Sullivan with intense interest. He sat upright during both presentations,  sometimes looking toward his wife, Betsy, who was in the front row of  spectators.  </P> <P> North is charged with 12 criminal counts, nine of them having to do with  deceiving Congress and President Ronald Reagan. The three others involve  charges that he personally profited from the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> A year after it passed the 1984 Boland Amendment banning U.S. military  assistance to the Contras, Congress received news reports that North was  secretly raising money for the rebels from foreign countries and private donors  and providing tactical military advice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Committee Meeting  </P> <P> At one point, Keker said, a House committee met with North in the White House  seeking the truth about the situation.  </P> <P> "The committee looked Oliver North right in the eye and North looked them right  in the eye and he lied," Keker said.  </P> <P> Sullivan countered that North never broke the law, that "he followed the  instructions of the highest-ranking officials of the United States of America.  . . . He followed his orders as any Marine Corps officer would."  </P></p>

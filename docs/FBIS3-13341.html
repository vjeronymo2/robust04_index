			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Campaign Against the Pressler </F> Amendment"]    [Text] A meeting held at the Prime Minister House the other  day reviewed all important aspects of Pakistan-U.S. relations.  It was attended by Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto; Foreign  Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali; Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M.  Khan; and Dr. Maliha Lodhi, Pakistani ambassador to the United  States. The Pakistani ambassador gave details of her meetings  with President Clinton and other U.S. authorities and said that  she has been apprising the U.S. circles of Pakistan's position  on the Pressler Amendment and expressed the hope that the warmth  in relations between the two countries will be visible again.  Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto expressed the confidence that  Pakistan will be able to convince the United States that the  Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law and that it failed to  serve the purpose of nuclear nonproliferation in the region.    The Pressler Amendment is applicable only to Pakistan.  Consequently, the United States has suspended economic and  military aid to Pakistan, thereby creating a very difficult  situation for this country. Pakistan very courageously endured  the situation and made it clear to the United States that as far  as nuclear nonproliferation is concerned, Pakistan has never  disagreed with it. However, it set only one condition: that  India should sign the treaty first.    Pakistan presented a number of proposals on keeping South  Asia a nuclear-free zone, but India has consistently rejected  these proposals. The United States has started to realize that  Pakistan is interested not in manufacturing the nuclear weapon  but in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This is why the  Pakistani leadership is expressing the confidence that the  United Stats will be convinced that the Pressler Amendment is a  discriminatory law.    A report says that Senator Larry Pressler has stressed that  before making any changes in the Pressler Amendment, it should  be ensured that President Clinton verifys that Pakistan does not  possess a nuclear weapon. Larry Pressler argues that if the  United States shows leniency in its attitude toward nuclear  nonproliferation, then the countries that have acquired nuclear  capability, including North Korea, will be encouraged to carry  out a nuclear explosion. Larry Pressler's opinion cannot be  taken as the last word. The U.S. Administration should keep the  facts in view and avoid creating difficulties for a friendly  country only on the basis of speculations.</p>

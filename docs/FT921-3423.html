			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Hooper warns of losses and no interim SHARES in Clarke Hooper, the UK's only publicly-quoted sales promotion group, slumped from 38p to 11p yesterday after the company announced it will make a significant pre-tax loss for the year ending in April. As a result the directors have decided not to pay the interim dividend of 1.7p which it announced last September. The board said the company continued to trade within its banking facilities and continued to enjoy the support of its principal bankers. At the interim stage Clarke Hooper reported profits halved to Pounds 820,000 and said that the business climate had been exceptionally difficult and showed little sign of an early recovery. The directors said they were carrying out further rationalisation to reduce group debt. Mr Alan Penson has been appointed chief executive and Ms Sue Archer, the company secretary, replaces him as finance director. Mr Barry Clarke remains chairman.</p>

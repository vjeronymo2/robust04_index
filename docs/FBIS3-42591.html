			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Trubitsin: "Military Aircraft Were </F> Acquired; the Process of Creating New Airline Companies Is  Proceeding in Civil Aviation"]    [Text] Anxiety compelled Muscovite Nikolay Mitin to plan a  long trip--to Uzbekistan. His mother, who lives in Chukuduk,  wrote that she was very sick. But the main thing is that she  wanted to see her son very much.    There were no problems with tickets: put up R96,000 for a  one-way ticket, and then wait for the departure of a flight  along the route Moscow-Tashkent-Chukuduk. There is one piece of  bad luck: flights to Tashkent were postponed for the time being.  One day followed another, the information service could not  report anything instructive on dates for renewal of flights and,  in the end, Nikolay Vasilyevich was compelled to turn in his  ticket, losing R10,000 in the process.    I learned a lot in the Russian Federation Ministry of  Transportation Department of Air Transportation to which I went  to inquire about what was happening to our civil aviation. For  example, about ticket prices. In comparison with December of  last year, they increased by a factor of 31.5! The volume of  passenger trips decreased by one-third for this reason, but  Russia's civil aviation, nevertheless, got an opportunity to  make ends meet. The aviators had no other way: the price of  aviation fuel was increasing, but its share in the cost of  passenger trips was lagging by 40-50 percent. The TU-154M is not  a bad, as the specialists say, long-range aircraft, and it now  costs almost 5 billion rubles [R], but in the near future,  apparently, it will even reach 7 plus billions. But the aviators  are not even guessing how much the new Il-96, Tu-204, and Il-114  aircraft will cost.    Nonetheless, aircraft are being purchased. Just in this  year,  46 aircraft and 52 helicopters entered civil aviation. And what  is interesting is that only three percent of the aircraft were  acquired with state resources, and aviation enterprises also  laid out their own money for three. The rest of the equipment  was financed by nonstate structures.    Aviation is by no means a hopeless sphere for investing  capital. If we are talking about property, there are no  obstacles in this branch now to conversion into joint-stock  companies and privatization. Just in nine months of this year,  the department of air transportation rendered opinions on 97  aviation enterprises that were subject to destatization.  Twenty-two joint-stock companies were registered, and 11 of them  are already selling shares of stock. The process proceeded, but  the fact that it was slow has its own reasons.    Petr Petrovich Pasichnik, an acquaintance of mine who is an  aviation engineer and a person with everyday common sense,  thinks the following on this score:    "I do not particularly understand the subtleties of  privatization. I know that there are three variants. Well, let  us assume that we privatized and that I became a kind of coowner  of my own aviation enterprise. But, tell me, what kind of  capital can I invest in the business? Besides wages, I have  nothing. My comrades also have nothing."    What also can be added to this fact is that a  structural restructuring is taking place in the bosom of the  aviation enterprises themselves, along with privatization. The  aircraft go to the aviation companies, but everything that is on  the ground remains the property of the airport. This is the way  it is throughout the world. But we lived in our own way for 70  years, and now we have to break a very strongly embedded system,  and this process is painful. Indeed, even the former once  monolithic Aeroflot disintegrated: civil aviation in the CIS  countries is being established on its basis. New contacts and  relations are still only being developed. For this reason, N.  Mitin was unable to get information on a flight from Moscow to  Uchkuduk, and how many other passengers remain uninformed about  flights to neighboring foreign countries.    Civil aviation is truly undergoing birthing pains now. A  majority of the companies that are being established on the  basis of state aviation enterprises are in a bad way with  investments. But, on the other hand, runways, the technical  maintenance base, and personnel are under their jurisdiction,  finally. Although private companies have money, they have to  resolve problems with basing locations, they have to find their  own niche on the market, acquire appropriate equipment, and  attract the necessary personnel.    All of these problems also faced the founders of the Pilot  Company in Krasnodar. It was headed not by a pilot, but by Yuriy  Fedorovich Azarov, a lawyer. Something like this could not have  even occurred to the leadership of the former Ministry of Civil  Aviation. Only aviators were placed at the head of aviation  enterprises at that time, inasmuch as a monopolist did not have  to concern himself about financial effect: it did not matter,  the money went into the common pocket. But now only a person who  is enterprising, strong, and energetic can become the head of  the company.    In planning their business, Azarov and his confederates  tried  to provide for everything. The bountiful Krasnodarskiy Kray is  rich in agricultural products, a substantial part of which is  exported. It is logical to deliver it where it is highly  valued--to the north, for example. The Krasnodar aviation  enterprise cannot cope with this alone, because it does not have  heavy cargo aircraft.    Of course, the incipient company did not have such aircraft.  At first it was decided to lease them in order to scrape the  capital together for the purchase of a cargo plane. It invited  the Krasnodar aviation enterprise with its facilities and the  Kubanskiy kolkhoz, a strong producer of agricultural products,  to be cofounders.    After earning the money, the company did not spend it on the  purchase of Mercedes, but acquired an An-12 cargo aircraft from  the military. True, it was "somewhat beat up," and the owners  did not expect to get rid of it, and already had even agreed  with the producer plant to place the aircraft on a pedestal  along an avenue of the plant. The Krasnodar residents considered  it more sensible to prepare it for flight, considering that it  had a long expected life. After the An-12 was repaired, it began  to perform a new service. And it performed the service not like  state aircraft that spent a great part of the time standing on  the ground, "Time is Money."    After accumulating more cash, Pilot leased an Il-76, which  is  capable of transporting up to 40 tonnes of cargo. The next stage  will be the purchase of such an aircraft.    "We are now able to perform three to four trips abroad  per week," explained Yuriy Fedorovich. "Entrepreneurs are also  not averse to contacting us. To transport cargo abroad by sea  takes a long time. It is far quicker and more convenient by air.  We are receiving proposals from countries in Eastern Europe and  the Near East."    Other aviation companies that appeared recently operate  similar to Krasnodar's Pilot. The founders make the invested  money work and aircraft fly and not stand idle, as happened in  Aeroflot. Also beginning to compete successfully with state  aviation enterprises are companies that strive to ensure good  service and not permit unforeseen flight delays that are  disadvantageous to themselves as well. It is a pity that Nikolay  Vasilyevich Mitin did not have the opportunity to use those  R96,000 for the services of another air line company.    An aircraft is a sign, a symbol of a society's civilization.  That is the way it was here at one time, until Aeroflot slipped  into a lack of culture. It remains to be hoped that the new  times will restore the normal order of things. The kind of order  under which a passenger does not expect a tolerable attitude  toward him, as a good deed, but rather the aviators see in him a  valued and desired customer.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Racism ruling 'upsets' workers Workers at the Midlands foundry at which some were judged by an industrial tribunal this week to have racially abused an Irishman have protested to management about 'misrepresentation' of their views by the media. 'They are upset at being accused of being racist; the fact is 95 per cent of the workers did not know who the man was,' said Mr Kevin Else, acting convenor at Auto Alloys Foundry at Blackwell, Derbyshire. 'The workers are complaining that they have not been allowed the right to reply to the allegations.' Mr Trevor McAuley, a 36-year-old machinist from Northern Ireland, won nearly Pounds 6,000 from the tribunal after it found unanimously that he had suffered at work from persistent anti-Irish abuse which had undermined his health by causing him stress. Mr Tony McCarthy, general secretary of the TUC-affiliated National Union of Domestic Appliances and General Operatives, whose members work at the foundry, said he could 'not understand the judgment'. He added that the union's members at the foundry where Mr McAuley worked for two years were 'upset and mystified' by what had happened at the industrial tribunal. Mr McCarthy said he had been called in to investigate the allegation of racial abuse against Mr McAuley, and he visited the foundry three times to interview all the workers individually to find out what was going on. 'I could find not a shred of evidence to support Trevor's allegations,' said Mr McCarthy. 'Most of the workers said they did not even know him, let alone abuse him. He worked by himself with an apprentice in a separate part of the foundry.' He added: 'I sent a statement explaining this to the industrial tribunal, but they did not refer to it or ask me to give evidence. 'None of the workers at the foundry were called before the two-day hearing. This kind of case gives industrial tribunals a bad name.' Mr Dan Taylor, the company's managing director, re-ffirmed he could not afford to appeal against the decision. The Commission for Racial Equality, which sponsored Mr McAuley's action, said last night that it would be approaching the company to urge it to introduce anti-discriminatory policies in its workplace to prevent any further abuse of Irish-born workers. 'We don't pursue cases vindictively against any individual, but to achieve equal opportunities,' said the commission. It believes the McAuley case will help to bring about a change of approach among employers about workplace attitudes to people from Ireland.</p>

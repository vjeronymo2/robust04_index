			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 May -- A Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman today condemned the actions of Bosnian Muslims in the  vicinity of Brcko in the north east of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  According to UN observers, on the morning of 10 May the Bosnian  Army, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement notes, fired  mortars at the central part of the city of Brcko, which is under  Bosnian Serb control. There are dead and wounded among its  civilian population.    The provocative actions by the Muslim side in what is  currently the most explosive region of Bosnia and Herzegovina,  carried out, moreover, on the eve of the Geneva meeting on  achieving a Bosnian settlement, could lead to the gravest  consequences, the Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out. In  condemning this action Russia insistently calls on all the sides  involved in the Bosnian conflict to show maximum restraint and  self-control at this crucial moment. It is time finally to  discard illusions of a possible military solution and to resume  negotiations immediately and unconditionally. Russia will in  every way promote precisely such a course.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Boss Group plans US sales drive Boss Group, the lift-truck producer acquired in May by Jungheinrich of Hamburg, yesterday unveiled an investment plan to turn its Bedfordshire factories into a world-class manufacturing centre. The company also plans a big assault on the US lift-truck market, which the former Lancer Boss Group never fully exploited. Jungheinrich acquired the Boss business, and its former subsidiary Steinbock Boss in Germany, after their controversial receiverships in April. The Boss factories in Leighton Buzzard, which are spread over a number of sites, were a nagging problem for Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and his brother Trevor, the former owners who lost control of the company with the receiverships. Lancer Boss had received planning permission for a contentious project that encroached on neighbouring green-belt land. But the company shelved the expansion plan because of its financial difficulties. Yesterday Mr Bob Bischof, Boss Group chairman, said that there had been a debate since the receivership over whether the new Boss Group retained this planning permission. Rather than take the issue to the courts the group will this month submit to Bedfordshire County Council a new application for a plan based only on industrial land. The plan involves rationalising and simplifying manufacturing, creating one facility for volume production and another for big, more specialised lift-trucks. The plan has yet to be approved by the parent company and Mr Bischof would not say how much it would cost. Boss could in effect spend Pounds 6m without incurring any extra cost because it would be saving leasing costs of Pounds 600,000 a year. Boss has increased its workforce by 45 to about 730 since the takeover. Mr Bischof said he was convinced that employment would rise further in the long term, although he would not say whether the in-vestment plan would increase jobs. Mr Bischof said Boss was moving quickly to set up a dealer network in the US, where it saw an excellent opportunity for the company's side-loaders and big container handlers. This was partly because of the problems faced by Japanese rivals exporting to the US from Japan when the yen is strong. Mr Bischof said Boss Group expects sales of Pounds 52m for the eight months of this year since the receivership, and 'a small profit'.</p>

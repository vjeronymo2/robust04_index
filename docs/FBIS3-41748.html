Of these, 280 are children. The number of  AIDS-infected adults who have died has reached 98 persons, 61 of  them children. Medical workers are attributing this increase in  the number of infected children to the fact that between 1987  and 1993, 17 children were born to mothers infected with the HIV  virus. The number of AIDS patients at the stage where the virus  carrier is already recorded as being sick is increasing slowly  yet steadily. As of today, 127 adults and 90 children are  affected, while 79 adults and 52 children have already died.  During the past year, 497 foreign citizens infected with AIDS  have been identified in the Russian Federation. All of them have  been deported.</p>

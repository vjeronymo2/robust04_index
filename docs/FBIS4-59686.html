			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni ulema have condemned the barbaric  practices of the gangs of apostasy and secession in the  Socialist Party, including their firing of internationally  prohibited long-range missiles at populated areas in the capital  of unity, other governorates, and secure cities and villages.  They strongly denounced such acts by the Socialist Party war  criminals, which have caused the death of many women, children,  and elderly people. This came in a statement issued by the  Yemen Ulema Society.    The statement said that fighting against the secessionist,  rebellious elements in the Socialist Party leadership is  legitimate because it seeks to eradicate sedition, protect  religion against the advocates of apostasy and secession, and  avert the dangers posed to the people and the country. God  says: And fight them on until there is no more tumult or  oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God.  [Koranic verse]    The ulema praised the heroic stands of the Army and Security  Forces men, who are resolutely fighting the forces of evil and  sedition and the advocates of secession and division, scoring  great victories by depending on God and holding out in the  fighting arenas. The ulema appealed to all our Yemeni people to  support our Armed and Security Forces, confront the rumor  mongers, and report any attempt to disturb security. The ulema  supported the wise and sound steps taken by the Presidential  Council, the House of Representatives, and the Council of  Ministers to deal with the situation and destroy the dangers of  sedition and its perpetrators. They stressed their rejection of  any interference.    The ulema concluded their statement by urging our people to  sincerely beseech Almighty God in their prayers to aid our  valiant soldiers and grant them victory.    God says: Already has Our Word been passed before this to  Our Servants sent by Us, that they would certainly be assisted,  and that Our forces,-they surely must conquer. [Koranic verse]</p>

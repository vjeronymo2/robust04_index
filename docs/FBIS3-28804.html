			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Zabihollah Now-Forsati, Iranian </F> ambassador to the ROK, by reporter Pak Kyong-a; place and date  not given]    [Text] On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the  Islamic revolution on 11 February, Zabihollah Now-Forsati (45),  Iranian ambassador to the ROK, stressed the need to expand  economic exchanges with the ROK. He said, "in the wake of the  15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Iran is faced with  the task of revitalizing its economy. The ROK is a very suitable  economic partner that Iran presently needs."    The Islamic government was established in Iran after the  Islamic revolutionary forces led by late Ayatollah Khomeini  overthrew the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Iran has been suffering  economic difficulties that increased with the aftermath of the  eight-year-long war with Iraq and last year's drop in oil prices.    [Pak Kyong-a] Relations between the ROK and Iran were  estranged for a short time after the Islamic revolution....    [Zabihollah Now-Forsati] Iran and the ROK established  diplomatic relations in 1962. Their relations became estranged  to such an extent that the ambassadorship was downgraded to the  level of charge d'affairs in 1981 when the war was going on  between Iran and Iraq. Their relations, however, have been  normalized since 1989. At present, Iran's trust in the ROK  people is so high that the Iranian Embassy here issues visas to  ROK people within only 24 hours.    [Pak] What is the reason for the increased trust in the ROK  people?    [Now-Forsati] A number of foreign enterprises left Iran in  succession during its past war with Iraq. However, ROK  enterprises remained in Iran and kept their working sites even  at the risk of death and wounds. The Iranian people never forget  the favor they receive from others.    [Pak] What do you think is the reason that the ROK should  attach importance to expanding economic cooperation with Iran?    [Now-Forsati] First, Iran, with a population of 60  million, is an excellent market for various kinds of consumer  goods. Moreover, Iran founded an organization for economic  cooperation with central Asian countries that separated from the  former Soviet Union and became independent states. Iran is  leading this organization. Therefore, the ROK can have easy  access to the central Asian markets with Iran as a  stepping-stone. Second, the ROK can secure the source of stable  oil supply based on amicable relations with Iran. Third, only  Iran has become the nation where rich experiences of the ROK  enterprises can be put to practical use in the Middle East.    [Pak] What is the degree of Iran's present economic exchange  with the ROK?    [Now-Forsati] The volume of annual trade between Iran and  the ROK reaches $2 billion. ROK enterprises, including Daewoo,  Daelim, Samsung, Ssangyong, Sinhwa, and Hyundai, are engaged in  the construction of roads, an oil pipeline, power stations, and  chemical and textile plants, throughout Iran.    [Pak] What is the position of Iran on the peace negotiations  between Israel and Palestine?    [Now-Forsati] We are opposed to such changes as seen  today. The PLO does not reflect the will of all the Palestinian  people. [end Now-Forsati]    Ambassador Now-Forsati said that it is curious that just as  the price of land in Seoul's Tehran Street has increased  exorbitantly, that of Tehran's Seoul Street has also drastically  increased.</p>

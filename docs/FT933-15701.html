			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Toyota Motor gives profit target warning TOYOTA MOTOR will find it even harder to achieve its parent company profit target this year, according to Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'We worked hard to meet our forecast of parent company current profit of Y300bn (Dollars 2.76bn) for the year ended June 1993. It will be an even tougher in 1993 - 94,' he said. Toyota has lowered its forecast of domestic vehicle sales to 2.20 in calendar 1993 from a December forecast of 2.32m, Mr Toyoda said. The company sold 2.24m vehicles in Japan in 1992. Domestic vehicle sales by Toyota in the first half of 1993 fell short of the 1.1m the company had forecast. 'We hope to achieve domestic sales of 2.20m vehicles in calendar 1993, thanks to a big sales push in the second half,' Mr Toyoda said.</p>

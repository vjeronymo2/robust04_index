			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Press Review" program] </F>   [Text] Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous  Regional People's Government, and others, visited officers and  men of the Air Force's radar station at (Ganbala) on 16 April  and heard briefings given by station instructor (Cao Hong.)  They were very excited when they learned that officers and men  at the station have been working hard with unselfish dedication  in a restricted forest area 5,374 meters above sea level for the  past 29 years, have safely guided over 220,000 flights by  various types of aircraft, and thus have been awarded the  "(Ganbala) Model Radar Company" by the Air Force Party  Committee. Gyaincain Norbu said: The spirit of (Ganbala) means  the spirit of sacrifice and dedication. It is not only that the  forces should carry forward the (Ganbala) spirit, but also Tibet  itself. We should vigorously publicize this spirit and develop  Tibet well. Later, Comrade Gyaincain Norbu and others visited  the honors room and watched training demonstrations by the  officers and men. They also inspected the dorms, kitchens, and  vegetable gardens one after another.</p>

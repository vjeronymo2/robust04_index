			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with reporter Luis Sexto, from BOHEMIA magazine, </F> by reporter Osvalso Rodriguez, from JUVENTUD REBELDE, on the  "Straight Talk" program on 3 May]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Rodriguez] This is Osvaldo  Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE, and we are talking to Luis  Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine. We are talking about freedom of  speech in Cuba, today being international freedom of speech day.    Luis, I believe every time someone talks about freedom of  speech, people think about the media, and we as a medium have  the right to refer to that today, taking advantage of the fact  that today the media belongs to us and the people. And I  believe that we need to point out that the media in Cuba are in  favor of the people and that the work we do is in favor of the  people and national interests. I believe it is important to  define it like this, in discussing this topic, because many  times, people talk about freedom of the press and freedom of the  press understood in traditional terms, where freedom of speech  is to be able to use the media to oppose the decisions of the  government.    Well, we would also have to look at up to what point they  oppose government decisions and how many interests are combined  for those decisions and that opposition. In Cuba, we have  followed a policy, which I support and believe should be eternal  as long as we have such a strong enemy like the United States,  and it is that the media does not allow nor give any space for a  criteria that goes against the popular majority and against the  people, and against the government approved by the people.    [Sexto] The famous freedom of the press is one of the forms  of freedom of speech. Sometimes freedom of speech is confused  with the famous freedom of the press, and I believe that is not  the way it should be. Freedom of the press, or the media, is one  of the channels for the people to express themselves. Seconds  ago, we referred to how, in Cuba, there are a series of  mechanisms to facilitate and channel freedom of speech.    [Rodriguez] Do do consider yourself a free reporter?    [Sexto] I consider myself a free reporter to the point that  I  am not capable of writing or talking about something I am not  convinced of. And I believe I have the right to tell the  director of the magazine, when I am ordered to write a  commentary on something I do not feel comfortable with, to get  someone else to do it. That has been my norm as a professional  during twenty years as a reporter.    [Rodriguez] That does not mean that there are some reporters  who have written things they have not agreed with.    [Sexto] No, just like there are people who go to meetings  and  do not say everything they believe because they are cowards.    [Rodriguez] Just like there are people who have said  something on the street and have been censured by someone...    [Sexto interrupting] By some citizen.    [Rodriguez] Yes, by a citizen, who has censured him and has  even denied him his right to have a different point of view.    [Sexto] Yes, he has been reprimanded verbally, right? He has  responded to a determined expression.    Now, getting back to the media, the same happens with  freedom  of speech. The media cannot be separated from society. Freedom  of the press cannot be separated from the determined society,  from the classical structure of a determined society. The media  is an instrument of the majority. No one should think that the  media is a fourth power, as many have said and as many continue  to believe. That is absurd. The media is always subordinate to  the dominant interests in a society. But in our country, the  media, which has its defects and problems, is subordinate to the  interests of the nation, the interests of the people. That is  the way it is.    Do you think it would be wise to give room for ideas of  annexation in our media? Don't you think it would be suicidal to  allow those who favor annexation to defend their point in our  newspapers, especially during these difficult times that our  country is facing?    [Rodriguez] I agree. I believe the opposition cannot have a  voice in our media because the opposition already has a voice in  the media of our enemies.</p>

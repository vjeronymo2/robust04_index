			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Yorkshire pudding The Leeds Permanent Building Society has proved a misnomer. If its proposed merger with the Halifax is completed, it will no longer be based in Leeds, it will cease to be a building society and its name will have proved less than permanent. The reasons for this extraordinary move, which will eventually create a bank with assets of Pounds 90bn, are not hard to fathom. The mortgage market is being forced to rationalise as building societies struggle with low volumes of new business. Their problems have been compounded by ever keener competition from the banks. Halifax and Leeds claim the merger should provide the combined group with sufficient size to compete successfully. But size for size's sake is nonsense, and it is disturbing that both institutions play down the scope for rationalisation. They insist, for example, that both headquarters will be kept, redundancies will be voluntary and branches will be maintained. The societies' managements should be mindful of the dangers of failing to cut costs: when the Nationwide and Anglia merged in 1987, there was little rationalisation for several years and consequently a poor return on assets. Members should not become overly concerned about the end of mutual status. For one thing, they will profit personally from the transformation of the societies to a public limited company, as they will receive equity in the new bank. Management, faced with the disciplines of running a quoted group, could hardly prove less accountable than at present. The business may benefit too. The switch in status will allow Halifax to raise funds from wholesale markets more easily to fill the gap created by the deceleration in the growth of deposit-taking. But more freedom will bring greater risks: the last time societies were given greater freedom, they charged into estate agency with disastrous consequences. So the new shareholders will have to keep management on a tight rein. Even if members agree to the marriage it may not necessarily be consummated. The merger must clear some tough regulatory hurdles, not least of which is the Office of Fair Trading. Last year the combined group would have had nearly 23 per cent of the UK mortgage market. However, given the few barriers to entering the mortgage market and the opportunities for new distribution methods such as direct selling by telephone, the group's market share should not prove problematic. Once the group has been floated with an expected market capitalisation of Pounds 8bn-Pounds 9bn, it should become a formidable competitor. That will place additional pressure on banks and building societies. A series of further financial earthquakes can be expected in the UK, emulating either this latest deal, or Lloyds Bank's takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.</p>

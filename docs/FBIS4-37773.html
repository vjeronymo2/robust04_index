			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ron Ben-Yishay] </F>   [Excerpts] PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat is insisting that the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdraw from major Judaea and  Samaria population centers in the near future, even before  autonomy is applied to these areas.    The demand, which was officially relayed to the prime  minister's bureau about two weeks ago, is based on what  Palestinian sources term "an oral understanding and the spirit  of the Oslo agreement."    A senior government element has confirmed that the PLO did  indeed present such a demand to Israel, although he denied that  "either an oral or written pledge was given to 'Arafat on this  matter."    Senior IDF commanders advised the prime minister to reject  the demand on the grounds that the IDF troops' exit from major  Judaea and Samaria cities before comprehensive security  arrangements for Palestinian self-rule are established would  jeopardize the lives of Israeli civilians. Those in danger will  be mainly residents of settlements in the vicinity of Ramallah,  Nabulus, Hebron, Qalqilyah, and Tulkarm, some of whom have to  drive through these cities' centers on their way to the  settlements.    'Arafat relayed this new demand to Jerusalem via his adviser  Nabil Sha'th, who handed it to Major General Amnon Shahaq during  a meeting at Erez checkpoint last week. [passage omitted]    Palestinian sources claim that a high-ranking Israeli  element, whose identity they refused to disclose, promised  'Arafat that rather than wait for sweeping redeployment in the  West Bank on the eve of the autonomy council elections, the IDF  would withdraw from city centers shortly after the completion of  the evacuation from Gaza and the Jericho enclave. 'Arafat is  now demanding that the IDF evacuate the centers of major cities  and hand over control in the evacuated areas to the Palestinian  police force in the framework of the next stage of the  establishment of Palestinian self-rule -- the stage of early  empowerment, during which the Civil Administration's powers in  the territories are to be handed over to the PLO, as agreed in  Oslo.    Senior defense establishment elements recently advised the  prime minister not to hurry to implement the next stages  stipulated in the Oslo Declaration of Principles before he is  certain the Palestinians have adhered to their Cairo agreement  commitments with regard to Gaza and Jericho. That was the  reason they recommended he reject 'Arafat's demand for early IDF  withdrawal from city centers. [passage omitted]    Defense establishment elements also recommended that the IDF  redeployment be put off until negotiations on comprehensive  security arrangements in the Palestinian self-rule in Judaea and  Samaria are completed. The IDF also has reservations about the  early transfer of Civil Administration powers to the  Palestinians. Senior elements argue that early empowerment will  only create confusion and undesirable friction between the still  active Civil Administration and the Palestinian authorities due  to take over from the Civil Administration.</p>

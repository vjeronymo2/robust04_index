			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TOP U.S. COFFEE NEGOTIATOR OUSTED; CALLED 'INTRANSIGENT,' OUTSPOKEN  </P> <P> The chief U.S. coffee negotiator, Jon Rosenbaum, has been ousted, but the move  does not signal a shift in U.S. coffee policy, officials at the trade  representative's office said today.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum's departure is considered important because he took a high-profile  approach to his job, provoking the wrath of some coffee producers for his  outspoken ways and perceived hard-line positions.  </P> <P> Colombian President Virgilio Barco, for example, in July blamed the  "intransigent position" of the United States for the collapse of the coffee  price-support system.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum will participate in a one-year career development seminar offered by  the State Department and will not be engaged in coffee policy while taking the  course.  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Discord on rouble's fall Russian ministers yesterday gave sharply different accounts of the rouble's rapid fall, reflecting fear in government circles over Russia's reform course, writes John Lloyd. Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting finance minister, said the fall was 'profiteering, pure and simple' by commercial banks, and that the rouble would rise again soon. But Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, told regional presidential representatives the fall was a 'result of half measures and deviation from the financial policy'.</p>

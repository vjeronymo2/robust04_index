			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: US and Japan seek to break trade deadlock NEGOTIATORS from the US and Japan were last night preparing for two days of intensive talks in an attempt to break the deadlock over a framework governing trade between the two countries. However, US officials played down the prospects of an imminent breakthrough based upon compromise proposals made late last week by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Miyazawa's proposals have breathed new life into the bilateral talks, which resumed on the eve of this week's Group of Seven economic summit in Tokyo after stalling 10 days ago. However, the two sides are still sharply divided. Japan is resisting US calls for Tokyo to accept numerical targets for increasing imports and reducing Japan's Dollars 50bn current account surplus with the US over the next three years. President Bill Clinton, speaking after an hour long meeting with Mr Miyazawa yesterday afternoon, admitted that the talks were in a critical period and were not 'free of difficulty'. Mr Clinton praised Mr Miyazawa for reaching across the gap which divided the two sides to keep the talks alive. Mr Clinton said: 'We have hopes. I do not want to raise hopes, but we have hopes.' Japanese officials said Mr Clinton called Mr Miyazawa's proposals a 'useful first step'. However, the Japanese proposal falls short of US demands in crucial areas. Japan's government says it will stimulate domestic demand to promote growth, which will contribute to reducing the trade surplus. However, it explicitly rules out targets to reduce the surplus to between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of gross national product, which the US has called for. Tokyo has conceded that it will use quantitative criteria retrospectively to monitor progress in expanding the foreign share of the Japanese market. However it has ruled out using these measures as targets to guide policy. A senior Japanese official said: 'We fear that as soon as we include a target it will be taken in the US as a commitment on our part to make sure that it achieved.' Mr Clinton stressed the US commitment to its often overlooked security alliance with Japan, as a counterpoint to the tensions over trade. He emphasised the US would maintain its military engagement in Asia, a theme he will take up at greater length today in a wide ranging speech at Waseda University on the US role in Asia. Mr Clinton took a benign view on the political turmoil in Japan created by the splits within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party which triggered the general election on July 18. He said the political upheaval would eventually benefit Japan by strengthening its democracy. However, US officials recognise that if they do not strike deal on trade with Mr Miyazawa's weakened administration in the next few days they may have to wait weeks if not months before a new Japanese administration is in place to resume substantive negotiations.</p>

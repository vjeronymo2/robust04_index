			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Markets: Of currencies and crashes - Global Investor After the turbulence of the past 10 days, many City pundits have thrown in the towel, declaring that bond and equity markets are now hostage to irrational forces and beyond orthodox diagnosis. Well, up to a point, Lord Copper, as the servile journalists used to say to Evelyn Waugh's megalomanic newspaper proprietor. But there are ways of rationalising recent events which can throw light on market movements in the weeks ahead, even if predictions about the next few days are best left to necromancers and Nick Knight, the volatile soothsayer from Japanese securities giant Nomura. The starting point is that careless political talk costs money, especially over trade and currencies. The proximate cause of the Crash of 1987 was the threat by the then US Treasury Secretary, James Baker, to push down the dollar against the D-mark. No surprise, then, that war whoops from the US Administration over trade with Japan ten days ago started the latest outbreak of nervousness in the markets. The fear that a further punitive appreciation of the yen against the dollar might lead to another rise in US interest rates appeared to strengthen the case of those who argued that the quarter point rise in US interest rates earlier this month constituted a decisive turning point. Yet a closer comparison between the macro-economic factors behind the 1987 Crash and those behind today's jitters suggests a less gloomy prognosis. Throughout 1987 politicians and fund managers were obsessed with trade imbalances between the US, and Japan and Germany. As a result of official intervention to stem the dollar's decline after the Louvre Accord there was a build up of liquidity which rubbed off on global securities markets. The heated debate over current account imbalances took place against a background of rising inflationary pressure as economic recovery in the G7 countries moved closer to maturity. This time, in contrast, only the US economy is growing strongly. Elsewhere, inflation is scarcely a threat in the short and medium term. There is an absence of ill-considered, large-scale currency intervention. While the Japanese have shown understandable irritation at the American lurch into a perverse form of bilateralism just as the Japanese economy teeters on the brink of a serious deflation, officials have hinted at concessions. Except in the very short term, an appreciating yen is unsustainable given the weakness of Japanese domestic demand. That does not sound like the right macro-economic formula for a global crash; or at least not unless politicians and central bankers put a great deal more work into it. Leveraged myopia The parallels with October 1987 are much closer on the purely financial front, in the sense that leverage is multiplying the consequences of small changes in interest rates to an extraordinary degree. While commercial bank balance sheets are probably in better shape than at any time since the 1940s and 1950s, when they were stuffed with government paper issued to finance wartime deficits, the balance sheets of securities intermediaries may be more questionable. At the turn of this year many market makers, who had just been paid exceptionally large bonuses, were far too sanguine about future bond prices. Much market fall-out has come from the trimming of positions. These movements were then exaggerated by derivatives trading and program trading, after the Fed's interest rate decision. Derivatives can themselves be highly leveraged. And the people who are using them extensively include the hedge funds, whose own operations are often leveraged five or six times over with debt. It seems plausible that the degree of leverage in modern securities markets is higher than at any time in living memory. Small wonder market adjustments to changes in policy direction are so violent. Compounding the problem is the fact that investment bankers' capital can look small in relation to their short-term money market funding requirements. They know that they are vulnerable to wholesale market runs because they cannot fall back on a retail deposit base or a lender of last resort. Their trading relationships cut across a huge range of instruments, currencies, markets and time zones. Within the trading day they are not always able to calculate their exposure to other traders or to their counterparties. No wonder rumours abound about problems at some of the best-known investment banks. An important message for central bankers and securities watchdogs is that the location of risk in the financial system has shifted somewhat from the commercial banking towards the securities fraternity. That is the inevitable consequence of the growing role of securities markets in financial intermediation, which has been indirectly encouraged by the tougher BIS capital regime for banks and the sophistication in dealing techniques that technology now permits. The message for investors is that leverage may lead to over-reaction in the markets. They also need to remember that sharp market movements usually turn out to be the solution not the problem - in this case, to overheating in capital markets, which had attracted disproportionate sums from the US banking system while the Fed was trying to put the banks back on their feet. The question, when the dust begins to settle, is whether the market adjustment has provided a full and final solution. Unhinged The other question for investors is how to cope with a world in which economies are manifestly uncoupled while securities markets are shackled together. The charts suggest that developed world short-term interest rates do not follow the US to the letter, even if there is a tendency to follow with a lag. The bond markets, on the other hand, do appear to move together except, as James Capel points out, when there is an exceptionally powerful domestic influence such as German unification. Since the lifting of exchange controls some convergence in bond markets made sense, as governments were competing for capital in the same marketplace and international investors were wielding a new discipline over fiscal policy. But with such obvious scope for further declines in short-term rates in European bond markets, it is interesting that Capel finds a degree of regularity in the movement of bond yields and purely domestic economic turning points - pleasing for those who see further potential in European bonds. And the firm finds little relationship between commodity prices and bond yields. That should give commodity enthusiasts among the hedge fund managers pause for thought. So, too, should the analysis in Brian Reading's latest opus for Lombard Street Research, which makes a bold stab at providing a rationale for recent commodity price movements. Reading points to the causal relationship between the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime, the subsequent explosion in world reserves and the 1970s commodity price explosion. Yet when world reserves accelerated both in absolute terms and relative to industrial production between 1986 and the early 1990s, commodity prices failed to take off. Nor does the recent spurt make sense on the basis of G7 industrial production in an unsynchronised economic cycle. Part of the explanation for the increase in world reserves in the 1980s is simply currency intervention to support the dollar - note the blip on the chart before the 1987 Crash. To the extent that intervention was sterilised, to avoid any impact on domestic monetary conditions, commodity prices were unaffected. But the table also shows that non-oil developing countries accounted for between half and two thirds of the increase in foreign currency reserves since 1980. On the basis of plausible assumptions about the developing economies' share in world industrial production, Reading concludes that commodity prices are seeing a cyclical recovery, reinforced by financial speculation, that has come earlier than normal relative to OECD growth. Yet he is no bull of commodities. Commodity price increases in the OECD, he argues, will be insufficient to offset the downward pressure on inflation from continuing large output gaps everywhere apart from the US. Better to be unhedged after all.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 24/2/94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 ---------------- % change over period ----------------                   US     Japan   Germany    France     Italy        UK  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash   Week          0.06      0.04      0.12      0.12      0.16      0.09   Month         0.26      0.19      0.51      0.55      0.71      0.46   Year          3.44      3.16      7.19      9.56     11.38      5.63  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year   Week         -0.53     -0.62     -0.83     -0.66     -0.59     -1.43   Month        -1.56     -1.33     -1.03     -1.28     -1.33     -1.84   Year          4.10      5.49      8.81     14.19     22.40      8.03  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year   Week         -1.20     -0.50     -1.58     -1.37     -2.16     -3.22   Month        -2.77     -1.48     -2.36     -2.18     -3.39     -4.72   Year          5.03      5.41      9.38     16.77     30.82     11.60  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities   Week           0.2      1.4       0.2       -0.9     -3.7       -2.5   Month          0.1      5.0       2.4       -0.3      7.8       -3.9   Year           9.4     24.6      29.9       24.4     38.7       24.8  --------------------------------------------------------------------- BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 24/2/94  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            ----------------- % change ----------------                             Close        Week        Month        Year Bandar Raya Dev.

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian wool market has continued to move steadily dearer, and the AWC market indicator, at 442 cents a kg. on October 6, is getting close to the high point of the season, 459, when sales were resumed in July. Clearances at auction are also good, over 90%. As always, strength in primary markets is causing more buying interest in wool using markets, though over-supply and recent erratic weakness in the Australian dollar make price rises difficult to establish.</p>

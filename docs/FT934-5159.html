			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Observer: Out with a bang Chinese celebrations will never go with a bang again - at least, not in Beijing. From midnight, Beijing's 10m residents can no longer ignite their own fire crackers; from now on firecrackers will only be permitted on official business. Not surprisingly, Beijingers are grumbling about the ban, which has been imposed for anti-pollution and personal safety reasons; hundreds are injured by fireworks each year. China invented gunpowder in the seventh century and is the spiritual home of firecrackers, which the Chinese believe frighten off evil spirits. 'Banning fireworks is like telling Spaniards they can't have bull-fights, or Brazilians they are not allowed their carnival,' grouses one Beijing intellectual.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / China to let foreigners into air joint ventures China yesterday said it would let foreigners run joint-venture airlines in 1994, as part of a programme to speed the development of aviation, Reuter reports from Beijing. Foreigners also would be allowed to invest in China's commercial airports and run all operations except air traffic control, according to Mr Lin Kun, a senior foreign trade official. He also said similar investment would be allowed in other parts of China's transport system and infrastructure. Mr Lin said economic growth and industrial production had expanded so briskly that China would be forced to resort more foreign-led 'build, operate and transfer' projects. Beijing has been insisting on relying on foreigners only for aircraft. However, air accidents and outbreaks of chaos at airports have persuaded the government that rapid import of aircraft without improving ground control, reservations and passenger management was unsustainable.</p>

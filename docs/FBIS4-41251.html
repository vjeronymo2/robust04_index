			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Agafonov: "G-7 Will Demand Quicker Reforms </F> From Ukraine, and in Exchange Will Promise Aid on the Russian  Model"]    [Text] Tokyo -- According to leaks from Japanese  Government sources, at the G-7 meeting in Naples the forum's  fundamental document -- the economic declaration -- will for the  first time include specific mention of the need to grant  large-scale Western assistance to poor Ukraine.    According to Japanese information, the draft G-7  declaration,  which has already been drawn up, notes that the economic crisis  in Ukraine has reached serious proportions and sovereign Kiev  needs emergency Western aid so as not to slip into an abyss of  instability and upheavals. The document proposes the holding  urgently, in the fall of this year (and most likely in Canada),  of a special G-7 meeting at ministerial level to discuss the  details of both an aid package and a mechanism for granting the  aid. A special meeting like this has been held only once before  -- in Tokyo in April of last year, and on that occasion Western  aid for the Russian reforms was on the agenda.    The appearance of a clause on Ukraine in the fundamental  document of the G-7 summit-level forum is, according to the  Japanese version, attributable to two "firefighting" factors --  a further deterioration in the situation in Ukraine could result  in dangerous consequences for international nuclear security in  view of the existence on Ukrainian territory of nuclear weapons  and the still operating Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station; and an  escalation of the economic crisis could blow apart the political  situation in Ukraine and present Europe with a "second  Yugoslavia."    The initiative to put the Ukrainian question on the G-7  agenda, the Japanese sources note, comes from Italy, and the  subject itself was raised for discussion for the first time by  the special personal representatives of the G-7 heads of state  at the end of last week. The proposed pattern of economic aid  to Kiev is thus far virtually a total repetition of the Russian  version -- it is a question of granting credits from the IMF,  the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Developments, conditional on further progress in Ukraine's  economic transformations. Here the G-7 intends to urge Kiev to  proceed more quickly along the path of reforms.    The volume of possible loans to keep the Ukrainian economy  afloat remains a big secret -- there is not even a hint of this  in the utterances of informed sources.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] Japan's JIJI news agency said in a report dispatched  from Seoul that North Korea once asked the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team to provide it with $300,000  in return for its allowance of nuclear inspections.    Quoting Seoul sources, JIJI reported that, although the IAEA  inspection team has conducted inspections mainly in Yongbyon  since 3 March, at one point North Korea refused inspection of  its nuclear fuel rod plant after already agreeing to include it  on the inspection list, and demanded that the IAEA provide  $300,000 if it wanted to inspect this facility.</p>

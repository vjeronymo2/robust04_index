			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Handle with care WHEN NORTH Korea threatened to become the first country to pull out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty last March, alarm bells rang from Seoul to Washington at the prospect of a nuclear arms race in east Asia. Although Pyongyang withdrew its threat three months later after talks with the US, the alarm about its purported nuclear ambitions is far from over. On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly - by 140 votes to one - expressed concern that North Korea is still refusing to allow full monitoring of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Today, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, is in the South Korean capital to discuss what to do next about suspicions that North Korea is processing nuclear fuel into an illegal stockpile of plutonium. Pyongyang's defiance presents the world with a tricky dilemma. On the one hand, it is vital to the credibility of international efforts against nuclear proliferation that the IAEA be allowed to conduct unlimited spot inspections of North Korean facilities. If not, suspicions that it is violating NPT commitments will persist, with the potential to disturb the regional strategic balance. On the other hand, it is hard to see what more the UN can do to force rapid North Korean compliance. Short of a lightning bombing raid on suspect facilities - a course so perilous that no one is seriously contemplating it  -economic sanctions are the weapon most frequently mentioned. But a sanctions resolution would almost certainly fall to a Chinese veto in the Security Council. And in any case, tightening the international noose on what is already a pariah state would be at least as likely to result in greater instability as to bring Pyongyang's paranoid leaders to their senses. Resolving the issue is complicated by the fact that no one can be certain whether the North Koreans have any realistic prospect of building a bomb in the near future, or what they ultimately want. It seems unlikely that Pyongyang has stirred up the nuclear question purely for its own sake. More likely, it is seeking, in return for opening up its facilities to inspection, some concessions from the US: diplomatic recognition to match Russian and Chinese recognition of South Korea, perhaps, combined with cancellation of what Pyongyang sees as aggressive US military manoeuvres in the south. If that is the real aim, it suggests that the US, Japan and other interested parties would be right to continue with their strategy of attempting to negotiate with Pyongyang, rather than piling on more direct forms of pressure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elia Sardinas for the "Exclusive" program -- </F> passages in quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Today, Vietnamese Ambassador Le Duc Anh delivered a  $2.5-million donation during a beautiful ceremony at the Ho Chi  Minh ESVEC [expansion unknown] in Jaruco Municipality. The  materials were collected in a solidarity campaign sponsored by  the UJC [Union of Young Communists] Ho Chi Minh Contingent and  supported en masse by the Vietnamese people.    [LeDuc] "I can tell you the campaign is an example of the  mobilization that is always seen in Vietnam, and our people's  awareness and internationalist solidarity with the Cuban people.  [applause] Therefore, the campaign, like other campaigns,  involved the large-scale and enthusiastic participation of all  the Vietnamese people, all young Vietnamese people and children."    The closing speech was given by UJC Secretary Juan Contino.    [Contino] "Friendship and brotherhood between Cuba and  Vietnam have been forged by a joint struggle waged for decades,  as has defense of the most humane system of solidarity that  exists in the world today. That is precisely why millions of  children, young people, old people, women, students, and workers  -- the purest, most representative examples of the Vietnamese  people -- actively participated in the campaigns of solidarity  with our homeland."    The ceremony was presided over by Jose Ramon Balaguer,  member  of the Politburo; Melba Hernandez, a heroine of the Moncada  Barracks attack; and Ministry of Education officials.</p>

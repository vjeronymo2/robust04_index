			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Hirst: "The Father of Battles"] </F>   [Text] Turkish Kurdistan -- Something seems to be happening  to President Saddam Husayn. It was during his last speech for  'Id al- Fitr, the feast which marks the end of Ramadan, that  people really noticed it. "I have never seen him like this  before", said a high ranking adviser of his, who recently  defected to "liberated" Kurdistan and the Iraqi National  Congress, the opposition alliance which has established itself  there.    Saddam spoke, and looked, like a man near the end of his  tether. The coarse features were bloated and haggard, his speech  slurred and his gestures, always uncouth, now weary and slovenly  too. His only topic was the UN sanctions, and the certainty  that they would be renewed. Five times he slapped his thigh in  unbecoming exasperation at the prospect. His ministers, as  usual, sat reverently through this grim performance; but Iraqis  watching it on television found it deeply revealing, and no one  more than his former adviser. "I do believe", he said, "that  before long he will do something crazy."    It is almost axiomatic among Iraqis that Saddam, the  inveterate gambler, will eventually do something truly crazy;  they cite his invasions of Iran in 1980 and Kuwait in 1991 as  precedents for the climactic gamble to come, the one he will  embark on when he feels that his end is nigh.    That feeling could come upon him any time. It has already  come upon many Iraqis. For them, the fate which has befallen  one of his hench men, Kamal Husayn al-Majid, is a metaphor for  the whole system, for the retribution surely closing in on it.  Kamal was the architect of Saddam's unconventional weapons  programme. He is also a monstrous blasphemer. During the great  Shiite Uprising of 1991, he led the army's assault on the holy  city of Karbala. Addressing the shrine of Husayn, he said:  "your name is Husayn, and so is mine. Let us see who is  stronger now." He commanded his troops to open fire on this  most sacred of Shiite sites. He visited Karbala again this  month -- but in an ambulance and to beg the saint's forgiveness.  He has a tumour on the brain.    The feeling that Saddam's whole system is doomed is rooted  in  more than signs or superstition. No one -- thanks to its  awesome apparatus of repression -- has been able to destroy it  from without, but, like its former minister of military  industry, it is sickening, rotting, dying from within.    Indeed, if Saddam himself has yet to commit the final act of  madness his people expect of him, a Kafkaesque insanity already  fatally infects his system, which simply cannot cope with the  sheer, accumulating weight of problems that beset it; it is  going haywire under the strain.    At last the UN sanctions are biting. Nothing Saddam can do  will stop the rot. This really set in last summer. Its chief  yardstick is the value of the Iraqi dinar which in turn is the  chief yardstick of Saddam's plummeting prestige. Officially,  one dinar is still worth $3. But so weird are the workings of  Saddam's economy that the only place where real banknotes remain  in circulation is the place where his writ no longer runs, here  in "liberated" Kurdistan. Last summer $1 fetched 20 dinars  here; now it is 80 dinars. But in Saddam-controlled territory  itself the rate is 350 "Saddam dinars" to the dollar, and  falling fast.    He repeatedly slips into the despot's delusion that terror  can control market forces. In 1992, long before the rot set in,  he had already executed 42 merchants as a warning to others. It  only made matters worse. The dead men even enjoyed a sort of  posthumous rehabilitation; they were called "martyrs of an angry  hour". Saddam's son Udayy, kingpin of the ruling family's  immense business interests, tried other tactics. In January he  put on what was supposed to be a confidence-raising show. He  emptied all the coffers of one of his companies in front of its  employees; they counted $50 million. It failed to impress the  market. Two days later, the secret police tried their way; they  shot two dealers and wounded 29. Then, with Saddam's latest  speech, the dinar took its latest, greatest tumble. An order  has gone out to the banks: nobody can with draw more than 2,500  dinars -- $7 -- at a time. The situation is virtually out of  control. Even Udayy's newspaper, Babel -- for he is an editor  too -- admits it; within a few days, it said this week, the  dinar would be down to 500 to the dollar.    Those who suffer most from the dinar's collapse are the  great  majority who do not in some way benefit from the system. They  are kept from starvation by the basic rations on which Saddam  manages to spend some $750 million a year -- most of the rest of  his meagre export earnings, perhaps $1,250 million, going on  illegally imported, hiqh-quality weaponry. The middle classes  are being wiped out; garbage collectors are now deemed to fulfil  a more important basic function than teachers, and are paid  more. Some get by on dollars from relatives abroad. But others  sell off furniture, carpets, fridges, even doors and window  frames.    Impoverishment fuels a moral and social breakdown directly  attributable to Saddam's misrule. Ten, 20 people now die every  day in robberies with violence in what used to be a law-abiding  society. Typically, the criminals come from the ranks of young  men who were drafted into the army first to fight a murderous,  but wholly pointless, eight-year war with Iran, then, two years  later, the even more pointless Mother of Battles. They have  lost their youth; demobilised without compensation, often  without education or training, without jobs or the prospect of  them, inured to the cruelty and harsh, survivalist lessons of  war, they turn to violence of another kind. The law encourages  them: in a bid to stem the contagion, Saddam has decreed that  theft is a capital offence, so thieves kill, the better to  ensure they are not caught.    The people openly grumble and curse him as they never did  before. But more worrying for Saddam is the fact that the  sanctions are now having a political and bureaucratic, not just  an economic and social, impact. An extraordinary proportion of  the population -- in the army, the police, the mukhabaraat  (intelligence services), the Ba'th party -- are employed in the  apparatus of control and repression. They are so numerous that  the regime can no longer afford to raise them through better pay  and perks, above the mass of the people.    So for most, economic gain now takes clear precedence over  political loyalty. This is a cancer in the body politic, whose  atrophied limbs are less and less responsive to commands from  the centre. It is a great help to the opposition. "A year  ago", said a visitor from Saddam territory "it could be  dangerous to cross the lines. But now even wanted men, whose  pictures have appeared in the newspapers, do not hesitate. With  a few thousand Saddam dinars you can buy anyone. It is  guaranteed." That is hardly surprising when one considers that  the general who used to earn $10,000 a year is now on a hundred,  and the wretched conscript on less than 10. A loaf of bread,  never mind money, will buy him; his thrice-daily crust looks --  and tastes -- like sawdust.    Within this vast apparatus, Saddam has alway relied on three  concentric circles of regional and sectarian solidarity: the  country's traditionally dominant Sunni Muslim minority as a  whole, people from his hometown of Takrit, and, at the top, the  members of his own immediate family. But disaffection is  manifest in all three spheres.    Of the four Sunni provinces of central Iraq -- Mosul,  Takrit,  Baghdad (now overwhelmingly Shiite) and Ramadi -- the last is  pivotal. Extending from near Baghdad to the Syrian and  Jordanian border, it has always been a stronghold of the type of  pan-Arabist doctrines that spawned Baath, a principal provider  of officers and bureaucrats. In the 1991 Uprising, Saddam,  already dubious of its loyalty, made sure of it. "The  mukhabaraat", said a Ramadi defector from that fearsome  organisation, "themselves murdered Ramadis and brought their  bodies to Ramadi city. The people were told that the Shiite  rebels had killed them simply because they were Ramadis. They  believed it. But now they know the truth."    Two weeks ago there was a football match between the local  team and al-Zawraq from Baghdad, patronised by Arshad Yasin, a  Saddam bodyguard and big businessman. After Ramadi scored two  goals in the first half, Yassin ordered a change of referees.  Al-Zawraq scored three goals in the second. The crowd  protested. Yassin's men opened fire on it. Some were shot in  the feet and legs. The riot spread to the town; they cursed  Saddam.    The fact is that Saddam has incurred the secret enmity of  virtually every clan and tribe in the central Sunni "triangle".  One by one his his purges have afflicted them all, even those of  Takrit itself. In the old days he used to treat the Takritis,  mindful of his dependence on them, with greater restraint than  the rest. No more. After the latest attempted coup, real or  imagined, he executed 11 Takriti officers, as well as the son of  the most revered figure in the town's modern history. One can  imagine, when such things happen, what conflicts of emotions  torment such high Takriti commanders as remain, particularly the  one whose cousin, Omar Haza'a, the former mayor of Baghdad, had  his tongue cut out for insulting Saddam's mother before being  hacked to death with an axe.    Then there is the ruling family itself. In the end it may  well be here, in the obscure, incestuous, microscopic universe  of the Saddam ruling house, rather than in the more easily  observable macrocosm of social, political and economic forces at  work in the country at large, that Iraq's destiny will be  decided. They must all hate him as much as they fear him, and  the only thing that stays their hand is the knowledge that if he  goes, they go with him.    Saddam has traditionally held himself aloof from family  conflicts, playing one party against another. Yet there are  indications that he now deeply distrusts the most infamous of  the Majids, defence minister Ali Hassan al-Majid -- Chemical Ali  to the Kurds -- and possibly even suspects that he was behind a  recent assassination attempt. It looks as though the versatile  young Udayy is now being groomed for the defence ministry in his  place.    Saddam still clings to the hope that the sanctions will be  lifted. At first he thought that might come about through the  Clinton administration, which, initially at least, seemed less  hostile than George Bush. He now seems to have despaired of  Clinton -- but found new encouragement in signs of Russian,  Chinese and French eagerness to do business with a rehabilitated  Iraq. He has been unusually quiescent for 15 months, but, unless  his slender hopes take more substantial form. he cannot remain  quiescent for ever.    "He is not", said his former adviser, "the man to wait until  the knife is on his very neck." Confronted with a growing  peril, he believes in the pre-emptive strike, especially one  that he can turn to strategic advantage; that was the impulse,  heavily rooted in his paranoid view of the world, that drove him  to invade both Iran and Kuwait. He thinks the western  "conspiracy" is still going on, that he is still fighting the  Mother of Battles in other forms. But this slow and wearisome  "war of attrition" is one in which his whole position, his grip  on his apparatus, is steadily eroding. On paper he may have  rebuilt much of his army to as much as 80 per cent of its  pre-Kuwait capability. But there must already be a serious risk  that if he orders it to attack, its commanders -- known to be  appalled at the prospect of yet another great debacle -- simply  will not obey, or, if they do, that the demoralised troops will  simply refuse to fight. So the impulse to act sooner rather  than later, and with maximum surprise, must be growing very  strong.    The question on everyone's mind is not whether but when  Saddam, sensing the end, will "do something crazy". He is  certainly in his terminal phase, but how long that will actually  last depends mainly on one key factor. Will the West -- which  so blatantly, and, it is now clear, so disastrously betrayed the  great Uprising -- make amends by helping the Iraqi opposition,  in a truly serious way, to bring the despot down? Will it do  more than merely preserve the sanctions, which, however  effective in the long run, cause the Iraqi people increasingly  unjustifiable suffering in the meantime?    If, for example, the West declared al-Basrah a "safe haven"  like the Kurdish north, the end would not only come more quickly  but there would be less danger of this most strategic of Middle  Eastern countries being plunged into the chaos and civil war  which regional and international powers so greatly fear -- but  which their current inertia and indifference is making more  likely.    The question is also how. Saddam has two basic choices. The  people of "liberated" Kurdistan fear they will be the primary  target of the despot at bay. Both official rhetoric and new  troop concentrations point strongly in that direction. In  January Saddam all but announced he would be spending the 'Id  al-Fitr in Kurdistan. Then, in addition to the three army corps  permanently stationed on the front line, three divisions of the  elite Republican Guards reinforced two others in the sensitive  Kirkuk and Mosul areas. But despite this -- and other signs,  like the arming of ostensibly loyalist Arab and Kurdish tribes,  of preparation for battle -- nothing happened perhaps  developments at the Security Council persuaded Saddam to call it  off.    Yet the intent remains clear. Any attack on Kurdistan could  take various forms -- terror bombardments the occupation of  Suleimaniyah Province, the Kurds' only access, through Turkey or  Syria, to the outside world -- but a purpose common to them all  would be to tell the West committed to the Kurds' protection  "Look, I am still here, I can still make plenty of trouble for  you, and unless you accommodate me, I shall."    Saddam has also moved Republican Guards to the south. Why,  no one quite knows. But it is certaunly southwards that his  other option lies. "When the knife gets close" said the former  adviser, "that is where he will strike. Occupying a piece of  Kurdistan risks western reprisals, but offers no great strategic  prize in return. Kuwait does offer it. The Gulf, with its  oilfields and shipping, is where he has always felt his  opportunities lie. He now hates the Saudis, champions of the  continued sanctions. Vengeance is part of his Bedouin  psychology. I think that, next time, he will do what he didn't  do last time, both take Kuwait and send his tanks down to the  Saudi oilfields."    That would surely be his end. For with western and Saudi  aircraft in Dhahran, the tanks would never make it across the  open desert. It would mean that the logic of Samson had finally  taken possession of him. For he has never made much secret of  it: if and when he goes down, he will take the world with him,  or as much of it as he can.</p>

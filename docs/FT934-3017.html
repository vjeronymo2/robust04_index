			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: European recession leaves JFB at Pounds 3.06m The warning from the directors of Johnson &amp; Firth Brown in August that second-half profits were expected to be below those of the first half was borne out yesterday. The full year to end-September saw pre-tax profits of the specialist engineering group fall from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds 3.06m, including a second-half contribution of Pounds 996,000 - compared with the first half's Pounds 2.07m. Earnings fell to 1.4p (3.3p) and a final dividend of 0.35p makes a total of 1.35p (3p). The shares fell 2p to 36 1/2 p. Acquisitions added Pounds 8.5m to total turnover of Pounds 130m (Pounds 124m) and Pounds 613,000 to operating profits of Pounds 4.83m (Pounds 6.94m). Interest took Pounds 1.77m (added Pounds 212,000). The directors said the results reflected a lack of demand in mainland Europe in markets that were of 'increasing relevance' to the group. They added that in addition to a generally weak economic environment, group companies experienced considerable pressure on margins. European competitors were 'increasing their export efforts outside Europe and attempting to win market share to maintain volume, almost regardless of margins.'

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHICKELE PLANS PASADENA END TO TOURS AS P.D.Q. BACH;  </P> <P> MUSIC: AN EMPHASIS ON OTHER COMPOSING PUSHES ASIDE 25-YEAR CAREER OF CLASSICAL  MUSIC SATIRE.  </P> <P> Along with all the usual reasons for going to see P.D.Q. Bach, there is now one  bittersweet additional one.  </P> <P> Sad to say, this may be the last time around for the hapless composer of  "Concerto for Horn and Hardart," the "No-No Nonette," the "Schleptet in E-flat"  and many even less distinguished pieces.  </P> <P> "Yes, I've decided that this season is my next-to-last touring with P.D.Q.,"  said Peter Schickele, the man who, as "Prof." Peter Schickele, not only  discovered P.D.Q. -- the fictive, besotted last-born son of J.S. Bach -- but  also parlayed him into a hefty, improbable 25-year career.  </P> <P> "My last regular concert will be April 1, 1991, which is of course P.D.Q.'s  birthday," said Schickele by phone from his country getaway in Woodstock, N.Y.  "It will be with the Pasadena Symphony, which is conducted by Jorge Mester. It  was Mester who conducted the first P.D.Q. concert when we were Juilliard  students in 1959, and the very first public concert in 1965."  </P> <P> A moment later, Schickele softened the shocking finality of this announcement.  </P> <P> "It won't necessarily be a complete goodby to P.D.Q. I still plan on doing the  New York concerts during the last week in December, as long as a crowd shows  up. And some more recordings."  </P> <P> But with the end of regular touring, an era will end. P.D.Q. Bach concerts --  with their distinctive blend of deliciously low slapstick and brilliant musical  parody -- have taken their place in the very top drawer of musical satire. The  shows appeal to all levels of musical and comedic sophistication. They are even  loved by most classical music fans, a group not always associated with a  razor-sharp sense of humor.  </P> <P> The P.D.Q. performances are physically taxing. Making one's entrance by  shimmying down a knotted rope from a balcony places more of a demand on one  than, say, walking on from the wings. But the endomorphic, 54-year-old  Schickele says it is not declining stamina that's behind P.D.Q's  semi-retirement.  </P> <P> "I've got other things I want to do. I've got an idea for a radio program and a  couple of television possibilities. These aren't signed and sealed, so I can't  really talk about them. I also enjoyed the few film scores I've done (four  altogether, including "Silent Running") and would like to do more. But the  trouble with that business is that they always want you to start tomorrow, and  I'm booked up two years in advance."  </P> <P> He also cites the mounting commissions for his "serious" music. This has always  been a touchy point for Schickele, who was a graduate composition student of  the eminent composer Vincent Persichetti. Schickele's non-P.D.Q. music is  widely performed and, for the most part, warmly embraced by audiences and  critics. But Schickele is clearly discomfited that the unwelcome shadow of  P.D.Q. hangs inappropriately over many of the serious performances. "Some  people go into a concert of my serious stuff determined to find things to laugh  at. And they do. It's as if they can't accept the distinction."  </P> <P> So one additional purpose of P.D.Q.'s withdrawal from the public stage will be  to help put the two aspects of Schickele's career into what he regards as a  healthier balance.  </P> <P> "My hope is that in the long run there would be an appreciation for both. To me  they are very complementary. In a way, the spirit that leads P.D.Q. also gives  my serious music a sunny, dramatic quality. . . . On the other hand, to tell  you the truth, if I were forced to list my favorite works -- something I hope  I'm never forced to do -- I would include some P.D.Q. pieces along with the  Peter Schickele pieces."  </P> <P> Schickele conceded that without the impetus of touring, certain ideas for gags  or bits that have been percolating may never be realized.  </P> <P> "I have an 'Ideas' file that's full of napkins from Holiday Inns and that kind  of thing. Over the years some of them have indeed turned into pieces."  </P> <P> One of them that hasn't is a rather recondite idea for a sendup of Paul  Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber.  </P> <P> "I thought it would be fun to write a piece called 'Symphonic Metamorphosis on  Themes From Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber by Paul  Hindemith by Peter Schickele.' But I'm not sure the piece could have ever lived  up to the title."  </P> <P> Schickele also noted ruefully that certain P.D.Q. instruments may forever  remain in the concept stage. "A timpanist wanted me to invent a ukulele da  gamba, and I'm sorry I didn't do it." The uke would have been played -- like  the now-out-of-fashion viola da gamba -- upright, between the performer's  knees.  </P> <P> But the P.D.Q. muse is not silent. Schickele recently released a new recording  on the Telarc label and another is already in the works.  </P> <P> "I have the same arrangement with Telarc that I used to have with Vanguard (his  longtime record company during the '60s and '70s). It's a gentleman's agreement  that I won't do any P.D.Q. Bach records without telling them first. But I'm not  tied down to having to produce one a year, or anything like that."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there are some P.D.Q. commissions left to honor. Among them at the  moment is a piece that will premiere later this season with the Cleveland  Orchestra.  </P> <P> Its title alone should reassure any P.D.Q. fans who fear that the master is in  danger of losing his creative spark. It's called . . . "The Safe Sextet."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Weight:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a condition of receiving Federal-aid funds, States are required to enforce Federal weight limits (23 U.S.C. 127) on the Interstate System and on routes providing reasonable access to and from the Interstate. The penalty for failure to do so is the withholding of a State's National Highway System (NHS) apportionment. A State may set any weight limit it wishes on other highways, though many have voluntarily adopted Interstate limits for all roads. States are therefore required to use the FHWA's definition only when considering whether to issue a nondivisible load permit allowing an overweight vehicle to operate on the Interstate System and roads providing reasonable access to and from the Interstate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Length:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal laws relating to vehicle length (49 U.S.C. app. 2311 and 23 CFR 658.13, 658.23) apply to the NN of highways_see appendix A to part 658_and routes providing reasonable access to and from the NN (49 U.S.C. app. 2312 and 23 CFR 658.19). The Interstate is part of the larger NN, and reasonable access rights extend the reach of Federal size laws beyond the NN itself. In contrast to Federal weight law, these provisions and the implementing regulations preempt conflicting State laws or regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a practical matter, the FHWA definition of a nondivisible load will rarely be applied to cargo length because it does not cover straight trucks or single-trailer combinations. It covers only loads on vehicles (1) operating on the NN, and routes providing reasonable access to and from the NN, (2) which have two or more cargo-carrying units, and (3) when the overall length from the front of the first to the rear of the last cargo-carrying unit exceeds the longest such length in actual legal operation for a specific configuration on or before June 1, 1991. There are very few single loads that rest simultaneously on the bed of a straight truck and on a trailer, or on two or more trailers. And even in those cases, the definition would not apply unless the total cargo box length were greater than that allowed by the State in 1991. The definition will apply more often to loads, like entire buildings, that are moved on a series of dollies, each of which is a single cargo-carrying unit. There has been virtually no controversy about these loads, and we expect little in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Width:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal width law (49 U.S.C. app. 2316 and 23 CFR 658.15), like the length requirements, applies on the NN and reasonable access routes, and it preempts conflicting State laws or regulations. However, the definition of a nondivisible load adopted by this rule does not apply to an overwidth vehicle because Federal law provides that States may issue permits to motor vehicles more than 102 inches wide without regard to divisibility or nondivisibility (49 U.S.C. app. 2316(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Height:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has no authority to regulate vehicle height; there is no Federal law on this subject. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments to the Docket <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Containers:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SNPRM proposed to allow States to treat containers moving in international commerce as nondivisible loads. Responses were about equally divided. Three State transportation departments favored the proposal, while two States, the ATA, and the Advocates opposed it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Missouri said that ``(u)niformity among States to issue overweight permits for containerized loads in excess of 80,000 pounds gross weight would be a giant accomplishment.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Connecticut suggested that States be required to treat sealed containerized loads moving in international commerce as nondivisible, subject to maximum dimensions and weights it did not specify. Florida went even further, pointing out that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> no justification is presented in the SNPRM for not affording identical containerized loads in domestic commerce a benefit being afforded such containers in international commerce. Therefore, it is proposed that the final rule make no reference to either international or domestic commerce and the statement in question should be revised to read: A State may treat a sealed containerized load as a nondivisible load. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the other hand, the Washington State Patrol strongly disagreed with the proposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If that were allowed, the industry could load any container to whatever weight, claim its (sic) moving in international commerce and obtain an overweight permit, without regard to axle, gross weight or bridge formula requirements *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During a recent ``Container Weight'' study, conducted by the Washington State Patrol, it was shown that of the 3,100 vehicles transporting containers, which exceeded the legal weight limits, all but one could be transported legally by using vehicles with the proper number of axles and axle spacings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Washington State Patrol concluded that ``(t)he proposal *&blank;*&blank;* appears to be in conflict with the `Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992' *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, the Washington DOT argued that ``(r)ather than stating a policy that the FHWA is ambivalent about whether the states allow containerized cargo to be treated as non-divisible, it would seem better to encourage a national policy that they are not. This would alleviate competition on this point among ports to make their services more amenable to haulers and shippers.'' South Dakota contended that ``(j)ust because the container is `sealed' or is `moving in international commerce' should not preclude a loaded container from meeting the same size and weight requirements which exists for a load which is loaded in a container, such as a truck box, not `sealed' and not `moving in international commerce.''' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA recommended that the proposal to allow containers to be treated as nondivisible loads be dropped and that the issue be addressed in the rulemaking to implement the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Advocates argued that the FHWA had ``openly contravened Congressional intent'' expressed in section 4006 of the ISTEA ``by explicitly endorsing the prospective regular issuance of such permits for any `sealed containerized cargo in international commerce.''' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

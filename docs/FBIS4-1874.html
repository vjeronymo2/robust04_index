			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The co-existence of  the state-owned, collectively-owned and private sectors has  enabled Zhejiang Province in east China to become increasingly  prosperous.    An official of the provincial statistics bureau said that  Zhejiang's value of industrial output shot up 40 percent in 1993  to 87 billion yuan.    State-owned enterprises registered a 14-percent increase in  output value, collectively-owned companies scored a 49 percent  rise and private companies reported a 110 percent surge, he said.    He described foreign-funded businesses as a "newly emerging"  economic sector in Zhejiang.    In 1993 the provincial authorities approved the setting up  of  4,487 foreign-funded businesses, up 92 percent over the previous  year. Exports from operational foreign-funded businesses  climbed nearly 65 percent in 1993 to 850 million U.S. dollars.    The official said that these businesses accounted for 19  percent of Zhejiang's exports in 1993, up five percentage points.    Multi-economic sectors began to co-exist in the province in  the late 1970s, he recalled.    Since then the ratio of the state-owned sector to Zhejiang's  economy has dropped to 30 percent from 60 percent, while that of  the collectively-owned sector grew to 60 percent from 40 percent  and that of the private sector rose to 10 percent, he said.    Local economists said that the simultaneous growth of  various  sectors has led to intense competition, benefiting both  consumers and manufacturers.    The co-existence of these sectors has also made it possible  to rationalize the distribution of natural resources, they noted.    Township-run factories, a major component of the  collectively-owned sector, have become a new driving force  behind Zhejiang's economic expansion, one economist said.    Zhejiang now has 550,000 such factories, which produce 60  percent of its industrial output value, he said.    Furthermore, the number of self-employed people reached 1.24  million and that of private companies 19,400 at the end of 1993,  he said.    These two sectors were virtually non-existent in Zhejiang  before China initiated the policy of reform and opening to the  outside world in 1979, he said.    The co-existence of various sectors has enabled populous yet  resource-deficient Zhejiang to become a rising economic power in  China, he explained.    For example, Zhejiang's gross domestic product -- the value  of goods and services produced -- totaled 164.5 billion yuan in  1993, almost matching that of Shanghai, China's leading  manufacturing center.    The average per-capita income of rural residents in Zhejiang  was 1,746 yuan last year, higher than any other province-level  area in the country, he said.    Moreover, during the 1953-1978 period, when the state-owned  sector dominated, Zhejiang's economy's grew at an annual rate of  seven percent.    However, its economy has been growing at an annual rate of  18  percent since 1979, he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> W. VIRGINIA ROLLS PAST SYRACUSE  </P> <P> Fullback Rico Tyler scored the winning touchdown on a one-yard run in the third  quarter as No. 17 West Virginia capitalized on a turnover and beat Syracuse  24-17 Thursday night at Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> Cornerback Preston Waters preserved the victory by intercepting a fourth-down  desperation pass at the West Virginia three-yard line in the final minute.  </P> <P> West Virginia junior quarterback Major Harris became the first player in  college football history to pass for 5,000 yards and run for 2,000 in a career.  Harris rushed for 95 yards, raising his total to 2,144, and added 182 passing  yards for a three-year total of 5,054.  </P> <P> West Virginia drove 46 yards on 13 plays for the winning touchdown after  Syracuse halfback Michael Owens fumbled and defensive back Lawrence Drumgoole  recovered at the Orangemen's 46. The Mountaineers also got one-yard scoring  runs from Harris and tailback Eugene Napoleon.  </P> <P> The Mountaineers, who limited Syracuse to just seven offensive plays in the  third quarter while scoring 10 points to erase a 17-14 halftime deficit, ended  their regular season 8-2-1.  </P> <P> Cornell 20, Penn 6 -- Todd Nicholson ran for two touchdowns as the Big Red  snapped a five-game losing streak at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The loss was the fifth straight for the Quakers, who shared the Ivy crown last  year with Cornell but dropped into a fifth-place tie at 2-5 with the Big Red  and Brown. Cornell and Penn finished at 4-6 overall.  </P> <P> Cornell piled up 266 yards rushing, led by fullback John McNiff's 98 yards in  22 carries.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with United Workers Front President Edgar Ponce </F> by unidentified reporter on 3 February; place not given; from  "The Voz Andes" newscast -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Ponce] The Ecuadoran people went on strike and  expressed themselves in the streets, villages, and cities of our  country. They rejected the government's economic policies,  especially the increase in fuel prices, which has adversely  affected the people's pockets. Those who tried to de-emphasize  the people's response did not realize that there is a social  commotion throughout the country brought on by the devastating  economic measures. Consequently, this preventive strike is a  warning to the government that if it does not change its  economic model, if its does not rectify its measures, the  struggle will continue. That is the great message the  Ecuadoran people, workers, peasants, Indians, housewives, and  all those who actively participated in the national strike want  to send.    I would not describe the strike as successful. I would say  it is a national plebiscite in which the majority of the  Ecuadoran people assumed their responsibility and showed their  willingness to continue with the struggle.    [Reporter] According to the labor minister, only 50 percent  of all workers participated in the strike. What is the workers'  point of view?    [Ponce] I believe certain officials are being irresponsible  when they try to play down the workers' strike. Maybe he has  different ways of measuring strike participation. Should we  start suspending the pumping of potable water and oil and  suspending electricity and telephone service so they will admit  that the strike was successful? That is not the real way to  measure the people's protest. We must point out that the media  -- which, by the way, have not been very supportive of the labor  movement -- had to recognize that the people were mobilized at  the national level and showed signs of patriotism. The people  issued a warning that if the president of the Republic does not  change his ways on the economic front, if the vice president  does not stop provoking the people as he did yesterday when he  announced more economic measures, they will really be forcing  the Ecuadoran people to react.    [Reporter] What would the reactions be?    [Ponce] Mobilizations, strikes, and marches. We are going to  open up room for dialogue, which will allow us to move on. The  workers are making a call to all patriotic sectors, to all  sectors committed to the highest interests of the Ecuadoran  people, to find solutions. As for the specific case of the  fiscal deficit, there are solutions. Today we heard a series of  political leaders, analysts, and deputies say there were  solutions and that there was no need to increase fuel prices,  but the arrogance of the government's economic team, their  attitude of provocation, their disregard for the Ecuadoran  people is unparalleled. They are really being irresponsible,  therefore the struggle will continue in a much more organized  manner.    [Reporter] According to the reports you have received, are  workers being arrested or repressed?    [Ponce] We are currently collecting all the information. It  is almost ready, but we can say that there has been repression,  arrests, injuries, the occupation of buildings, and a series of  incidents that have resulted from the actions of public order  personnel. Actually, they were trying to downplay the effects  of this popular, national movement.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPRINTER DENIES HE TOOK DRUGS WITH JOHNSON IN '81  </P> <P> Sprinter Desai Williams denied today that he began taking steroids along with  teammate Ben Johnson in 1981.  </P> <P> Charlie Francis, who coached Canada's sprint team through the 1988 Summer  Olympics, has identified Williams as one of the athletes who for years took the  banned drugs.  </P> <P> "Charlie knew my thoughts on anabolic steroids," Williams told a federal  inquiry into drugs in amateur sport, adding that he is opposed to the drugs.  </P> <P> Williams, 29, said Francis took him in 1981 to see Dr. Gunter Helge Koch of  Toronto, where he had a physical examination.  </P> <P> He said that Francis then broached the subject of steroids but that Koch was  opposed to the idea.  </P> <P> "The doctor said: 'No, this a strong young guy, I don't think it's necessary.'  He said: 'I don't want to get involved in this.' "  </P> <P> Williams said he and Francis left the doctor's office and the coach handed him  a bottle of steroid pills.  </P> <P> "I was startled," said Williams, adding he later threw the bottle away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Do Things His Way'  </P> <P> Williams said he did not throw the pills away in front of Francis because "I  knew Charlie's outlook on steroids. I had to do things his way or I took the  highway."  </P> <P> Williams, who still is competing, won a bronze medal at the 1984 Los Angeles  Olympics as part of Canada's 1,600-meter relay team. He also made the finals in  the 100 meters at last fall's Seoul Olympics.  </P></p>

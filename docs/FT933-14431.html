			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Revenues at Ciga fall by 4.9% CIGA, the troubled luxury hotels chain which is controlled by the Aga Khan, suffered a 4.9 per cent fall in revenues in the first half as the recession bit into occupancy rates. Turnover fell to L206.8bn (Dollars 88m) from L217.6bn, with the steepest fall in Spain where room occupancy sank to just 38 per cent. By contrast, sales and occupancy in the big Italian market improved slightly. Ciga's latest figures come as a Milan judge decides today whether to approve a court order in late May freezing the Aga Khan's stake in Ciga, which is held through his quoted Fimpar holding company. The court decision, postponed from early June, follows a legal action by the German subsidiary of the IMI financial services group, which led a Dollars 100m loan to Fimpar. As a result of the freeze, trading in Ciga and Fimpar shares has been suspended for the past seven weeks. Ciga's shareholders' meeting yesterday elected two court-appointed representatives to its board, which has been slimmed down to seven from 12 members. The two members will represent the interests of the IMI-led bank consortium pending resolution of the dispute. Ciga gave no precise earnings forecast for this year in view of the difficult trading conditions. However, it said that it expected operating earnings to be in line with the L23.9bn made before interest in 1992. Having reduced costs to ensure break-even at occupancy levels of about 50 per cent, the group maintained it was well placed to benefit from any recovery. Net group debts reached L1,101bn, including unpaid interest, at the end of last month, against L972bn at the end of December 1992. Financial charges amounted to L196.3bn in 1992, with interest costs accounting for about L125bn and an additional burden of L71bn arising from the effect of the lira devaluation on Ciga's foreign currency borrowing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview by Lidiya Lukyanova of Yevgeniy Nikolayevich </F> Belyayev under the ``Ecology'' rubric: ``Public Health  Physicians, Respond!''; first paragraph is large-type boldface  KURANTY introduction]    [Text] When, especially in springtime, the stinking  and unknown-to-the-civilized-world Soviet substitute for  drinking water gushes through the water faucet, when some  epidemic or accident in a toxic industry has rolled up to the  threshold of your home, when there are more cockroaches in homes  and rats in basements than there are tenants, when there is no  longer anything to breathe in the city, then we will recall that  besides the local administration, we have protectors against  such similar disasters whom we taxpayers support, and we will  send an SOS.    In the USSR, the Communist Party kept the sanitary  inspectors' mouths shut tight with its' ``classified'' stamp and  with its ``concerning nondivulgence'' signed statement, and it  knew how to deal with insubordinates. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich  Belyayev, who until recently was the chief sanitary inspector of  one of Russia's oblasts, himself felt both the degradation and  arbitrariness of such a service. For this reason, after becoming  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, Ye. Belyayev insisted, with  government support, on the independence of his committee from  the departmental service and, in some regions, from the local  authorities. The masters of the sanitary service have always  felt that it does not pay and were even sometimes afraid to give  the public the truth about morbidity, the condition of the  environment, and barbaric working conditions.  [Lukyanova] I congratulate you on your independence  for the first time in 70 years. But independence is tied to  accountability. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, have sanitary inspectors  learned to use their independence to protect the public?  [Belyayev] That is a difficult question. You will  agree that not all of the service's directors and specialists  have successfully managed to immediately restructure their  psychology after crippling dependence on party discipline, after  decades of the forced necessity of hiding the truth about the  state of health and ecological problems from the public.  However, we can now act on the basis of the law ``Regarding the  Public's Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare'' and be guided by  society's interests. I suggest that such independence should fix  everything. It will be difficult, but we will learn to make  decisions independently, and reform of the service is proceeding  in this direction.  [Lukyanova] Tell me, is sanitary inspection in the  country now all-encompassing. Does it cover all industries or  are their still exceptions?  [Belyayev] Unfortunately, there are exceptions. The  sadly familiar principle -- divide and conquer -- still applies  to our service. It is very convenient for hiding negative  information. The Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation  has its own departmental public health service. Its status is  such that it is not always able to halt public health  violations. The Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal  Affairs, and Ministry of Security also have subdepartmental  services. The main thing that alarms us is that our committee  does not oversee the enterprises of the defense industry, the  space complex, or the production of nuclear fuel. Departmental  control of the former Third Main Administration of the USSR  Ministry of Health has essentially been maintained, and the  Federal administration of Biomedical and Emergency Problems is  currently attached to the Russian Federation Ministry of Health.  The departmental public health services do not have any legal  basis for activity at closed enterprises.  [Lukyanova] So do they have their own standards?  Their own maximum permissible concentrations [MPC]? Their own  levels?  [Belyayev] Yes...Now there is the problem of  destroying the very same chemical weaponry. Maximum permissible  concentrations and maximum permissible levels must be  established. The scientific research institutes working on this  problem are under the management of the specified main  administration. A situation has been created wherein the  department itself will develop standards, and we will be forced  to approve them. The last emergency in Tomsk is yet another  example of closure. We have no oversight over this secret  facility nor over analogous facilities. When an emergency  arises, the committee is obliged to participate in clearing the  consequences without knowing its specifics, process, etc. We  have proposed subordinating the aforementioned departmental  public health services to our committee but have encountered  fierce resistance from the ministries. We do not intend to  destroy them. They have knowledgeable specialists; too often,  however, their departmental affiliation ties their hands and  does not allow them to tell the whole truth. The government  supports the associations of all departmental public health  services in our committee, but the resistance...  [Lukyanova] Forgive me. For months the government has  permitted itself to ``support'' reorganization, but the  authorities do not make use of it. If there are not enough  authorities, it is possibly time to summon the people to the  next referendum. Must we really wait for the next Chernobyl,  Chelyabinsk, or Tomsk?.. Departmentalization closes the circle  of problems of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service's  independence. Do not take offense, but will it really be more  comfortable and easier for the specialists under the its wing?  [Belyayev] You have touched upon the most difficult  question in the development of our service. For years, quiet,  submissive, obsequious directors have been selected and have  learned to work in the bureaucratic style in order to, pardon  the expression, survive and remain in their job. In the very  same meat combine, there is the technology, the critics below,  and the unsanitariness all around. And they ask the sanitary  inspector, ``What, do you want the public to go without meat?  Put yourself in our position. We must feed the people and not  shut down production as you are prescribing.'' Builders  delivering homes with unfinished work offer the same arguments.  That is why some sanitary inspectors practically never make use  of their right to shut down harmful or unsanitary production. It  is very difficult for our services' directors to change their  psychology. They do not want to fight, they do not want to...It  is very difficult for sanitary inspectors to break the habit of  ``putting themselves into somebody's position.'' I have already  said that not everyone has been able to change his ideology and  get over the old system under the new conditions. But I also  wanted to mention that we have many examples where service  directors have made decisions based on principles. They have  made full use of their right to halt violations of public health  legislation. For examples, there are the Moscow, Perm,  Sverdlovsk, Orenburg, and many other republic, kray, and oblast  services.  [Lukyanova] The press has reported information about  the fact that foreign athletes and businesspersons, especially  artists, have brought their own drinking water when visiting our  country. Is this fact or fiction?  [Belyayev] It is difficult to talk about this, but  they do in fact bring in drinking water. It is a product used  every day. Most of ours does not meet the international standard.    In Russia, 12.6 percent of the drinking water used  absolutely  does not meet even our state standards [GOST] with respect to  bacteriologic indicators, and 23 percent does not meet the  chemical indicators. There are territories in Russia where up to  70 percent of the water drunk by the public does not meet the  standard. It is not pleasant for us to speak about the cost of  drinking water or about the fact that it is a product. The GOST  ``Drinking Water'' requires studies of water for 28 ingredients.  The World Health Organization proposed that water be studied for  50 ingredients back in 1984, and the list is now nearly up to  100. So you judge our level. Our out-of-date water purification  process makes it impossible to test for either 50 or 100  ingredients. And out-of-dateness creates the appearance of  well-being. Together with scientists, we are revising the GOST  for water. I am afraid that 70 percent of our drinking water  will turn out to be of poor quality.  [Lukyanova] Is there any possibility of providing  Russians with normal drinking water?  [Belyayev] In the distant future. It will involve  replacing the entire water treatment system and refraining from  using chlorine. Civilized countries have long stopped using it.  Chlorine compounds form corrosive and toxic substances in the  body. Abroad, ozone purification of water is a stage that has  already been passed, and we have not yet begun using the method  in most cities. Other water purification and disinfection  methods have already been discovered and are being used, and we  must switch over to them. And the quickest way is that of  building local units for additional water treatment, as is being  done throughout the entire world. They may be designed for the  home, hospital, children's settlement, or even apartment. The  units are expensive but effective. A second way is to sell  drinking water in containers as is done everywhere. And it must  be decided quickly. The water supplied to the public in Moscow  meets the GOST for drinking water.  [Lukyanova]Your committee developed a document  regarding compensation for harm inflicted to human health in  connection with environmental pollution. What is the fate of  this document?  [Belyayev]It is now being examined in Russia's state  legal administration. And I fear that the legal experts are  trimming it it so that all that will remain is a shell with no  teeth. In saying this, I am not implying any criticism of the  legal experts. Very weighty arguments are necessary to prove the  causes of such harm in court. This type of compensation is very  unusual for our government. They have been ``tossing the  document around'' for half a year already; however, we are  standing up for the public's interests.  [Lukyanova]I know that the committee has created a  register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological  materials. What is the purpose of this work?  [Belyayev]Increasingly newer compositions, alloys,  and chemicals are being used. Before they are used to  manufacture, let us say, children's toys, we must know  everything about these materials from the standpoint of  adherence to public health standards and prevention of harmful  health consequences. Construction materials that have not passed  health tests and that have not been approved by the sanitary and  epidemiological service have, for example, been used in  finishing the interior of buildings. And it later became clear  that they are harmful to health because they give off toxic  materials. A register is needed to eliminate this type of  ignorance. It is a check for the toxicity of materials used in  the national economy and everyday life.  [Lukyanova]While becoming familiar with your  committee's work, I was surprised: You are continuing to  actively set up antiplague institutions. I can't bear to find  out that plague is again with us. But what about typhus and  cholera?  [Belyayev]Plague has not been recorded among Russia's  population for many years. Natural foci of the infection have  recently been activated, however. That is, there has been an  increase in the number of cases of rodents and fleas excreting  plague microbe. Each year, the institutions of the antiplague  system exterminate rodents in order to reduce their number. The  members of the public who live within the territories of natural  foci, as well as geologists and shepards, are being inoculated.  Antiplague institutions are maintaining constant oversight of  this menacing infection and developing new diagnostic  preparations. Specialists at antiplague institutions are now  taking preventive measures against especially dangerous  infections.    As far as cholera is concerned, only isolated cases of its  being brought in from India and other countries have been  recorded in Russia in the past 3 years. Poor-quality sewage  treatment and contamination of water reservoirs by sewage are  creating a real threat of cholera in several places, however.  The deterioration of the socio-economic situation in the  country, increase in detergent and disinfectant prices, and lack  of baths have all led to a significant increase in scabies and  pediculosis. The high louse infestation of the population  constitutes a potential threat of the occurrence of nearly  forgotten typhus.  [Lukyanova]Fresh vegetables have appeared, and with  them a panic over nitrates. What should we do -- eat them or  just feast our eyes on them?  [Belyayev]There are no vegetables without nitrates.  Nitrates are a natural phenomenon in vegetables, and the only  threat lies in their level of accumulation. Even if vegetables  are not fertilized at all, they will still have a natural  nitrate content. The danger lies using chemical fertilizers with  no control of time or amount. In such a case, the amount of  nitrates in vegetables may reach a toxic level, and when they  accumulate in the body, they prevent the circulation of blood,  bind hemoglobin, and facilitate the formation of carcinogens.    Standards for safe nitrate contents in different fruits and  vegetables based on safety criteria have been established. In a  vegetable predominating in the diet of the population of a given  local, the nitrate standard should be as low as possible. Local  public health services have the right to make nitrate content  standards more stringent. I will note our country has the  greatest number of nitrate content standards for fruit and  vegetable products. Other countries do not view them as strictly.    The nitrate level in lettuce and beets, for example, is low  in our country. Farmers and truck farmers are obligated to  adhere strictly to norms and times between the fertilization and  harvesting of vegetables, espeically in the case of ammonium  nitrate. Otherwise, the plants do not have time to process the  nitrates into other compounds that are harmful to humans. Thanks  to inspection by Moscow sanitary inspectors, the amount of  nitrates in vegetables grown around Moscow have decreased by a  factor of 1.5 to 3.</p>

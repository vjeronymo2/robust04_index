			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission issues circular </F> in connection with the bribery case of Yao Guitao and Ju Peijin,  calling for thorough investigation and handling of embezzlement  and bribery cases in order to remove corrupt elements from the  party"]    [Text] The Shanghai Municipal CPC Discipline Inspection  Commission recently issued a circular, which stressed: Party  and government organizations and leading cadres at all levels  should realize, from the perspective of reform, development, and  stability, the importance of the fight against corruption and  strictly investigate and handle embezzlement and bribery cases  in order to remove corrupt elements from the party. This is an  important content of the anticorruption struggle and is also a  means of removing obstacles to reform and opening to the outside  world.    The circular said: Yao Guitao, former secretary of the party  committee of Xinjing Township in Changning District (member of  the district party committee) and chairman of the board of  directors of the Shanghai Meilian Real Estate Development and  Enterprising Company, and Ju Peijin, former vice president of  the Shanghai Municipal Gas Company and deputy chairman of the  broad of directors of the Shanghai Meilian Real Estate  Development and Enterprising Company, unscrupulously accepted  bribes in the first half of 1993 when they participated in a  joint real estate development project with foreign businessmen.  It has been verified by a preliminary investigation that Yao  Guitao accepted a bribe of over 300,000 yuan, and Ju Peijin  accepted over 400,000 yuan. Their acts have caused serious  losses to state and collective interests. With the approval of  the municipal party committee, the Changning District Party  Committee, the district government, and the municipal public  utilities bureau decided to expell Yao Guitao and Ju Peijin from  the party and remove them from their posts.    The circular pointed out: Our cadres wield some power  because they bear the responsibility for reform, opening to the  outside world, and economic development. This being so, some  lawbreakers have often made use of the party's cadres in  achieving their objectives. All cadres should maintain a high  degree of vigilance against this. In the new historical  condition, every communist party member is faced with the  serious challenge of fighting against being corroded. This  challenge is in no way second to the life-and- death test during  the war years. Promoting the healthy development of the  socialist market economy by proceeding from the interests of the  people and observing honesty and self-discipline -- this  constitutes one of the codes of conduct all party member cadres  must follow in the new period. If they go against this norm,  they will harm the fundamental interests of the state and  people. If they don't promptly check this trend but allow it to  develop, it is possible that they will violate law and  discipline and even commit crime. Party member cadres must  guard against money temptation, discipline themselves, remain  honest, and be able to withstand the test of reform, opening to  the outside world, and of being part of the ruling party.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Lonrho-gazers were given plenty to ponder in yesterday's Delphic board-room manoeuvres. The election of two non-executives at Mr Dieter Bock's suggestion was balanced by the oddly symmetrical and simultaneous elevation of two other men, presumably at Mr Tiny Rowland's behest. The compromise prevents a messy public battle for control which neither Mr Bock nor other shareholders seem to want and which Mr Rowland would almost certainly have lost. Perhaps Mr Rowland hopes that the move will preserve his voting advantage on the board, helping him prevent a shake-out of executive directors. If so, it was bought at a heavy price. The new non-executive board members will doubtless wish to continue the reform of Lonrho, so at best Mr Rowland seems to be fighting a doughty, if forlorn, rearguard action. Skirmishing will now move on to detailed areas such as the formation of audit and remuneration committees and the contentious issue of board membership. Sparks will probably continue to fly, though given that institutional investors seem to support Mr Bock's initiatives, he may be expected to make further progress. Presumably the aim is to tidy up the company sufficiently for the market to accept a rights issue - which is probably Lonrho's only way forward. The company is not generating significant amounts of cash. If it is to grow, disposals are only a limited option. Higher gearing would only reawaken the fears which Mr Bock's reforms are designed to quell.</p>

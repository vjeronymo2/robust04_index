			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: </F> "Russia and United States: Partnership Not Premature, But  Overdue"]    [Text] Doubts are being voiced on both sides of the  Atlantic regarding the possibility of Russian-U.S. partnership  and Russian-Western partnership as a whole.    Some people are saying that it is premature. Others are  talking about a return to rivalry. I would like to set out my  stance in clear-cut terms straightaway: There is no reasonable  alternative to partnership, unless of course you count the  possibility of missing the historic opportunity to shape a  democratic Russian state and transform the unstable  postcommunist world into a lasting democratic one. Both these  objectives are indeed interconnected. They are all too precious  for Russia's democrats, who have already repeatedly encountered  armed (not to mention furious political) opposition from the  enemies of reform. We will continue to fight to secure these  goals even if we are not heeded and correctly understood by our  natural friends and allies, in the shape of the democratic  states and governments of the West. In this respect, the  threats to reduce economic aid to a Russia led by President  Yeltsin are as futile as they are counterproductive.    The same can be said about the talk of the need to abandon  "infantile pro-Americanism." If this were due to recognition of  the need to finally have the Russian Embassy in the United  States carry out diplomatic work on a professional, energetic,  and systematic basis or to stop statesmen, including Russian  parliamentarians, making pilgrimages to the United States, one  might be able to agree with it. But people seem to want to see  the attainment of maturity as abandoning the idea of natural  partnership. But this is not maturity, but degeneration, an  ill-disguised attempt to give up the very essence of radical  reform -- in foreign policy too. I cannot agree to and I will  not be involved in it!    The United States and the West can make an invaluable  contribution to shaping a stable democratic world via the means  outlined in the Vancouver and Moscow declarations that Russia  and the United States signed at summit level. Namely the policy  of strategic partnership. Strategic because we share common  values, while Russian and U.S. national state interests  regarding the main world problems not only do not conflict but  complement one another.    In both Russia and the United States only reactionary forces  in the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes have an  interest in wrecking partnership. They seek out mythical  explanations, saying that Russia is doomed to totalitarianism  and confrontation with the world outside, and East and West are  incompatible. The reality is that we must move on to practical  partnership.    At the same time we must abandon certain illusions. Some  people in the West have indeed been daydreaming that partnership  can be developed with Russia on the principle that "if the  Russians are good, they must follow us in everything." There  may also be romantics in Russia who thought that partnership is  an idyllic situation without conflicts and problems.    I think that I and all pragmatic politicians realized from  the very outset two fundamental facts.    First, as I have repeatedly said in my speeches both in the  West and in Russia, including before the breakup of the USSR,  the Russian Federation is condemned to be a great power.  Aggressive and threatening under the Communists and  nationalists, peaceful and prosperous under the democrats. But  a great power nonetheless! Naturally this prompts the conclusion  that it cannot be a junior partner but only an equal partner.    Second, partnership based on common values and even  sympathies does not mean renouncing a firm or, if you like,  aggressive policy of upholding your own national interests and  sometimes of competition and disputes.    There is another dangerous illusion in the way of  partnership. Namely the almost fanatical desire to see just one  great power in the world today -- the United States -- and  insistently proclaim American leadership.    First, the United States is not able to handle all the  problems in the modern world on its own and would, I think,  badly lose out by overtaxing itself in this way. Second, even  though it is experiencing the difficulties of the transitional  period, Russia will remain a superpower not only as far as  nuclear missile and military might as a whole is concerned, but  also in terms of space exploration and development of  state-of-the-art technologies, not to mention natural resources  and geostrategic position. Third, there are other centers of  influence which mean that the world is not unipolar or bipolar  but multipolar.    So what option is left for Russia's democrats when the  question is formulated in these terms? Agreeing to play a  secondary or subordinate role would be as unwarranted as it is  politically dangerous. The extreme nationalist and reactionary  forces involved in the domestic political struggle in Russia  would immediately take advantage of this. They are in effect  already trying to do so. Even my fellow democrats are already  grimly joking that, whereas Gaydar was not around long enough to  see considerable Western aid, Zhirinovskiy is already enjoying  the fruits of the talk about it!    Russia and the United States in conjunction with other  countries must set about tackling two interconnected tasks.  First, the joint formation of a strategic partnership bolstered  by the corresponding institutions and resources. Second, the  immediate setting up of a mechanism for coordinating their  actions in approaching the most important international problems.    Both tasks are easily illustrated by the example of NATO.  The alliance was set up to repel Communism and consolidate  Western democracy. This institution, good as it may be, is  obviously inadequate and unsuitable for current purposes. NATO  is not faced with communism, and Russia itself is not part of  NATO. The "Partnership for Peace" program will provide a  partial answer, but it cannot be considered the pinnacle of  achievement. That was obvious during the crisis in Sarajevo.  The NATO ultimatum was delivered without Russia, but it is  quite plain that Russia cannot and should not be excluded from  the general efforts to settle the problem of Bosnia, where it  has considerable interests and potential.    There is a danger of putting too much emphasis on NATO and  partnership with it to the detriment of the CSCE, a broader and  more general-purpose structure. That would be a great mistake.  It is the CSCE that should play the main role in making the  system of Euroatlantic collaboration truly stable and democratic.    If all of us in East and West do not learn from the  difficulties and disputes of the last few weeks and immediately  develop a strategy and instruments for partnership, you can be  sure that these difficulties will be exploited by those in favor  of self-fulfilling gloomy prophecies.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff shares rise 8% on demerger plans SHARES IN Pittencrieff defied the general market decline yesterday with an 8 per cent jump to 351p as the group finally confirmed plans to demerge the telecommunications division from its oil and gas activities. The company accompanied the announcement with a forecast increase in its annual dividend of at least 17 per cent to 7p. The share rise came despite a placing yesterday of about 2m shares at 312p to pay for purchases. Pittencrieff intends raising about Dollars 50m (Pounds 35m) by floating a minority stake in the mobile communications subsidiary in the US through a public offer. In just two years the offshoot has been built up into an operation with turnover of Dollars 2m a month. Mr Doug Sinclair, finance director, said the group had decided to float the business rather than call continuously on existing shareholders for cash to fund such rapid growth. He added that there was a greater understanding in North America of Pittencrieff's particular communications sector, making the US a sensible place to float. The proceeds would be used to repay part of telecommunications' loans to Pittencrieff and for further expansion. The repayments and expected dividends would fund expansion in the on-going oil and gas business. Ms Liz Butler, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the decision to float the communications business in the US was a good move. 'If the US goes well, it will underpin the UK shares.' Pittencrieff is acquiring a communications business in El Paso, Texas, for Dollars 6.65m and oil and gas reserves, also in Texas, for Dollars 3.75m.</p>

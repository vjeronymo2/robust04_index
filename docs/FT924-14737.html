			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Renishaw limits fall to 18% RENISHAW, the maker of precision measuring probes and inspection equipment, suffered an 18 per cent decline in annual profits due to a sharp fall in sales to its main machine tools markets. The group managed to limit the impact of the 40 per cent fall in the machine tools market, most of which is now in Japan, by introducing new products, increasing market share and cutting manufacturing costs. Pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 9.09m on sales of Pounds 44.05m (Pounds 45.7m). Earnings per share fell from 16.1p to 13.1p and the recommended final dividend of 4p, makes 6.5p for the year (6p). Recession in many markets shaved net margins from 18 per cent to 15 per cent. But this hid gross margins that remained resilient before absorbing some input price rises and increased marketing costs. Net cash rose from Pounds 20.23m to Pounds 21.49m. Mr David McMurtry, chairman and chief executive, said there was a flicker of hope for economic recovery in the US, but elsewhere there was not much sign of a recovery. The continuing decline in the British machine tools and co-ordinate measuring machine markets meant that sales had halved to about 5 per cent of total group turnover. With the majority of sales outside the UK and many input costs denominated in sterling, Renishaw is likely to gain some benefit from devaluation of the pound. COMMENT To all but maintain sales when its crucial Japanese machine tools market has collapsed is a tribute to Renishaw's new product development and fleet of foot. As well as switching its sales effort from original equipment manufacturers to end users, the company has also started to use its own tools to increase its manufacturing efficiency and is spending more R&amp;D on its own product manufacturing techniques. Renishaw is one of the few genuinely innovative British companies and has as a result had to bear very little pressure on gross margins. But it is also a cyclical stock, dependent on recovery in the world capital goods markets. With profits forecast at Pounds 11.5m for next year, giving earnings of 16.5p, the implied prospective multiple of 17 suggests rather a lot of recovery is already factored into the price and perhaps too soon.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Statement of the FIS Press Bureau," signed by Tatayana </F> Samolis, press secretary of the director of the Foreign  Intelligence Service of Russia]    [Text] In April 1994 a book appeared in the United States,  by Ministry of State Security Lt Gen (Ret.) P.A. Sudoplatov  ("Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness"), which he  coauthored with his son and the American Mr. and Mrs. Schecter.  A whole section of the book is devoted to what the author calls  "atomic espionage." Certain passages of this section are  clearly intended to be sensationalistic. In this connection,  the Foreign Intelligence Service Press Bureau considers it  necessary to declare the following: Nuclear, and later  thermonuclear, weapons were developed in the Soviet Union  thanks, first of all, to the presence there of a powerful  scientific-technical and intellectual potential. A large group  of Soviet scientists made the decisive contribution. As for the  contribution made by intelligence activity to developing the  Soviet atom bomb, its important, highly skilled work played a  significant role. Judging by the archive material which the FIS  has, one can state that P.A. Sudoplatov's book "Special Tasks"  is a jumbled mosaic of authentic facts, half-truths, and obvious  fabrications. Special services usually avoid talking about  their work and their concrete sources of information. However,  in the case at hand, we consider it possible for us to declare  that the assertion contained in the book--that Soviet  intelligence received information about the atom bomb directly  from such famous scientists as E. Fermi, L. Szillard, R.  Oppenheimer, and some others--does not correspond with reality.</p>

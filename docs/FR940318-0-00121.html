			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will encourage, where appropriate, alternative processes and technologies that reduce environmental and human health effects. In many applications, reliance on alternative processes and/or equipment may be associated with the use of particular substitute chemicals. In these instances, EPA encourages the filing of joint submissions where information is provided by both the chemical manufacturer and, for example, an equipment manufacturer whose equipment makes use of such a substitute. Such joint filings will provide the most comprehensive data on an alternative and its effect on human health and the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second-generation substitutes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A key issue is whether there exists a point at which an alternative should no longer be considered a class I or II substitute as defined by section 612. The Agency believes that as long as class I or II chemicals are being used, any substitute designed to replace these chemicals is subject to review under section 612. In this final rule, the Agency has determined that second-generation replacements, if they are non-ozone depleting and are replacing non-ozone depleting first-generation alternatives, are exempt from reporting requirements under section 612. Other regulatory programs (e.g., other sections of the CAA, or section 6 of TSCA) exist to ensure protection of human health and the environment in these situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where second-generation substitutes replace first-generation substitutes that are themselves ozone-depleters (e.g., HCFCs), these second-generation substitutes are bound by the same notification and review requirements under section 612 as first-generation substitutes to ozone-depleting chemicals. For example, if a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) is introduced as a first-generation refrigerant substitute for either a class I (e.g., CFC&hyph;12) or class II chemical (e.g., HCFC&hyph;22), it is subject to review and listing under section 612. Future substitutions to replace the HFC would then be exempt from reporting under section 612 because the first-generation alternative did not deplete stratospheric ozone. If, however, a class I or class II chemical is used as a first-generation substitute (e.g., use of HCFC&hyph;141b as a transitional replacement in foam blowing), the second-generation substitute is still subject to review under section 612 because it is replacing a class I or class II chemical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The key to determining whether a substitute is exempt or not as a second-generation substitute is, as discussed above, what it is designed to replace. For example, SNAP reviews are not meant to cover cases in which a technology is designed for use primarily in replacing existing non-ozone depleting evaporative cooling systems. In general, if most intended uses for a possible substitute are to replace a non-OD substitute for a class I or class II substance, then this substance would therefore be a second-generation substitute, and SNAP review is unlikely to be required. In those situations where class I or class II substitutes have already been replaced in most applications, the small use exemption could also eliminate the need for review of next generation substitutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability to existing uses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The prohibition on use of an alternative applies only to substitutions to unacceptable substitutes made after the effective date of any final rulemaking for unacceptability. However, for this final rule, any person who has transitioned to a substitute for an end-use prior to any SNAP final rulemaking designating it as unacceptable may continue to use the substitute until their existing supply of the chemical, as of March 18, 1994, is depleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing inventory of final products manufactured with or containing a substitute designated unacceptable as a result of final EPA rule-making within an end-use covered under SNAP could theoretically be legally sold after listing. Producers should be aware, however, that they will be effectively barred from selling a substitute for use once it has been deemed unacceptable under SNAP, because potential purchasers will not be able to use it. After the effective date of this final rule, users will not be able to use any additional supply of a banned substitute purchased after the publication date of the unacceptable listing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Substitutes produced outside of the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Companies manufacturing substitutes outside the U.S. who are producing solely for use by entities outside the U.S. are not subject to the requirements of these section 612 rules. EPA believes that its authority under section 612 extends only to use of substitutes in areas under the jurisdiction of the United States government. This principle does not apply to substitutes introduced as replacements for class I and II chemicals at offshore U.S. installations (e.g., U.S. military bases located in foreign countries) that are subject to the legal provisions of section 612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substitutes manufactured within the U.S. exclusively for export are subject to SNAP since the definition of use in the rule includes use in the manufacturing process, which occurs within the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Who Must Report <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by section 612(e), anyone who produces a substitute for a class I substance must provide the Agency with that person's unpublished health and safety studies on the substitute, as well as notify the Agency at least 90 days before introducing the substitute into interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative. Also, as discussed in section IV.A.2.c. of this final rule, pursuant to sections 114, 301 and 612(c) of the CAA, producers of class II substitutes must abide by the same reporting requirements. Under the authority of sections 114, 301(a) and 612(c), EPA has determined that in certain cases, formulators or end-users of substitutes could be considered to be producers and would therefore be subject to reporting requirements. This approach is discussed below, in section IV.B.2. To analyze substitutes under section 612(c), the Agency finds it necessary under section 301(a) to require that any person who introduces a substitute in its final form into interstate commerce be considered to be a producer of the substitute and required to submit information describing the substitute under section 114. With respect to substitutes for both class I and II substances, EPA needs all of the types of information described below, not just health and safety studies. Such data are needed to allow EPA to fully analyze the overall risks to human health and the environment presented by alternative substitutes, as required by section 612(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Sang-ki] </F>   [Text] During the military regime period, most military  personnel was from the Taegu and North Kyongsang Province [TK]  area and Chungchong Province centering on the Hanahoe. Since  the Kim Yong-sam government set sail, however, military generals  from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces [PK], which is  President Kim's hometown as well as his political base of  operation, are increasingly apparent.    Moreover, generals from the PK region occupy key positions  in  the military where there is the possibility of exercising  influence on those from these regions. Officers point out that  this is greatly hindering military harmony and morale.    Military authorities state: "The government's military  personnel reform is focused on excluding the members of Hanahoe.  However, to choose generals from the Pusan and South Kyongsang  Province region regardless of their capability and temperament  is the same as when the Hanahoe monopolized the military in the  past." They also express the worry that intervention in  military personnel changes by Chongwadae [presidential offices]  aides and authority figures is the same as when Chongwadae's  Security Service intervened in the past.    Currently, Chongwadae and the Ministry of Defense is  influencing the military. Those from the PK region occupy an  absolute advantage over those from other regions in key posts in  each military headquarters. Pak Kwan-yong, Chongwadae's chief  secretary, graduated from Tongnae High School in Pusan; and  Chong Chong-uk, assistant to the president for foreign and  national security affairs, graduated from Pusan High School.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae graduated from Kyongnam High  School, where President Kim also graduated. Regardless of a  small number of military officers from this school, during  personnel changes last spring military officers, including  Brigadier General Pyon Ho-in, who graduated from the 24th class  of the Military Academy, was promoted to major general and now  occupies a position in the key division of the capital district.  While appointing generals to take command of a division of the  capital district, almost all of those who graduated from  Kyongnam High School were promoted. Those who graduated from  Kyongnam High School include Major General Chon Sang-pae from  the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the chief of staff  of intelligence of the ROK Army Headquarters; Maj. Gen. An  Song-yong from the 23d class of the Military Academy, who is the  commander of a division in the capital district; and Pak No-suk  from the 24th class of the Military Academy, who is the chief  secretary of the Chief of Staff of the ROK Army.    In the past military government the main current of the  military was the TK faction, as well as those who graduated from  Pusan High School. Even in the Kim government, those who  graduated from Pusan High School occupy key positions including  the Chongwadae and the military. Gen. Yun Yong-nam from the  19th class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of the  three armed services; Yu Chong-kap, who was promoted to  lieutenant general in April, is the director of intelligence  headquarters under the Defense Military; Maj. Gen. Han Sung-ui  from the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the policy  and planning officer of the Defense Ministry; and Yi Ui-se from  the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of  an intelligence command, are all from Pusan High School.    Military figures from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces  are  regarded as those who hold key positions under the current  government through school and regional connections. Lieutenant  Gen. Yi Yu-su from the 20th class of the Military Academy, who  was promoted to head of the field Army; Maj. Gen. Cho Yong-nae  from the 177th class of the class-A officers' candidate school;  and Maj. Gen. Kim Hui-sang from the 24th class of the Military  Academy, were promoted to divisional commander by the new  government. Four to five high-ranking cadres, including  Commander Yim Chae-mun from the third class of the Reserve  Officers' Training Corps of the Defense Security Command, are  from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces.    The Kim Yong-sam government is inclined to exclude almost  all  of the TK figures from military personnel changes. In October's  regular personnel change, not one person out of the 20 from the  TK region were promoted to lieutenant general and major general.  In the April personnel change, only one person out of the 13  was promoted from this region. A Defense Ministry colonel  expressed dissatisfaction by saying: "Whenever the opportunity  arises, the military supreme command states that military morale  is higher than ever before. Nevertheless, mainly officers from  the president's hometown are chosen for key posts and  promotions. It seems that the military as a force for a  possible coup d'etat is still recognized."    Another problem is that Chongwadae aides and the president's  closest aides are interfering in military personnel changes.  People who have a good knowledge of military personnel reveal  that since the inauguration of the Kim regime, outside pressure  for military personnel changes takes places with each passing  day. An unidentified general said: "Since the last period of  last year, the president's direct family members, who have no  relation with the military, have been meeting with high-ranking  military generals and interfering in military affairs, including  personnel changes. A popular joke among the generals these days  is that if you have not met any of the president's family  members, you are an impostor."</p>

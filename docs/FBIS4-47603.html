			<p>SUMMARY                                The Mubarak regime has launched an unprecedented proactive  campaign against extremist groups in government-controlled  television and the semi-independent film industry by airing and  encouraging productions--including a TV serial, an interview  with a ''repentant'' extremist and a movie starring a popular  Egyptian actor--that openly address the issue of Islamic  militancy.  Editors and columnists of the government-owned news  media have effectively built on the campaign by lavishly  praising the government's efforts and calling for more, while  Islamist opposition writers have predictably expressed cynicism  over the productions.  The campaign's success has been somewhat  undermined by al-Azhar's strong criticism of the TV serial's  handling of an otherwise arcane issue of religious doctrine-  -criticism that appears to have been intended in part to win the  institution greater censorship authority over artistic  productions.                          END SUMMARY     Government Press Lends Support to "The Family"     Cairo's pro-government press offered strong support for the  government effort through its strong expressions of approval of  "The Family" and published little negative commentary.  The 12  March issue of the government-owned weekly Akhbar Al-Yawm  conducted a "man-on-the-street" survey to assess reaction to  "The Family."  The article claimed that the series caused "a  tremendous uproar" among Egyptians who identify and sympathize  with the central character's efforts to protect his family from  extremist influence.  Mothers, professionals, and retired civil  and military workers expressed "shock," the paper maintained, at  the series' portrayal of extremist recruitment and operational  activities, and demanded more air time for similar programming.  One mother from Upper Egypt, for example, was quoted by Akhbar  Al-Yawm as lamenting that "The dangers shown by 'The Family'  still surround us in the real world."  She stressed that mothers  "live in utter fear for their children who are at the vulnerable  primary and secondary school years.  After they are pulled into  following the extremist groups, hundreds of them live in  numerous mosques pretending to be devout Muslims, having left  school and home.  No one knows what happens to them after that!"  Also interviewed was Major General Sa'd al-Jayyar, former head  of the Police Narcotics Department, who said that with the  'shocking TV showing of loathesome extremist ideas on 'The  Family'" he felt "for the first time that all of Egypt will  confront terrorism."     Clerics Criticize Program     Islamic leaders, both establishment and opposition, took  Egyptian TV to task for allowing actors instead of Islamic  scholars to deal with religious issues.  Traditionally sensitive  to the public release of any Islamic ideas without its blessing,  the al-Azhar establishment followed up its complaints by  repeating persistent demands on the government for a greater  role in sanctioning Islamic-oriented programming.  Muhammad al-  Ghazali, an independent shaykh who has at times supported and at  times undermined government efforts against extremism (see note  1) simply deemed television drama a non-venue for an anti-  terrorism campaign.  He stressed in the anti-government biweekly  Al-Sha'b, organ of the Socialist Labor Party and principal  mouthpiece for its ally the Muslim Brotherhood, that "if the  culture of some religious people is faulty,  it is established  scholars, and not farcical artists, who can correct it"  (5  April).     (Note 1)  Al-Ghazali, who has at times joined in government  efforts to preach Islamic moderation, sent shockwaves through  Egypt last June when in court testimony he appeared to justify  the killing of secularist writer Faraj Fudah by implying that  Islamic law prescribes no punishment for an individual who kills  an apostate (Al-Jumhuriyah, 23 June 1993).     According to Akhbar Al-Yawm, many Egyptian clerics were abroad  "directing missionary activities" for Ramadan and, therefore,  did not watch the series (12 March).  Al-Azhar officials  nonetheless voiced strong theological objection to one episode's  treatment of the Islamic concept of "torture in purgatory"  ['Adhab al-Qabr].  Mufti of Egypt Shaykh Muhammad Sayyid  Tantawi, who was in Egypt during the program's airing but said  he had not watched it, told Akhbar Al-Yawm that he "received  thousands of phone calls and letters at his home and office from  people complaining that the series causes them to doubt their  religious beliefs" and "mocks and denies the existence of  torture in purgatory."  Supporting al-Azhar's denouncement of  "The Family," he added, "I believe religious doctrinal issues  must not be shown on television."  When asked why he did not  watch the series to verify the complaints he had received, the  mufti responded, "Unfortunately I do not have free time to watch  TV but I will try to watch in order to form an opinion."     The debate between al-Azhar officials and the Ministry of  Information over treatment of Islamic issues on television  continued in late March.  In a 19 March interview with weekly TV  magazine Al-Idha'ah Wa Al-Tilifisiyun, Information Minister al-  Sharif said in defense of "The Family": "Egyptian media have  bravely probed various problems through their presentation of  the extremism issue.  'The Family' is not a religious series but  a social one which treats many different issues and problems."  He emphasized, "The only goal of 'The Family' was to deal with  issues through a multi-faceted approach."     However, al-Azhar rector Jad al-Haqq 'Ali Jad al-Haqq announced  that "al-Azhar is officially responsible for reviewing TV  scripts whose episodes discuss religious affairs" (Al-Siyasi Al-  Misri, 20 March).  Jad al-Haqq stressed that al-Azhar is  protesting that "television broadcasted episodes of 'The Family'  without its review," particularly in the case of the "torture in  purgatory" episode.  Al-Siyasi Al-Misri also reported that some  telephonic wrangling subsequently occurred between the al-Azhar  shaykh and information minister over the shaykh's demands for  script review and editorial privileges for religious-oriented  texts before and during productions, as well as an al-Azhar-  approved revision to the final episode of "The Family" to  "change people's understanding of the 'torture in purgatory'  concept."  Although maintaining his earlier defense of the  program, Information Minister al-Sharif acquiesced to Jad-al-  Haqq's demands and revised the final episode of the program.     Several columnists in the government-owned press, all of whom  praised "The Family" for its handling of extremism, took issue  with al-Azhar clerics for their "unwarranted" preoccupation with  this seemingly minor theological detail in view of "The  Family"'s greater goal.  For example, Al-Ahram columnist Salamah  Ahmad Salamah, who has at times criticized the government for  its handling of Islamic extremism (see note 2), addressed the  controversial discussion of "torture in purgatory" between "The  Family"'s main character and a young boy, asking, "In view of  the real problems and concerns which the Islamic World faces,  couldn't the questions in this dialogue have passed unnoticed?"  (Al-Ahram, 13 March).  Al-Jumhuriyah's chairman of the board  Samir Rajab criticized the program's detractors, writing on 14  March, "They have found in the series an opportunity to strike  at future TV productions instead of commending television for  making superior achievements."     (Note 2) For example, Salamah criticized the government early on  in the current wave of Islamic violence for blaming Islamic  extremism entirely on outside sources and ignoring the internal  societal and economic roots of the problem (Al-Ahram, 3O June  1992).     Television Interview     In addition to "The Family," Egyptian television aired in Egypt  and regionally via satellite on 27 March an interview with 'Adil  'Abd-al-Baqi, a defector from the Islamic extremist group al-  Shawqiyun.  Several prominent Al-Ahram columnists praised 'Abd-  al-Baqi's detailed account of the group's philosophy,  recruitment practices, and criminal misdeeds as a "coup" for the  Egyptian media war on extremism.  Al-Ahram editor-in-chief  Ibrahim Nafi' described the televised interview as "a success"  which "probably enjoyed the highest viewership in recent years"  (1 April).  Nafi' thanked and praised Egyptian TV for taking  this "wise step . . . without attempting to steer 'Abd-al-Baqi  toward denouncing this way of thinking and these crimes, relying  instead on his earnest desire to atone for his former role with  these groups."  In Al-Ahram of 4 April, Salamah Ahmad Salamah  described the interview as "perhaps the first time that TV has  dared to put a personality like this in a question-and-answer  setting before millions of eyes."  The columnist deemed the  interview a success "in giving broad graphic insight to viewers  who base their attitudes about terrorism on what goes on in dark  corridors,"  adding, "This interview is an example of what  'intelligent media' can do to expose some of these misguided  people."  Columnist Salah Muntasir on 6 April countered the  anti-government biweekly Al-Sha'b's claims that 'Abd-al-Baqi was  a government spy (Al-Sha'b, 1 April), suggesting that Al-Sha'b's  condemnation of the terrorist's defection but not his story  lends credence to the visual images of extremism he conveyed in  the interview:  "'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi may be an agent for the  authorities, but does this deny the ugly picture of extremist  groups which he has drawn?"     Film Angers Militants     Finally, a newly released film, "The Terrorist," is a  controversial portrayal of the violent life of an extremist,  played by popular Egyptian actor 'Adil Imam, who ultimately  renounces militancy.  The film has thus far provoked commotion  at the nine heavily guarded movie theaters where it is being  shown.  Scriptwriter Lenin al-Ramli in an 8 April interview with  weekly magazine Al-Musawwar claimed that the movie is not about  terrorism, nor is it a "propaganda film to mobilize people  against terrorism."  Nonetheless, various press reports indicate  that the movie has angered Islamic militant groups.  Several  papers reported the arrest of terrorists heading for Cairo to  blow up several theaters showing the movie (Al-Akhbar and Al-  Wafd, 18 March; Al-Ahrar, 21 March).  The Arabic London-based  daily Al-Hayah on 26 March reported from "a security source"  that at the Normandy Theater "a dispute broke out between some  moviegoers and security guards," ending in "the two sides  clashing" and "one guard wounded."     Implications     The recent productions dealing with Islamic extremism represent  a clear milestone in the government's attempt to use the media  against the militants.  While the government will probably make  good on Interior Minister al-Alfi's promises to forge ahead on  the media battleground, the effectiveness of its campaign will  largely be determined by how honestly it confronts the broader  issues surrounding extremism--including its societal and  economic roots and the government's past mistakes in addressing  the problem--and how much credibility any future productions are  likely to enjoy.  As it has previously done, the government will  likely further appease al-Azhar clerics by allowing them to  review future programs that address religious issues, but only  to the extent that anti-terrorism campaign objectives are still  achieved.

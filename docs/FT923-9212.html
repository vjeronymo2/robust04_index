			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / German jobless total rises further UNEMPLOYMENT in Germany rose by almost 180,000 in July as the economic slowdown and the factory summer closedowns took their toll. In the west, a further fall in utilisation of manufacturing capacity underlined the trend to contraction. The federal labour office blamed continuing industrial restructuring for most of the 65,000 job losses in the east, which took unemployment to 1,188,200 or 14.6 per cent of the workforce. The western total rose 112,000 to 1,827,700, or 6 per cent, the office said. A survey of industrial plant usage by the Ifo economics institute showed 15 per cent of all manufacturing capacity standing idle, 0.6 per cent more than in March. Areas worst affected were investment goods, with 82.7 per cent of plant in use, and components makers, with 83.9 per cent. The institute said manufacturers had become more concerned that they would not be back at optimal utilisation for another 12 months. Overall manufacturing industry plant use and order backlogs are now back at levels last seen around mid-1988. Conditions in the western German labour market will continue to deteriorate until the second half of next year, the Hamburg economics institute, HWWA, said yesterday. Average unemployment in 1993 would be 1.95m, compared with 1.8m this year, while the total number employed would stagnate.</p>

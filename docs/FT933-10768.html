			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Aetna cautious despite advance AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurers, turned in improved results for the second quarter. However, it said earnings remained unsatisfactory. For the three months to June 30, it posted net income of Dollars 146.1m, or Dollars 1.32 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 45.2m, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Operating earnings before extraordinary items were Dollars 150.8m, against a deficit of Dollars 73.1m a year earlier. Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said results from core businesses were on track with expectations, but that company results continued to reflect unfavourable conditions in commercial real estate markets. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company said its commercial property and casualty insurance services earned Dollars 35m in the quarter, against an underlying loss of Dollars 25m last year, before a Dollars 26m reorganisation charge. Catastrophe losses narrowed to Dollars 8m in the latest quarter, from Dollars 11m. Aetna's financial services business recorded net income of Dollars 17m in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 22m before reorganisation charges of Dollars 4m a year earlier. The personal property-casualty services turned in net income of Dollars 12m, against Dollars 6m the previous year, before reorganisation charges of Dollars 30m. For the first half, net income rose to Dollars 338.7m, or Dollars 3.07, against earnings of Dollars 73.5m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Excluding extraordinary items and the impact of adjustments, income from continuing operations rose to Dollars 290.1m from Dollars 81.3m. Revenues eased to Dollars 8.62bn from Dollars 8.78bn.</p>

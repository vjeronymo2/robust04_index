			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Franz Vranitzky, chancellor and chairman of </F> the Social Democratic Party, by Christoph Kotanko in Vienna;  date not given: "I Represent Austria in Accordance With the  Rules of the European Union"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kotanko] Mr. Chairman,  Nationalrat elections will be held in about four months. What  is your goal for the elections? Do you want to become so strong  that you no longer depend on the Austrian People's Party [OeVP]  as the junior partner?    [Vranitzky] Such a goal must always exist. Of course, one's  sense of reality sets certain limits. We have a coalition  agreement with the OeVP, which is valid until the last day of  the legislative period. Anything else must be discussed after  the elections.    [Kotanko] Have the Greens become more predictable, more  serious for you as a result of their changed attitude toward the  European Union [EU] membership treaty?    [Vranitzky] I admire people like Johannes Voggenhuber, who,  despite their anti-EU conviction, accept the clear decision of  the people after the referendum as Voggenhuber did [he said that  he will vote for the EU membership treaty in parliament as a  result of the positive referendum]. However, that does not yet  build any bridge for a future coalition. [passage omitted]    [Kotanko] Many people expect a "duel" between Vranitzky and  Haider in the election campaign. The Freedom Party chairman  wants to gather the "real patriots" around himself.    [Vranitzky] I believe there is a difference between "real  patriots" and patriots. And, after all, Haider does not look so  glorious now, after the referendum. He has suffered an enormous  defeat and then called this a climax..</p>

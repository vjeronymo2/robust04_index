			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Higher Education and Research </F> Minister Francois Fillon by Jean-Paul Croize; date, place not  given: "Research Seeks To Take a Deep Breath"; first paragraph  is LE FIGARO introduction]    [Text] Society, in its determination to develop, must do  more to exploit the opportunities offered by science: Investing  in research seems essential if France is to enhance its  potential in coping with economic and industrial developments on  both a European and a global scale, especially if we finally  manage to better "marry" our researchers and our companies.  These are the three key findings of the "Report on the Trends  of the Major Aims of French Research" presented yesterday by  Robert Daulray, High Commissioner for Atomic Energy, to Francois  Fillon, Minister of Higher Education and Research. This  document, running to some 60 pages and commissioned last  September by the minister, will now be circulated to around  30,000 people, who will use it as the basis for a "major  national consultation" launched today by Francois Fillon.    This consultation exercise, based also on six thematic  seminars to be held in different regions between now and  mid-March, will be synthesized in a national debate on 9 April;  this will be followed by the drafting during May of the final  summative document, which will be used as the framework for  parliamentary discussion on the future of French research,  scheduled by the minister for the end of the spring session of  the National Assembly, next June. Replying to our questions, he  explains why he considers it "indispensable" to take the pulse  of the French scientific community, so as to help it reach the  end of the century in good shape.    [LE FIGARO] Why undertake such national consultation on the  aims of research now?    [FILLON] Firstly, because this has not been done for 10  years, despite the major changes which have taken place since  then in our society and in research. At the geopolitical level,  take the disintegration of the former USSR, or, at the global  level, the importance now attached to environmental problems.  Take, also, the very rapid growth in the numbers of students,  who should be considered not only in terms of their interests  and abilities, but also in terms of the constraints of the labor  market, without neglecting the research role of our universities.    Next, I feel it is important for France to have a more  accurate perception of its scientific resources, and of the  major steps it can and must take during the next few years, for  the same reason as the United States, Japan, Germany, or indeed  Britain.    [LE FIGARO] What should be the role of the state in  scientific research?    [FILLON] My main criticism of French policy in this area  over the past five years is the fact that we have not managed to  define strong priorities -- for pump-priming programs suitable  for stimulating research in a changed national and international  context; for launching basic research programs today, not only  to prepare the applied research which tomorrow's companies will  need, but also to respond to advances in this same applied  research.    The state is presently going too far in reducing its  essential role to allocating funding which is growing ever  larger, but which unfortunately is increasingly absorbed by  major research bodies, rather than by research activities  themselves. I believe it is time we found the way to target our  research -- with all the consultation that requires, of course  -- instead of being satisfied just to finance it, while having  nothing, or virtually nothing, to say about it. Neither is it  normal -- the research establishments themselves complain about  this -- for the state to be unable to take selective decisions  on supporting a particular laboratory which has just achieved a  major breakthrough in a field which is becoming highly  significant for our country...  <H5>  Building Bridges Between Laboratories </H5>   [LE FIGARO] The preliminary report which launched this  consultation refers to inflexibility over basic research. What  is the cause of this, and how can it be cured?    [FILLON] Though it has not yet reached paralysis, we can  certainly speak of disturbing inflexibility. Its symptoms are  varied: Inability properly to assess needs, or difficulty in  properly allocating efforts over the medium term, leading to  difficulty in developing...    What causes this? The cause lies, once again, in the  difficulties faced by institutions in properly developing their  programs. Another cause is the doubts facing researchers, and,  more generally, laboratories, over their ability to question,  and, if necessary, abandon existing activities. It is also  worth mentioning the problem faced by French researchers in  finding the right level in particular fields, such as the "new  frontier" which now is as much at the level of the infinitely  complex as of the infinitely large or small. It seems that  there are not enough bridges between laboratories where  interdisciplinary research is concerned, such as -- to take a  specific example -- global climate change. What do we do?  This national consultation should analyze present modes of  operation, and, hopefully, result in the basis for solutions.  <H5>  A Very Longstanding Deficit </H5>   The preliminary report which launched this consultation  refers to serious causes: For example, high-school education,  which is claimed to favor the abstract at the expense of the  concrete. We shall also have to look into problems which have  been discussed for a long time: The insufficient mobility of  researchers, their reluctance to take advantage of their job  security so as to take risks, or even the lack of pump-priming  funding, such as invitations to bid, for example.    [LE FIGARO] How does our private-sector research compare  with  that of other industrial countries?    [FILLON] It is common knowledge that far less is achieved  here in France than in the other major industrial countries.  Where German companies provide 72 percent of research and  development, French companies manage only 60 percent.    We suffer from a very longstanding deficit, linked to the  organization of our outmoded industrial structures. Many small  and medium-sized enterprises [SME's] have problems in gaining  access to research. There is little contact between the public  and private sectors over research. It is obvious that France  needs to increase its private-sector research -- this was a  matter of concern to my predecessors. I hope that this national  consultation will reveal new solutions in three directions:  Firstly, in developing modern tools, particularly through  ANVAR, the National Agency for the Promotion of Research; then,  in progressively fostering a research culture in many companies  where it does not presently exist; and finally, in achieving a  better understanding of the needs of our industries on the part  of our research establishments.    [LE FIGARO] How can we enable applied research better to  service SME's?    [FILLON] This can only be achieved through collective  action,  by the state, the private sector and local communities. For  example, take the improvements in procedures for aiding research  and innovation, again through such bodies as ANVAR, the creation  or the strengthening of skills in companies -- by hiring  engineers with greater awareness of the scope offered by  research to develop an activity -- and the growing cooperation  between these companies and technical education.    I believe that the interweaving of research activities and  the needs of SME's must take place on a regional scale. The  relationship between the two can be far more firmly established,  on a person to person basis, so that needs and potential for  development are in harmony.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK / KEVIN THOMAS  </P> <P> James Toback's 1983 Exposed (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a drenchingly  romantic thriller lots stronger in style than credibility in which an ambiguous  angel of death (Nastassja Kinski) captivates a concert violinist (Rudolf  Nureyev) and also a Paris-based terrorist (Harvey Keitel).  </P> <P> The 1977 Annie Hall (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is landmark Woody Allen, a  declaration of maturity and a witty semi-autobiographical romance in which he  stars with Diane Keaton.  </P> <P> The new TV movie Crossing to Freedom (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a World War II  drama starring Peter O'Toole as a reluctant hero intent on leading a band of  French children to safety in England.  </P> <P> Twin Peaks (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the new David Lynch TV movie, which  launches the series of the same name and lays bare the dark underside of a  small Pacific Northwestern town.  </P> <P> King of the Gypsies (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) brought Peter Maas'  engrossing 1978 multi-generational saga to the screen in synthetic, all-star  fashion.  </P> <P> Capital News (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie/series pilot set in a  Washington newspaper and starring Lloyd Bridges and Helen Slater.  </P> <P> The 1985 That Was Then, This Is Now (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a sincere  film about two delinquents starring Craig Sheffer and Emilio Estevez (the  latter adapted the script from an S. E. Hinton novel).  </P> <P> Forbidden Nights (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Melissa  Gilbert and based on American teacher Judith Shapiro's experiences in China.  </P> <P> Switching Channels (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), that frenetic, misfired  1988 attempt to update "The Front Page" to the cable business, traps Kathleen  Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve in an enervating, joyless endurance  course.  </P> <P> Julien Temple's Earth Girls Are Easy (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a  jazzy, snazzy 1988 rock musical about a dumped-on Valley Girl (Geena Davis) who  ushers three girl-crazy extraterrestrials (Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, Damon  Wayans) around town after they crash-land in her swimming pool. Fluff, but fun.  </P> <P> Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner,  traces the parallel lives of two very different British athletes who competed  in the 1924 Olympics.  </P> <P> Break of Dawn (Channel 28 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is an awkward yet moving  biography of Pedro Gonzalez (Oscar Chavez), a Mexican singer who became an  influential recording and radio star whose career ran afoul of corrupt,  exploitative Anglo politicians.  </P> <P> The 1985 Stick (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) took a gem of an Elmore Leonard  novel and turned it into a mediocre Burt Reynolds vehicle.  </P> <P> Like all anthology comedies, the 1987 Amazon Women on the Moon (Channel 5  Friday at 8 p.m.) is a hit-and-miss affair, with the hits outweighing the  misses to yield an amiable enough diversion.  </P> <P> Reckless (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a shallow, irresponsible 1984  feature teaming then newcomer Aidan Quinn as a small-town Brando-Dean type  entangled with bored rich girl Daryl Hannah.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paulo Sotero] </F>   [Text] Washington -- Yesterday, PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva said he  supports, in principle, the idea of "using a multinational  military force to restore democracy in Haiti." He said the coup  d'etat against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was "as grave"  as Saddam Husayn's invasion of Kuwait. In what was apparently a  veiled criticism of U.S. inaction in the case of Haiti, Lula  said he does not agree with "the policy of double weights and  double measurements."    These were Lula's first meaningful statements on foreign  policy during his trip to the United States. Lula proposed the  creation of "more agile mechanisms" to respond to attacks  against the democratic order in Latin America. He criticized  the proposal to create a permanent military force under the OAS  to protect the region's democratic regimes, however. He said  that under a PT administration, Brazil will not attempt to take  a leadership role "on this specific question." Brazil will  participate with other countries of the region in initiatives  and actions that respect the principle of self-determination.    During a luncheon with U.S. legislators, and afterwards  during a public audience at the U.S. Congress, Lula  diplomatically criticized the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba  right in front of the measure's main supporter in Congress, New  Jersey Democratic Representative Roberto Torricelli. Torricelli  heads a House of Representatives foreign relations subcommittee,  and was Lula's host on the occasion. "The embargo is against  President Fidel Castro. It is not fair because the Cuban people  suffer the consequences," Lula said. "I do not understand an  initiative that has the purpose of protecting human rights in  Cuba, but which leaves innocent Cuban children without food and  medicines." Lula expressed hope that the U.S. Government would  put aside its lasting animosity toward Cuba. He mentioned the  agreement between Israel and the PLO as an example of an  attitude that deserves to be followed. "Eight months ago, I  visited Israel and met with the Israeli prime minister. At that  time, a peace agreement with the Palestinians seemed impossible,  but today the agreement is a reality."    The third day of Lula's tour of the United States was also  marked by moderation. On 10 May, he spoke before nearly 300  sympathizers who crowded a large amphitheater at Harvard  University Law School. On the occasion, Lula and main economic  adviser Aloizio Mercadante set aside the carefulness they had  exhibited during their meetings with entrepreneurs. Sitting in  front of them were some 50 Brazilians who study at Harvard. But  most of those attending the meeting were young descendants of  the tens of thousands of Brazilians who live in Boston's  surroundings.    But Lula regained the moderate tones that had characterized  his meetings with bankers and New York business executives  during his public and private meetings in Washington yesterday.  Lula added a new line to the discussions on the foreign debt,  an unavoidable topic at all meetings. He reiterated that if he  is elected president he will not try to renegotiate the debt,  "which has already been approved by the Senate. Some people find  it difficult to accept the PT's disagreement with present debt  agreements, which is very interesting, and the fact that we want  to talk about it with creditors. These people do not react in  the same way when the Dart family, whose members have $1.4  billion in Brazilian foreign debt titles, threaten to sue  Brazil."    Lula said during his meeting at the U.S. Congress that he  will accept international financial and technological  cooperation to design a sustainable development policy for the  Amazon region "within a framework of absolute respect for our  national sovereignty."    Lula visited the THE WASHINGTON POST headquarters, where he  was received by honorary president Katherine Graham. He also  had an unscheduled meeting with Jim Hackney, Department of  Commerce under secretary for Latin America [title as published],  who promised to arrange a meeting with Secretary of Commerce  Ronald Brown when he visits Brazil at the end of the month.  Lula's agenda today will begin with a breakfast with Richard  Feinberg, National Security Council adviser for Latin America  [title as published], and will end in New York with a reception  at the residence of Ronaldo Sardemberg, Brazilian ambassador to  the United Nations.    Tomorrow, Lula will test his knowledge of economic issues at  a forum with experts organized by Inter-American Dialogue. He  will not have the help of Mercadante, who returned to Brasilia  yesterday to participate in the vote on the process to strip  Deputy Ricardo Fiuza of his privileges. Lula's visit to the  United States will end tomorrow with a luncheon for nearly 700  people at the Hotel Marriott Marquis on Broadway.</p>

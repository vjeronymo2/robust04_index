Shi Guangsheng said: The Chinese Government has consistently  been abiding by the accords that it has signed with some  countries on textile exports. In recent years, however, we  found that a small number of enterprises have been violating the  relevant regulations in an attempt to disrupt market order  through cheating, illegal transshipment, and other means, thus  affecting the normal export of Chinese textiles. In this  connection, the Chinese Government is conducting conscientious  investigations and will take strong measures against such  activities.    Shi Guangsheng said: There are three possibilities regarding  illegal textile exports. First, some enterprises intentionally  violate the law; second, Chinese exporters collaborate with  foreign importers and intermediary agents; and third, some  enterprises simply know very little about the relevant policies,  laws, and ordinances. Shi stressed that comprehensive and  coordinated efforts should be organized to curb offenses in the  first two cases.    Shi Guangsheng revealed that the departments concerned had  called a meeting before the Spring Guangzhou Export Commodities  Fair this year to formulate measures in a campaign against  illegal activities related to the textile trade.</p>

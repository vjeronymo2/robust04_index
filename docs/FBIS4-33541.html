			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] Army General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], arrived in Matanzas this  morning to begin a tour through the territories defended by the  Central Army. Raul was met upon his arrival at army  headquarters by Central Army General Joaquin Quintas Solas.  Immediately after arriving, Raul placed a floral wreath at the  monument honoring the militia school students who fell during  the Bay of Pigs invasion.    Politburo member Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the party  in Matanzas, briefed Raul and his delegation on the economic,  political, and social situation in Matanzas, which sparked a  debate on topics such as the efforts made in the recovery of the  agricultural-livestock sector, which is currently faced with  many difficulties.    Colonel Cabrera Valdez, deputy chief of the provincial  general staff, presented a report on the main areas of the  provincial staff's work in defending Matanzas Province.    On this first day of his tour, Raul stressed the importance  of the people's defense tunnels and other fortification projects  which are aimed at defending the population and maintaining the  vitality of the FAR in case of an aggression against our  country. With regards to this, Raul expressed his belief that  Matanzas City, from the work that has been carried out and the  possibilities that its natural conditions provide, could become  the first capital city of the provinces to have its entire  population protected, if it is not beat by Santiago de Cuba.  Santiago de Cuba is currently making a great effort in that  area, but Santiago de Cuba has more than 400,000 inhabitants.    Raul is accompanied by Commander of the Revolution Juan  Almeida Bosque; Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first  vice minister of the FAR and head of the general staff; and  other high ranking officers.</p>

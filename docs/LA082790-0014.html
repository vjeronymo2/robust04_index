			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Concert Crashers: A group of about 40 youths scaled gates at the Shoreline  Amphitheater in Mountain View, Calif., during a performance Friday by the rap  group Public Enemy and randomly assaulted concertgoers and security guards.  </P> <P> Thirty people were treated for minor injuries at the venue's first-aid  stations, said police Lt. Gary Smith. Victims told police that they believed  the attackers were members of a gang, but Smith said no gang affiliation had  been confirmed. The assaults, which took place in the plaza surrounding the  amphitheater, apparently did not disrupt the concert attended by 8,000 people.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

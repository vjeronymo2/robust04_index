			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chit Estella and Minnie Cadelina] </F>   [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] denied  yesterday it was participating in peace talks with the  government next month. In a statement, NDF Vice Chairman Luis  Jalandoni branded the information as a form of "disinformation"  aimed at "diverting attention from the current massive protests  of the people against Mr. Ramos' policies."    Former Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello was recently quoted  as saying he received a communication from exiled communist  leader Jose Ma. Sison announcing the holding of preliminary  talks either in Europe or Vietnam next month.    Jalandoni said the claim was untrue and baseless. Indicating  that the talks have even become uncertain, he said, "The NDF  leadership, in considering possible preliminary or exploratory  talks between the NDF and the government of the Republic of the  Philippines, is taking into account the deep and widespread  anger of the people against the Ramos regime's imposition of  intolerable burdens on them, while continuing to be subservient  to the IMF and World Bank and the foreign monopolies."    He also protested the government's recent move allowing  detained rebel Arturo Tabara to be temporarily released on bail.  Tabara is among the so-called rejectionists in the communist  movement who are opposed to the leadership identified with  Sison. By releasing Tabara, Jalandoni said the government was  merely coddling "renegades and expellees" from the Communist  Party of the Philippines. "If the Ramos regime is indeed serious  in improving the climate for peace talks, it should release the  more than 350 political prisoners," he said. Jalandoni accused  the government of disinterest in the peace efforts and of  resorting again to "psywar schemes."    Meanwhile, Sen. Rodolfo Biazon (Laban) [Lakas ng Bayan --  People's Power] yesterday urged President Ramos to declare an  eight-day unilateral cease-fire during the Holy Week, in  observance of the Lenten season. The suspension of offensive  military operations (SOMO), Biazon proposed, should run from 28  March to 24 April, four days longer than the usual cease-fire  period government declares during the Holy Week.    Biazon pushed for an extended Lenten cease-fire due to the  success of the extended cease-fire government declared last  Christmas season. Traditionally, government declares a six-day  cease-fire during the holiday season, but last year, it declared  a 17-day SOMO, which Biazon said gave both soldiers and rebels  and the people in the affected communities a respite from the  armed struggle.</p>

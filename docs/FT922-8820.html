			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (5): New employers move in - Success threatens Scunthorpe's development area status SCUNTHORPE, AN industrial island set in the agricultural flatlands of South Humberside, stands at a crossroads, fearful that it may become the victim of its own success. The 1980s were times of dramatic change for this town of steelworks and parkland, transforming it from a community overwhelmingly dependent on the steel industry to a manufacturing centre with a much more broadly based spread of activities, ranging from computer hardware to plastics engineering and food processing. Development area status, an enterprise zone and European Community aid, giving access to European Coal and Steel Community loans and the European Regional Development Fund, have helped Scunthorpe to attract dozens of new employers during the last decade: more than 40 British companies and 16 multinationals have manufacturing bases in the town. Unemployment, which, after the traumatic Normanby Park steelworks closure of the early 1980s, rose to a peak of around 20 per cent, is now, at 9.1 per cent, just below the national average. But in that case, one might ask, why should Scunthorpe have top-tier development-area status? That, the town's borough council fears, is precisely the question government ministers will be asking when they start their promised review of the UK's assisted-area map. The council's answer is that the radical restructuring of the local economy, for which government assistance has been vital, is still incomplete. It faces the 1990s without the benefit of enterprise zone concessions: now fully occupied, the EZ loses its designation next year. The recession has also bitten; the heady days of the late 1980s, when Scunthorpe was attracting, in net terms, 40 new businesses a year, have been followed by leaner times; in 1991 it lost 55 businesses net and around 500 jobs. There is also an underlying fear that British Steel's Scunthorpe works, which makes steel sections and plate, is extremely vulnerable, should there be any further rationalisation in the UK's steelmaking capacity after Ravenscraig closes in September. Of the four remaining major BS sites, Scunthorpe, part of the General Steels business, alone operates from an inland location. In the late 1970s, steelmaking in Scunthorpe employed around 23,000 people; today British Steel's payroll is 5,500; about 4,500 more people are estimated by the council to work as contractors on the BS site in the town. But more steel jobs are certain to go; BS announced last year that it is to close its Scunthorpe plate mill, resulting in 600 job losses in 1994. Despite all this, British Steel remains by far the dominant local employer; all the newer companies Scunthorpe has attracted employ well below 1,000 people. It also has a subsidiary interest in its former rod mill in the town, now run by Allied Steel and Wire, and its former bar mill, now owned by Caparo. Another cloud on the horizon is the possible knock-on effects on European assistance should the government abolish Humberside county council. As part of Humberside, Scunthorpe benefited under the European Community's Yorkshire and Humberside Steel Areas Integrated Development Operations Programme for areas hit by steel industry job losses. Labour-controlled Scunthorpe borough council, however, favours Humberside county council's abolition; greater autonomy is a powerful promise. On a brighter note, 'Sunny Scunny' (stand-up comedians have a lot to answer for) has attracted Pounds 250m ininvestment and around 4,000 jobs to its 250-acre EZ. Zone status triggered development of new industrial estates, offering rapid access to the motorway network and Scunthorpe town centre, yet close enough to the countryside for a pheasant to be spotted last week strutting across a major access road leading to Foxhills industrial park. Large employers attracted to the EZ include the expansionist Spring Ram, HLF, part of Hillsdown Holdings, and Unigate, which developed Europe's biggest white meat and poultry processing plant at Foxhills. This plant has just been acquired by Hillsdown, one of a spate of acquisitions which have brought sudden changes to the ownership of some of the town's key new businesses. They include the acquisition of Eurolam, formerly Welsh-owned, by the German company Keinle and Speiss, and of Sooner Snacks, bought from Borden by Dalgety. This deal has resulted in the transfer away from Scunthorpe of Sooner Snacks managerial posts. But Scunthorpe remains the headquarters of several large private companies, including Clugston, one of the UK's top 50 non-housing building and civil engineering contractors, which employs 900 people nationally and turns over Pounds 115m a year. Founded 55 years ago, it pioneered developments in the use of steel industry slag before diversifying into its present activities. So far in 1992 it has won contracts worth Pounds 21m. Among overseas investors in Scunthorpe, the Americans predominate, although the German presence is increasing. The town has just one Far East investment, Japanese-owned Citizen, which employs 230 people making computer printers. About 36 per cent of Scunthorpe's employment is in manufacturing, well above the national average. Attracting other sorts of inward investment has proved more difficult. However, Lloyds Bank has chosen the town for its new national mortgage-processing centre, employing 120 people. Now that the EZ is full, the council hopes incoming industry will buy sites at Lysaghts Enterprise Park, part of the Normanby Park steelworks site. More than Pounds 2m in government derelict-land grant has been spent here annually since 1985, but contamination makes for slow progress. Just 40 acres of the 400-acre site has so far been reclaimed. 'We've hardly started,' observes Mr Fred Kirk, vice-chairman of the council's estates and industrial development committee. Mr Kirk, aged 68, and fellow Labour councillor and housing committee chairman Mr Brian Vessey, 57 are proud of their home town and optimistic about its future - if development area status is retained. 'We're deemed to be a successful area,' says Mr Vessey. 'We're worried people in high places will judge us as not needing help.'</p>

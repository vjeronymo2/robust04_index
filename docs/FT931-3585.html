			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Rise in output lifts recovery hopes: Lawson calls for Pounds 6bn tax increase to curb fiscal deficit A SHARP RISE in manufacturing production has provided a favourable background for today's Budget by adding to expectations about a UK recovery. Manufacturing production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent in January compared with the previous month, well above expectations in the City. News that manufacturing output was the highest since August 1991 coincided with growing speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will seize the opportunity in his Budget speech to raise taxes from 1993-94 to curb the growing fiscal deficit. Pressure on Mr Lamont to take bold action on this front increased last night after Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor, said failure to raise taxes by Pounds 6bn would be a 'serious mistake', as he became the latest in a series of former Tory cabinet ministers to urge tax rises. At a conference on currency markets in London, Lord Lawson said a tax rise of this magnitude 'could prove a political and economic turning point that is so badly needed'. Also, in a surprising departure from his previous enthusiasm for the European exchange rate mechanism, Lord Lawson said it was 'only a matter of time' before the ERM broke down after the pressures of German unification and the drive towards a single currency robbed the system of its flexibility. Further indications that the economy may be turning came yesterday with a survey by Trade Indemnity, credit insurers, showing that exporters have increased their order books in the past three months, taking advantage of the 15 per cent devaluation in sterling since the UK left the ERM in September. The Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents, an industry-appointed body, provided further evidence of a revival in the housing market by reporting a strong rise in sales last month. In recent weeks, Mr Lamont has been advised by many in the City and by his own backbenchers that he should head off the possibility of Britain moving towards Italian-style budget deficits through a tough tax increase. According to this argument, the more favourable auguries about the economy mean that the risk of stifling an upturn by a fiscal tightening has been greatly reduced. With many City economists expecting the gap between government spending and income to reach some Pounds 50bn in the financial year starting next month, the word from Whitehall yesterday was that Mr Lamont is planning to make his Budget speech about half an hour longer than the normal 60 minutes or so in order to deal adequately with an explanation of fiscal policy. Yesterday's release of the manufacturing figures was accompanied by a warning from the Central Statistical Office that the monthly data may have been distorted by the timing of the Christmas holidays. Even so, in the three months to the end of January, manufacturing output rose by 0.7 per cent against the same period a year earlier. All production industries - including energy, water and manufacturing - showed a 0.4 per cent drop in output between December last year and January. Output of oil and gas fell 6 per cent between the two months, largely because of operating diffiintends culties in the North Sea.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Marina Ivanova; from the </F> "Segodnya" program]    [Text] [Ivanova] The presidential election campaign in  Belarus is taking place to the accompaniment of scandals and  attempts to find out the attitudes of the candidates. One of  the candidates standing on behalf of the Democratic Bloc,  Stanislav Shushkevich, said in an interview to the Segodnya  program:    [Begin Shushkevich recording] There is massive pressure on  local authorities that they have to say that Vyacheslav Kebich  is the most intelligent and talented. They have to be quiet  about the fact that he has, on the whole, brought the Republic  to economic collapse. [end recording]    [Ivanova] A special Monitoring Council made up of famous  journalists and lawyers has been set up in the Central Electoral  Commission for the first presidential elections in order to  ensure equal opportunities for candidates to use the mass media.  Inter alia this council has noted three unplanned appearances  by presidential candidate Vyacheslav Kebich on 2, 3, and 4 June.  These were not just appearances by the prime minister, but also  contained elements of his election campaign. Other candidates  did not have this opportunity, an official statement from the  Monitoring Council says.    Apart from this, in certain parts of the Republic on 11  June,  an appearance by Stanislav Shushkevich live on national radio  was unexpectedly disrupted. Instead of a dialogue with the  former parliament speaker, the listeners had to listen to a  monotonous reading of provincial news.    Another scandal has broken out around Aleksandr Lukashenko.  A truck from Latvia was detained by Belarus customs in the town  of Braslav. The truck contained printed material supporting  Lukashenko's candidature--65,000 color posters and 250,000  pamphlets produced by the German firm of Supra from Hanover.  The customs officers put the value of the load at 100 million  rubles, although the documents said just nine million. The law  on presidential elections forbids any direct or indirect  participation by foreign firms or individuals in the  organization or conducting of the elections. All financial  provisions come from the state budget.    Marina Ivanova, Igor Stanov, Dmitriy Semenov, Minsk,  exclusivly for NTV.</p>

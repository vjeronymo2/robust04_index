			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: ISDA adopts agreement A NEW master agreement, intended to simplify dealing in a range of derivative instruments, has been adopted by the International Swap Dealers Association, writes Richard Waters. The agreement covers a wider range of derivatives than was included in the previous version, introduced in 1987. By bringing more instruments under a single agreement, it is possible for financial institutions to net off their risks in different products against each other, reducing their overall credit exposure. ISDA said that 'hundreds of participants from Europe, Japan and the US' had been involved in developing the new master agreement. The 1987 version and agreements based on it are currently used in about 90 per cent of all over-the-counter derivative deals, ISDA said.</p>

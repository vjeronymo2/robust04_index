			<p>BFN     [Text] Latvia will not accept Moscow's clarifications about  President Yeltsin's decree 174 of April 5 because of its  sovereignty being put under threat, Latvian Embassy officials  told Interfax. They referred to Friday's statement that Latvian  ambassador Janis Peters made to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin.    President Yeltsin on Thursday issued a decree supporting  proposals by the defence and foreign ministries to set up  Russian military bases in other CIS states and Latvia.  Officials of both ministries later spoke of "technical  mistakes" being made in drafting the paper and Russian  Ambassador to Riga Aleksandr Rannikh made a formal apology to  the Latvian Foreign Ministry.    Latvian Embassy officials said Churkin had suggested that  the  two countries should maintain their relations as usual working  on the assumption that the Yeltsin decree did not exist. He was  also quoted as having promised a thorough investigation into the  origin of the paper "which is out of line with bilateral  agreements, already initialled."</p>

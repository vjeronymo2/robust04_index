			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Apr (MENA)--General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli  deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the  peace talks, has said that the Palestinian-Israeli round of  talks that concluded in Cairo today was "positive and fruitful."  He said that the two sides have come very close to reaching an  agreement on implementing self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. At a  news conference today before his departure from Cairo, Shahaq  said that during this round an agreement was reached on several  issues but that certain issues have not yet been settled. He  voiced his hope that next week will be the end of the talks on  implementing the Palestinian self-rule. He refused to set a  date for signing the agreement on self-rule, but noted that the  time is not far away.    Gen. Shahaq said that the Civilian Affairs Committee has  nearly finished numerous issues submitted to it, such as water  and communications. He noted that certain issues have not yet  been settled, such as stamps and telephone codes. He pointed  out that the Security Committee settled a working paper related  to the Palestinian police, but certain issues remain to be  worked out. Regarding the Legal Affairs Committee, he voiced his  hope that progress will be achieved in the work of this  committee next week.    Gen. Shahaq stated that an agreement was reached on the  legal  jurisdictions, but he declined to define the points of the  agreement, noting that certain topics will be postponed to be  discussed by higher echelons. He noted that the Palestinian and  Israeli delegations are waiting for the resolutions of the  Economic Affairs Committee currently meeting in Paris, which has  not yet finished its work. He said that the resolutions that  will be reached in Paris will be annexed to the other  resolutions to work out a general agreement that will be  implemented in Gaza and Jericho.    Gen. Shahaq pointed out that there are still issues on which  the two sides disagree; they will be postponed until after the  signing of the executive agreement on Gaza and Jericho.    Responding to a question on the Jericho area maps and the  reservations shown by the Palestinian delegation on this issue,  Shahaq said that what was signed in the "Cairo agreement" will  not be broached or negotiated again.    Regarding the Palestinian delegation's statement that there  is an understanding on the release of all Palestinian detainees  without distinction, Gen. Shahaq said: "This is what the  Palestinians are saying, not the Israelis." He noted that an  agreement was reached to release 5,000 out of 8,400 detainees in  two stages.    Regarding the legal jurisdiction and its limits if a  Palestinian citizen should commit a crime in Israel and flee to  Gaza, Gen. Shahaq said that in such a case he would be handed  over to Israel to stand trial. Concluding his news conference,  Gen. Shahaq pointed out that an agreement was reached on all  issues related to the crossing points between the self-rule  areas and Israel. He noted that no agreement has been reached  regarding the Palestinian authority at sea and in the air, which  is under the Security Committee.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> STRAPPED B. ALTMAN JOINS FLOCK OF OTHER RETAIL STORES PUT UP FOR SALE  </P> <P> The venerable department store chain B. Altman &amp; Co., whose Australian  owner filed for bankruptcy protection in August, is joining a host of other  well-known retailers on the auction block, the Australian company said today.  </P> <P> Hooker Corp. of Australia's U.S. subsidiary, L. J. Hooker Corp., which also  owns the upscale Bonwit Teller chain, said it hopes for a "quick sale" of its  seven Altman stores. The department stores are in New York, New Jersey,  Pennsylvania and Ohio.  </P> <P> The Altman chain is the latest among the nation's best-known department stores  to put up the "For Sale" sign, although industry analysts do not expect it to  bring top dollar.  </P> <P> Altman's will have to compete to attract buyers with retailing stars like  Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's, as well as Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall  Field, whose British owner BAT Industries is unloading them as part of an  attempt to avoid a takeover from Sir James Goldsmith.  </P> <P> Suppliers of both the Altman and Bonwit Teller chains had slowed sales to the  stores as Hooker sank deeper into debt.  </P> <P> Hooker arranged a $50-million line of credit in August with General Electric  Co.'s GE Capital subsidiary and was forced to pay in advance for goods.  </P></p>

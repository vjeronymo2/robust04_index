			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We will wage the campaign against corruption in the  Army mercilessly and uncompromisingly -- this is the categorical  view of Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov.    An announcement by the Defense Ministry Press Center states  that facts have been established confirming gross violations  during the recent allocation of housing that began on 11  January, connected with certain people enriching themselves at  the expense of others.    The announcement further states that a group of 30 officers  from the Sofia Garrison came to see the defense minister and  explained to him their complaints. Their complaints had also  been deposited with the commission supervising sales at the  Sofia Garrison. Despite explicit instructions issued by  Minister Aleksandrov, the commission chairman, Colonel Georgi  Vutov, adopted a rude, unceremonious attitude toward the senior  and junior officers. The defense minister went in person to the  place were the commission sits and immediately dismissed Colonel  Vutov from active military service for violations in carrying  out the duties entrusted to him. The minister also ordered the  replacement of all the members of the commission.</p>

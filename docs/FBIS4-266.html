			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has  today instructed that there will be no movement of people from  1900 to 0500 [as heard] in the Burnt Forest area which has  recently been the scene of clashes. President Moi said the  instruction takes effect from today and will continue until such  time as peace will have been completely restored in the area.  [one-minute break in reception] instructed the provincial  administration to facilitate the formation of village committees  in the various settlement farm to enhance and maintain order.  He warned that any village that will be found to have  instigated violence of any order will be fined heavily, apart  from other legal measures being taken against them. The  president told the two communities, the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu,  living in Burnt Forest to also form youth groups who will be the  watchdog of the villagers.    The president explained that the recent clashes in the area  erupted when two Kikuyu youths hurled a grenade at two Kalenjin  youngsters who fortunately were not killed. He said following  the attack, the police arrested the attackers but some people  took the law into their hands and sparked off tribal animosity  which led to the clashes. The president told the wananchi  [citizens] in the area to abide by the law and report to the  security agents whenever they are aggrieved, so that  investigations could be carried out. President Moi instructed  the police to hunt down some few people who are known to have  incited the people by spreading falsehood.    The president cautioned the Wananchi against being incited  to  fight one another, saying that in the long run, they and their  children will be the sufferers. President Moi particularly took  a swipe at the DAILY NATION newspaper for fanning tribal  animosity in the area by publishing false reports. President  Moi said the media in the country should play a more responsible  role of promoting a harmonious coexistence among the different  communities in the country.    The president also called on the churches to preach to the  people the importance of maintaining peace, instead of using the  pulpit to criticize the government and making inflammatory  statements. [passage omitted]    The head of state told the villagers in Burnt Forest to stop  being alarmists by demolishing their homes and leaving behind  their property while running away to urban centers. He  explained that there are some people who have run away with  their household goods to seek sympathy, claiming that their  houses had been burnt when that was not the case. He said no  one should be allowed to create the impression that some  communities were being chased away from Burnt Forest and urged  all the people in the area to return to their farm.    By a show of hands, the people in Burnt Forest assured the  president that they were for peace and will cooperate with all  those concerned to ensure that normalcy resumed. President Moi,  at the same time, called on all leaders from the Burnt Forest  and the surrounding areas to hold barazas [meetings] and  emphasize to the people the need to live harmoniously.

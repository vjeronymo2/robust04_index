			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: UK purchase boosts OPSM in Europe OPSM Protector, the Australian manufacturer, has bought Sabre Safety, the privately-owned UK respiratory equipment group, for ADollars 27.5m (USDollars 18.4m). OPSM Protector's chairman, Mr Adrian Lane, said yesterday the Sabre acquisition would double the size of the company's European operations and that further acquisitions may follow. 'We now have a major presence in the European personal protection equipment market and are well placed to continue to build our business there and to develop exports to other markets,' Mr Lane said. 'Sabre has annual sales of approximately ADollars 37m, of which about 75 per cent are in Europe and the rest are exports to the US, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions.' Sabre, with headquarters in Aldershot, was founded by Mr Michael Glynn in 1969. He will remain with the company as executive director of Protector Safety in Europe.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas The attempt by British Gas to portray itself as exercising self-restraint on pricing cut little ice with either the regulator or the market. Yesterday Ofgas said its reading of the gas price index did not justify price rises in the first place. Whichever side is right, the exchange is a side-show to the main event at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Even confirmation that the combative Sir James McKinnon will step down from Ofgas this year did nothing to lift the shares. They are likely to under-perform until the outcome of MMC review is clear.</p>

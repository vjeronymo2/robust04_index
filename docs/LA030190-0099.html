			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD BUDGET HONORED DESPITE PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The city of Oxnard, plagued by financial problems for more than eight months,  has received two statewide awards this year for achievements in budgeting  standards.  </P> <P> Oxnard was one of four cities with a population of 125,000 or more to receive  an award for its 1989-90 operating budget from the California Society of  Municipal Finance Officers.  </P> <P> The group also presented Oxnard with an award for its 1988-89 fiscal year  financial report.  </P> <P> "I think it's important to recognize what these awards represent is that the  city of Oxnard discloses information regarding actual revenues and expenses so  the City Council and public are fully aware of where the money goes," said Bill  Mayer, Oxnard's budget director. "It sets the basis for decision making."  </P> <P> The operating budget, which estimates revenues and expenses for the coming  year, was judged on the basis of how easy it is for the layman to understand,  said Amy Chan, director of finances for the city of Sunnyvale and one of the  judges who made the award.  </P> <P> "We were not looking at the financial health of the city as much as the  document itself," Chan said. "We wanted to see if the reader was able to  understand what it was telling people."  </P> <P> The statewide organization is a group of city finance directors.  </P> <P> Of the 43 cities that submitted operating budgets for review, 18 received  awards. Oxnard, Pasadena, Santa Ana and Stockton received the award for cities  with populations at or above 125,000.  </P> <P> The financial report, which details the actual expenses and revenues determined  by an audit at the end of a fiscal year, was judged on the basis of such things  as its footnotes and statistical section.  </P> <P> Of 105 cities that applied for the award, 102 received it. It is the first year  that Oxnard has been cited for its financial report.  </P> <P> But Oxnard has also become known for its budget problems, having engaged in a  series of budget cuts that were in part necessitated by miscalculations in  revenues and expenses.  </P> <P> It was disclosed last fall that estimates of revenues for the 1988-89 fiscal  year were $2 million too high. At the same time, it was learned that the city  had overspent its budget by $850,000.  </P> <P> City leaders subsequently made more than $1 million in reductions, slashing 16  city positions and reducing department budgets. The decreases followed $1.9  million in cutbacks made in June.  </P></p>

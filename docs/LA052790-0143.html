			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIEU, KY BACK IN LEADERSHIP ROLES  </P> <P> You would think that after the fall of South Vietnam in 1975 we would have had  sufficient time to evaluate the leadership of its former premiers. For that  reason, I was appalled to read that Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky were  attempting to reestablish their influence over the Vietnamese community in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Thieu and Ky never demonstrated any qualities of good leadership and, in fact,  were concerned only with themselves and their own families. It is also  well-documented that their administrations were nothing more than corrupt  regimes that showed very little regard for their own people.  </P> <P> The most tragic result of their ineptitude was the loss of more than 58,000  Americans who fought a war that Thieu and Ky had no interest in fighting. While  we saw our friends leave the battlefield in body bags, the South Vietnamese  army conducted "search-and-avoid missions." This was the result of policies  established and implemented by both Thieu and Ky.  </P> <P> How little have we learned from history and what does it say about our own  leaders who fail to confront these two "glorious heroes"? Instead, they are  allowed to live and flourish here and to attempt to recapture a semblance of  statesmanship.  </P> <P> FERNANDO ALDECOA  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

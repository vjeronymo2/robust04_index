			<p>BFN     [Text] Reacting to the Hadera attack, President 'Ezer  Weizman calls for national unity, for keeping calm, and  continuing the peace process. In his opinion, the government  should consider several additional steps that can ensure  security.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also calls for national unity  and for finding the unifying factors in anticipation of the hard  times ahead. He adds that despite the bloodshed, Israel will  continue extending its hand in peace.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the Hadera attack will  not halt the peace process or deter Israel in the pursuit of its  goals. He further said that 'Arafat is not omnipotent, and there  is no point in continuously demanding that he denounce terrorist  attacks.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu blames the government for  the rising terror and demands that the prime minister either  discontinue the negotiations with the PLO or announce elections.    Tzomet head Refa'el Eytan demands that the government stop  the peace talks until terror stops. This is also the demand of  YI'UD [Independent and Democratic Israel] head Gonen Segev.    Meretz faction chairman Ran Kohen calls on 'Arafat and the  Palestinian leadership to immediately condemn the heinous  murder. He calls on Israeli opposition leaders not to disrupt  the national unity of Remembrance Day mourning and not to  exploit the attack for political purposes.    The National Religious Party calls on the prime minister to  resign at once.    Minister Yosi Sarid says the government will do all it can  to  pursue terrorists, but it will pursue peace at the same time.    The Arab Democratic Party and Deputy Minister Walid Sadiq  condemn the Hadera attack.    The Moledet faction calls for an immediate halt of the  negotiations with the Palestinians and for banning their  policemen from Gaza and Jericho.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal promises to capture the  perpetrators. He says the government will not rest until it  brings peace.</p>

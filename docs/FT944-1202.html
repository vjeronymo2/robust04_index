			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Mattel to shed 1,000 jobs, take Dollars 70m charge Mattel, the US toy manufacturer which outbid Hasbro in a battle for J. W. Spear of the UK in July, has announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs from its international workforce of 22,000 in an attempt to reduce costs and increase profitability. It said the cuts would produce a pre-tax restructuring charge of about Dollars 70m in the year just ending. However, the increase in efficiency would produce pre-tax savings of about Dollars 25m next year and greater amounts thereafter. In the year to December 1993, Mattel had net income of Dollars 117m on sales of Dollars 2.7bn, but reported that the figure would have been Dollars 226m were it not for the costs of absorbing Fisher-Price, a toy company it took over at the end of 1993. Mattel said it expected this year's results from operations to make 1994 the sixth consecutive year of record sales and earnings. It also announced a stock split and 25 per cent increase in the quarterly dividend to 6 cents a share. Mattel said the restructuring would involve the consolidation of manufacturing operations and the reduction of headquarters expense and support functions around the world.</p>

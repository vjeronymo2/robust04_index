The uranium and mercury, originating in Russia, were seized  by Romanian customs officials as the Moldovans crossed the land  frontier at Leuseni, and were to be sold on to one or several  unknown customers, they said.    Ukrainian authorities and Black Sea security forces on  Wednesday arrested six people involved in a plot to smuggle out  300 grammes of a ``highly radioactive material'' worth one  million dollars, according to Ukrainian radio monitored by the  BBC in London.    The report did not say where the arrests were made, what  kind  of radioactive material was involved, or where it was bound.    More than 20 kilogrammes (44 pounds) of red mercury and 20  containers of cesium have been intercepted this year at the  frontier between the former Soviet republic of Moldova and the  culturally similar republic of Romania, where border controls  for nationals of the two countries have in principle been  simplified.    Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991,  smugglers carrying nuclear materials from Russia and other  former Soviet republics have been arrested in several central  and eastern European countries.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Call for Generals' Withdrawal -- If the generals named in  the  Goldstone Commission report on police involvement in the  violence in Natal are innocent, "then they, their colleagues and  the Commissioner of Police should accept their withdrawal from  duty instead of fighting it on procedural grounds," declares a  page 14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25  March. "It is, of course, correct that proper procedures must  be followed, but this is a quibble that the commissioner could  have sorted out in hours. There can be no argument at all that  the generals and all others accused in the report should be kept  out of the way until innocence or guilt is proven."    Editorial Skeptical About Mediation Success -- A second  editorial on the same page says Lord Carrington and Henry  Kissinger, named to mediate between the Inkatha Freedom Party  (IFP) and the African National Congress (ANC), "face a most  daunting task even before they begin their work." "Ideally, the  mediation should be completed before the election, so that the  IFP can be included in the process. But mediation can be long  and cumbersome and preparations for the election must,  therefore, go ahead as planned. Perhaps the mediators' wisdom  can devise a means by which agreements reached after the  election could yet be included in the constitution. We wouldn't  bet on it, however."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   TEC `Gave In' To Prisoners' Protests -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS  DAY in English on 25 March in a page-6 editorial notes that the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC) "gave in to violent protest  in deciding that all prisoners should be allowed to vote in  South Africa's first democratic election." "Having won their  first battle through rioting which cost at least 23 lives, some  prisoners are already setting out new demands. Some long-term  prisoners want to vote `at home', and this novel idea is sure to  catch on. Demands do not stop there. Other Ciskei prisoners  say they should be released because `there is no government'.  If they riot savagely enough, will the TEC decide they have a  point, and let them loose?"  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Government, TEC `Dawdled' Over Issues -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN  in English on 25 March in a page-12 editorial says the TEC and  the government "dawdled" on the issues of prisoners' voting  rights and the lack of free political activity in Bophuthatswana  (Bop). The TEC and the government "huffed and puffed and wrung  their hands until Bop folk took the law into their hands and  sent Mangope scuttling. It was only then that the TEC and the  Government stepped in." Now it is "happening in kwaZulu, the  Ciskei and the other homelands. It's happening with decisions  on the other violence racking the country. The message from all  this is that only might is right. It is the old story of the  liberation struggle: Lives have to be sacrificed first before  there is action. This is all against the message that the TEC  and the Government are trying to give us -- that negotiations  and democracy are the way of a new South Africa."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   Call for SADF Intervention in Natal/kwaZulu -- Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 25-30 March in a  page-20  editorial believes that to avoid "direct and bloody conflict"  between the IFP and the ANC, "the South African Defence Force  should be sent in to isolate the Inkatha warriors, separate the  ANC mass activist from their IFP rivals, neutralise the kwaZulu  Police, disarm all parties and stop the informal training of  warriors. Their purpose should not be to depose anyone -- that  would worsen the situation -- but to secure the region for  elections and reduce the death rate."</p>

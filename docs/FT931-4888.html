			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Italian cabinet to debate action over corruption THE AMATO government will today decide whether to submit to parliament controversial legislation on illicit funding of Italian political parties or to adopt a new approach to dealing with the issue of corruption. Prime minister Giuliano Amato also has to convince Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana to reconsider his weekend decision to resign as environment minister, or find a replacement at a time when the four-party coalition is increasingly fractious. 'The government tried to carry out something which has wounded the commonsense of Italians,' Mr Ripa de Meana said yesterday, explaining his resignation. 'I don't see how this government can continue.' Another question mark was raised over the Amato government yesterday when Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister appointed less than three weeks ago, said he had considered resigning over the issue. The government's increased weakness follows near-universal hostility to a decree approved on Friday which depenalises illicit funding of political parties and removes party finances from magistrates' jurisdiction, except in cases of extortion. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign the decree on Sunday. Mr Scalfaro's move was made on constitutional grounds, but he implicitly invited the prime minister to reconsider the legislation, or at least his legislative approach. He said clear conflict existed between the decree, which had to be endorsed or rejected in its entirety within 60 days, and a referendum on April 18 to consider the abolition of political parties' public funding. Mr Amato can opt to leave the text of the decree intact and submit it to parliament. In this way parliament would be free to alter its provisions and achieve the compromise originally intended - to balance the need to speed the judicial process of those involved in corruption proceedings with perhaps a form of limited amnesty, while paying deference to the independence of the judiciary. But with some 50 parliamentarians under investigation, and the main parties clearly implicated in an institutionalised system of corruption, opposition deputies yesterday doubted that the present legislature had the legitimacy to act. The mood of parliament will be clearer today when a general debate on corruption is held. A decision is also due on whether to waive immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader, to face charges of alleged corruption and extortion. Milan magistrates, at the centre of the investigations, yesterday welcomed Mr Scalfaro's refusal to sign the decree.

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Tory anger grows over handling of 'back to basics' The back to basics initiative launched by Mr John Major appeared close to foundering yesterday as questions mounted over the prime minister's handling of the issue. He defended the initiative vigorously, but there were signs of growing anger among Tory MPs about the muddle over values which has dogged the campaign since it was launched at the party conference in October. In the past two weeks it was revealed that Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister, had fathered two children out of wedlock by different women; that Mr Alan Duncan, a minister's parliamentary assistant, had resigned after disclosures about a business deal; and that a Conservative backbencher was reported by his wife to have allegedly left her for a man. It also emerged that Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, may face a re-selection battle in his Epping constituency over claims that he has had five mistresses. Interviewed on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Major sought to defuse the row by denying that back to basics was a moral crusade, and drawing a distinction between bad behaviour and tolerance of indiscretions. He said it was 'proper' that ministers should resign if they behaved 'badly'. But 'if someone commits a silly indiscretion, I am not in the business of a witch-hunt'. Mr Major urged his colleagues to show 'tolerance and understanding' to MPs who behaved 'foolishly', and insisted that recent events did not invalidate the initiative. Senior Conservatives refused to comment publicly on the initiative in an attempt to avoid stir-ring up fresh controversy when parliament resumes tomorrow. However, many rightwing MPs have been angered by the prime minister's handling of the issue, which some see as a betrayal of family values. By contrast, mainstream Conservatives who were worried by the moralistic tone of the initiative are concerned that Mr Major has given a further hostage to fortune by attempting to distinguish between classes of bad behaviour. Sir Edward Heath, a strong supporter of the prime minister, said it was 'highly dangerous' for ministers to moralise. 'People, particularly the British, dislike being preached at,' he said. The confusion prompted a scathing attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who claimed the initiative had 'collapsed in its own contradictions'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Mr Major of offering the electorate 'bland slogans, muddled thinking and complacency'.

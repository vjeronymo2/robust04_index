According to an official note released  yesterday, the list could be expanded if the Finance Ministry  identifies other sectors that are considered oligopolies and for  which there is world competition.    Of the approximately 132 products in the list, 103 are  medicines. The others are hygiene and cleaning products, like  matches and steel wool, which have little effect on living  costs. Margarine and the materials for producing it are the  only food products in the list.    The resolution with the list, which was signed by Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, can be suspended at any  time. The ministry declined to report whether the sectors that  are affected by the resolution have actually increased their  prices above inflation. The resolution says only that "the  government has detected that in various sectors in which just a  few enterprises are operating, the process of commercial opening  that began in 1990 did not go far enough to check significant  price increases in real terms."    The 41 products, of a total of 13,000 products on the  Brazilian Custom Tariffs list, were compiled so as "not to  produce excessive lack of protection, which might have caused  unemployment in the national industry," the resolution states.    The list of products did not meet the expectations of  economic team members. FOLHA learned that the initial proposal  included home electrical appliances, electrical and electronic  products, and petrochemicals. This would have had repercussions  on the textile, ink, and dye production sectors. The ministry  of industry, commerce, and tourism opposed reducing taxes in  those sectors on the grounds that it would have harmed the  medium and long-term industrial policy.    Yesterday morning, before publication of the list of  products  whose import tariffs would be reduced, Minister Cardoso said  that the reduction of the tariffs paid on products whose prices  suffered abusive increases should make prices return to their  normal level.    "It is quite an effective measure, and we should try  carefully to avoid any demagogic use of it," he said. According  to the minister, any country in the situation that Brazil is in,  with a high level of international reserves and an open economy,  would also have reduced import tariffs.    Cardoso asked entrepreneurs to respect people's aspirations  and to refrain from imposing abusive price increases.  "Enterprises are important, and we should appreciate both  enterprises and entrepreneurs, but they should also understand  that they cannot ignore the aspirations of the people. People  cannot bear irresponsible price increases," the minister said.</p>

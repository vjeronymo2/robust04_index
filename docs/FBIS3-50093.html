			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maja Narbutt from Kaliningrad: "Polish Consulate </F> Opens in Kaliningrad"]    [Text] Yesterday a Polish consulate was officially opened  in Kaliningrad. It is the first diplomatic post of this rank in  the Kaliningrad Oblast; a German consulate is supposed to be  opened there in a few months.    On the same day, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Iwo  Byczewski and Kaliningrad Oblast Mayor Yuri Matochkin signed a  document on the establishment of a Polish-Russian Council for  Cooperation Between Poland's North-Western Voivodships and the  Kaliningrad Oblast. The council will start work in March.    The Kaliningrad Oblast, part of the Russian Federation  located farthest west and the most militarized area in Europe,  aspires to become a Russian Hong Kong. New prospects for Western  investors arose in December of last year, when a decree by  Russian President Boris Yeltsin exempted their goods from the  customs duty. The decree also exempted them from paying taxes  for four years.    Polish companies are most numerous as far as foreign capital  enterprises in the oblast are concerned. However, German  investors have invested the greatest amount of money there.  According to Polish entrepreneurs working in Kaliningrad, the  gap between German and Polish capital is steadily increasing.</p>

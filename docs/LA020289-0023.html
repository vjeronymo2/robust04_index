			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: HISTORY ON THE PHILIPPINE PISO  </P> <P> Question: A few years ago I acquired a Marcos-Reagan 1982 Philippines 25 piso  coin. What is its present value? -- H.W.G.  </P> <P> Answer: Most countries issue commemoratives of one sort or another. Ancient  Greek and Roman rulers started the practice. It was good for the ego and has  had a lasting imprint on history. The Philippines have followed suit with coins  honoring Gen. Douglas MacArthur, various papal visits and deposed President  Ferdinand Marcos.  </P> <P> The fact that Marcos and former President Ronald Reagan adorn the same coin  should prove interesting to collectors. As you probably know, the United States  does not honor living Presidents on coinage. Only a few of our Presidents are  memorialized on coins and bills. Politics is a factor.  </P> <P> However, medals honoring all our Presidents are available. A complete set in  bronze (Option No. 154) is $54. Contact the United States Mint, Customer  Affairs Staff, 10001 Aerospace Drive, Lantham, Md. 20706; telephone (301)  436-7400.  </P> <P> Your Philippine coin with Marcos and Reagan on the obverse, catalogues for $45.  Realistically, expect $10 to $20 from a dealer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Botswana, Lesotho and Mozambique have each issued coins commemorating a papal  visit. Lesotho issued both gold and sterling silver (pictured) proofs. The  Mozambique and Botswana pieces are sterling silver. Each country's design is  different. The Pope visited the African nations in September. The Lesotho gold  coin (750 mintage) is $495; the silver pieces are $44.95 each. Contact the  British Royal Mint, P.O. Box 2570, Woodside, N.Y. 11377-9864; telephone (800)  543-0237.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin Calendar  </P> <P> Today, Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- The 500-year-old British sovereign is  getting its first design change in 170 years and will be available to  purchasers for the first time at the mammoth 11th annual Long Beach Numismatic  &amp; Philatelic Winter Exposition, which also features a three-day auction,  450 dealers, special interest forums and specialty booths.

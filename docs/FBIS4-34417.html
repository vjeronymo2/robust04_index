			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Cabinet Council held a special meeting on  Saturday and authorized the issuance of public debt bonds so  Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] can meet  the demands of the eight banks involved in the intervention.    Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information Office [OCI]  minister, made the announcement while reporting on the topics  discussed at the special meeting. Although he admitted there  were technical problems involved in immediately paying savings  account holders at the intervened banks, he did not rule out the  possibility that these banks could reopen their doors on Monday  and Tuesday to honor these commitments. He said the decree  approved by the president will be published in the official  gazette on Saturday night, a task for which printing press  personnel have already been designated.    [Begin recording] [Alvarez, in progress]...invest 400  billion  bolivares at this time. The first investment is 150 billion to  cover Fogade's demands to meet the requirements of the eight  banks you already know about. This was the main point on today's  agenda. This decree will be published in the official gazette  tonight. As a sign of the urgency with which we have treated the  case, we have already assigned printing press personnel to  perform this task.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Alvarez] Our intention, which was announced by the finance  minister a few days ago, was to get the banks to open tomorrow  and resume normal operations. Excuse me, I meant Monday. The  bank superintendent has said there are technical problems which  they are trying to overcome and which could prevent them from  opening on Monday. If they cannot open on Monday, they will open  on Tuesday. It would be a 24-hour thing, at any rate. There is  no contradiction here. [end recording]    The OCI minister said that if Congress and the executive  branch have submitted this plan to pay savings account holders  on Monday and Tuesday, the money does exist.</p>

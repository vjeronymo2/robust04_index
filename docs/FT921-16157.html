			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Company News: Tenneco chief aims to repeat the turnround trick - Martin Dickson examines the dramatic changes under way at one of the few remaining large US conglomerates It is tempting to describe Mr Michael Walsh, the new chief executive of troubled US conglomerate Tenneco, as 'Action Man,' except that Mr Walsh hates the tough guy label which Wall Street and the press have hung around his neck. 'Its so macho, so superficial,' he says. 'Its not a question of being tough, or not tough, its a question of being realistic.' Nevertheless, Mr Walsh, an athletic 49-year-old who confesses to playing rock music louder than his children, has unleashed a whirl of change since he arrived at the staid Houston company last autumn, including a six-point 'action plan' to strengthen its highly leveraged balance sheet and improve profits. The plan, announced just 10 days after his arrival, also owes something to Tenneco's chairman since 1978, Mr James Ketelsen. But it is to Mr Walsh, who will become chairman next May, that the group is looking for a turnround from the lacklustre performance of the past few years - including severe losses at its JI Case agricultural and construction equipment business. The hope is that Mr Walsh can repeat the trick he performed between 1986 and last August as chairman of Union Pacific's railroad business, where he nearly doubled profits through a shake-up of a mature, traditional business. He cut costs aggressively, pushed decision-making down the line, removed bureaucracy and stressed teamwork and innovation. Tenneco, which ranks 26th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest US industrial companies, certainly needs shaking up. One of the few remaining large American conglomerates, its origins lie in the gas pipeline business which remains its largest income earner. However, diversification in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, means that its interests also span automotive components, shipbuilding - submarines and aircraft carriers - packaging and chemicals, as well as agricultural equipment. In 1988, in a move which amazed Wall Street, it sold its huge oil industry assets for Dollars 7.4bn, so that it could reduce debt, repurchase its stock, and counter rumours of a break-up bid. The company was in effect staking its future on an improved performance by Case, the number two US agricultural equipment maker behind Deere &amp; Co, but which lost money every year between 1983 and 1988. In 1989 and 1990 Case, which accounts for some 35 per cent of Tenneco's revenues, did indeed move strongly into the black, thanks to an upswing in the volatile tractor cycle. But the past year has been an unmitigated disaster. This is partly due to general economic conditions - the farm market has grown soft, while the construction industry is in deep recession - but Case also allowed its inventories to get badly out of hand. And as it brings them under control, it has had to slash both prices and production. In the first nine months of this year Case produced an operating loss of Dollars 439m and, in the third quarter, it had to take a Dollars 413m restructuring charge to cover 4,000 job cuts, plant closures and product rationalisations. Tenneco's other businesses are reasonably well regarded, though they have not fared particularly well during the current recession, with even the gas pipeline business suffering from a spell of unusually warm weather. And by last summer, with debt accounting for some 63 per cent of total capital and on a rising trend, it was clear that strong action was needed to bolster the group's balance sheet. The action plan, which was essentially completed by early December, goes some way to achieving that. It includes a 50 per cent cut in the dividend, a 25 per cent (Dollars 250m) reduction in 1992 capital spending, and the sale of Dollars 1.05bn of non-core assets, including Tenneco's natural gas liquids business, which fetched Dollars 632m. It will cut costs by Dollars 250m a year, partly through a further 2,000 job losses, and the group has also raised Dollars 516m through an offering of preferred stock. This all looks eye-catchingly dynamic, but it is only the first part of a turnround which will take much longer to achieve, as Mr Walsh is well aware. The second stage, he says, involves a much improved financial performance across the group in 1992. He has set much tougher operating targets for each of the businesses, with the aim of returning Tenneco to 'respectable levels of profitability'. And he makes clear that the ability of subsidiaries to meet these targets will play a role in the third stage of his plan - which is to determine what businesses have a place in the long-term future of Tenneco. 'In my mind,' he says, 'the ability to perform against commitment is an important part of earning strategic respect.' He appears to have no strong feelings for or against the conglomerate structure as such. He says that one advantage of a conglomerate, at least theoretically, is that you should be able to take profits during the up-cycle in one part of the business and invest in the down-cycle of another part; and he points out that single product companies are hardly problem-free. 'In my book there's one rule that matters: if it works, its good, if it doesn't work its bad.' He acknowledges that it is hard for a complete outsider like him to plunge into a complex business like Tenneco and 'overhaul the ship without the luxury of putting it in dry-dock'. 'What you bring to it is a fresh perspective, but you need to be able to build a bridge to existing management and win their confidence or you don't have a prayer.' And that means getting out and shaking an awful lot of hands. His financial goal is to cut the ratio of debt to total capital to around 50 per cent over the next few years and improve the equity base 'not just because the rating agencies insist on it, but because its the way I want to run the company'. Much will depend on his ability to turn Case around. Mr Walsh acknowledges that this is not going to be easy, or done 'all in one bite'. But he says that a lot of inventory has been run off in the fourth quarter and the market may be sufficiently firm for the company to raise prices and cut its discounts in 1992. The division also has a new chief to replace Mr James Ashford, who was once seen as a potential successor to Mr Ketelsen but resigned abruptly last March, as Case's problems mounted. The new man is Mr Robert Carlson, whose past employers included United Technologies, the large Connecticut technology group, and Deere, where he worked for over 25 years and enjoyed a good reputation. Wall Street thinks Tenneco would love to rid itself of Case, but Mr Walsh refuses to be drawn on the subject, or on persistent rumours that it may have been discussing a deal or joint venture involving a Japanese company. All he will say is that 'the world's obviously getting smaller and people are looking for alliances that make sense'. Whatever is afoot at Case, dramatic change seems certain across Tenneco. Mr Walsh says that Mr Tom Peters, a leading US management expert, studied his techniques at Union Pacific and came to the conclusion that his across-the-board approach to change works better than incremental fiddling. 'If you don't do this,' says Mr Walsh, 'the organisation will wear you out, or wait you out, or both. And the idea these organisations are fragile - like flowers in the late spring - is just something I have found to be not true.'  ------------------------------------------------------- TENNECO SALES BY DIVISION (1990)  ------------------------------------------------------- Division                            Dollars bn  ------------------------------------------------------- Gas pipelines                          2.5 Farm and construction equipment        5.4 Automotive parts                       1.7 Shipbuilding                           2.1 Packaging                              1.5 Chemical and mineral                   1.3  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

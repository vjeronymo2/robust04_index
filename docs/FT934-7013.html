			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Middleton in final plea for Merrett Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, will today make a last-ditch effort to persuade Lloyd's agents to increase their backing for syndicates managed by the Merrett Underwriting Agency Management. Fears are growing that failure could lead to the break-up of the wider Merrett Group, which also owns insurance services interests. Lloyd's has become involved because Merrett's two biggest syndicates 418 and 1067 lead some of the market's most valuable US insurance business and are unlikely to continue trading next year without support. The Merrett's syndicates' difficulties have increased by the collapse of plans last week to secure support from Travelers, the US insurance company. Members' agents (who handle the affairs of Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market) are now said to be offering between Pounds 32m and Pounds 33m in backing for syndicate 418, compared with the syndicate's current capacity of Pounds 150m and an estimated minimum requirement of Pounds 50m. Lloyd's could also be left with the job of organising the 'run off' (meeting claims on existing policies) of any Merrett syndicates which are closed. Merrett is already handling the run-off of syndicate 418's 1985 and 1990 loss-making years. A spokesman said yesterday that Lloyd's 'was concerned to ensure continuity for existing policyholders and that the interests of members are safeguarded'. A 'steering group' consisting of Mr Middleton and other senior figures will co-ordinate the activities of the Lloyd's Corporation - which administers and regulates the market - and Lloyd's agents. Mr Keeling replaced Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Merrett Group, as deputy chairman of the Lloyd's market in August. As well as 418 and 1067 the group had aimed to manage four other syndicates  -179, 332, 1038 and 1184 - next year. They could now be transferred to other agencies, leaving the group dependent on its income from insurance services business including Miller Knight, the loss adjusters, BIL, an insurance investigations business, the Merrett Health Risk Management, and BCS, a specialist run-off company. Meanwhile three Merrett executives who resigned on Friday are to join Zurich Re, the Swiss reinsurance company. Mr Dennis Purkiss, former group chief executive of Merrett, will become chief executive officer, while Mr Ken Barrett and Mr Stewart Laderman, underwriters of 1067 and 418's non-marine business respectively, will join the Zurich underwriting team.</p>

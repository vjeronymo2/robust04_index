			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MISSION IN THE GULF  </P> <P> Alexander Cockburn's article "Stand Fast for Talk, Not Battle" is excellent  (Column Left, Commentary, Oct. 21).  </P> <P> I agree we should say no to Iraq's grab of Kuwait, no to a U.S. war and no to  double standards about which land grabs and invasions the U.S. chooses to  denounce. I believe we should say yes to the countries and to the United  Nations who are trying their utmost to remedy the complex issues in the Persian  Gulf with a peaceful settlement.  </P> <P> A war wouldn't settle the difficult problems in the area. A war would just  delay the settlement of international difficulties. The American people don't  want war with its unbelievable horrors and inhumanities for all concerned.  </P> <P> JEAN M. NICHOLSON  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Lenders make cautious start to rate cuts MOST building societies yesterday held back from an instant cut in mortgage rates after the reduction in base rates, as housebuilders, homeowners and estate agents tried to weigh up the consequences of a turbulant week. Abbey National, the bank, National &amp; Provincial, the eighth largest building society and Northern Rock, the 11th largest, all announced that they were cutting mortgage rate to 9.25 per cent with immediate effect for new borrowers and from December 1 for existing borrowers. North of England Building Society said it was making available for some borrowers a rate of 8.35 per cent - its lowest for 20 years. Other lenders promised rate cuts that they would quantify later. The prospect of a further reduction in mortgage interest rates would normally be expected to stimulate house sales and prices, but there was only a weak cheer when the Bank of England signalled the latest cut in base rates. Housebuilders say most people are more concerned about the possibility of losing their jobs than about saving a few pounds on mortgage bills. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, said: 'Any reduction in interest rates is welcome, but sales are unlikely to revive until people feel more confident about the economy and in particular about whether they will have a job this time next year.' Mr David Holliday, president of the House Builders Federation, whose members build 90 per cent of the country's new homes, said the latest cut was 'a step in the right direction, but unlikely to stimulate an immediate recovery in the housing market'. Abbey National, which cut its rates to 9.6 per cent for new borrowers on Tuesday, but postponed an earlier cut in its rates from November 1 to December 1 for existing borrowers, said the base rate cut was 'better news than we were expecting'. The new 9.25 per cent rate applies to loans under Pounds 60,000. Rates for loans of Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000, are 9.05 per cent and 8.85 per cent for loans over Pounds 100,000. These also apply to existing borrowers from December 1. None of the institutions cutting their rates matched the 1 point drop in base rates. Halifax, the country's largest building society, promised that new mortgage rates would be announced soon and said its planned cut from 10.65 per cent to 9.99 per cent in response to the last cut in base rates would still take effect for existing borrowers from November 1. Nationwide, Woolwich, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Britannia said they were considering their positions. Alliance &amp; Leicester said it would cut rates for existing borrowers on December 1 and announce the size of the cut next week. Woolwich said the size of its planned drop in mortgage rates would have to take into account the needs of investors. The Big Four high street banks all said their mortgage rates were under review.</p>

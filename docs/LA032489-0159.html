			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> AIDS THEME DARKENS ARTIST'S PLAYFUL VISION  </P> <P> Masami Teraoka has always taken a tolerant view of the folly of humankind. A  social critic in the tradition of Daumier and Thomas Nast, he's explored man's  ignorance and short-sightedness with the wise bemusement of an indulgent  parent. Frantically racing about, soiling his own nest, a slave to sensual  pleasure, blind to the glory of nature, man is obviously a rather foolish  creature, but like a mischievous dog that persists in chewing up the paper, you  love him anyway. Teraoka affects a sharp shift in tone in his latest series,  however. A mournful requiem for AIDS and a warning of even darker days to come,  "Waves and Plagues" speaks with a grave sense of finality altogether absent in  previous work by this enormously popular artist.  </P> <P> On view at the Long Beach Museum of Art through April 25, "Waves and Plagues"  may be a bit too heavy for Teraoka's longtime fans who have loved his work for  its playful handling of erotica (one of the cornerstones of Japanese art) and  the comical collision of the cultures of Japan and America. A master of the  visual pun, Teraoka has explored pollution and the corruption of tradition as  symbolized by such things as the junk food industry and the tourist trade, and  invariably made his point with an extremely light touch. If you failed to get  the message or the jokes in his delightfully naughty paintings, you could  always luxuriate in their overripe beauty or marvel at Teraoka's dazzling  technique.  </P> <P> It is, however, virtually impossible to miss the point in this new work; these  pictures resonate with an overwhelming sadness that's both moving and  unmistakably grim. "Waves and Plagues" is but the latest in a spate of  exhibitions designed to increase public awareness of the AIDS epidemic, and the  recent death of esteemed photographer Robert Mapplethorpe will no doubt  generate a few more. (LACE presented a survey of AIDS-related art last fall,  and a similar exhibition of photographs by Rosalind Solomon opens at UC San  Diego on Tuesday). Born in Japan in 1936, Teraoka immigrated to the United  States in 1961 and became caught up in the then-burgeoning Pop art movement.  Synthesizing the disparate influences of Japan, America and Pop, he arrived at  a unique style rooted in the traditional Japanese printmaking form known as  Ukiyo-e. A vibrant yet meticulously controlled woodblock-print technique,  Ukiyo-e became popular in Japan in 1615 and thrived until 1868 when it  disappeared. Basically a form of genre art, Ukiyo-e is comparable to modern-day  comic books in that these images are often inscribed with text illustrating a  corresponding story. Teraoka revived the style and made it current by using it  to tell modern stories loaded with hip nuances, and his reputation spread like  wildfire after his first major one-man show in 1975. (The fact that his work  reproduces extremely well didn't hurt.)  </P> <P> Teraoka's longtime preoccupation with nature and eros dovetail perfectly in  AIDS, which he perceives as a metaphor for the wrath of nature and a  foreshadowing of even greater ecological disasters to come. He delivers his  warning here in the form of complex parables, many of which employ the  structure of Kabuki theater. The recurring motifs in these highly detailed  compositions function on multiple levels; the snake, for instance, symbolizes  the AIDS virus, while condoms represent salvation and the forethought one must  now bring to sex.  </P> <P> Tormented, angry figures wear blue makeup which signifies that they've died but  are unable to rest in peace. "He died but his soul hasn't really passed on yet;  it wanders around," reads the text on a particularly powerful image. The lush  beauty of Teraoka's watercolor style juxtaposed with the anguish and confusion  of the figures in these images makes them doubly heartbreaking.  </P> <P> Nine years ago, Teraoka relocated from Los Angeles to Hawaii, and not  surprisingly, the shift in locale is reflected in his art. Whereas previously  his work occasionally verged on being hysterically busy, "Waves and Plagues"  exudes a quiet, somber simplicity (which could, of course, have something to do  with the subject matter). Life in a tropical paradise has also increased his  concern with ecological issues, and he's begun doing straight landscapes, a few  of which stand among his finest work. "Pali Lookout," a small landscape of a  bank of green cliffs eroded by the sea, pulsates with a mysterious ambiguity  that leaves it open to more varied interpretation than his narrative scenes  allow.  </P> <P> However, the occasional luminous landscape does little to disguise the fact  that Teraoka is essentially a fin de siecle artist working at the top of his  form. Fin de siecle is a French term describing the final flowering of a  culture that's become so perversely overwound and diseased that it's on the  verge of blowing apart; that's pretty much what "Waves and Plagues" is about.  </P></p>

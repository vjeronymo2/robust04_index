			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT BEWITCHED  </P> <P> I was horrified, but not surprised, at Michael Wilmington's review of "The  Witches" (Aug. 24). The movie revolves around a plot by an organization of  witches to turn the children of the world into mice.  </P> <P> All the witches in the film are portrayed as ugly and evil old women.  </P> <P> Actually, there are witches, and we celebrate and worship the Goddess  (otherwise known as Mother Earth). The golden rule of witchcraft is "An it harm  none, love, and do as you will." Witches believe that whatever you do, comes  back to you threefold. Therefore we don't use magic at the expense of others.  We have been slandered, tortured and burned down the centuries because we do  not believe in the same God as the church (though we recognize other people's  right to believe in whatever they like).  </P> <P> "The Witches" is intended to be lighthearted fantasy. But what would  Wilmington's reaction have been to a lighthearted fantasy called "The Jews" in  which the Jews of the world were revealed to be ugly, evil people who plot "the  destruction of every last child in England?"  </P> <P> TALIESIN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

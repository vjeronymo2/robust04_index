			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Landmark equal pay ruling is welcomed PAY differentials between men and women will be more difficult to justify after a landmark ruling from the European Court of Justice, the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday. The ruling concerned Dr Pamela Enderby, a senior-grade speech therapist, who for eight years has been seeking to establish pay comparability with senior-grade pharmacists and clinical psychologists.

They could no longer simply offer a description of how different rates of pay came about. The judgment puts Dr Enderby's case back to where it began eight years ago. In effect, it means she has established her right to go to a tribunal and have her equal-pay case heard. The commission said the judgment did not mean that her claim would be rubber stamped. 'Nobody has yet assessed the merit of her claim to equal pay. Independent experts will have to do an audit.' The speech therapist's claim and the length of her battle for equal pay highlights the complexity of existing legislation. The commission has urged the government to simplify the law on equal pay and sex discrimination. It said yesterday that many claimants lost heart and did not pursue their claims because of legal complexity. 'There are complexities in the law that could be simplified and unnecessary ambiguities removed,' it said. MSF, the white-collar union, which backed the court action, said: 'This case marks a turning point for thousands of speech therapists who are demanding equal pay with their male colleagues.'</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Nation in search of itself: Japan thinks itself a spiritual country. Yet corporate identity is stronger than religious awareness. Robert Thomson considers a cultural change MEASURING the ground with casual precision, Kiyoshi Sato prepares his fields for a crop of rust-stained steel rods, the ribs of a vinyl greenhouse. Instead of Bright Sun rice, the earth will be caressed by Sato into bearing Prince melons, more profitable than the sacred grain but strangers in Suye village, where the rhythms of life always have been in tune with the rise and fall of the rice crop. The cultural rhythms of Japan are out of synch. Remarkable industrial growth is popularly viewed against a romanticised rural background. The reassuring images of the 'old village', the furusato, are essential to the sense of being Japanese. A family might live in Tokyo but it will tell you that its furusato is somewhere like Suye, a relatively rustic village on the southern island of Kyushu. It is not just a sense of 'place' that is under assault. The Japanese are taught that industrial success was inspired by a deep-rooted 'cultivator spirit' that makes them unique. The theory is that Japanese work together harmoniously in an electronics company because they have a shared tradition of planting and harvesting rice. Westerners, however, are said to be hunter-gatherers - they eat what they kill, and their companies are just as selfish and compulsive. The cultivator theme is played over and over in the classroom, and is echoed during negotiations when Japan defends its rice market against imports. Appealing as the theme might be to older Japanese, it bewilders the urban young, whose only links to the land are sentimental descriptions in a textbook. For Japan, the last rice crop of Sato in Suye village is another disturbing symbol of a creeping identity crisis that no one wants to confront. Suye was visited in the mid-1930s by a meticulous US sociologist, John Embree*, who found a remote, content community gradually being co-opted by a powerful central bureaucracy. At the time, Japan was preparing for war, and once isolated Suye suddenly became a sub-branch of the Patriotic Youth Association, the Farmer's Co-operative, and the Women's Patriotic Association, all strongly nationalistic. The villagers, ironic and warm, accepted the changes as inevitable, and went on cultivating their fields. The folk of Suye are still ironic and warm. They, more than the urban dwellers who romanticise them, have a clear view of the altered cultural landscape and of the need to redefine what it is to be Japanese. When Sato, surrounded by withered rice stumps, contemplated the fate of the ground, he smiled a wry smile: 'I don't suppose it matters. Modern Japanese can't tell the difference between good rice and bad rice. You could give them quality like Bright Sun and they wouldn't appreciate its worth.' Sato is one of the last true cultivators, who comprise about three per cent of the population. Farm machinery has undermined the old communal cause of planting, harvesting and celebration of the harvesting. Even in the rural heartland of Suye, only a third of the 1,620 villagers work in primary industry. The rest toil in factories, offices or shops, perhaps at the towns of Menda or Takagi, now 10 minutes by car, but, traditionally, a long walk only rarely worth making. Suye village is still remote from the political scandal and financial market turmoil of Tokyo. There is one restaurant, a Shinto shrine, a few vending machines, an all-purpose convenience store, a couple of car repair shops, and a factory, KM Clothing, with 100 staff, the largest employer. The only policeman is based in the neighbouring village of Fukada, and his greatest concern is traffic accidents, which have risen with the vinyl greenhouses - in the old days, drivers had clear vision across empty fields, and they still drive as though they do. Television has diluted the local dialect by forcing standard Japanese, Tokyo talk, into local living rooms. And it has encouraged the village to contemplate the outside world, though Japanese programmes tend to reinforce cultural differences rather than explore common characteristics. Foreign workers have arrived recently in the nearby towns: women from Thailand in the bars and hostess clubs, construction workers from China, and exchange students from privileged Western backgrounds. In the face of change, Masatsugu Saiki puts extra emphasis on honouring the past. He runs a dairy farm with 32 cattle, and grows rice on the side. Fading photographs of his grandfather and mother are displayed alongside a row of Buddhist prayer cards politely requesting abundant harvests and good health. Each day, Saiki pays homage to his ancestors, whose spirits are encased in an an ornate wooden shrine, a butsudan, in a matted room near the entrance to his home. 'There is a lot more competition these days. We are competing with each other. The spirit of the area has changed. There are people that we don't know around here. In the past we knew everyone.' Buddhist prayer cards aside, Saiki is no mystic. He and his wife, Kumi, are in the cowshed by 5.30 most mornings. If, by chance, they oversleep, a Beethoven recording would wake them. Each morning at 6, 'Fur Elise' echoes across the paddy fields through a loudspeaker system run by the village office. At lunchtime, Schubert reminds them to eat, and at five in winter, six in summer, the local children are alerted to return home by the strains of Yuyake Koyake, a folk song about the setting sun and the blackbirds. There is a deep love of the loudspeaker in Japan. Right-wingers use them to condemn Chinese communists and corrupt Tokyo politicians. Suye village has a loudspeaker car broadcasting traffic safety messages. In a nearby town, a loudspeaker van delivered a message about a public lawyer's imminent visit to counsel folk on legal disputes - in between the spoken messages, the van played 'The Lord is My Shepherd'. Apart from the private ancestor worship and the hymns used for advertising, religion is not much seen or heard, though a deep faith is part of the romanticised rural personality. The local shrine is overgrown - one afternoon, a worshipper had placed a handful of rice and a glass of sake as offerings to the gods. The shared spiritual experiences are supporting the local high school in a national baseball tournament, and watching the most popular gaudy gameshows, which lack the historical texture of the silent black-and-white photographs in most homes. The faded black-and-white photograph behind Kazumi Hirata is of him in uniform. Sitting upright, proud but not arrogant, the 78-year-old told of his war years in China and Taiwan. He followed the Yangtze River from Shanghai to Wuhan in central China during the early days of the 1937 war. It is clear that he respects China, and he cursed gently when he could not rouse his memory to produce a few sentences of the Chinese language. On returning to Suye after the war, Hirata worked in the village office for 26 years, guiding the region through starvation to relative prosperity and on to an era in which the country is reluctant to recognise its new self. His family runs a small convenience store, and it is the word 'convenience' that most strikes Hirata about modern Japan. 'It is easier. It is convenient and that's important. I don't know what really what else to say. It was too hard in the past. Too much hardship.' He has thought about the past a lot, but is too dignified to force opinions on a visitor. The present amuses him. Political scandals make him smile gently. He appears to have spent his retirement sagely contemplating the financial farce of the late 1980s and the inevitable 'bubble' burst. For the convenience store, 'our sales went up a little bit during the bubble years, and they are now down a bit'. For most of the village, the economy was up a bit and down a bit. The man most affected is Mitsunobu Nonaka. He runs KM Clothing, with one sewing factory in Suye and three elsewhere. His troubles are not bubble-related, but from rapid economic growth in neighbouring countries: 'Three or four years ago, there was no real threat from China because their products were cheap, but of a much lower quality. Now they are using Japanese technology, their workers are more skilled and the quality is high, but the labour cost is about an eighth of ours." On display in the KM factory, surrounded by rice paddys, is a small trophy won by Nonaka's workers in a beach volleyball tournament. 'Well, it was beach volley-ball, but it was played in a hall.' He was the team's coach and has a reputation as a thoroughly modern manager, but the time will come when he has to lay-off the volley-ball players. Other factories in the region have already started firing: 'We have always been one or two workers short. That has changed. From September we started to get calls from people who had lost jobs at other factories. We can't help them.' Nonaka is one of the U-turn generation. Educated in Tokyo, and a former employee of the Tokyo railway and property group, he came back for family reasons. The village elders are attempting to lure back more of his kind, but the attractions of big city life are more in demand than Suye-style solitude, and the sun-tanned, stylish Nonaka is a bit like the 'model worker' of China, lauded but not imitated. Suye people are generally modest in ambition, but they have noticed that the folk of neighbouring Fukuda village somehow seem to get a larger cut of the national budget each year. The reason is the influence of the legendary Maehara brothers, Dansho and Tetsunojo, one a mayor, the other a monk. Dansho, 72, studied in Tokyo and is said to have close contacts with the important ministries, construction and finance. Tetsunojo, 69, is well-known nationally in the Pure Land sect of Buddhism. The monk is a touch distant, wandering around the room preoccupied with his thoughts, while the mayor is definitely down to earth, discussing economic strategies and the benefits of tourism in Fukada. After settling for long enough to answer a question, Tetsunojo complained that 'new religions' and sects have come into fashion, confusing the young, who have reached a level of material comfort that makes them conscious of their spiritual poverty: 'What is the correct religion? That is the question in people's hearts'. The question is all the more pressing, he says, because the Japanese think of themselves as very spiritual, and yet corporate identity is stronger than religious awareness. In the past, spirituality came with the rural culture, but the end of communal work and play has left the Japanese isolated from their traditions and from other villagers. He uses the word 'villager' to mean all Japanese, and not a small village in the south. However, Dansho is more concerned by concerned by a different kind of loss. Young villagers are disappearing to work in Tokyo or Osaka, and he reckons that the village's population will fall to 1,750 by 2000, down from 3,113 in 1955 and 2,133 in 1990. He is trying to make Fukada livelier and wealthier. He is encouraging farmers to grow tobacco, and has apparently struck up a useful relationship with Japan Tobacco, the Tokyo-based cigarette monopoly. 'You want to know why they do so well at Fukada? Dansho went to Tokyo University.' There was no malice in the comment. Noriaki Tayama does not appear capable of malice. He runs the Body Shop, a car repair and sale yard in Suye, and has leased out a small plot of land used for rice cultivation. Recession means that the Body Shop does more repairs, sells fewer cars, and has more salesman dropping by looking for 'hot' customers: 'I used to ring the car companies and say Mr So and So wants a car, send a salesman. Now the salesmen come to me, about three a week, wanting to know about hot customers, anyone about to get their licence, anyone with a sick, old car.' Noriaki and his wife, Kazuko, have just come back from their first international experience, a group tour to Hawaii with car repairers from around Japan. They were impressed by the idyllic beauty of the tropical landscape as the aircraft made its approach to the runway, and they boarded the tour bus with a pleasant sense of anticipation. Then, said Noriaki, the tour guide began her spiel: 'She said the streets are dangerous and we should be careful not to wander off the main roads. We should be extra careful at night and keep an eye on our possessions. She said a lot of people have Aids. We got to the hotel, and the walls were so thin we could hear the people in the next room. They could hear us, we thought, so we had to whisper.' After the pleasures of a week in Hawaii, returning to Suye village was a relief because 'Japanese food is cheaper in Japan'. But, the inconveniences of tour groups aside, Noriaki and Kazuko were comfortable with the cultural journey. Their impressions, delivered with a self-effacing humour, were not those of the mythical cultivator intimidated by a hunter-gatherer society, but more those of Japanese speakers limited by their language in an English environment. In their own understated way, the Body Shop proprietors have come to terms with the outside world, while the official keepers of Japanese culture are determined to perpetuate the confusing myths of rural uniqueness. As Noriaki Tayama explained: 'The village is not what it used to be, and we are not what we used to be, but we are still part of Suye, we are Suye people.' John F.

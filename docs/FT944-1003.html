			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank funds buy with Pounds 17m rights issue Walker Greenbank, the wallcoverings and fabrics group, is raising Pounds 16.8m through a 1-for-5 rights issue to finance the acquisition of Warner Fabrics and to fund capital expenditure plans. The acquired business, which specialises in the design and sale of high quality furnishing fabrics, was bought from Collins &amp; Aikman of the US for Pounds 4.45m cash, including repayment of a Pounds 2.58m inter-company loan. The rights issue, priced at 90p a share against yesterday's level of 109p, up 1 1/2 p on the day, will also clear Warner's outstanding bank debt of Pounds 2m. Mr Charles Wightam, chief executive, described the acquisition as one of the 'sweetest deals' Walker Greenbank had done. He said it would 'fit perfectly with our existing consumer operations, particularly Zoffany,' the wallpaper and fabrics supplier. Warner suffered an operating loss of Pounds 49,000 in 1993, on sales of Pounds 8.27m. This year it is expected to break even. Mr Wightam maintained that through Walker's sales and distribution network and an improved design strategy, profits could be increased considerably. Warner has a 125 year-old archive of fabric designs. Mr Wightam said: 'This treasure trove will be a unique source of designs for us over the next 50 years.' The remaining Pounds 10m from the rights issue, underwritten by SG Warburg, would be spent mainly on a Pounds 9.4m distribution and office complex for Muraspec, the group's marketing and distribution division for Europe based in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.94m (Pounds 7.08m) were forecast for the year to January 31, including Pounds 26,000 from a property disposal. The expected final dividend of 2.3p (2.1p) would give a total of 3.6p (3.3p).</p>

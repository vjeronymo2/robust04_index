			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (18): Awash with cash again - US / Richard Waters on the wave of new investment The US buy-out industry is awash with cash again. Back in the late 1980s, the Dollars 8bn-10bn a year that flowed into private buy-out partnerships provided the springboard for some of the decade's biggest acquisitions: by using debt to gear up their equity tenfold in some cases, the LBO funds became a power in the land. Today, leveraged acquisitions may not be as leveraged as they were (a recipe of three or four parts debt to one part equity is more the norm). But the equity base of the buy-out industry is getting back to the levels of the 1980s. After Dollars 7.2bn in 1993, acquisition funds raised Dollars 5.7bn in the first half of this year, according to Private Equity Analyst, a newsletter based in Wellesley, Mass. The tide of cash seems well on its way to matching record levels. This wave of new investment in the buy-out industry is being driven by supply, not demand. While the opportunities for large-scale deals are still relatively few and far between, there is no shortage of institutions looking to back them. In the main, the suppliers of cash to private equity partnerships have been US pension funds, lured by the chance to make investment returns well in excess of those available in public markets. Over the past two decades, leveraged buy-out funds are estimated on average to have made compound annual returns for their investors of some 25 per cent (after management fees.) Those fund sponsors who came through the upheavals of the 1980s and early 1990s with their records (and reputations) intact are well placed to benefit now. Investment returns in the future are unlikely to be as high, though. The lower levels of leverage reduce both the financial risks and rewards of buy-outs. The demand side of the equation has yet to match the supply. Several big-name sponsors who put together new investment partnerships last year have yet to put any of the money to work. In part, that has been due to the high level of activity in the public equity markets. With the stock market putting a historically high valuation on many companies, anyone looking to dispose of a business has tended to do so either through the initial public offering (IPO) market, or by selling to another company which can issue equity at a high earnings multiple to pay for the acquisition. Those big buy-outs that have been done this year have tended to involve the sale by large corporations of businesses they no longer consider to be central to their operations. Often, these companies are also looking to raise cash. One of the most active buy-out funds recently, New York-based Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, has rung up a list of such transactions, buying businesses from ailing corporate giants like General Motors and Westinghouse Electric. 'We concentrate on buying properties from corporations,' says Richard Braddock, a Clayton Dubilier partner and former president of Citicorp. Competition for these deals does not come from the public equity markets, he says: 'The people we find ourselves in competition with are corporate buyers.' This year's small handful of Dollars 1bn-plus deals have followed this pattern, including the sale by General Motors of its car rental business and the disposal by Kmart of PayLess, a drugs store chain. Jonathan Sockaloff, a general partner of Leonard Green &amp; Partners, the Los Angeles-based buy-out firm which handled the PayLess deal, says: 'It was a classic case of a large company having to concentrate on its core business, and having to raise cash through the sale of non-core businesses.' There are several reasons to expect the level of buy-out activity to rebound further in the coming months. For a start, higher US interest rates are likely to help the buy-out market more than hinder it. They help by taking the shine off the public equity markets, reducing the options available for selling a company: the IPO market has wound down as interest rates have ratcheted up. As yet, though, equity prices have not dropped to the sort of bargain levels that tempt buy-out funds back into the market in force. Says Mr Braddock: 'The prices today are still generally quite high.' Higher rates also hinder deals, of course, by raising the cost of borrowing. But the lower levels of leverage make this less of a problem  - and most buy-outs are tested against higher interest rate assumptions (though a much bigger spike in rates than has yet been seen would pose more of a challenge). 'You have to adjust the interest rate structure to the reality of the interest rate market you are in,' says Mr Sockaloff. 'We can achieve our required rates of return in this interest rate environment, or even a higher interest rate environment,' Mr Sockaloff continues. Another reason to expect a rebound in buy-outs is simply the amount of cash available. With the war chests full, there is an army of deal sponsors scouting for transactions. There is also plenty of debt finance available to back these deals. Commercial banks, which largely abandoned leveraged deals in the early 1990s, are back in force, seeing this as one of the most profitable areas in which to put their excess capital to use. The bank debt has in part plugged the gap left by a scarcity of high-yield (or junk) bond finance. Last year, high-yield mutual funds provided the bond market with ample funds to back acqui-sitions. Now, personal investors' mistrust of bond funds generally has carried over into the high yield area, halting the flow of new cash. As the late 1980s demonstrated, when there is cash available, the deals follow. Whether that means that buy-outs will again become as big, leveraged and aggressive remains to be seen.</p>

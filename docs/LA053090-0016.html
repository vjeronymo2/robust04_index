			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> After allegedly robbing an East San Diego home, a 35-year-old man stuck his  handgun in his waistband and inadvertently shot himself in the groin, San Diego  police said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Juan Manuel Guillen and two alleged accomplices were arrested by San Diego  police after a robbery was reported in a home on South Bancroft Street.  </P> <P> Armed with knives and a .22-caliber handgun, the three men forced their way  into a home and demanded drugs and money, Sgt. Fred England said.  </P> <P> They fled in a brown car, taking a television and cable television box, England  said.  </P> <P> The shooting victim apparently shoved the handgun into his waistband, where it  accidentally discharged, England said. Guillen, wounded in the testicles, made  no mention of his injury when the three men were apprehended by police. But a  detective noticed the blood on Guillem's pants before he began questioning him,  England said.  </P> <P> Guillem was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he underwent surgery, a  hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Jose Valencia, 25, and Javier Hernandez, 25, were arrested and charged with  robbery and burglary in connection with the incident. Guillem will be jailed  when he is released from the hospital, England said.  </P></p>

The "100-Scientist Program" will adopt public recruitment  with the aim of selecting about 100 outstanding young scientists  all over the country.    Scientists under 45 years old can apply to join the program.  They are expected to become leading members of major research  projects in the next century.    It is said that 10 to 15 such scientists will be selected  each year for the program.    CAS will apply preferential treatment in research  expenditure, housing and salaries for the program members.    A special leading group for the program has been set up at  CAS.    The members working in state key research centers and  laboratories will be selected from those conducting research  into new sciences, multi-disciplinary sciences, frontier  sciences and key projects.    In recent years CAS has carried out a series of training  programs for young scientists. Now some 56 percent of  scientists at the academy are under 45. And senior researchers  under 45 accounted for ten percent of CAS's total.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Hammerson The brightest gloss that can be placed on Hammerson's dismal results is that the property cycle is probably approaching its nadir. The company's net asset value and earnings per share have now fallen below those of a decade ago. Despite continuing weakness in international property markets, it is hard to see Hammerson slipping much further from here. The stock market certainly called the turn for the sector following Black Wednesday. The question is how soon growth can be resumed. On this score, the rise in Hammerson's gearing from 78 per cent to 114 per cent is unnerving. The 51 per cent fall in earnings per share meant that even the cut dividend was barely covered. Like several other property companies, Hammerson is relying on sales of high-yielding assets to fund its pay-out. Last year, Hammerson realised Pounds 188m from disposals; more than Pounds 100m is promised this year too. The trouble is this only worsens Hammerson's operating cash flow, making it hard to spruce up properties and, eventually, replace its portfolio. A rights issue is the obvious route out of the dilemma. While the new directors prepare their case, Hammerson will be vulnerable should the much-rumoured bid materialise - although shareholders cannot pray for anything approaching Rodamco's offer of almost Pounds 10 per share just four years ago. Takeover talk, though, would help support the share price, and it might even enable Hammerson to get the issue away at a less painful discount.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,  said here today that China and Tajikistan should become good  neighbors on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Qiao made these remarks at a meeting with a delegation led  by  A.S. Dostiev, the first vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  Tajikistan [name and title as received], at the Great Hall of  the People here this afternoon.    Dostiev agreed with Qiao's view, adding that Tajikistan and  China have shared a peaceful border. "It is our hope that this  will become a border of friendly cooperation between the two  countries."    Qiao expressed the hope that the two countries will increase  their contacts and understanding and boost cooperation in the  fields of economy and culture.    He noted that Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing  Committee, held very good talks with Dostiev, which will be  conducive to promoting mutual understanding and friendship and  provide the delegation with more information about China.    The two legislative departments' close contacts and exchange  of experience will play a positive role in pushing forward  bilateral ties, Qiao said.    He said he was very pleased that now Tajikistan's domestic  environment is stable, and that he was sure that the country  will move ahead continuously.    "China will be Tajikistan's good cooperating partner in the  process of its development," he added.    Dostiev expressed his appreciation for China's pursuit of  the  five principles of peaceful co-existence in handling  state-to-state relations.    As Tajikistan is a newly-independent country, he said it  should learn from experience of other countries including China  in both economic and legislative construction.    Buhe, vice-chairman of the Chinese NPC Standing Committee,  was present at the meeting.</p>

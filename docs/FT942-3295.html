			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: AFG tumbles to Pounds 21.2m loss after restructuring Automotive and Financial Group, one of the leading UK motor dealer groups and which is controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, tumbled to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.2m last year compared with profits of Pounds 3.76m. Turnover in the 12 months to end-July 1993 fell by 25 per cent to Pounds 330.7m (Pounds 438.8m), as the company was forced to undertake a substantial restructuring in response to the loss of the Nissan importer/distributor franchise by its sister company Nissan UK in 1991. AFG's 180 dealerships, which all previously sold Nissan vehicles, have been cut back to a network of 78 outlets, while the company's workforce has been reduced from 3,153 to 2,120, according to the latest annual report. The company has been turned into a multi-franchise dealer group operating for several leading carmakers including Citroen, Peugeot, Fiat, Honda, Renault, Vauxhall, Rover and Volkswagen/Audi. It is currently ranked 11th by turnover among UK motor dealer groups, according to the latest listing of the top 100 car retailers by Automotive Management magazine. AFG said in its annual report that it had succeeded in re-franchising 70 of the remaining 78 dealerships, but the costs of the restructuring had been high. 'We have only been able to take new franchises in markets where a manufacturer has previously had a very weak dealer or no dealer at all, and substantial investment in time and money will be required before the dealerships can trade profitably.' Five of the former seven-man board of AFG resigned in the 14 months to October last year. Three new directors have been appointed including Mr Botnar and his secretary, Ms Dawn Lawson. The Pounds 21.2m pre-tax loss was reduced to a net loss of Pounds 9.6m thanks to a tax credit of Pounds 11.7m, described as 'group relief receivable'. Current assets in the balance sheet include some Pounds 11m of corporation tax said to be recoverable as a 'group relief receivable from fellow subsidiary undertakings'. The heavy loss in the AFG motor dealer operations was offset by a pre-tax profit of Pounds 27.8m achieved by the finance division, Automotive Financial Services, and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6m from the group's property division. As part of the retrenchment being undertaken by AFGH, its parent company, the volume of new business being taken on by the finance subsidiary is being reduced, with a concentration on business introduced by AFG dealers rather than the provision of instalment credit to consumers and businesses in other sectors. As part of the group restructuring, AFGH has also sold Automotive Leasing, its contract hire subsidiary, and has ceased trading in Automotive and Industrial Machinery, its fork lift truck distribution subsidiary. Partslink, the group's automotive parts import and distribution subsidiary, suffered a trading loss last year and operations have now been concentrated on wholesale distribution.</p>

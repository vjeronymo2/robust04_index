			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TAKING PAGE FROM CAPISTRANO, COLLEGE IS NOW FOR BIRDS  </P> <P> About 800 cliff swallows returning from South America to roost at College of  the Canyons got a royal welcome Saturday from a community that once tried to  drive them off with gooey repellents, sonic beepers and high-powered water  hoses.  </P> <P> Now their presence is regarded as a feather in the cap of the school, although  sidewalks, windows, building facades -- and passers-by -- are still fair game  for their droppings.  </P> <P> "They're beautiful birds, and we've decided to make the most of them," said  Dianne Van Hook, the college's president. "It's very special that they come  here."  </P> <P> Van Hook was a victim of a passing swallow during her first day on campus in  July, she said. Her tan suit had to be dry-cleaned, but the incident did not  turn her against the birds, she said.  </P> <P> Instead, the swallows are now viewed as an asset to the otherwise nondescript  community college, just as they are to Mission San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Welcoming Ceremony  </P> <P> On Saturday, about 200 people attended what officials hope will become an  annual event to welcome the birds, which form colonies and make their nests in  groups of hundreds along the ledges of concrete campus buildings. They will lay  their eggs and tend their young until August, when they begin the 6,000-mile  return to South America.  </P> <P> While ornithology professors gave tours of the bird colony, members of the  campus biology club did brisk business selling T-shirts emblazoned with  pictures of the swallows and the logo, "Even Swallows Come Home to Valencia."  Proceeds from the sales will help fund a three-year research project to study  the birds' nesting behavior, migration, mating rituals and social behavior.  </P> <P> Biology instructor Betty Rose said researchers hope to publish the results of  studies as early as next year.  </P> <P> A Yale University professor and his wife have been researching cliff swallows  for nearly a decade, studying such subjects as what factors cause animals to  form colonies, she said.  </P> <P> "It's a great educational experience, but you need an umbrella to protect you  from the guano," said Gale Hutchins, a biology student who spent last summer  observing the birds and helping to band them for identification.  </P> <P> College officials did not always regard the birds so kindly. For 12 years, they  tried devices such as beepers, stuffed owls and chemical repellents to  discourage the birds from building their nests, which resemble mud igloos. One  season they even used high-powered water hoses to wash down the nests every day  in an effort to drive the birds away.  </P> <P> None of the methods worked well, and some were lethal to the birds, which are  protected by federal law. In 1985, the president of the college had to pay a  $500 federal fine after 12 birds died when their wings became glued together  with a substance that had been spread on building ledges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $600 Window  </P> <P> In 1986, the school put 2-by-10-foot panels of nylon parachute cloth along the  eaves, hoping that panels flapping in the wind would force the birds to go  elsewhere to build nests. When a bird got tangled in the fabric, maintenance  workers had to break a $600 window to save the bird.  </P> <P> In 1987, officials decided to leave the birds alone and start the research  project, Rose said.  </P> <P> "Finally, we're proud of them," Rose said.  </P> <P> So proud, in fact, that flyers promoting Saturday's event included a poem  written specially for the swallows by Dan Jacobs, a biology student at the  school:  </P> <P>  "I think that I  </P> <P>  Shall never see  </P> <P>  More beauty --  </P> <P>  Than, in the swallows -- at C.O.C."  </P> <P> </P></p>

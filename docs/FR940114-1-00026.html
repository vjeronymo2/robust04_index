			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 3_Motorcycle Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The elements of the present Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 address the following safety issues: (1) Preventing or reducing the severity of head injuries; (2) determining whether novice motorcyclists have the basic skills; and (3) assuring that the vehicles have minimum safety equipment and are adequately maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed new Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 continues to emphasize the importance of motorcyclists wearing helmets and places great emphasis on improving the knowledge and skills of all motorcycle operators through motorcycle rider education and training programs. The guideline also strongly encourages states and communities to develop comprehensive motorcycle safety programs that address (1) the effective management of the program through a central or lead agency; (2) the requirement for special licensing exams; (3) the influence of alcohol and other drugs on motorcyclists; and (4) the issues of motorcycle conspicuity and motorist awareness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 8_Alcohol in Relation to Highway Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current Guideline No. 8 contains the elements which provide the basic structure underlying the drinking and driving laws of the states. These include the use of chemical tests, the establishment of a BAC value (.10%) which is presumptive evidence of intoxication and the enactment of laws establishing the ``implied consent'' of a motorist to submit to a chemical test. The other components of the current guideline relate to the collection of data on alcohol-related fatalities, and the specifications and qualifications of chemical testing equipment and personnel administering the tests. The primary effort of the guideline was to establish some reasonable conformity with a uniform legal basis for detecting and prosecuting drunk drivers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current guideline, the States follow a ``specific deterrence'' approach designed to remove from the road those who had been arrested for DWI. However, the majority of alcohol-related crashes involve drivers with no previous DWI arrest; moreover, the majority of intoxicated drivers on the road go undetected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Guideline No. 8, entitled ``Impaired Driving'', reflects a comprehensive, community-based approach with goals of (1) preventing people from being killed and injured in the short-term through general deterrence programs, and (2) permanently reducing the number of drinking and drugged drivers through long-term prevention and intervention measures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the general deterrence approach, the objective is to increase the perceived risk by the drinking driver that he or she will be caught and convicted of DWI. The proposed guideline recommends states establish a BAC value of .08% as the illegal per se level, at or above which a drive is considered to be driving while intoxicated; implement specific countermeasures designed to better equip and train police officers in recognizing, tracking, and arresting impaired drivers; enable prompt suspension of drivers licenses through streamlined administrative procedures; result in punitive action such as fines, community service, jail or the suspension of driving privileges; and ensure the public is fully aware of the increased enforcement efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the ``prevention and intervention'' approach, the guideline recommends strategies which are aimed at permanently changing the public's attitudes and behaviors concerning drinking and driving. These include public information and education for students in schools and colleges, for adults through programs in the workplace and for the general population through programs in health care settings. Other education efforts include promotion of designated driver programs, responsible alcohol service efforts, citizen support and outreach efforts, and the establishment of self-sufficient programs requiring offenders to defray program costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States should also be aware of and enforce alcohol and drug requirements for CMV drivers. The FHWA established a BAC level of .04 percent as the threshold at which a CMV driver is considered to be under the influence of alcohol and subject to disqualification from driving ranging from one year to life. In addition, a CMV driver found to have any measurable or detectable alcohol level in his or her system while operating a CMV is prohibited from driving for 24 hours. FHWA also requires motor carriers to have specific drug testing programs of CMV drivers in place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

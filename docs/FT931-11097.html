			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: 'La Musica' - a French 'Private Lives' / Theatre They loved each other once, but they couldn't bear being married to each other. Now that each of them is about to re-marry, they realise that they are still in love. We have come across this situation before - in drama as well as in real life, I mean. Noel Coward made it a classic comedy of it in Private Lives. Broadway and (especially) Hollywood made a whole genre from it: see The Philadelphia Story et al. La Musica is Marguerite Duras's version. It is very French, very dejected, very plotless, and pretty damned dull. From the first re-meeting, comparisons between Private Lives and La Musica are inevitable. Like Elyot and Amanda, Michel and Anne-Marie try to avoid for a long time the shocking fact that they are still attracted to each other. They quickly point out when they must leave, they are politely considerate about each other's plans, they make discreet enquiries about the other one's intended, and then they start to reveal how much heartbreak they have been through. Certain details make Michel and Anne-Marie the more believable couple. Anne-Marie wanted a child; both of them were consumed by jealousy; at one time he came near to murdering her, at another she close to suicide. But these details are few and far between. What consumes both Anne-Marie and Michel is ennui. Early on, when talking guardedly about the once-in-a-lifetime hell of love, she says 'If it does happen again, it's perhaps because one hasn't found another way of . . .' She pauses, and he helps her out: '. . . of dealing with the . . . the weariness?' 'Yes,' she says. Later, his new mate rings up and asks how things are going. He replies, almost casually, 'We're in the hotel lounge. We're both in despair.' How to get through the rest of their lives? This is what preoccupies them. And La Musica is more successful as an expression of French worldweariness than as an examination of a broken marriage. True, you could say something similar about Private Lives  - that it is more truly an expression of English frivolity than it is about a couple who can't live together or apart. But Private Lives creates its own world and makes it tick. La Musica does not have the energy or the nervous system to be a play  - it is too sophisticated. It is full of post-Chekhovian non-sequiturs, post-Proustian reminiscences of obsessive jealousy, and post-Maeterlinckian symbolism ('Come into the light') that serves no purpose. Joseph Blatchley, directing, has paced the dialogue to near-perfection, but both Harriet Walter and Larry Lamb, excellent actors, are miscast here. It is not that they sound or look too English  - far from it. But her nervous intensity is too up-front; and he is too obviously sensitive and passive. Both of them lack the degree of mystery, cool and self-possession that would give more tension to what Duras leaves unspoken. (English actors can achieve this; my mind goes to Nicola Pagett and Jonathan Hyde in Anouilh's The Rehearsal two years back.) The triumph of the production is Geraldine Pilgrim's set, a hotel foyer with doors and stairs leading who knows where. Nothing ever happens in this grand hotel, but it is in a haunting shade of green, with mysterious smoke in the air  - and overgrown branches beyond the windows.

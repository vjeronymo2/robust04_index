			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (1): Time to grasp the nettle - Mr Gonzalez must soon decide whether or not to take the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.  Peter Bruce examines the alternatives If Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, found earlier this month that winning Spain's closest-ever election was difficult, then winning the battle he now faces against recession may be the end of him. It is time to make some awkward choices. The one that matters most is whether or not to take the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Getting out would take some of the pressure off him to make very rapid economic and political decisions in order to anchor his government - now short of parliamentary majority - in place. But it also means throwing out of the window the European dream for which Mr Gonzalez has struggled hard for most of his 11 years in office. To remain in the ERM carries with it an air of determination and confidence but, claim many analysts, also an air of unreality. Can Spain really begin economic recovery with its real interest rates still among the highest in the EC and adopt a promised programme of labour market reform - to make it easier to sack people - while unemployment is rising, and still stay inside the ERM? The peseta may have been devalued three times in the past nine months, but it still makes Spanish industry relatively uncompetitive. If Mr Gonzalez does not take it out of the ERM, then he may find the markets will try to do it for him. One way this might be avoided is by quickly forming a credibly stable coalition government which immediately announces sharp spending cuts in the 1994 budget, and instituting negotiations with unions and employers on a wages pact and on removing hiring and firing barriers in the labour market. But even forming a government is fraught with booby traps. Mr Gonzalez' socialists have 159 seats in the 350-seat parliament, giving him four broad options: A minority government which would make deals with whatever forces were necessary to pass specific legislation; A minority government in which he would try to make a four-year deal with the Catalan CiU (17 seats) and possibly the Basque PNV (six seats) to support him but not actually to join the government; A formal coalition with the CiU, which would give him a parliamentary majority and, perhaps, with the PNV, whose seats would make the team unassailable; A formal coalition with the communist-led United Left (IU), whose 19 seats would also guarantee a parliamentary majority. The two minority options could not in any way be guaranteed to hold for long. Mr Gonzalez is a superb political manipulator but he is not a magician and the degree of fiscal brutality required of this new government will not allow him to skip happily from party to party for support. And there is no reason to believe that even if the CiU were to make a long-term pact to support the socialists (in return, no doubt, for the transfer to Catalonia of more political power) that they could stick to it. The CiU is a divided, opportunist party. Any union with the IU would have to be seen as a radical shift to the left by a socialist prime minister who has spent 11 years in government trying to do exactly the opposite. There may be people in the socialist party who would be comfortable with the IU but Mr Gonzalez is not one of them. He has said he will only do business with parties committed to the terms of the Maastricht treaty on European economic and political unity, which the IU opposes. He has to find someone willing to assume the risks of government with him - and the Catalans entering government would be the most secure and credible of all the possible permutations. Mr Gonzalez would also be more comfortable with the CiU than any other party. But the CiU is a merger of two parties and a dozen political ideas. From his perch as Catalonia's premier, Mr Jordi Pujol, the CiU leader, regularly shrieks at Madrid for its policy failures. But does he have the vision to help run the country and not just his own backyard? The world may be about to find out that, while the Catalans deserve their reputation as model small businessmen - careful with their money and serious about debt - they can also be politically provincial and small-minded. Spain's bankers, their balance sheets battered by bad loans provisions as the recession takes its toll, pray for Mr Pujol to sign up. He, however, has one small problem. What if he joins a national government and it fails to stem job losses and corporate failures? He would pay for it at the next regional election in Catalonia. He quite reasonably suspects that the left wing of the socialist party will try everything in its power to prevent Mr Gonzalez implementing the serious labour market reforms and budget cuts necessary to help the country out of recession. The socialist left has successfully paralysed fiscal restraint in the past four years and Mr Gonzalez has yet to demonstrate he is both willing and able to force his will upon his own party. What needs to be done once a government is formed is also more or less clear. First, wage inflation (wages are rising at about 7 per cent this year) must be brought under control. To do this, Mr Gonzalez needs a social pact - a glorified wages agreement - between government, unions and employers. Each act in this drama will be costly. To get the unions to the table, he has to get a strike law through the new parliament or at least defend it in the form it was before the election was called. Employers hate this draft law because it gives pickets wide powers of molestation, the socialist party having dramatically watered down an earlier tough version drafted by the government. But employers are chasing bigger fish - the right to hire and fire more cheaply and more rapidly - and the prospect of landing them will also bring the bosses to the negotiating table. Unions might consider such reform if employers and government pump more money into training. Analysts say they want these talks to begin soon and that they will be watching for fudges. Without a profound reform of the labour market, it is assumed Spain cannot begin growing again soon. Second, the 1994 budget will have to cut back sharply on public spending. Until now the government has identified its central fiscal problem as a lack of control over budget deficits. This time, with GDP having fallen by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter and unemployment at a record 21.7 per cent, the planned deficits in nominal and real terms will come under pressure. Also, the budget will have to be brought in on time, at the end of September, giving the government no prospect of a quiet August holiday. Punishment for delay or failure on any of these fronts is possible expulsion of the peseta from the ERM as speculators bet again on the economy not being as strong as the currency. Mr Gonzalez may be forced to anticipate such an outcome by taking the peseta out of the ERM. He would need to rationalise such a move as being in the best interests of his country - the same reasons as he gave for entering the system in the first place. The peseta would probably drift gently down to around Pta85 to the D-Mark (its central parity is Pta79.1 to the German currency now) and stabilise if reasonably strict fiscal policies were put in place, although the time pressure would not be so telling. Interest rates could fall again. Leaving the ERM need not change Spain and it would only slow, not alter, Mr Gonzalez' s European ambitions. It would be far worse for him if the markets removed the peseta from the system. But lower interest rates would encourage investment and it would be easier to sell labour market reform to the unions in a climate in which employers were hiring again. The danger of leaving the ERM is that Spain, with the pressure to perform off, would go to sleep. With the currency competitive, businesses might not put off measures needed to improve overall competitiveness. With low interest rates, Spaniards might feel less incentive to save. But Mr Gonzalez does not change his mind easily. The betting must be that he will try to hold the peseta inside the ERM and that he will genuinely try to put together the policies to help keep it there. But this time he needs Mr Pujol on the barricades with him.</p>

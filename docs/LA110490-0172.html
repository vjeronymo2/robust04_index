			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOP HOUSE CANDIDATE OUTSPENDS RIVAL 19-1;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN: DANA ROHRABACHER HAS SWAMPED CHALLENGER GUY C. KIMBROUGH IN  FUND-RAISING AND SPENDING. OTHER REPUBLICANS SEEM TO HAVE SIMILAR FINANCIAL  POWER.  </P> <P> In what arguably is the hottest of Orange County's congressional races,  incumbent Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach) is outspending his Democratic  opponent by a margin of 19 to 1, campaign records show.  </P> <P> Between Jan. 1, 1989, and Oct. 17, 1990, Rohrabacher raised $366,982 and spent  $288,325, compared to $13,844 and $14,901, respectively, for Democratic  challenger Guy C. Kimbrough. A college professor, Kimbrough began raising money  earlier this year for his rematch with Rohrabacher in the 42nd Congressional  District.  </P> <P> At the same time, an independent fund-raising group that is seeking to unseat  Rohrabacher said it has raised only $8,000 to $9,000, which it intends to use  to pay for a series of anti-Rohrabacher advertisements airing on cable  television.  </P> <P> On Friday, Rohrabacher filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election  Commission because the group, the Southern California Coalition for Responsible  Government, had not yet filed financial reports required by federal law. A  spokesman for the organization said it would move quickly to correct any  problem.  </P> <P> Despite the lopsided fund-raising and spending totals, the  Rohrabacher-Kimbrough race has attracted the most interest in Orange County  because of the national attention Rohrabacher received when he launched an  attack on purportedly pornographic and sacrilegious artwork funded by the  National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> In other Orange County congressional races, the only challenger who has filed  an FEC report, required when a candidate raises more than $5,000, is Democrat  Eugene C. Gratz of Laguna Beach, who is challenging Rep. Christopher Cox  (R-Newport Beach) in the 40th Congressional District.  </P> <P> As of Sept. 30, Gratz had raised $31,754 and spent $21,150, according to his  most recent report to the FEC. Gratz said he has spent most of his money on  Democratic "party-building" activities, such as voter registration drives.  </P> <P> Cox, who has spent much of the 1990 election cycle raising money to pay off the  $334,298 debt from his 1988 campaign, collected $609,754 between Jan. 1, 1989,  and Oct. 17, 1990, and spent $508,158, including debt repayment. His  outstanding debt remains at $114,619.  </P> <P> Gratz, a real estate attorney, had $7,034 in the bank as of Sept. 30, while Cox  had $47,475 on hand on Oct. 17.  </P> <P> No financial statements were filed by the announced challengers to Reps.  William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) in the 39th District, which comprises  northeastern Orange County, Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) in the 43rd District,  which includes southern Orange County, and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in  the 38th District in north-central Orange County.  </P> <P> Barbara Jackson, Dornan's Democratic opponent, announced her withdrawal from  the campaign before the primary election, but her name remains on the Tuesday  ballot. Dannemeyer is running against Democrat Francis X. Hoffman of Garden  Grove, while Packard is opposed by Libertarian Richard L. Arnold and Peace and  Freedom candidate Doug Hansen.  </P> <P> A second Rohrabacher challenger, Libertarian Richard Gibb Martin, also is among  the challengers who did not file FEC finance reports.  </P> <P> The incumbents, however, have raised and spent significant amounts of money.  Dornan listed contributions of $1.4 million since Jan. 1, 1989, and  expenditures of $1.2 million, most of it on his direct-mail fund-raising  operation. Dornan reported no debts and $209,591 in the bank as of Sept. 30.  Dannemeyer has raised $393,693 and spent $313,939, largely on direct-mail  fund-raising. He reported no debt and $90,469 in the bank as of Oct. 17.  Packard has raised $97,387 and spent $56,060 by Oct. 17. He reported no debt  and cash on hand of $209,380.  </P> <P> In the 42nd District race, Kimbrough, chairman of the political science program  for the Mt. San Jacinto Community College District, lost to Rohrabacher in the  1988 general election by a margin of 34% to 65%.  </P> <P> In an interview earlier this week, Kimbrough said his spending will approach  $60,000 by Tuesday, including a $26,000 "in-kind" contribution of ready-made  television ads from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Not all of  the ads will be aired, however.  </P> <P> Kimbrough will use much of his money to air 30- and 60-second spots about 200  times on local cable television stations. The ads attack Rohrabacher for  supporting offshore oil drilling and favoring content restrictions on art  funded by the NEA. In addition to the cable TV ads, Kimbrough said he also is  sending out 43,000 campaign mail pieces over the weekend.  </P> <P> In one direct-mail piece sent by Rohrabacher, and in two others that are on  their way, the first-term congressman is pitching himself as a fiscal  conservative who fights wasteful government spending and strongly supports the  local aerospace industry.  </P> <P> The Southern California Coalition for Responsible Government, the  anti-Rohrabacher group organized largely because of the congressman's attempts  to impose content restrictions on NEA-funded art, is spending about $5,000 to  air cable television ads, said spokesman Michael Nash.  </P> <P> In a letter to the FEC released Friday, the Rohrabacher campaign asked for an  investigation of the coalition's failure to file required campaign finance  statements.  </P> <P> "They've been slinging a lot of arrows in my direction," Rohrabacher said in an  interview. "If they're going to get involved in the political system like that,  they should realize there are certain rules, both legal rules and ethical  rules, that they should be following."  </P> <P> "I hope that there's not a problem," responded Nash. "If there is, we will take  care of it. I think it's typical of the Rohrabacher campaign to try to distract  the voters with non-issues and technicalities, rather than to address the real  concerns of the district."  </P></p>

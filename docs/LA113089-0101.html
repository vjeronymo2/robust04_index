			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING ON PARKLAND AND STREET TAX  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has set a public hearing on a proposed  ballot measure to fund parklands and streets maintenance for Dec. 12 at 7:30  p.m.  </P> <P> The city is considering renewing the tax, which voters have approved by a  two-thirds margin since 1980. If the council agrees to renew the parcel tax, it  will be put on the April 10, 1990, city ballot.  </P> <P> The last tax was approved for a four-year period in 1986, when voters agreed to  pay $74 per parcel with a 4% increase per year. This year residents paid $84  per parcel.  </P> <P> Finance Director Bill Yeomans said he will probably propose at the public  hearing that residents pay $88 or $89 per parcel with a 5% annual increase.  </P> <P> The parcel tax pays 60% of the cost of maintaining streets and parklands,  Yeomans said after the meeting, with the balance coming from the city's General  Fund.  </P></p>

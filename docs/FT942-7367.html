			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Advance for Republicans in US poll Republican hopes for gains in the mid-term congressional elections in November were sharply lifted late on Tuesday when the party captured in Kentucky a House of Representatives seat that had voted Democratic for the last 129 years. In a special election caused by the death in March of Congressman William Natcher, Mr Ron Lewis, a fundamentalist Christian minister, defeated Mr Joe Prather, the Democratic candidate, by 55:45 per cent. The House now holds 256 Democrats, 178 Republicans and one independent (Mr Bernie Sanders of Vermont). Last month, the Republicans picked up another traditional Democratic seat, in Oklahoma, also a state bordering the south. With 11 incumbent Democrats in the region having announced retirement, and with more than 40 House seats to be vacated by incumbents of both parties nationwide, the prospects for further Republican gains in November seem clear, perhaps beyond the 25-seat advance hitherto considered realistic. Particular factors applied this week in Kentucky's second district, not least the absence of Mr Natcher, a fixture for the last 40 years who was often returned unopposed. Mr Natcher, a conservative Democrat by any standards, bucked the party trend evident in his own district in presidential elections. In 1992, President George Bush beat Mr Bill Clinton from neighbouring Arkansas in the district by 45:41 per cent (Mr Ross Perot, the independent, took the rest); in 1988, Mr Bush beat Mr Michael Dukakis there by 60:40. Mr Lewis benefited, in a low voter turn-out, from strong organisation by the religious right and Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 132,000) in funding, mostly for media advertising, from the Republican national committee. Mr Prather ran a low-key campaign. The victor also scored heavily by explicitly identifying his opponent with the policies and personality of President Clinton. One slogan ran: 'If you like Bill Clinton, you'll love Joe Prather. Kentucky doesn't need another professional politician.' Special factors or not, Mr Clinton has presided over a series of worrying Democratic defeats in elections since he won the presidency in November 1992. These include senate races in Georgia and Texas, gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia, mayoral contests in Los Angeles and New York, and two House seats in the last month. Some of the president's policies have not gone down well in the south, including his proposals to increase taxes on tobacco, a regional product. Also, some of these electoral reverses have been partly brought about by intense efforts by the religious right. These have been most effective in its heartland of the south and the region's borders, and wherever voter turn-out has been low and national attention elsewhere, and so do not necessarily imply growing support for the Christian conservative agenda nationwide.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OVER 60 ANIMALS SEIZED AT ILLEGAL WILDLIFE COMPOUND  </P> <P> Thirteen bobcats and more than 50 other animals were seized from an Acton  residence Monday where authorities said a woman had been operating an  unlicensed wild animal compound and dog kennel for at least two years.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County animal control officers confiscated the animals from Susan  Jennifer Arn, 44, who kept the animals in cages on her rural property in the  35000 block of Acton Canyon Road.  </P> <P> Arn was arrested on suspicion of operating an unlicensed wild animal compound,  a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or a fine of up to $1,000.  She was being held at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar for psychiatric  observation after becoming emotionally upset during her arrest, officials said.  </P> <P> The 13 bobcats and two chousts -- a cross breed of bobcat and domestic cat --  were taken to the Wildlife Waystation, a private animal preserve in Little  Tujunga Canyon. The rest of the animals, including 40 golden retrievers, 10  cats and five kittens, were being held at the Los Angeles County Animal Care  and Control shelter in Castaic.  </P> <P> Three snakes, including two five-foot-long boa constrictors, that were seized  from Arn also were being kept at the shelter.  </P> <P> Animal control officers along with California Department of Fish and Game  wardens and sheriff's deputies raided the property and seized the animals  because Arn had refused repeated orders to get proper permits to breed and sell  dogs and shelter other animals.  </P> <P> "She was in business without any permits at all," said John Rozier, a  supervisor at the Animal Control office. "This had been going on for at least  two years. We tried to work with her and she just never complied. It got to the  point that we had to do something."  </P> <P> Rozier said Arn advertised in local newspapers to sell the animals and  apparently took in stray animals, such as the bobcats, that were brought to  her. Though there are other houses in Acton Canyon, most are on 2 1/2- to  20-acre properties and none are close to Arn's home.  </P> <P> Rozier said the animals were well cared for, but there was no fence around  Arn's property -- a safety measure that is a requirement for permits.  </P> <P> "The animals were in cages, but if they got out there was no fence to keep them  on the property," Rosier said. "In that situation, the bobcats could be  dangerous. If they got hungry enough, they would be dangerous."  </P> <P> Fish and Game Warden Jan Yost said it is illegal in California to own a bobcat  without a Fish and Game Commission permit. She said that such permits are  rarely issued because the bobcat is a species of native California wildlife.  </P></p>

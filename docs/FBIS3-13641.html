			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Udi Segal] </F>   [Text] The meeting between Prime Minister and the pope  ended a short while ago. Prime Minister Rabin met privately  with Pope John Paul II. The two men held a relatively short  45-minute meeting. Rabin condemned the Hebron massacre and asked  the pope to use his religious and moral authority to call on all  parties to resume the negotiations. The pope, for his part,  said that he hoped for peace in the Middle East before the year  2000. The pope briefed Rabin on his plans to visit Lebanon. As  for the possibility of coming to Israel, the pope said that he  looked forward to visiting Jerusalem, but did not mention any  dates.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin presented the pope with an  ancient vase, approximately 3,000 years old, and said that he  hoped the pope would be able to preserve the vase for another  3,000 years.    Several minutes ago, we asked Prime Minister Rabin several  questions pertaining to the political process. The prime  minister replied that since he had just completed his visit to  Washington, it was still too early to speculate on the chances  for progress in the negotiations. As for the evacuation of the  Jewish residents of Hebron, Rabin said: Although we will not  reopen the Oslo and Cairo agreements we will definitely take  more steps to guarantee the security of the Palestinians in the  territories. The prime minister described the design of the  Jewish settlement in Hebron as stupid.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 17 March,  in  a report on Rabin's meeting with the pope, adds the following:  "Mr. Rabin told the pope he is eagerly looking forward to his  visit to Israel." "Our correspondent in Rome Yosi Bar reports  that Mr. Rabin promised the pope to bring peace and prosperity  to the Holy Land. Following the meeting Mr. Rabin said the pope  can provide spiritual and religious help to facilitate the peace  negotiations.    "The Vatican's envoy stated that the pope has called on  Yasir  'Arafat to return to the peace negotiations with Israel. The  envoy said that during his meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis  he conveyed to him the pope's support for the rights of the  Palestinians. The envoy -- who serves as the Vatican's foreign  minister -- also stated that the Holy See is not mediating  between the sides."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the  Czech Government approved a bill on the Czech security services  and a bill on the activity of the Security and Information  Service (BIS) and on the position and obligations of its  members. Both bills were drafted on the basis of the principles  which were thoroughly discussed by parliament.    Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists after the meeting that  the bill on security services defines the basic framework of  their activity and basic forms of coordination between them and  additionally states the way the services are to be made  accountable. In this sense it is an umbrella law of global  nature and serves as a basis for another law on the BIS, Klaus  said.    He confirmed that the government had agreed with a proposal  by its Legislative Council that BIS installations are guarded by  policemen and not by counter-intelligence members.    Klaus described as a considerable positive shift the fact  that, apart from general control, the new law would make  security services less accountable to parliament and more to the  government. To entrust a security service with a task was  basically a matter of the government and president, with the  president entrusting security services with tasks through the  government, Klaus said.</p>

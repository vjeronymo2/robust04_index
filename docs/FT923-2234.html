			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: Mecca in the making - Will London become the new centre for Islamic art? Patricia Morison talks to Nasser Khalili Britain, according to Dr Nasser D. Khalili, could become 'the Mecca for Islamic art'. Whether Britain does will depend on the government's response to Khalili's offer to present his superb collection of Islamic art to the nation. The terms of the offer, as he explained to the Financial Times, are not only conditional but highly specific: a museum in central London, to be named after himself. Khalili puts the value of his collection at over Pounds 1 billion. It consists of some 20,000 pieces chosen to span all Islamic cultural artifacts, from Korans, coins and astrolabes to armour, seals, and precious scraps of letters written on papyrus in the first century of Islam. It is a collection, Khalili claims, which has no gaps. This hoard, stored in warehouses around the world, is described by experts as the finest privately owned collection of Islamic art. In the 1980s, Khalili wrote a doctoral thesis at London University on Islamic lacquerware. Two years ago, he endowed a chair in Islamic art and archaeology at the University. Its holder, Michael Rogers, emphasises the scholarly importance of a collection which is 'the product of an informed and inquiring mind anxious to show the close relations of the arts in different media.' Despite his name Khalili, 46, is Jewish. He was born in Iran where the Jewish community traditionally use both Jewish and Arab names - his second name is David. He left Iran in 1967 and has lived in London since 1980. Over 20 years and in great secrecy, Khalili has built up his collection out of a fortune from dealing in art, property and commodities. A notable coup was in 1980 when he bought at Sotheby's the World History by Rashid al-Din, part of an extraordinarily important manuscript written at Tabriz in 1314. At Pounds 935,000 it was the most expensive medieval manuscript ever sold, and remains the most costly Oriental manuscript. He points out that the opportunity is there for the Persian vizier's masterpiece to return to Britain - and for him to achieve what he deprecatingly calls 'my stupid vision.' This vision has been of a great art-collection to represent the achievement of Islam, a religion and culture he sees as grievously misjudged. After the years of secrecy, Khalili is now seeking maximum publicity for his collection. An expensive and unique publishing venture is part of the campaign. On October 22, a party at the Foreign Office will mark the launch of four beautiful volumes cataloguing the Korans in the collection. The next few years will see the publication of a further 22 volumes. Through this massive publishing venture many of the world's leading Islamic scholars have been brought into contact with the Nour Foundation, set up under the chairmanship of Lord Young of Graffham to publicise the Khalili Collection. To achieve his vision, Khalili intends to install his collection in a museum which will bear his name. As his adopted home and a centre of Islamic scholarship, the UK governments is being given the first offer. For 15 years, the Khalili collection should be housed in a separate museum in central London. It must be a building of between 3,500 and 5000 square metres and would be fully staffed with curators and conservators. As well as giving public access to the collection, the museum must function as a centre for teaching and research. During that period, loan exhibitions would take the collection around the world, the cost to be born by the host nations. The Museum would be a growing collection, objects being added and also sold. Khalili is determined it should not suffer the fate of the Chester Beatty bequest, turned down by the British government and now fossilised and unvisited in a Dublin suburb. But what about the expense of a new museum, to be created for 15 years in the first instance and at a time when flagship national collections such as the British Museum and the National Gallery vociferously bemoan their financial plight? What, too, of the objection that London already has enough museums already? Khalili's answer is that the UK can ill afford to pass up his offer. With a population of 2 1/2 million Moslems, it is time the country made a big gesture to acknowledge their role. Yet the museum needs to be in London, not in Bradford or other major areas of Moslem population, so that it will be easily accessible to international tourism. The museum's cost would be 'peanuts' compared with the benefits it would bring, not only in of tourist revenue but also in terms of good will from the Islamic world and giving Britain the lead within Europe in cultural relations with the Middle East. Other countries have expressed a keen interest in the collection. Spain is said to have already agreed to meet Khalili's conditions. However, Khalili is prepared to wait while the negotiations with the British government run their no doubt tortuous course. 'I am offering the horse, its just a case of providing the saddle', he says. But his clearly stated preference is for a British saddle for his extraordinary gift-horse.</p>

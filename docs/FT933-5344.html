			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cargill earnings slip 20% CARGILL, the Minneapolis-based international commodities merchandising firm, reported a 20 per cent slide in fiscal year 1993 earnings, to Dollars 348m. Sales for the year rose slightly to Dollars 47bn, while cash flow, at Dollars 1.01bn, dropped slightly. The secretive and closely-held company only began reporting results last year, when it initiated a employee stock ownership programme. Cargill said despite the earnings decline, fiscal 1993 was its third-best year in its 130-year history. Mr Robert Lumpkins, senior vice-president and chief financial officer, said operations within the US were stronger than ever. However, activity outside North America was adversely affected by reduced acreage in the EC, currency fluctuations, political instability within parts of South America, and continuing credit problems among Cargill's leading customers, including the former Soviet Union. 'Many of the economic and other factors negatively influencing the global business environment had been anticipated,' Mr Lumpkins said.</p>

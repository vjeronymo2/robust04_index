			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: The grocers' bun fight J Sainsbury's price offensive threatens to turn the food retailers' stock market retreat into a rout. The company has footled around before with price-cutting campaigns, but there is little doubt this is the real thing. By chopping the prices of 300 own-label lines for the foreseeable future, Sainsbury is sacrificing gross margin without much clue whether this can be recovered in higher sales. There is now no knowing where this downward spiral in the industry's margins will end. The move will undoubtedly strengthen Sainsbury's position as market leader. It re-emphasises Sainsbury's high quality brand, which represents its most important competitive advantage. Moreover, the move is adroitly timed - just before Christmas - and will tie up additional own-label manufacturing capacity, making it hard for rivals to respond. Weaker competitors will either suffer intense margin pain or lose sales. Sainsbury's aggression, though, may only ensure it emerges as the least bad loser. With much of its Pounds 2bn rights issue proceeds left to play with, the industry is now in danger of wrecking its returns by ploughing on with self-defeating expansion plans. With the sector trading on a historic multiple of 12, the market already considers the grocers incapable of sustaining much earnings growth. They might be doing shareholders a favour by accepting that reality, halting their development programmes, running their stores for cash and slashing their generous dividend cover. By giving them low multiples and high yields, the market seems increasingly to view grocers as utility stocks. Perhaps it is time they took the hint.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Revenue probe led to closure of Pounds 150m-a-year loophole TAX EXPERTS wince at the use of terms such as 'scam', but there was little surprise that the Inland Revenue closed the loophole which allowed companies to be sold solely because they could reduce the purchaser's liability to advance corporation tax. An unofficial but brisk market in subsidiaries, organised by tax consultants, allowed companies with a subsidiary which had paid corporation tax over the previous six years in excess of its own ACT requirements to strip the subsidiary of trading activities and sell it. Buyers with unrelieved ACT could then pass dividends through the subsidiary and offset the ACT on those dividends against the corporation tax paid by the former owners. The chancellor stopped, with immediate effect, the 'carry-back' of ACT when the ownership of a company changes and there is a significant change in the nature or conduct of its trade or business. Mr Chris Adams, a partner in the accountants Arthur Andersen, estimated that there had been as many as 100 of these transactions recently, although most involved ACT totalling only Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. The Revenue said that closing the loophole would yield about Pounds 150m a year, and prevent further loss of tax from any increase in this activity. Recent sellers include Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, which sold four subsidiaries with net assets totalling Pounds 1.6m for up to Pounds 11.3m. In May Farnell Electronics, the electrical components distributor, sold a subsidiary with net assets of Pounds 6.2m for Pounds 12.7m. The Revenue's special investigation division had focused on 'carry-back' transactions and adopted an aggressive posture to companies buying 'cleaned-out shells'. It is also likely to continue challenging purchasers who completed deals before the Budget under sections of the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes Act, which require that there is a genuine commercial reason for the transaction. Mr Adams said the change in law could also pose problems for companies which made acquisitions for genuine commercial reasons. Such purchasers would have to be Careful how they restructured the subsidiary.</p>

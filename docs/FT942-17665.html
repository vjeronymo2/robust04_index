			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Israel in accord on Palestinian police for Gaza Israel has agreed to allow a first contingent of 300 to 400 Palestinian policemen to be deployed in the Gaza Strip early next week in the first vestige of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Israeli and PLO officials will resume intensive negotiations in Cairo tomorrow on the final aspects of the much-delayed 'Gaza-and-Jericho-first' Palestinian self-rule deal, with a view to reaching agreement within two weeks. The intensified activity follows Thursday's breakthrough when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation concluded a deal for the deployment of a 160-strong international observer force in Hebron, to serve as protection for the Palestinians there in the wake of February's Hebron mosque massacre. The force will comprise 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes and 35 Italians - 60 of them lightly armed for their 'personal protection.' The mandate is for three months but can be extended if both sides agree. In Tunis, PLO officials said they hoped Israel could complete its militarywithdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by April 13, as originally scheduled in the declaration of principles the two sides signed last September in Washington. 'The Israelis know how important this date is and we will insist on it very hard,' said Mr Marwan Kanafani, an adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. PLO Officials in Cairo said they believed the two sides were close to announcing the date for an Israeli withdrawal. But they would not confirm remarks by a PLO official in Jordan that Israel had already agreed to begin withdrawal on April 12 and complete the pullout by April 30. Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said after the Cairo deal was reached that it marked 'a renewed commitment to finish by the target dates'. PLO and Israeli officials have emphasised during last week's talks that the Hebron massacre and events since have heightened the need to speed implementation of the Gaza-Jericho deal.</p>

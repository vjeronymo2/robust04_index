			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: Investment managers query the value of asset-liability models The bonds vs equities debate is exercising pension fund trustees in a way that few investment issues have. Fund managers are reporting an increasing number of trustee clients -  not known for investment sophistication - walking through the door clutching a tailor-made asset-liability model which the investment manager is asked to follow. The use of these models, fund managers say, has increased sharply within the past six months, largely due to press comment suggesting that pension funds have invested too heavily in equities. Not surprisingly, many of these models are advising fund managers to pare equities weightings to reduce the risk that there will not be enough money to ensure that pension liabilities shortly falling due are met. In fact, consultants at actuaries Mercer Fraser say, the public debate has missed the point. The real problem is that UK pension funds have become increasingly mature, with the number of current and deferred pensioners dwarfing the number of active contributing members. While a young pension scheme has a bulge of liabilities falling due far in the future, a mature scheme faces a bulge of costs quite quickly. But the average UK balanced pension fund pool, with its 85 per cent weighting in equities, may represent an investment strategy which takes 10 years to come good -  too long to meet the needs of many mature schemes, according to Mr Tim Gardiner, a consultant there. Mr Robert Baker, who specialises in investment consulting at Mercer Fraser, illustrates the point with a story about a client who, as the result of making 7,000 workers redundant in a single year, became a mature scheme almost overnight. That scheme went from 70 per cent of members making contributions to 35 per cent, with many of those redundancies requiring immediate calls on the pension scheme. Mercer Fraser devised several possible asset-mixes for the client, who selected a middle course, paring equities holdings to roughly 60 per cent of the portfolio from 93 per cent. However, the fund manager has been given leeway to add value to the portfolio by shifting the equities holdings to anywhere between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of total assets. While the solution has not eliminated the risk that short-term liabilities will be unmet, it has reduced it significantly. But the use of these models is unsettling fund managers. For their part, they hint darkly that consultants are pushing asset-liability models on clients because they simply want the fee income. Mr Baker says costs for a modelling study range from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 30,000, but some fund managers report costs of up to Pounds 100,000 each. Also, a proliferation of tailor-made asset-liability benchmarks for different clients will make the operation of large balanced pools difficult. The pools, which include the funds of many clients, are efficient and lower cost to operate than segregated funds which require tailor-made administration and reporting systems. 'One of the problems for fund mangers is that benchmarks are client-specific,' said Mr Michael Robarts, a director of Fleming Investment Management. 'This must reduce the number of funds that anyone can run and still meet client needs.' Mr Robarts says his concern about the models is that clients may not understand them sufficiently. 'A client could end up with a performance that is good for the benchmark but bad relative to others in the fund management industry,' he said. Thus, in a year when equities had heavily outperformed bonds, fund managers with high bond benchmarks in their asset-liability model, risk incurring the wrath of a client who does not understand that it was the model which dictated the lower level of return. Also, there is some concern among fund managers about the quality of some of the models. While some consulting actuaries have spent large sums developing software systems to hypothecate portfolios under various conditions, others have not. And too often fund managers are left in the dark about the underlying macroeconomic or business assumptions used to devise the model.</p>

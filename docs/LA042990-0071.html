			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: WOMEN WHO WRITE BY LUCINDA IRWIN SMITH (JULIAN  MESSNER/SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $9.95; 165 PP.)  </P> <P> Opening under Anais Nin's succinct quote -- "The role of the writer is not to  say what we can all say but what we are unable to say" -- "Women Who Write" is  intended as a how-to cum inspirational guide for young readers, presumably  young female readers. The main section of the book is devoted to authors from  Jane Austen and George Eliot to Carolyn See and Tama Janowitz.  </P> <P> Lucinda Irwin Smith presents the contemporary authors in interview form; her  selection, though obviously limited, is most imaginative and diverse, including  poet Denise Levertov, young adult novelist Norma Klein and Lorraine Vivian  Hansberry, the first black woman to have a play produced on Broadway ("A Raisin  in the Sun"). "Women Who Write" closes with a section addressing readers as  future writers and offering them ideas on "Developing Your Gift." Although the  book's earnest, wholesome tone occasionally betrays textbook intentions --  particularly in the chapters on authors on the wrong side of the grave for  interview purposes -- it would certainly be an inspired choice for classroom  use.

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: Speaking in vernacular Sir, It is comforting to read that Philip Stephens ('Premier makes music in a minor', February 26) believes that Mr Major suppressed his doubts about the US air-drop operation in Bosnia by calling it 'brave' and 'imaginative'. However, if Stephens had read his Yes, Prime Minister, he would know that such words can imply damning praise indeed, to be translated into 'foolhardy' or 'idiotic' or even worse. One can only hope that Mr Major's vernacular has not been too contaminated by Appleby-ese. Of course, the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler, seems a far cry from Sir Humphrey, so maybe the risk is not too great. Johan Enegren, Avenue de l'Amazone 4, B-1640 Rhode-Saint-Genese, Belgium</p>

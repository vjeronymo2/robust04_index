			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / The alluring call of the Buddha: Religious loyalties exercise increasing influence in Japanese politics Politics and religion have often been uncomfortably close in Japan. And the two estates are getting closer these days, to the alarm of many in a country whose postwar constitution imposes a broad but imprecise ban on religions exercising political authority. Japan's largest and richest religious organisation, the Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai, is a significant, yet poorly understood, behind-the-scenes force in the political upheavals likely to lead to the formation of a new Japanese government this week. Founded 64 years ago as a pacifist protest against state Shinto ritual, Soka Gakkai is now part of the political establishment as the power behind Komeito, the clean government party. Komeito's partnership with the conservative Japan Renewal Party dominates policy in the fragmented seven-party coalition. Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal Party, is a potential successor to former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa - though the outcome is unclear. Formally, Soka Gakkai and Komeito are separate organisations, but their links run deep: all but six of Komeito's 76 members of parliament belong to Soka Gakkai and use its 1,000 community centres to address the faithful during election campaigns. Komeito's opponents in the opposition Liberal Democratic party suspect that Mr Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai's 66-year-old leader and founder of Komeito 30 years ago, still runs his old party from behind the scenes. Mr Ikeda, author of more than 60 spiritual tomes, is portrayed by critics as a billionaire megalomaniac. He was forced to demerge Komeito and Soka Gakkai in 1970. Komeito was then the political department of Soka Gakkai and Mr Ikeda was alleged to run both as personal fiefs. But Soka Gakkai's wealth still makes it an attractive political friend. Political parties badly need new non-corporate backers because of a law curbing the size of political donations from any one source. Soka Gakkai's most avid suitor is the wily Mr Ichiro Ozawa, deputy head of the JRP. His opponents accuse him of using his alliance with Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary-general - dubbed the 'Ichi-ichi line' in Japan's press - to dominate the coalition. Soka Gakkai's attractions are obvious. The sect and its affiliates own a daily newspaper with a circulation of 5.5m and a gravestone business, and it has established its own university. The newspaper, Seikyo Simbun, the sect's biggest cash source, reported a Y9.4bn (Pounds 62m) profit in 1991. The group is, however, shy about divulging its precise income. Soka Gakkai's influence also derives from its following among the spiritually inclined in Japan's armies of salarymen. Its membership - about 8m households in Japan and 1.3m abroad - makes it the most successful of the half-dozen new religions to have grown over the past few decades by offering a community and spiritual dimension to city dwellers who feel their lives lack depth. Mr Ikeda's officials are baffled at their movement's controversial public image. They insist its influence is benignly ethical and deny it finances any political party. Yet they accept its increased influence imposes new responsibilities: they have to offer a clearer vision for Japan than a bland diet of universal harmony. Here, the main influence is Mr Einosuke Akiya, Soka Gakkai's president and a close friend of Mr Ikeda. 'Religion is the underlying current in human life . . . so there is going to be some kind of involvement in politics, based on religious ideas,' he says. There is nothing new in this, he adds. Three years ago, Komeito helped the former LDP government win parliamentary agreement to send peacekeepers to help the United Nations in Cambodia. Mr Akiya wants Japan to play a greater role under a UN-based international system, on which he is deliberately vague. But he has clearer views on development aid. 'Japan must do more than merely provide international aid to satisfy its obligations to the world community,' he says. It must discuss aid projects with recipients, and send more aid workers into the field. The sect does not, however, plan to impose a parliamentary whip on Komeito members, he says. It does not have to. At least one Diet member has found offending Mr Ikeda left him no option but to resign. Komeito politicians see no constitutional problem in bringing Buddhism to politics - if the party and sect stay institutionally separate. 'Yes, Soka Gakkai supports us electorally, but Komeito handles its own political business,' says Mr Akihiro Ohta, Komeito's vice-secretary general. Dr Masami Kita, economics professor at Soka University, likens the relationship with Komeito to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland's support for the Labour Party in the 19th century. 'Soka Gakkai members are awakening to their political responsibilities and exercising their political rights,' he says. The benefits to Komeito of the relationship are clear. It regularly pulls in 7m votes at general elections and is rarely defeated in any seat on which it can afford to concentrate resources. Its election candidates address the faithful at the end of monthly Soka Gakkai worship sessions. Their speeches usually follow a simulcast talk over a central television screen in each of the sect's community centres by Mr Ikeda, offering moral guidance from the lives of a wide range of figures from Beethoven to Napoleon. Part of Soka Gakkai's appeal, say members, is to bring spiritual freedom to people who feel oppressed, as did its two founders, who were jailed as 'thought criminals' for challenging the monopoly of state Shinto of the 1930s. The movement expanded fast after the second world war, under Mr Ikeda's leadership. Another surge came in the 1960s from the first generations of salarymen, often sent to Tokyo to live in company dormitories away from their families. Soka Gakkai even went to the trouble of providing a laundry service for the faithful. But Soka Gakkai's membership has stagnated in recent years. New religious converts have flocked to younger fringe groups, such as the ultra-nationalist Institute for Research into Human Happiness, or to Agon-shu, which uses its own satellite television station to blast healing psychic power at the faithful. Even before the recent spiritual revival, the Japanese showed a unique capacity to follow several faiths at once, suggesting a dilettante approach to religion which could rebound on Soka Gakkai. At last count, the government's cultural affairs agency knew of 231,000 Japanese religious sects with 215m members - more than 1 1/2 times the nation's population of 124m. Soka Gakkai's inability to benefit more from this religious revival may result partly from the damage to its image when a safe belonging to a former director of its newspaper, containing Y175m, was found discarded on a Yokohama rubbish dump in 1989. The coalition government even felt it necessary three months ago to make a small increase in the low tax rate on religious groups' business profits, in response to public criticism of the tax privileges allowed to Soka Gakkai and other rich movements. The sect's image may equally have been harmed by its mass excommunication three years ago from the 700-year-old Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist sect on which its teachings are based. Mr Ikeda's followers had accused the Nichiren monks of 'playing golf and living madly spendthrift lives'. Mr Akiya is undismayed and likens the split to Christian protestants' breakaway from the Catholic church. 'We have been liberated,' he says. Despite its ambivalent public profile, Soka Gakkai will be part of Japanese public life for some time. It is so powerful that the wobbly coalitions likely to run Japan for the foreseeable future cannot afford to offend it.</p>

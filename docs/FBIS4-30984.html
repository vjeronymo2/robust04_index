			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's address at </F> the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy  graduation ceremony in Boston on 22 May 1994: "A New Conflict  of Ideas"]    [Text] In our country and our part of the world, we bear  witness to and enthusiastically participate in the end of  communism and the beginning of a new era, the beginning of a  free society. When I refer to the end of communism, I feel  obligated to warn against often oversimplified views and  interpretations, and against incorrect and misleading  expectations which are -- paradoxically -- two completely  different trends.    Communism was an immense human tragedy but I can agree  neither to its demonizing on the one hand nor to its  trivializing on the other hand. The demonization of communism  implicitly suggests that communism was a unique, unrepeatable  event that somehow befell its innocent victims, without any  fault on their part, without their silent approval, or their  active cooperation. That is not true. Communism was "only" a  more extreme form of etatism, human constructivism, and  political and social engineering; a world where somebody knows  better than the others what is best for all of us, where one and  only one interpretation of freedom, right, social equality, or  economic rationality is considered obligatory. Communism also is  a world of extreme bureaucracy, far too many directives and  bans, human oppression and human degradation, a world of  powerlessness of the citizens against the omnipotent state.    I dare to argue that a milder form of all these symptoms  exists also in the standard Western societies. In the course of  history, the development of these symptoms had its ascents and  returns, and it also had its dangerous internal dynamics, thanks  to which a point was unexpectedly reached when the entire  society slid into an unforeseen and unintended state of affairs.  Therefore, I believe it is extremely important also for the  Western countries to know the maximum about our experience and  study it very carefully.    I dare say that the Czech Republic is undergoing the fastest  and most successful systemic changes in the entire postcommunist  world. We have already formed a standard system of ideologically  well-defined political parties. We have been successful in  reaching and maintaining the basic political and social accord  with respect to goals, strategy, and running results of the  transformation. We have introduced a market economy based on a  massive and unprecedented privatization, deregulation, and  liberalization, as well as on a high degree of macroeconomic  stability.    We have accepted in our country an open view of society,  which is based on the trust in human action rather than human  design, if we are to use the very helpful terminology of  Friedrich von Hayek. Nevertheless, during the transition period,  it is necessary to assign even the state a considerable  constructive role. The reformers must abolish the old  institutions, and the ensuing institutional vacuum must be  quickly filled with an alternative coordination mechanism.  Otherwise, the new system would not work. The faster, broader,  and deeper this transformation runs, the lower is the economic  and social cost, and the more successful is the entire systemic  change.    I disagree with the opinion that the world has entered the  stage occasionally referred to as the end of history or the end  of ideology. Neither is, and never will be, true. As long as  people are people, there will be ideological conflicts. The  conflict between communism and free society dominated the world  in the past decades, and the current conflicts are not any less  significant. We are -- after decades of life under communism --  somewhat oversensitive in this respect, and consider it our duty  to warn against these invisible, or insufficiently conspicuous  potential dangers.    The present world also bears witness to another fundamental  conflict. It is again becoming a question whether to trust  unlimited teamwork and cooperation of free citizens or rather  delegate power to the hands of benevolent politicians and  administrators; whether we are convinced of the superiority of  the "free market" system, or prefer the "just" market (which  means protectionism); whether we are satisfied with monitoring  the quality of production of our industry, or whether we want to  control production technology and processes; whether we advocate  the free market, or a state industrial policy; whether we favor  the free choice based on our own preferences and interests, or  whether we accept aprioristic externally formulated norms and  criteria.    This idea is based on the ethically peculiar and rationally  unsustainable argument that different labor costs from firm to  firm or country to country cause a "distortion of competition"  and that such a lapse must be remedied by enlightened  supranational regulation. Calls for quasi-universal social  rights are a disguised attempt at protecting high-cost producers  in the countries with a high degree of regulation and with  unsustainable welfare standards from cheaper labor in less  productive countries. The disparity that arose between the  North and East (or South) is not a result of the difference in  regulation or social legislation but directly reflects the  difference in the productivity of labor. Postcommunist and  developing countries cannot raise wages above their productivity  and no international conference can increase their productivity.  Their unemployment rate and general poverty can increase,  however, if these external criteria and standards are imposed  upon them.    The conflict of ideas prevails, and we must discuss it. I  hope that the fundamental liberal demand for freedom of speech  will never be replaced by the non-liberal slogan about the  "correctness of phrases," with this correctness defined, perhaps  with good intentions, by the advocates of this or that truth.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We come to the crisis between Cameroon and Nigeria.  The Yaounde authorities say they have not been informed about  the holding of a summit between Abacha and Biya although  unofficial sources report that a summit will be held between  President Paul Biya of Cameroon and General Sani Abacha of  Nigeria and that the two leaders will meet in a few weeks time  with their Egyptian counterpart, Husni Mubarak, the current OAU  chairman, in Abuja. Nigerian Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe  has expressed surprise at this news and in Yaounde, the minister  of communication and government spokesman says he has not been  notified of this meeting which is rather expected to take place  in Togo. Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, Cameroon's minister and  government spokesman, speaks to Raphael Badinga:    [Begin Kouomegni recording] We in Cameroon believe that  normally the host country should be Togo since the Togolese  leader came to Cameroon and went to Nigeria in connection with  the dispute, and his foreign minister went to Cameroon and  Nigeria. The Nigerian minister also came here for three days  and we worked on the assumption that Togo is offering mediation.  We are, therefore, surprised to learn that somehow Nigeria has  chosen Cairo because Nigeria has not informed us of any such  development and Egypt has not notified us of any invitation to  Cairo. Normally, we should be informed, even discreetly, by  Nigeria or Egypt. We should negotiate the date, procedure, and  subject of discussion together and then we should announce this  simultaneously in Yaounde and Lagos or simultaneously in  Yaounde, Lagos, and Cairo. That is the procedure in  international relations. [end recording]</p>

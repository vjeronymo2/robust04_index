			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN 4 AND 5 SCRAMBLE FOR PLACE IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> For all the anxiety of the last few months, Alice Gordezky's daughter might as  well have applied to an Ivy League college.  </P> <P> There were enigmatic tests, endless interviews and probing essay questions.  Tuition could have bought a new car. And the odds of getting in, well, they  made Yale look like a breeze.  </P> <P> When the letter -- a thick one, indicating acceptance -- arrived in last  Saturday's mail, Gordezky screamed with joy. Five-year-old Rachel had won a  spot in an exclusive North Hollywood kindergarten.  </P> <P> "The whole experience was amazingly stressful . . . ludicrous . . . and  mind-boggling," said Gordezky, 37, a graphic artist from Van Nuys. "I guess I  was one of the lucky ones."  </P> <P> Welcome to the world of private education in Los Angeles. But don't expect to  get in. Dissatisfaction with conditions at public schools and the specter of  year-round classes have unleashed a stampede of youngsters that few private  schools can accommodate.  </P> <P> Last week, dozens of elite schools across the county -- from Carlthorpe in  Santa Monica to Buckley in Sherman Oaks to John Thomas Dye in Bel-Air -- mailed  out acceptance and rejection letters for next fall, then promptly closed for a  two-week vacation. Of the thousands of children who applied, somewhere between  75% to 95% were wished better luck next time.  </P> <P> "I started to cry," said an Encino mother, who asked not to be identified  because her 5-year-old son is still on a waiting list at one school. "This was  really the first rejection of his young life."  </P> <P> Although this process has been a spring rite for years at private schools,  administrators say the crunch to get into classes this fall -- even at prices  that range from $5,000 to $8,000 a year -- has never been more intense.  </P> <P> At Polytechnic School in Pasadena, for instance, no new students were accepted  for the second, third and fifth grades, despite more than 40 applications for  each class. The competition is just as fierce at the high school level. At  Oakwood School in North Hollywood, applications for some classes increased by  as much as 250% over last year.  </P> <P> "It is a painful time of year," said Mimi Baer, executive director of the  California Assn. of Independent Schools, which represents 50 private schools in  the Los Angeles area serving about 60,000 students. The organization only  admits schools that have been in existence at least six years and have  independent boards of directors, which excludes most religious schools.  </P> <P> "I think all of us really deplore the situation," she said. "We're having to  say 'no' to a lot of wonderful families."  </P> <P> Unlike many Eastern schools, however, where successive generations of  youngsters often attend their family's alma mater, headmasters at private  schools here say they are attracting mostly first-time students.  </P> <P> They come from families who believe fervently in public education -- who, in  fact, say they would prefer that their children attend a neighborhood school --  but feel that deteriorating conditions there have left them no alternative.  </P> <P> "Many come with a sense of resignation and, in some cases, desperation," said  Paul Cummins, headmaster of Crossroads School in Santa Monica. "They really  wish their neighborhood schools were doing the job. But we, as a society, have  dumped so many problems on the public schools . . . that these families just  give up."  </P> <P> Nowhere is the desperation of parents more magnified than at the kindergarten  level.  </P> <P> Because most students don't leave once they are accepted, kindergarten is  usually the only realistic shot a family has at getting into the private school  of its choice. That is, if 175 children vying for 10 spots seems realistic.  </P> <P> "Families come to me in a total panic," said Harriett Bay, a West Los Angeles  consultant, who at $600 a pop, does a thriving business helping match children  with private schools. "I work with them and really try to calm them down . . .  but I can't guarantee placement."  </P> <P> Indeed, there's no such thing as a sure thing, given that admissions directors  are trying to assess the academic potential of kids only a few years removed  from diapers. Besides, their methods for separating the cream of 4-year-olds  from the rest of the crop vary wildly.  </P> <P> At Mirman School for Gifted Children in Bel-Air, pupils must possess an IQ of  at least 145 -- well above average and bordering on genius -- just to be  considered.  </P> <P> Most other schools try to judge development and verbal skills by having a  teacher tell a story, then asking the child to recall the sequence of events.  Many rely heavily on nursery school evaluations.  </P> <P> Some refuse to meet the children one-on-one, but spend considerable time  interviewing the parents. And a few engage the youngsters in social activities,  such as sharing graham crackers and milk, to see how well they interact with  their peers.  </P> <P> "It's utterly crazy," said Aliza Guren, 35, of Brentwood, whose 4-year-old son  will begin kindergarten at a private school this fall. Guren, a graduate of  Harvard Law School, helps the university interview prospective students.  </P> <P> "At least there you have scores, boards, grades and records," she said. "But  what does a 4-year-old have? These are little kids."  </P> <P> Many parents take a more cynical approach. They prep their children for the  interviews and train them for the tests. Some families have found that hefty  financial contributions, apart from tuition, increase their chances. Others say  it's not who your child is, but who you know.  </P> <P> "There was so much politics going on, your name, your income, your position,  your connections," said one Santa Monica woman, a former actress, whose  4-year-old daughter is on a waiting list. "I tried to be realistic, because I  felt like we were just kind of mid-range on all those points."  </P> <P> Even administrators concede the process is imperfect.  </P> <P> "The report on my own daughter when she was 4 was that her hand-eye  coordination wasn't too good, as reflected by her use of the scissors," said  Cummins, the Crossroads headmaster. "Now, she's a violinist."  </P> <P> But faced with a staggering number of applications and committed to maintaining  small classes, most private schools say they know of no other way to make their  cuts.  </P> <P> Nor are they laughing all the way to the bank. Administrators say they are  pleased to find parents interested in their schools, but they are distressed  that the quality of education in public districts has sent so many desperate  families their way.  </P> <P> "A lot of these are really nice people looking at their little guy or girl and  wondering what's the best they can do for them," said Mike Babcock,  Polytechnic's headmaster. "We do our best to explain that it's a bit of a crap  shoot. But there's no question that this is a time of anxiety and I really  regret it. When your child is 3 or 4 or 5, you shouldn't have to worry about  their schooling."  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles Unified School District, about 4,000 of the district's  610,000 students left to attend private schools last year. To some extent,  officials concede, it is a welcome relief from overcrowded conditions.  </P> <P> But Paul Possemato, associate superintendent for instruction, says he fears  that some parents may be leaving the district for the wrong reasons.  </P> <P> "This society is a complex and varied one. It is diverse and dynamic,"  Possemato said. "Because of that, a child must learn to grow and mature in an  environment that's real. Public schools are where reality exists.  </P> <P> "My advice to parents is always the same," he said. "Don't run from public  education because you think you're going to save your child. You're just going  to force your child to run from real-life issues."  </P> <P> For many parents, however, that philosophy is far from realistic.  </P> <P> "The bottom line for every parent is you have to do what is best for your  children," said Abbie Rich, a PTA mom in Tarzana, whose son, 10, and daughter,  6, will enter a private school in the fall.  </P> <P> Her litany of complaints about the public school system is familiar:  overcrowding, lack of resources, discipline problems in class, too few teachers  capable of helping non-English-speaking students and eventual year-round  classes.  </P> <P> Although Rich said she worked hard at her local elementary school, serving as a  Spanish-speaking classroom volunteer and helping to raise money for computers  and books, she began to see the problems as bigger than what a few concerned  parents could accomplish.  </P> <P> "Private school should be an option," said Rich, 41, a free-lance television  writer. "It shouldn't have to be a necessity. That's what's absurd."  </P></p>

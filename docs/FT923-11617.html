			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Anheuser climbs to Dollars 317.2m ANHEUSER-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, yesterday reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 317.2m, up from Dollars 286.7m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per share increased from 99 cents to Dollars 1.09 on a fully-diluted basis. Anheuser scored the increase on sales of Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.26bn in the second quarter of 1991. This takes sales for the first half of 1992 to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 6.18bn, and after-tax profits to Dollars 541.2m, against Dollars 487.6m. ***** Union Pacific, the US transportation company, yesterday reported a 35 per cent rise in second-quarter profits, at Dollars 206m after tax, writes Nikki Tait. The advance lifted net profits for the first months to Dollars 351m, compared with Dollars 286m in the same period of 1991. At the operating level, second-quarter figures improved more modestly - profits were up 15 per cent at Dollars 376m - but the company said there had been 'strong gains' in all its businesses. The railroad division pushed up earnings by almost 9 per cent at Dollars 158m and, despite a two-day shutdown in June, car loadings rose by 2 per cent. ***** Hershey Foods, the largest publicly-traded manufacturer of chocolate and confectionery products in the US, saw second-quarter profits rise to Dollars 34.5m after tax, from Dollars 31.9m a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait. This takes after-tax earnings for the first six months of the year to Dollars 93.4m, compared with Dollars 80.5m. ***** Wall Street brokerage house, Bear Stearns, yesterday agreed to work with a recently-formed consortium of seven Spanish banks to promote asset securitisation in Spain, writes Patrick Harverson. This is its second foray into Europe under the asset securitisation banner. In 1989 it set up a similar joint venture in France with Credit Lyonnais. ***** Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the third largest soft-drinks group in the US, announced a 13 per cent increase in second-quarter operating profits, to Dollars 46.5m, writes Patrick Harverson. After interest expense of Dollars 39.6m, a Dollars 6m charge to cover the costs of cancelling a Dollars 600m public stock offering, and Dollars 4.6m in minority interest dividend, however, the group recorded a net loss of Dollars 2.2m in the quarter. Last time Dr Pepper made a net profit of Dollars 2.2m.</p>

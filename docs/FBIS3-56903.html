Three statements were adopted at the session. The statement  regarding terrorist acts against People's Movement of Ukraine  activists names numerous events, which have occurred in many  oblasts of Ukraine, in particular the disappearance of Mykhaylo  Boychyshyn, head of the Rukh secretariat, without a trace on the  night of 15 January, and the reflection is expressed that  "certain circles in the state are endeavoring to demoralize the  democratic forces on the eve of elections and frighten their  adherents by means of terror."    The central leadership of Rukh evaluates the tripartite  statement on eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine as  "capitulation by Ukrainian state officials to gross external  pressure," which became possible as a result of the lack of a  clear and consistent foreign policy by the government. The  leadership of Rukh believes that Leonid Kravchuk, president of  Ukraine, took a capitulatory step.    Evaluating the results of the presidential elections in the  Crimea, the central leadership of Rukh stated that the  president's policy, aimed at pacifying the separatist forces,  failed totally. The leadership of Rukh believes that a further  delay of resolute actions by the president and Supreme Council  of Ukraine regarding the stirring up of separatism in the Crimea  could lead to armed conflict and irremediable consequences for  the citizens of Ukraine and peace in Europe.</p>

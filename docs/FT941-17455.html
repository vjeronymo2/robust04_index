			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / International Company News: Vote hits Rothman's E Asia merger plan Shares in the Malaysian subsidiary of Rothmans International, the British tobacco giant, fell sharply on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange yesterday following a weekend vote by Malaysian shareholders rejecting a plan to merge Rothmans operations in East Asia. Rothmans of Pall Mall (Malaysia) shares, which opened at MDollars 26 (USDollars 9.70), closed down more than MDollars 4 at MDollars 21.40. 'There's a lot of speculation now about what Rothmans International intends to do,' said a Kuala Lumpur broker. 'In the short term, shareholders in the Malaysian company will see the value of their shares go down - but no one is too upset at the moment.' The shares have been trading strongly recently, rising from MDollars 13.50 last November. Rothmans International had planned to merge subsidiaries in Malaysia and Singapore with company operations elsewhere in East Asia. Rothmans planned to use the combined financial muscle of the new company for a big marketing drive in China and north-east Asia, where Rothmans still lags behind its competitors. While shareholders in the Rothmans subsidiary in Singapore voted for the merger plan, Malaysian shareholders raised objections, saying that Rothmans intended to take cash out of the highly profitable local unit to finance a big marketing campaign in China and Japan. Rothmans-made cigarettes now control about 55 per cent of the Malaysian market. In the year ending March 31 1993, Rothmans Malaysian and Singapore units made a combined operating profit of Dollars 150.6m while Rothmans made combined losses elsewhere in the region of Dollars 30.3m. Permodalan Nasional (PNB), a state controlled investment company and one of the biggest institutional shareholders in Rothmans (Malaysia) said it was against the new plan because 'with the merger, the focus will . . . be diverted to East Asia'. Shareholders are now awaiting the next move by Rothmans International.</p>

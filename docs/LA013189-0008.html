			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: PEOPLE KILLING PEOPLE  </P> <P> A man who calls himself Homer telephones occasionally to express his  displeasure with the various social programs that blow like summer breezes  through L.A. He begins his conversations without preamble. "You read about  those crapheads wanting to spend millions to take care of abused kids?" he  demands when I answer the phone with a pleasant hello. "Well, Homer," I say  sweetly, "nice to hear from you again. How are things in Hell?"  </P> <P> I stay sweet because it is a policy at the L.A. Times to remain courteous even  though there is some nut on the other end of the line calling me names that  would make a street cop blush. Homer from Hell has never indicated a tendency  toward violence, and therefore I tolerate his periodic calls as a way of  keeping in touch with those who, though not blessed with superior insight, are  still able to tie their own shoes and remember their way home.  </P> <P> Homer's most recent call came yesterday. He disagrees with the effort by City  Councilman Nate Holden to get semiautomatic weapons off the streets by buying  them for $300 each from his campaign fund and turning them over to the LAPD for  destruction.  </P> <P> Homer feels that his constitutional rights are being violated even though no  one is forcing anyone to turn in their shootin' irons. Holden is simply  offering a method by which someone can pick up a few bucks by selling  something, and if they make a little profit, so what? That's the American Way.  </P> <P> "What they ought to be doing is issuing AK-47s to our citizens," Homer said,  "not taking them away. There's a war going on in this city, and it sure as hell  isn't the bad guys who are turning in their weapons. When the riots come, we'll  wish we had them!"  </P> <P> He went on to say in terms not printable in a newspaper famous for nice manners  that we all ought to offer to buy AK-47s back from Holden for more than he paid  for them, an enticement he surely would not be able to resist since the profit  would fatten his campaign fund.  </P> <P> "He's already gotten the news space out of it," Homer said, "and now if he's  going to run for mayor, he can use the do-re-me. You can call this People  Helping People."  </P> <P> When I asked Holden's press secretary, Paulette Jones, if the whole thing was  just a publicity stunt, she bristled and said that was nonsense.  </P> <P> I didn't expect her to say, "Yes, Al, you're right. Isn't it a wonderful  gimmick?" because press secretaries just don't do that. But on the other hand I  hadn't expected her to elevate a somewhat prosaic notion to the level of  genius, which was her exact approach.  </P> <P> "It's a genius program," Paulette explained, "because it gets the message  across and at the same time gets guns off the street. Nate had always been a  gun control advocate. This just keeps the topic alive and has nothing to do  with any campaign. We've had 44 guns turned in already."  </P> <P> We were talking on the telephone so I don't know if she was reading from a  prepared text or not, but if she was, it must have contained stage directions  to keep it light because she got less prickly as the conversation continued. At  the end I felt she was pleased I had even expressed an interest in her boss's  genius and might say "have a nice day" at any moment.  </P> <P> Genius was not a factor when I discussed guns with a cop I have known for many  years and whose name I would use only at the risk of severe consequences for  both of us. He, to begin with, would be buying a lot of departmental grief for  any opinion he expressed, and I would be subject to his wrath, which would be  even worse. I am small and afraid and wish to avoid anyone's wrath, especially  a cop's, so I'll call him Stokes.  </P> <P> Stokes is against private ownership of any rifle not required for killing deer,  unless the deer are organized and armed and attacking in vast numbers. "You  need an assault weapon like you need four wives," was the way Stokes put it.  "People say they're going to use them for burglars, but those damned rifles are  so powerful they'd go through a burglar, the house, a tree and the guy next  door. There is no more reason for owning an AK-47 than there is in owning an  F-16."  </P> <P> Stokes believes Holden's campaign will do about as much good as asking gang  members to turn in their Uzis for slingshots. "The only way to cut down on  private ownership," he said, "is to make selling the damned things illegal."  But with the NRA as powerful as it is, even that seems unlikely. Charlton  Heston will be able to convince guys like Homer from Hell that the deer are  already arming and God help us if they ever start marching on the cities.  </P></p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (At A Glance): Gilts prove their worth in the long term Index-linked gilts have proved reliable friends for investors over the last couple of turbulent years for stock markets. As the left hand graph shows, the normal pattern for index-linked gilts is steady growth over the long term. Occasionally, this means that the index-linked tortoise can beat the equity hare, as shown by the right hand graph. Private investors should also remember that a large part of the return on index-linked is tax-free, and that it is easier to construct a representative portfolio of index-linked than it is to put together an equity portfolio that matches the All-Share Index.</p>

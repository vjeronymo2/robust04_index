			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (17): Don't invest solely for the tax saving - Personal equity plans A personal equity plan is best regarded as an annual tax-free allowance, rather than a product. Peps began in 1987 as a result of the government's desire to encourage wider and deeper share ownership. The encouragement is in the form of generous tax breaks, albeit accompanied by rules which have become unnecessarily complicated. You can hold Pounds 6,000 of equities in a 'general' plan and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single-company plan each year. Income and gains are all tax-free. From April 6, you will also be allowed to hold corporate bonds, convertibles and preference shares in UK and EU companies, as a result of the Budget. These are all fixed-interest instruments, which will appeal to those seeking a high income. Since Peps are more flexible than other tax-efficient investments (such as pensions, the benefits of which can only be tapped on retirement), they form an essential part of any long-term planning strategy. However, those who are averse to equity investment should think very carefully before buying an equity-based Pep solely for the tax benefits. Peps must be administered by a manager, who will charge for doing so. The exception is unit trusts, where it usually costs no more to hold the unit trust in a Pep than outside one; but buying a unit trust incurs charges, usually of about 5.25-6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually. Investment trusts charge extra for administering a Pep, and if you want a direct holding of equities, the plan manager will charge for handing the portfolio. It costs more to have a 'advisory' Pep where the manager chooses the investments for you than a 'self-select' Pep where you make the investment decisions. If you want the latter, choose a plan manager whose charging structure best suits your needs: some plan managers do not charge an annual fee but charge for reclaiming tax on dividends; others have a relatively low dealing charge but charge an annual fee. There are some investment restrictions on Peps. Unit and investment trusts only qualify for the full Pep allowance if at least 50 per cent of their investment is held in UK or EU companies. The rest can be in gilts or held in companies outside the EU. You can only put Pounds 1,500 into wholly 'non-qualifying' trusts. The single-company Pep can only be used for the shares of one company (which cannot be an investment trust) but you can switch between companies. It is rarely a good idea to put too much money into a single company's shares, unless you already have a well-diversified holding of shares, because of the risk. However, the single-company Pep is useful as a tax shelter for transferring shares from an employee share option scheme or for investors who have already used up their general Pep limit for the year. If you are unhappy with your plan manager or want to change from one type of fund to another, you can transfer to another plan manager. There will be switching charges and the process may take several months. Do not cash in your existing Pep - it will lose its tax-free status. Instead, contact the manager to whom you wish to transfer who will explain the administration.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Japanese unions faced with a dwindling role: They have been slow to match up to falling membership and new conditions Members of the Japanese Electrical, Electronic and Information Union recently held a mock strike in preparation for shunto, or the 'spring struggle', Japan's annual wage offensive. 'Some of our members have never experienced a strike, so we simulated one for the experience,' explains Mr Yukuo Ajima, bureau director of the JEIU, which represents the country's electronics and software industries. But in the event, the JEIU and private railway unions, which were also threatening to strike, opted to avert stoppages and settle for less than they had demanded. The current wage round is proving to be producing the most modest wage settlements in recent Japanese history. Average wage increases, which are at present running at about 3 per cent, are likely to be the lowest since shunto began some 40 years ago. Despite the show of resistance by some unions, such as the JEIU, this year's shunto has followed a familiar pattern of compromise that has characterised Japan's labour movement for the past 20 years. The wage settlements for others in the IMF-JC, a grouping which represents the key steel, shipbuilding, electrical appliance and car industries, have been in line with levels that had been widely publicised beforehand. The predictability of the shunto agreements has raised questions about the relevance of the annual event and the willingness of union leaders to put up a decent fight for their members. 'The past 20 years have been a labour-management honeymoon,' charges Prof Ryohei Magota of the International Buddhist University, who is a specialist on labour relations. 'Japanese labour unions have become just another business division within the company and cannot be expected to play a major role in reforming society.' In the wage negotiation ritual, labour and management gradually move closer to each other's position, with a very good idea of how far the other is likely to compromise. Indeed, the results of the spring wage offensive have been forecast with considerable accuracy by William Mercer, the consultancy which boasts an average discrepancy of just 0.1 per cent between its forecast and the actual agreed rate of increase for the past nine years. Japanese unions are enterprise-based rather than industry-wide, and as a result, tend to identify strongly with the interests of the company. If unions are convinced, for example, that a high wage increase would hurt the company's competitiveness, and thus would end up eventually damaging the prospects of the workers themselves, they tend not to ask for much of an increase, says Prof Atsushi Seike of the labour economics faculty at Keio University. Japanese management for its part also tries to maintain smooth relations with workers, points out Prof Michio Nitta at Tokyo University. Nissan, for example, has agreed a 2.89 per cent increase for its workers despite making a loss this year. But as Japan's economic growth has stalled and as industrial restructuring proceeds, unionisation has fallen steadily over the past decade. After falling below 30 per cent of the workforce in 1983, the proportion declined to 24.2 per cent last year. The fall is attributed to the growing number of people working in new industries where organising labour has been difficult, and to the rising number of part-time workers. But there is little question that more workers feel that unions have not lived up to expectations. 'Wages have not increased substantially over the past several years and more people feel that the high union fees are not worth paying,' notes Mr Magota. 'It is doubtful whether Japanese labour unions in general are able to protect the interests of their members,' admits Mr Takumi Takeuchi, vice-president of the East Japan Railway Workers Union. Unions have, for example, often been willing to sacrifice current gains for future benefits. During the late 1980s, when the Japanese economy was growing strongly, unions, particularly in the motor sector, did not press for significant wage increases. Instead, they allowed management to channel excess funds into capital investment in the hope that this would raise the competitiveness of their companies. But with the current slowdown, far from reaping the benefits of their hard work and modest demands during the good years, workers are suffering the impact of excess capacity in their industries. The result was damaging from a macro-economic perspective as well, in that it allowed companies not only to increase capital investment but to turn to speculation, Mr Seike says. Unions have also been slow to address other trends such as companies introducing some forms of merit-based pay, which make the conditions and interests of workers much less uniform than they have been in the past.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that two section 245(i)'s of the INA have been enacted into law in the last two months. The other section 245(i) was enacted in the Crime Bill, Pub. L. 103&hyph;322, which created the ``S'' visa category and accompanying provisions enabling adjustment of status for ``s'' visa holders. The State Department and the INS view both section 245(i)'s as co-existing and will seek a legislative technical correction to rename one of the sections as 245(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the provisions of INA 245 are administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), appropriate regulations and/or implementing instructions will be promulgated by that agency. It is anticipated that many aliens benefiting from this amendment will indeed take advantage of the adjustment procedures rather than seek immigrant visa issuance abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Companion Provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This Act further amends the INA at section 212 by adding subsection ``(o)'', which reads as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o) An alien who has been physically present in the United States shall not be eligible to receive an immigrant visa within ninety days following departure therefrom unless_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the alien was maintaining a lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of such departure, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the alien is the spouse or unmarried child of an individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 at any date, who <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) as of May 5, 1988, was the unmarried child or spouse of the individual who obtained temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act or section 202 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) entered the United States before May 5, 1988, resided in the United States on May 5, 1988, and is not a lawful permanent resident; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) applied for benefits under section 301 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment to INA 212 encourages aliens who can benefit from the broadened INA 245 adjustment of status provisions to take advantage of them by discouraging them from seeking immigrant visa issuance from a U.S. consular post abroad. To induce such aliens to seek INA 245 adjustment of status, Congress imposed a requirement that an immigrant visa applicant be physically absent from the United States for ninety days since the last departure before an immigrant visa can be issued. Under this amendment, an alien who departs from the United States would be eligible to receive an immigrant visa on the 91st day following the departure. As can be seen in the statutory language quoted above, two classes of aliens are exempted from this provision. The first class consists of aliens maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of departure. The second class consists of the spouses and children of certain aliens who benefited from the special agricultural worker program, the legalization program, and the Cuban-Haitian adjustment provisions of IRCA, and who sought benefits under the family unity provisions of the Immigration Act of 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This regulation is being promulgated to implement the INA 212(o) prohibitions of issuance on immigrant visas to aliens who have not complied with the ninety day physical absence requirement, unless the aliens fall within either one of the two specific excepted classes of aliens. Pursuant to this regulation, consular officers shall refuse to issue immigrant visas to aliens who have been physically present in the United States unless 90 days have passed since their departure or unless they are members of either of the two excepted classes of aliens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is not expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This rule imposes no reporting or record-keeping action from the public requiring the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements. This rule has been reviewed as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempted from E.O. 12866 but has been reviewed to ensure consistency therewith and vetted with INS through OMB to ensure interagency coordination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

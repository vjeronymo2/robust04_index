			<p>BFN     [Text] The 31st provincial government executive meeting  was convened yesterday morning [25 April]. It was presided over  by Governor Ruan Chongwu and attended by Executive Vice Governor  Wang Xiaofeng; Vice Governors Chen Suhou and Liu Mingqi; Liu  Xuebin, special assistant to the governor; and government  Secretary General Cui Zhongjun. The leaders of relevant  provincial departments attended the meeting as guests.    The participants analyzed and discussed the province's  economic situation in the first quarter of 1994. The meeting  stated that by and large, the province's national economy grew  steadily and normally in the first quarter of this year, with  the province's total accumulated industrial output value  reaching 2.089 billion yuan, representing a 3 percent increase  over the corresponding period last year. The province's early  wheat, tropical fruits, and aquatic products grew rapidly and  well, and registered substantial output increases. The  province's town and township enterprises also registered dynamic  growth, with their output value registering a 120 percent  increase over the same period last year. The province's  investment structure underwent drastic readjustments, with the  result that the province's total fixed-asset investment reached  1.922 billion yuan, up by 68.4 percent over the same period last  year, and the province's total investment in key projects  reached 887 million yuan, up by 177 percent over the same period  last year.    The meeting noted that since last year, the province has  made  unreserved efforts to develop commodity housing. As a result,  the province's total area of commodity housing in the first  quarter of this year registered an 81.8 percent increase over  the corresponding period last year. In the first quarter of  this year, the province's sales and area of commodity housing  increased by 260 percent and 140 percent, respectively, compared  with the corresponding period last year. The province's total  foreign trade volume, including both import and export trade  volumes, reached 538 million yuan, representing a 25.5 percent  increase over the same period last year. The province's social  commodity retail volume reached 2.249 billion yuan, up by 39  percent over the same period last year. In the first quarter of  this year, the province actually used a total of $1.4 billion in  foreign funds, representing a 34.7 percent increase over the  same period last year. Moreover, the province maintained a  balance between revenue and expenditure, and enjoyed a basically  stable financial situation.    The meeting also pinpointed a series of problems plaguing  the  province's economic operations, including a drastic drop in  grain- and sugarcane-growing areas, an excessive slowdown in  industrial growth, a rapid drop in the output value of large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, slow light industrial  growth, a slight drop in export volume, and a sustained shortage  of funds, as well as a drastic drop in revenue and soaring  prices on the part of some cities and counties.    The meeting held that the province's difficulties have  resulted from a multitude of contradictions. Given the current  nationwide macroeconomic retrenchment, the province should make  more energetic efforts to press ahead with all sorts of reforms,  optimize the economic structure, raise economic efficiency, and  maintain sustained economic growth in hopes of eventually  bringing the province's economy back into a benign cycle.    The meeting emphatically called for enhancing the province's  economic work in the months ahead by improving macroeconomic  supervision and control; speeding up readjustment of the  industrial structural and the product mix; further developing  production; bringing about sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic growth; increasing effective investment in both  agriculture and the construction of key projects; guaranteeing  sufficient funds for the production of readily marketable  products; continually and vigorously quickening the pace of  reforms; stepping up price control and market building; and  energetically improving the investment environment.</p>

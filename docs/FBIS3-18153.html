			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Social Democrats More </F> Popular"]    [Text] The Social Democratic Party's support is now clearly  larger than in the parliamentary election of 1991. Conversely,  the Swedish People's Party has not been able to draw any  advantage from the popularity of presidential candidate  Elisabeth Rehn. This is seen from one of the polls that the  Finnish Broadcasting Company released on Wednesday [9 February].    The Social Democratic Party is now supported by 32.5 percent  of eligible voters, compared with 22 percent in the  parliamentary election three years ago. Support for both the  Center and Conservative Parties is now put at 17.5 percent. In  1991 almost 25 percent voted for the Center Party and over 19  percent for the Conservatives. The survey was done by  Taloustutkimous [marketing research firm] in January-February. A  total of 1,900 citizens were asked their opinion.</p>

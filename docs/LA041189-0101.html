			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poors Corp. and Moody's Investors Service have affirmed their  high credit ratings for St. Joseph Health System in Orange.  </P> <P> Officials of St. Joseph, a nonprofit operator of several hospitals and the  Health Plan of America health maintenance organization, made their biannual  presentation to the financial rating services in December. S&amp;P gave the  company an A+ rating; Moody's gave it an A1.  </P> <P> The "A" rating is considered "investment grade," indicating a minimal risk that  a corporate bond issue will default.  </P> <P> Many hospitals have experienced downgradings in credit ratings over the past  several years in the face of lower occupancy rates.  </P> <P> "Our strong occupancy rates . . . as well as positive performance projections  for the next 5 years persuaded the agencies to continue our high ratings," said  President Robert O'Leary.  </P></p>

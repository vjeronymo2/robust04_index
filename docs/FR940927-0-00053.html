			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) EPA commented that the authority for certifying the completion of coal reclamation resides with the President of the Navajo Nation but that section 411(a) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 assigned the authority for the certification to the Director of NAMLRD. As stated in response to the same comment by Navajo EPA (comment No. 18), OSM responds that the request for concurrence with the Navajo Nation's certification was actually submitted by the President of the Navajo Nation in compliance with section 411(a) of SMCRA and in conformance with EPA's comment on which tribal authority should make the certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) EPA expressed concern that the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 does not provide for the Secretary's concurrence with the certification of completion of coal reclamation. SMCRA provides that the Secretary shall concur with a Tribe's or State's certification of completion of coal reclamation. Therefore, OSM responds that the Navajo Nation plan does not require revision for an action taken by the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) EPA stated that it had understood that NAMLRD's Reclamation Plan would be revised to include work at priority 3 abandoned uranium mine sites, meaning NAMLRD would conduct work on abandoned uranium mine sites that exhibited environmental hazards and degradation. EPA stated further that it appeared no priority had been assigned to uranium sites in the Navajo Nation Rules at II(D)(2), pertaining to noncoal reclamation priorities prior to certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 403(a) of SMCRA provides, prior to certification of completion of coal reclamation, that ``priority 3'' is the restoration of lands and water and the environment previously degraded by adverse effects of coal mining practices. After certification, section 411(c) of SMCRA provides that priority 3 is the restoration of lands and water and the environment previously degraded by the adverse effects of mineral mining and processing practices. Title IV of SMCRA does not prioritize noncoal commodities, and sections 411 (e) and (f) of SMCRA provide that community impact assistance and public facilities projects may be undertaken as they relate to the priorities for noncoal reclamation. In this notice, OSM found that the Navajo Nation plan has been revised to meet the requirements of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations for noncoal reclamation subsequent to certification. OSM is aware that EPA, among others, continues to work with the Navajo Nation to develop a plan to address abandoned uranium mine sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) EPA asked that the Navajo Nation clarify provisions of its AMLR Code of 1987 and the Navajo Nation Rules to provide that the Nation's President has the authority to undertake action at a noncoal site before certification of completion of coal reclamation. The rules provide that this authority resides with the President of the Navajo Nation, but the code allows the Director of NAMLRD to conduct reclamation activities and take other remedial actions on noncoal sites. This comment is immaterial in light of the Secretary's concurrence in this notice with the Navajo Nation's certification of completion of coal reclamation on Navajo Nation lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) In a related manner, EPA suggested that the community participation process for reclamation at noncoal sites is not consistent between provisions of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and the Navajo Nation Rules. Specifically, EPA asked what mechanism ensures that a request for noncoal reclamation to the Director of NAMLRD will reach the President who has authority to request reclamation at noncoal sites and what feedback mechanism existed to inform the community of what actions will be taken. OSM, in approving the proposed Navajo Nation plan amendment that is the subject of this notice, has determined that the Tribe's public participation process for determining the priority of community assistance projects meets the requirements of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey chief executive to resign Mr Richard Wakeling is to quit as chief executive of Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, at the end of this month. He is expected to receive compensation in the region of Pounds 330,000. Mr Wakeling is not being replaced, but Mr David Davies, chairman, is to take on the chief executive role as well. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, a non-executive director, is becoming deputy chairman. Mr Wakeling, 46, joined JM as a non-executive director in 1987, when he was finance director of Charter Consolidated which held a 38.5 per cent stake in JM. Charter sold its stake a year ago. He became deputy chief executive in January 1990 and chief executive in January 1991. JM said it wished Mr Wakeling well in his 'alternative career'. JM said yesterday that Mr Wakeling's job had been to supervise the three year reorganisation of the group and he had now completed his task. It had been the consensus view of the board that his job was no longer necessary. It said that operational management was strong and Mr Davies was a hands-on executive chairman. Further, the group had talked to its institutional shareholders about combining the chairman and chief executive roles. The changes had been approved by two non-executives representing the group's two largest shareholders, Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Minorco, which hold 20 per cent between them bought from Charter. Mr Chris Clark, executive director in charge of materials technology, becomes managing director, materials technology, colour and print. Mr Graham Titcombe, executive director, precious metals and catalytic systems, becomes managing director with the same responsibilities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hague -- The environment committee of the  multilateral Middle East peace negotiations met for one day of  talks in the Hague today, Thursday.    Informed Foreign Ministry sources said Jordan did not send  an  official delegation to the session because we are still awaiting  Washington's decision on the Port of al-'Aqabah blockade,  anticipated this week.    Jordan, sources told AL-RA'Y, sent its ambassador in Rome  Hasan Abu-Na'imah to the Hague meeting as an observer rather  than participant.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / New Irish leaders face tough initiation A NEW coalition government will take office in Ireland this week and will have to confront the country's most serious currency crisis since 1986, when the punt was last devalued. The government is likely to be formed tomorrow following a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister. The Labour party last night gave its seal of approval to the coalition programme, paving the way for a government to be formed. Fianna Fail has been running a minority, caretaker government since the general election last November, in which no party won an absolute majority. The two parties reaffirmed this weekend that they would continue to support the no-devaluation policy of the outgoing government. Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said the punt 'would not be devalued and would maintain its existing parity within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism'. The punt is none the less expected to come under renewed pressure in the currency markets this week, despite an increase in overnight lending rates to 100 per cent by the central bank on Thursday. Two of Ireland's leading building societies have warned, however, that they may be forced to raise mortgage rates this week if the currency and interest rates crisis continues. Many analysts believe a further mortgage rate increase would deal a crippling blow to the economy and force the government to devalue. Last week Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, expressed disappointment with his EC colleagues for failing to tackle the ERM crisis and called the German agreement to support the French franc a 'sweetheart deal' which had not been made available to the other currencies in the central band of the ERM.</p>

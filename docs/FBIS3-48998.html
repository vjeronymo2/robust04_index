			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Finance Minister Ivan Szabo by </F> Istvan Varga; place and date not given: "Past the Nadir After  Three Years -- Ivan Szabo on Economic Growth and Crisis Sectors"]    [Text] Hungarian economic changes require greater  sacrifices than were expected by many people in 1990. The gross  domestic product [GDP] decreased by 15 percent in three years,  although the decline appears to have stopped this year and it is  possible that a solid growth will start next year. The question  is how fast and lasting the upturn will be. A brief period of  growth could easily be followed by another decline. In order to  avoid this, the banking system has to be put in order, a further  swelling of the budget deficit has to be curbed, and Hungarian  exports have to increase. We interviewed Finance Minister Ivan  Szabo on the chances and the effect of the factors that depend  on us and that are independent of us.    [Varga] Recently you said a number of times that the  Hungarian economy has arrived at the threshold of growth. What  is the basis for this statement?    [Szabo] When we talk about the whole economy, we have to  look at its various elements. One of these is industry, which  started to move in a positive direction from the fourth quarter  of 1992 and production has been increasing every month. It  seems that, by the end of the year, industry will have produced  4 percent more than in 1992. Agriculture is in an emphatically  bad situation, it has many wounds. On the basis of yields and  the sown area, it can be established that the drought that has  lasted many years and caused specially large damage this year  caused most losses. However, it has to be admitted that the  changeover also has a price: The slowest structural change is  in agriculture and it is far behind the pace of industrial  transformation. Services that include transport is the third  big area of the economy. There is a general boom in the service  sector. The small and medium size enterprises that are part of  the private sphere in this sector have reached as much as 15 to  20 percent growth. On the other hand, road, railway, and water  transport suffered untold losses, mainly due to the Yugoslav  embargo. Therefore, we can conclude that the economy is drawn  back by the low performance of agriculture and transport.  Otherwise the GDP would already be showing an increase.  <H5>  Special Support to Agriculture </H5>   [Varga] How much loss does the UN embargo cause to Hungary?    [Szabo] According to calculations, this now reaches $1.2  billion. However, it has to be added that $300 million arose in  1992 and this year's figure approaches $900 million.    [Varga] What does the government do to improve the situation  in agriculture, which is the main crisis sector?    [Szabo] The government is trying its best, but it can only  be hoped that the many-years-long drought will end. The amount  of agricultural support will increase by 20 percent in the 1994  budget. I expect much from the fruition of the association  agreement with the European Union. In this respect, it is  positive that the GATT talks have ended, which also gives  Hungary more room for maneuver. Unfortunately, in the area of  transport, we cannot expect significant changes until the  situation outside our border changes.  <H5>  If Recession Ends.... </H5>   [Varga] Experts also admit that a solid growth can be  expected next year, but they immediately ask how lasting the  growth is going to be. They mention the deficit of the state  administration as the main hindering factor.    [Szabo] Undoubtedly, the level of the deficit of state  administration causes liquidity problems in the economy. The  reason is that the state bonds tie up the mobile capital of the  banks. However, two factors have to be added to this. One is  that our state administration's deficit would not be one of the  worst in Western Europe. It is a different matter that, in  their case, the budget deficit is in an economy that is  operating better than ours. In addition to this the crisis that  was caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union can be felt  everywhere. Compared to the GDP, the deficit is twice as much  in Sweden, and one and a half to two times as much in England  and Belgium. I think that we managed to stop the increase of  the budget deficit this year. It seems that we will be able to  keep to the level of the deficit defined in this year's  supplementary budget. I honestly hope that we will also be able  to say the same next year. If we reach this point, then the  many- years-long process, namely that the deficit is always  bigger than planned, will be reversed.    [Varga] Do you feel that the economy can now start on a  course of lasting growth?    [Szabo] I am convinced that it can. However, it has to be  seen clearly that Hungary's economy is basically dependent on  foreign markets and more than half of the gross national product  is sold abroad. Therefore, Hungarian economic development  mainly depends on the West European countries. The fact that we  did not manage to achieve growth this year is largely a  consequence of the decline there. The forecasts referring to  the European Union and the European Free Trade Association  [EFTA] indicate that economic growth will also start there in  1994. A modest growth in Western Europe can have a decisive  effect on Hungarian exports. A 1-percent growth abroad can  increase Hungarian exports by as much as 25 percent. Therefore,  to answer the question how lasting the growth will be, I can say  that this depends very much on foreign market conditions.    [Varga] Bank and debtor consolidation will be implemented in  December 1993 and next year. According to the government's  promise, this is the last step to putting the economy back in  order.    [Szabo] This is needed because all losses that have  accumulated in the economy over the past years now appear as  dubious or bad debts. This is where everything culminates. The  majority of bad debts originate from the crisis of circular  debts that has been pushed along since 1988 and 1989, and it  amounted to 300 billion [currency not specified] already then.  And at that time, the forint had a different value.    Putting this area in order will eliminate most of the ruins  forever. On one hand, bank and debtor consolidation gives an  opportunity for the economy to rid itself of burdens that even  effect enterprises that operate well. This helps preserve  workplaces that, after a while, will lead to reducing the  solidarity fund and welfare expenditure. The other result of  the tidying up of banks will be that the capital ratio of  domestic banks will improve. The stability of the various  financial institutions will increase and the gap between  interest rate on deposits and loans will narrow. The  improvement of the capital ratio will also increase the  privatization chances of banks.    [Varga] What is needed to be able to sell the currently  rather-shaky banks on good terms?    [Szabo] According to European norms, a normally operating  capital ratio is at around 8 percent, and banks that have less  than this find it difficult to find a buyer. The capital ratio  of Hungarian banks is incredibly low, it is usually under 0  percent. If we privatizaed a bank under these circumstances, I  am afraid that it would have to be given away free and even then  the buyer would be generous. If the state was not putting 300  billion forints into the banking sector then the buyers would  have to do this. It is obvious that, if we do not consolidate  the banks, then we will lose the purchase price. However,  raising the capital ratio to 4 percent or even higher will make  it possible for us to sell the banks on better conditions. At  the same time, it is much easier to increase this figure from 4  or 6 percent to above 8 percent. In this case, it will be worth  buying a bank, especially if the investor group can acquire a  significant economic role through this. I believe that the  technical and finance-technical conditions will be adequate by  the middle of next year for bank privatization to begin.    [Varga] The investors of which countries show most interest?    [Szabo] Mainly European interest is big which we can also  see from the fact that many foreign banks, not having found any  healthy Hungarian banks, have established subsidiaries in  Hungary. However, I must add that interest is shown literally  from all over the world, because even a Malay bank was recently  established in Budapest. Interestingly, the London-based  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] shows a  remarkably great interest in bank privatization and it would  like to become part owner of several Hungarian financial  institutions.  <H5>  The Stages of Integration </H5>   [Varga] Whether we look at the import of capital or the  export of goods, contacts with Western Europe is the key issue  of the Hungarian economy's development. In your view, when will  Hungary be admitted to the European Union [EU]?    [Szabo] In my view, EU membership has many conditions. One  is legal harmonization, and the institutional structure also has  to be set up. In my view, we are not behind in these. The  transitional period while we are associate members will be  enough for us to prepare for the membership. Considering all  this, I expect that full membership will be possible to achieve  sometime between 1997 and 2000. By this time, our institutional  and economic development can reach the point at which  unification will not be much of a problem either for Europe or  for Hungary.    [Varga] Will the political or the economic conditions of  membership be more difficult to fulfill?    [Szabo] Economic conditions certainly play a determining  role. Politically it is also important for Europe that the  countries of this region are economically solid, otherwise we  can also shake their stability. This would have far-reaching  negative political consequences. It is a completely different  matter that economic integration has to be concomitant with some  kind of integration in security policy. However, I believe it  is Western Europe's fundamental interest that these countries  that are economically linked to it do not belong somewhere else  politically. The one supposes the other.    [Varga] How do you assess the achievements so far?    [Szabo] I believe that Hungary has been taking the hurdles  of transition very well. The challenges in our region are huge.  I think that if Hungary wants to create serious chances for  itself, then 1994 will be a good occasion for this. We have to  preserve the Hungarian economy from disarray, hyper-inflation,  or chaos. If Hungary remains to be an island of peace, both in  political and economic terms, then it can make a very big step  forward. It can prove to the world that Hungary does not follow  fashions and avoids right- or left-wing extremism and this meets  the European standards.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Bonds: ADollars deals feature while activity slows ACTIVITY in the international bond market slowed yesterday after Monday's busy start to the week, with a handful of deals in Australian dollars and European currencies. Shell Australia and Coca Cola Amatil both came to the market with Australian dollar deals which were well-received, helped by the fact that the short-to-medium end of the market has been relatively . Westpac, which lead managed Shell's ADollars 100m five-year bond, noted strong demand for Australian dollar bonds, saying that recent redemptions have left investors with Australian dollars which need to be reinvested. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) launched a DM500m 10-year issue with a coupon of 8 1/8 per cent and priced to yield 8.22 per cent, or 10 basis points over the September 1991 German government bond. The IADB issue represents part of the bank's core funding and Deutsche Bank, the lead manager, said the bonds were bought mainly by domestic investors given that foreign interest in D-Mark issues is rather limited. The bonds traded at 99.80 - within fees - by mid-afternoon. In the French franc sector, SNCF launched a FFr1 bn zero coupon bond, lead managed by Credit Commercial de France. The six-year bond is fungible with SNCF's earlier FFr1bn issue. It was priced to yield 8.67 per cent, the same as the 9.5 per cent OAT due 1998, but 22 basis points over the level where the first tranche is trading in the secondary market. The bond was reoffered at the issue price of 58.60 and traded at 58.55-58.65 according to the lead manager. About 35 per cent of the issue was sold to Swiss investors and 20 per cent to French investors.</p>

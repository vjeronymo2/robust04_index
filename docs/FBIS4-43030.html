			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wolfgang Schweitzer] </F>   [Excerpts] Vienna, June 10 (AFP) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency voted Friday [10 June] to suspend technical  assistance to North Korea amid growing outrage at the Stalinist  regime's refusal to allow access to suspected nuclear  installations.    The suspension constitutes one of the toughest forms of  sanction the world nuclear watchdog can take against a member  state.    The 35-member IAEA board of governors took the decision by  28  votes to one with four abstensions, amid Pyongyang's continued  refusal to allow full inspection of nuclear sites suspected of  producing material for nuclear arms. [passage omitted]    In the IAEA vote, Libya voted against, while China, India,  Syria and Lebanon abstained. Cuba and Saudi Arabia did not take  part.    The decision by the board of governors provides "in  conformity with the provisions of...the (IAEA) Statute, to  suspend non-medical Agency assistance to the DPRK (North  Korea)." [passage omitted]    The IAEA noted in its resolution "with deep regret" that the  "limited opportunity...to select, segregate, and secure fuel  rods from the DPRK's five-megawatt reactor for later  measurements in accordance with Agency standards" had been lost.  The Agency also regretted it was no longer possible to  ascertain whether nuclear material had been diverted from the  reactor.    The Agency added it "deplores the DPRK's failure to  implement  essential elements of resolutions of the Board (of Governors)"  and called on Pyongyang to cooperate fully and provide access  "to all safeguards-relevant information and locations."    The IAEA governors strongly commended the "tireless efforts"  of its Director General Hans Blix and the IAEA secretariat to  obtain North Korea's cooperation in implementing safeguards  agreements, calling on them to continue their work.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ZONING PROPOSAL TO GET MORE STUDY  </P> <P> After a public hearing on zoning proposals that could change the character of  two historic Old Towne neighborhoods, the Planning Commission voted unanimously  to further study the issue and tour the areas.  </P> <P> Despite land-use studies and four public workshops this spring, plus  discussions on the future of the Cypress Street and Santa Fe Railroad Depot  neighborhoods, the commissioners agreed that further study is needed before  they can make a recommendation to the City Council.  </P> <P> City officials want to rezone the Cypress Street area to make it consistent  with the Orange General Plan. Part of the six-block area of mostly  single-family homes is now zoned to allow four or more units per lot, but is  designated for three units per lot in the General Plan. The commission is  considering proposals that will allow two, three and four units per lot.  </P> <P> The commission is also considering plans to change the Railroad Depot area from  a light industrial to a residential and limited-business district. Another  public hearing is scheduled June 18.MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

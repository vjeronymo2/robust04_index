			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Useful data Sir, The appointment of a Central Statistical Office director (January 15) with a policy of making economic data more useful to the commercial world represents a welcome reversal of the apparent long-standing official view that governments collect statistics for their own purposes and any benefit to the taxpayer from their publication is purely incidental. In this connection, the early reinstatement of the Commercial and industrial floorspace statistics (which last appeared in 1986) and the full Census of distribution (which has not appeared since 1971) would earn Mr McLennan the approbation of planners, property developers, retailers and investors, to list but a few.

			<p>Comprehensive   Nuclear Recycling Technology   <F P=102> 94FE0360A Tokyo ENERUGI FORAMU in Japanese Dec 93 p 16--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0360A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ENERUGI FORAMU </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] On the afternoon of 25 October, PNC held a "Report  and Lecture Conference." In his presentation on international  relations, PNC Assistant Chairman of the Board Mitsuo Taguchi  made the following statement: "Last year PNC underwent 17  percent of the total amount of inspections worldwide by the  IAEA, which added up to 1400 man-days." Needless to say, this is  the kind of strict international scrutiny that results from  Japan's plutonium utilization. The number of man-days works out  to four inspectors from foreign countries conducting  international inspections at PNC facilities every day of the  year. In fact, the IAEA's "eyes of non-proliferation" are  focused more sharply on Japan than anywhere else in the world.    In his introductory greeting, Chairman of the Board Takao  Ishiwatari touched on the international situation, including  increasing concern over the problem of excess plutonium  resulting from the dismantling of nuclear weapons accompanying  the end of the Cold War. He said, "The FBR, fuel recycling, and  plutonium utilization put us on a radical path of atomic energy  development and use. We must respond to concerns raised by the  international community." He also revealed a plan to proceed  with international cooperative research with the U.S. and France  on mixing and burning minor actinide series transuranium  elements (neptunium, americium, etc.) with plutonium. In a  sense, as a response to foreign concern over Japan's use of  plutonium, this research will lead to utilization of "nuclear  proliferation resistant" enhanced plutonium that is blended so  nuclear outlaws will leave it alone. Moreover, because this  technology also burns up the minor actinides that are normally  present in high level waste, it may kill two birds with one  stone by easing the burden of high level waste disposal, which  is the greatest problem the nuclear power industry must confront.    As a backdrop for all this, the U.S. Department of Energy's  budget proposal in April authorized the burning of actinides in  the experimental breeder reactor (EBR II), and funding for the  IFR (Integral Fast Reactor), which had been eliminated, was  restored by a House-Senate conference committee in Congress on  14 October.    In the spring of 1977, President Carter essentially put a  halt to breeder reactor development, and although both are  Democrats and President Clinton's non-proliferation policy must  cope with the problem of plutonium from dismantled weapons,  after 16 years this is, in essence, welcome news. France, on the  other hand, remains silent. In Japan, however, informed persons  have been deeply distressed because the Atomic Energy Commission  has been holding hearings to revise the Long Term Plan for one  year and three months, but the long-awaited report on FBR  commercialization, which includes plans for the first FBR  demonstration reactor, is still not ready for submission because  of "evasion tactics" by some in the electric power industry.  <H5>  Fuel Facility Automated, Remote Control Plant </H5>   Returning to the main topic, PNC also revealed issues to be  addressed and future prospects for technical progress through  the cooperative development of this advanced plutonium recycling  technology by Japan, France, and the U.S. Yoshiro Takahashi  (Assistant Director, Development Promotion Division, PNC)  appealed that we should change our concept of plutonium  recycling as merely technological development intended to clean  up the leftovers of LWR power generation and stated, "The ratio  of isotopes in which nuclear fission occurs (fissile quantity)  drops off only slightly even when the number of recycling passes  is increased." "We can utilize minor actinides, which are  elements we have thrown away in the past, as a source of fuel  and reduce the burden on the back end (disposal of high level  waste)," and "We must look at this from the standpoint of a  comprehensive technology from LWR to FBR to recycling."    From the standpoint of fuels, Shojio Kawada (Assistant  Director, Reprocessing Technology Development Division, PNC)  stated, "In reprocessing we must first develop technology for  isolating and recovering transuranium elements, and because we  will no longer need a purification process, the overall process  will be shortened."    Because of the intense radioactivity, however, operation of  the plant must be automated, and maintenance must be performed  by remote control. Construction of this Recycling Equipment  Testing Facility (RETF) will begin next spring.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Miyazawa's frail grip exposed: The cruel humbling of the Japanese prime minister A FEW days ago Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, looked forward with justifiable relish to the Group of Seven summit next month in Tokyo where he would have been one of the stronger world leaders on display. Now he will be fortunate if he has the pleasure of hosting the gathering. His relative strength was partly a reflection of weakness or changes elsewhere in the world leadership, but Mr Miyazawa's frail grip on Japanese power has been cruelly exposed by the events of the past few days. Instead of showing leadership, he has been relegated to a bit part by other faction leaders in the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Mr Miyazawa's fate will be determined by a no-confidence motion presented yesterday by opposition parties and scheduled to be voted on today in the lower house of the Diet, the Japanese parliament. If the vote is lost, the prime minister must dissolve his cabinet or call a general election within 10 days. LDP officials were coaxing reform-minded members of the party not to abstain or defect during the no-confidence vote, and one compromise apparently offered last night was Mr Miyazawa's political head. The resignation of the prime minister would not itself bring political reform, but it would enable the reformers to argue that they had achieved something. Mr Miyazawa was said yesterday to 'regret' that he had not supported the original LDP proposal for reform, which could not win parliamentary approval and was designed to ensure that the scandal-prone political system remained unaltered. Japan has a system of multi-seat constituencies which encourages competition among the LDP factions, making politics an expensive business and tempting politicians to accept illegal donations in return for a wink, a nod and a lucrative construction contract. Opposition parties are in favour of a system mixing single seats and proportional representation, which they reckon would increase their chances of success against the LDP. The four largest opposition parties are yet to agree on the fine details of reform, but they did agree to move the no-confidence motion yesterday against the Miyazawa cabinet. Even if the no-confidence motion fails, Mr Miyazawa, aged 73, has given another bumbling performance this week that has lowered his standing and probably shortened his prime ministerial life. For a month last year, during the height of a corruption scandal, he was speechless when asked about the fate of the scandal-stricken godfather of Japanese politics, Mr Shin Kanemaru. The mute Mr Miyazawa was mocked by television reports, which showed him inspecting dairy cattle, attending local fairs, and ambling into parliament but refusing to answer Kanemaru-related questions. He was reticent because Mr Kanemaru had kindly done the backroom work to ensure his appointment as prime minister. In the weeks after this self-imposed silence, Mr Miyazawa's popularity rating plunged to 12 per cent - at last count it was 25 per cent. These poor returns are in contrast to the popular optimism at the time of his appointment two years ago, when he was portrayed as the thinking person's LDP faction head, relatively liberal and, perhaps, the man to wield the reform broom. 'The most important task of my time in office will be to get rid of money politics,' he said then. But he has not been able to bring himself to overturn the system which made him, leaving him particularly vulnerable at a time when an appropriate scapegoat is needed. Before he lost control of the reform debate, Mr Miyazawa had a fair chance of extending his stay in office when the present term ends in September. He knew his place, leaving other LDP factions to bicker over the policies that mattered most to them, while showing signs of leadership during a difficult debate over whether Japanese military personnel should be sent abroad on peacekeeping missions. But his chances of a second term have diminished each day this week. If a snap election is held, the LDP is likely to fare badly, and the prime minister will be under extreme pressure to resign. If an election is not called, he will face continuing attacks from the reformers in the LDP. Mr Miyazawa, and other LDP elders, must long for the return of Mr Kanemaru, who is awaiting trial on tax evasion charges. The godfather had the clout to keep maverick factions in line, and it was the splitting of his own faction that led to the creation of the one led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, a former finance minister, which is threatening to vote against the government today. Perhaps the prime minister was prescient when he at last ended his self-imposed silence on the Kanemaru case - on the day the godfather resigned, a dazed Mr Miyazawa shook his head and said: 'It's a very unfortunate thing.'</p>

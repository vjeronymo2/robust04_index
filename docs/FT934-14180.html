			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (12): 100 million lines by year 2000 - China's telephone target / The big growth area for foreign telecom exporters to China is public switching equipment IN THE face of China's critical shortage of telephone lines and public switching equipment, foreign telecommunications manufacturers are engaged in an intense battle for market share to meet the enormous consumer demand in the world's fastest growing economy. 'It's a big, big market,' comments a western business executive from a telecommunications multinational. 'No matter how fast China's population grows, the demand for telephones is still increasing at phenomenal rates.' China has 17 million phone lines. It has already nearly reached its target for the country's five-year plan, which ends in 1995. China's official goal now is to have 100 million lines operating by the year 2000. Nationwide, this means China has about 1.7 telephones for every 100 people. In contrast, the United States has about 60 telephones per 100 people. China's public pay phones are scarce and the utilisation rate is so heavy domestically that most telephones are busy ninety per cent of the time. In addition, getting through to the right number is difficult - 'the 'hit rate' is so bad that callers have to recall and redial and recall,' says a western businessman. The largest growth area for foreign telecommunication exporters is public switching equipment, which some industry sources say is a billion dollar marketplace in China. The country is modernising and updating its telephone exchanges by installing 'stored program computers' (SPCs) to replace the older electro-mechanical equipment to do the switching. The dominant equipment manufacturers in this market are Alcatel, Ericsson, Northern Telecom, Siemens, NEC, Fujitsu, and AT &amp; T. Initially, China's State Council allowed only three of these multinationals to form Sino-foreign joint ventures to manufacture switching equipment. These were Shanghai Bell, which is an affiliate of Alcatel, a Beijing-based joint venture by Siemens, and a company formed with Japan's NEC in Tianjin. But other multinationals were unhappy at being frozen out. Under pressure from the American government and lobbying by various companies, industry sources said the Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recently agreed to ease restrictions on the lucrative switching market. Northern Telecom recently concluded a Dollars 159m deal to sell switching contracts to four Chinese provinces and expects to begin producing switching equipment in Quangdong province in southern China by the end of the year or by early 1994. Earlier this year, AT &amp; T was also given permission to launch a joint venture in Qingdao to manufacture switching equipment. In February, AT &amp; T signed a far-reaching memorandum of understanding to jointly develop manufacturing plants and research and development projects in China's telecommunications industry. The competition has intensified in the last year as customers have sought to purchase equipment with more than just switching capability. 'Customers are looking for more and more high-tech products - and not just pure switching capacity,' explains a western business executive. 'The customer is concerned with quality, performance and the different functions of switching equipment.' Industry sources report that Japanese suppliers, such as NEC and others, have lost some market share to other foreign manufacturers in China in the last year. They report that the top three foreign companies are Alcatel with 31.2 per cent of the market, Ericsson 23.6 per cent, and Northern Telecom with 19.1 per cent. As the market leader, Alcatel is the most aggressive. Its joint venture with Shanghai Bell has more than trebled its design capacity of over 300,000 lines to produce more than two million lines last year. Alcatel also sold an additional two million lines direct to various MPTs. Alcatel has also been able to obtain soft loans from various European governments for telecommunications purchases. Its Belgian subsidiary signed a Dollars 250m loan with the Chinese in the spring. And the company's Spanish subsidiary agreed to an even larger Dollars 500m deal for the purchase of telecommunication switches. Meanwhile, Ericsson has won a Dollars 300m contract to install 1.8m lines in Guangdong over the next few years. Demand is so great that Siemens has also doubled its original production capacity in its Beijing operation from one million lines to 1.5m this year and 2m next year. Last year the joint venture produced 370,000 lines. Apart from switching equipment (or SPCs), another booming growth area is the cellular mobile phone market. 'It's expanding so rapidly that you can't compare it with anything else in the world,' says a business executive. Ericsson and Motorola are the leaders of this market. Both have manufacturing operations in China. Siemens has also recently announced it is establishing a joint venture in Shanghai to produce radio handsets and transmission equipment. Though the cellular market is growing dramatically, industry sources say it is still relatively small for the country's size. Subscribers are still less than 300,000, although line capacity is about a million. In comparison, Hong Kong, which has a population of 5.5m, has about 250,000 subscribers. Mobile telephone subscriber costs are high in China. Subscriber fees are about 25,000 renminbi (USDollars 4,386), but demand is still great for this service, particularly in China's Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, and in the country's rural hinterland. Cellular phones are more attractive to many business customers because a radio network can be installed more quickly than cables could ever be laid for a conventional telephone system. Other promising areas of growth include micro-wave equipment and optical fibre cables to link China's more remote areas. Optical fibre systems are increasingly being used for long distance transmission in China because the quality of communications is said to be better than that of microwav systems; and cable systems are less subject to climatic interference. But microwaves still have some advantages over optical fibre systems. For particularly long distances, the equipment requires less time to installation time and causes less disruption in cities where roads would need to be dug up to lay cables.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            LEADING TELECOM MARKETS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Phone   Phone   Line               CAG             lines   lines   growth             rate*           Invest.             per     per     1992-              since           as             100     100     2000,    Revenue   1982, Invest-   per cent             popn,   popn,   in       in 1991,  per   ment      of Country     1991    1992    '000s**  Dollars m cent  in 1991   revenue  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan        45.4    59.2   20,000   49,107    2.1   17,844    36.3 Australia    46.4    54.1    2,500    7,426    4.3    2,329    31.4 South Korea  33.7    48.4    8,000    6,119   10.3    3,249    53.1 India         0.7     2.1   15,000    2,698   10.1    1,584    58.4 China         0.7     2.3   20,000    2,671      -    1,617    60.6 Kong Kong    45.9    64.9    1,500    2,364    7.1      283    12.0 New Zealand  44.2    58.2      500    1,485    2.7      385    25.9 Singapore    39.9    57.1      600    1,326   11.5      639    48.2 Indonesia     0.7     2.1    3,000    1,320   11.4      792    60.0 Thailand      2.7     8.6    4,000    1,300   14.2      550    42.3 Malaysia      9.9    29.1    5,000    1,092    9.7      504    46.1 Philippines   1.0     3.0    2,000      604    7.3      300    49.6 Pakistan      1.0     2.5    3,000      539    6.9      269    49.9 Sri Lanka     0.7     2.4      300      118    7.3       19    15.7 Total/average*  -       -   85,400   78,169    3.7*  30,364    39.9*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Countries are ranked by 1991 revenues.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *CAG rate indicates compound annual growth rate. **Forecast.

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC FEARS HISTORY WILL REPEAT  </P> <P> Written into the grass at Arizona Stadium -- in block letters that stretch  between the 35-yard lines -- is the motivational reminder: "Bear Down."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Arizona, a similar message isn't painted onto the artificial  turf at Oregon State's Parker Stadium, where last week the Wildcats were upset  by the previously winless Beavers.  </P> <P> The 35-21 loss all but eliminated Arizona from the Rose Bowl race and tried the  patience of Coach Dick Tomey.  </P> <P> "We're not pleased with where we are, but we've just got to accept that and go  on," said Tomey, whose team is 4-2 overall and 2-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference  going into today's game against USC (5-1, 2-1) at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> USC Coach Larry Smith called last week's game a disaster for Arizona and warned  his team this week that such a humbling loss could serve to motivate the  Wildcats, as last month's 31-0 loss to Washington seemed to revive the Trojans.  </P> <P> Of course, losing to the worst team in the conference is different than losing  to the best.  </P> <P> But to Smith, apparently, a train wreck is a train wreck.  </P> <P> "We can expect a completely different Arizona team in here," he said. "I think  we can expect them to play the best game of their lives, or of the season.  </P> <P> "What makes Arizona so dangerous is that they're where we were (after)  Washington. They had a disaster. We came back the next week against Ohio State  and played one of our best games. They're very capable of doing (the same  thing)."  </P> <P> Arizona, ranked as high as 16th this season and 21st after a dramatic 28-21  victory over UCLA two weeks ago at the Rose Bowl, fell out of the top 25 after  squandering a 21-14 third-quarter lead against Oregon State.  </P> <P> The Wildcats rank ninth in the Pac-10 in total offense and rank last in the  conference in passing -- which should be good news to the Trojans, who have  been outpassed in every game since their opener.  </P> <P> George Malauulu, a sophomore from Carson High, started at quarterback last  week, completing nine of 21 passes for 155 yards, but Tomey said Malauulu and  Ronald Veal, a starter in 28 games for the Wildcats, will both play today.  </P> <P> Malauulu collapsed after practice Tuesday and spent several hours in the  University of Arizona hospital, where his condition was diagnosed as  dehydration. He returned to practice Wednesday.  </P> <P> "George has been a little more successful throwing the ball down the field, but  Ronnie has thrown for a higher percentage," Tomey said of his quarterbacks,  neither of whom is considered a threat to win a game with his passing alone.  </P> <P> Veal has thrown 31 passes, completing 61.3% for 207 yards, and Malauulu has  thrown 51, completing 43.1% for 408 yards.  </P> <P> Arizona's strength is its running game, which ranks second in the Pac-10, and  its defense, which ranks third in the conference and is led by cornerback  Darryl Lewis, a senior from Nogales High in La Puente whom many, including  Tomey, consider the premier defensive back in college football.  </P> <P> "He's just doing everything you could ask of a cornerback," Tomey said of  Lewis, a converted running back who rushed for 1,423 yards as a senior at  Nogales.  </P> <P> Lewis made a game-saving tackle on Oregon quarterback Bill Musgrave at  Arizona's one-yard line with nine seconds to play in a 22-17 victory over the  Ducks last month and returned an interception 70 yards for the game-winning  touchdown against UCLA.  </P> <P> "They've got great speed on defense," Smith said of the Wildcats. "They've got  by far the best secondary we've played -- in terms of both hitting and pass  defense. It's like throwing into a tiger's teeth back there."  </P> <P> Arizona knows about tigers. It ran into one last Saturday.  </P> <P> Trojan Notes  </P> <P> A crowd of about 70,000 is expected for the homecoming game. . . . USC is 15-1  against Arizona, the loss occurring in 1981, when the Trojans were 4-0 and  ranked No. 1. They lost at the Coliseum, 13-10, against a team coached by Larry  Smith. . . . USC has won its last six games against Arizona.  </P></p>

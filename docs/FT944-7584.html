			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Tories face December by-election test The date of the Dudley West by-election has been set for December 15 - the latest threat to the government's slim House of Commons majority. Labour will be disappointed if it cannot win the West Midlands seat, in a contest in which the Conservatives will defend a majority of less than 6,000. Losing the seat would trim the government's majority to 13. The by-election was caused by the death last month of Mr John Blackburn, the sitting MP. In the last general election, Labour cut the Conservative majority by nearly half, even though the number of votes cast for Mr Blackburn increased by 2,500. Mr Blackburn won the seat from Labour in 1979. It contains the market towns of Kingswinford and Sedgley and has a high proportion of home owners. Mr Graham Postles, the Conservative party candidate, said yesterday that his campaign would focus on the issues of the economy and law and order. He said that he would also seek to expose 'the reality behind the rose-tinted facade of Tony Blair's new model Labour party'. Mr Postles, the director of an insurance company in Halesowen, lost narrowly to Labour's Mr Bruce George in Walsall South in the 1987 general election. Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, will join his party's candidate, Mr Ian Pearson, at Labour's campaign launch today. Mr Pearson is joint chief executive of the West Midlands Enterprise Board. Two other candidates have been named so far: Mr Michael Hadley (Liberal Democrat) and Lord David Sutch (Monster Raving Loony). 1992 result: Dr John Blackburn (C) 34,729, Kevin Lomax (Lab) 28,940, Gerry Lewis (Lib Dem) 7,446. Turnout 82.1 per cent.</p>

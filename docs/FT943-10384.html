			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Greenalls puts greater emphasis on property management John Longden's appointment as group property director of Warrington-based Greenalls, which quit brewing to concentrate on its pubs and hotels operations, is fresh evidence that the right brands and good management are not the only keys to success in the increasingly specialised pub retailing business. Greenalls is believed to be the first major pub retailer to appoint a property specialist to its main board. Longden, 49, is a chartered surveyor, who has more than 20 years experience in the drinks and leisure sector, having worked for companies ranging from Grand Metropolitan to Trust House Forte and Samuel Smith. Longden believes that pub retailers need to give the same attention to managing their property assets as do the big supermarket chains. Longden has been headhunted away from Bass, where he was director of property and deputy chairman of Bass Developments. He had been responsible for Pounds 3.2bn of properties around the world and also looked after Bass Developments which made Pounds 3m a year from developing individual properties and selling them on. Bass, in common with other brewers, has been forced to rationalise its public house estate following the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry. Consequently, Longden has been responsible for selling over 4,000 properties over the last five years, which he believes is bigger than the combined transactions of the big banks which have also been trying to make the best use of their retail outlets by selling off hundreds of surplus properties. Greenalls, which has about 2000 outlets, is considerably smaller than Bass. But Longden was attracted by the promise of a seat on the main board and the chance to join what he calls a 'very stylish and fast-moving licensed retailer'.</p>

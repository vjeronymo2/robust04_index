			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HOPES ARISE FOR NEW EMERGENCE OF LIZA IN FILM  </P> <P> LIZA MINNELLI is off to Toronto in early September to begin a new film for  Paramount titled "Stepping Out." In this one -- based on a British play -- Liza  portrays a tap dance instructor. Lewis Gilbert will direct. Her co-stars are to  be Shelley Winters, Ellen Greene, Andrea Martin and Bill Irwin.  </P> <P> This is just great news. For as electrifying as Liza Minnelli is on stage, in  concert, here is a woman made for the movies. It is unfortunate that Hollywood  has never really known what to do with Liza's oversized talent. Only "Cabaret"  for which she won the Oscar, and Martin Scorsese's "New York, New York" were  able to showcase not only her dazzling musical abilities, but the sensitivity  and wry humor of her acting.  </P> <P> Perhaps the '90s will see a new emergence of Liza on screen.  </P> <P> On the personal side, Liza has triumphed unconditionally. She fought her demons  and won, becoming a role model of willpower and determination. This in the face  of a press and public that perversely seemed to expect, no, demand that Liza  self-destruct. She has made a great success of her marriage to sculptor Mark  Gero, against daunting odds. It hasn't been 11 years of wedded bliss. It's been  years of working overtime on a relationship that both of them obviously care  about deeply. Neither one took the easy way out by throwing up their hands and  saying, "I can't handle this!" They kept it together. For the strong and  graceful handling of her personal life alone, Liza should take great and  justifiable pride.  </P> <P> Liza Minnelli in the '90s. The best is yet to be.  </P> <P> MANDY PATINKIN, currently on screen in "Dick Tracy" as 88 Keys, will soon be  back on stage. He's just been signed to star in Peter Hall's new musical "Born  Again," based on the Eugene Ionesco play "Rhinoceros." "Born Again" opens in  London this fall with an eye on Broadway for the summer 1991 season.  </P> <P> Patinkin also has a new album from Columbia coming out around Christmas. It  will include a number from William Finn's new musical "Falsettoland."  </P> <P> DINAH SHORE, at a taping of her "Conversation With Dinah" TV show, recently  asked veteran actor and fairly new author Kirk Douglas who he would like to  have star in a movie version of his first book, the autobiography "The Ragman's  Son."  </P> <P> Kirk replied that ideally the film would involve his entire family: son Peter  would produce, son Eric would play the "young" Kirk, and son Michael as the  "midlife' Douglas. He'd play himself in more recent years. However, Kirk said  he doesn't think he can afford Michael Douglas' salary, so maybe it won't be a  family affair.  </P></p>

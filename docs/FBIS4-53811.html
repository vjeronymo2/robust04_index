			<p>BFN     [Text] The approach and pace in dealing with regional  security issues topped the agenda yesterday as senior officials  began a special preparatory meeting for the ASEAN Regional Forum  (ARF) being launched in Thailand in July. Much time was spent  sorting out two schools of thought put forward by Western  countries which advocate development of the ARF as a  results-oriented forum, and Asian countries which advocate a  slower and more general approach to dealing with security.    Specific security concerns in the region, proliferation of  nuclear and biological/chemical weapons in the Korean peninsula,  the dispute over the Spratly Islands, Cambodia and Burma were  mentioned but not discussed at length yesterday.    Deputy permanent secretary for foreign affairs Sarot  Chawanawirat told reporters the four hot topics were raised with  the aim to work out a regional strategy to resolve them without  blaming any party involved. The senior officials were in  Bangkok to prepare for the ARF in July and not to try to resolve  the four issues, sources stressed.    Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) announced the advent of the ARF at their annual  meeting last year. ARF participants will include the six ASEAN  member states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand, their seven dialogue partners, plus  observers and consultative partners. The United States, Canada,  Australia, New Zealand, the European Community, Japan and South  Korea are ASEAN's dialogue partners. China and Russia are  consultative partners, while Laos, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea  are observers.    ASEAN sources stressed that the ARF is meant to be an  informal, consultative forum for discussing regional political  and security cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. It is not  meant to replace existing international or regional mechanisms  dealing with security issues. ASEAN's position is that the  ARF's development as a forum should be "slow but sure," Thai  permanent secretary for foreign affairs Pracha Khunakasem told  reporters. All participating countries should feel comfortable  with it.    Security was complex and had to be dealt with step by step  as  a certain issue developed, Mr Pracha said.    "ARF is a new constructive experiment; it's like a newborn  baby, we have to nurture it," he said. "Foreign affairs is  difficult to quantify. We have no control because the events  happen outside our country and the only thing we can do is to  have an open dialogue (with the countries concerned)," he said.    A U.S. official said ARF could develop step by step but  there  must be movement and results. A senior Russian official  expressed optimism that all 18 countries will be able to reach a  consensus on the issue by the time three days of preparatory  talks end tomorrow.    "I believe a melange (a mix) will be reached between East  and  West on the approach and speed at the end of the meeting,  because without consensus, we cannot deal with security issues,"  he said.    A Canadian delegate said Canada would like to see the forum  play an important role in strengthening peace and security in  the region. The forum should be institutionalized to allow  participants "to meet each year to be able to discuss issues in  order to prevent situations from further deteriorating," the  official said.    South Korea supported a forum to meet once a year and it  should be a supplement for existing dialogues between Seoul and  its partners, a senior South Korean official said. "We are  going to have some more supplements which might be conducive to  further stabilizing peace and security in the future," the  official said.    Mr Pracha said the participating countries had already  agreed  that ARF at foreign minister level would meet annually with the  six ASEAN members taking turns in hosting the meeting. He said  the meeting in Bangkok would last three hours on July 25 with a  working dinner.    A so-called chairman's statement by Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri will be released at the end of the meeting. Sqd Ldr  [Squadron Leader] Prasong will set the parameters of the  three-hour talks around Asia-Pacific security issues, preventive  diplomacy and confidence building.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Blow to hopes of new life for drugs: Merck fails to gain US approval for over-the-counter sale of Pepcid The failure of Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, to gain approval from US regulators for the over-the-counter sale of Pepcid, its heartburn treatment, is a blow to companies' hopes for switching prescription medicines to store shelves. The decision by two US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees followed similar rejections earlier in the week for SmithKline Beecham's heartburn medicine Tagamet and Upjohn's Rogaine, a treatment for balding. Drugs companies have been banking on extending the product-life of their medicines once their patents expire by marketing them without prescriptions. Many other groups are hoping to convert the status of their drugs from prescription-only to OTC. Last week's rejections raise the question of whether there were particular problems with these three drugs or whether such strategies, involving powerful medicines being sold in supermarkets without a pharmacist's advice, are flawed. In each case there were concerns about the individual drugs, but three refusals in three days represent a serious set-back for the industry. In Upjohn's case, there were clearly problems with both the drug and the company. Upjohn's reputation with the FDA is still tainted by concern about the accuracy of clinical trial data for Halcion, a sleeping pill. The advisory committee also felt reluctant about allowing a potentially powerful drug becoming available on supermarket shelves for baldness - a non-serious condition. As for SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, the committees expressed concerns about the drug's safety, in particular its possible interaction with other, widely prescribed, medicines. The refusal by the FDA OTC and gastro-intestinal advisory committees to recommend Pepcid reflected concern about its effectiveness. Merck presented data from trials using doses of 10mg, compared with usual prescription doses of 20mg-40mg. The committees said the trials had failed to demonstrate that the drug consistently provided relief from heartburn or consistently prevented heartburn. More generally, the committees are worried about recommending potent medicines such as Pepcid and Tagamet which come from a class of drugs called H2-antagonists. That gastroenterologists generate a good deal of income from repeated prescribing of such drugs - the longest prescription available in the US is for three months - may also have been a factor, according to Mr Viren Mehtha, of New York-based analysts Mehtha and Isalay. The immediate outlook for non-prescription Tagamet and Pepcid is not good. SmithKline Beecham needs to conduct additional clinical trials, while Merck must argue with the FDA about the validity of its efficacy data. Approval may take a long time. The advisory committees washed their hands of the medicines, saying that it was up to the FDA to make a final decision. Risk-averse FDA bureaucrats will have little incentive to make a rapid judgment, given the advisory panels' concerns. Glaxo, which is working with the joint-venture Warner-Wellcome to change the status of its top-selling ulcer-drug, another H2-antagonist, Zantac, will have watched last week's developments with apprehension. Nevertheless the rewards for the first H2-antagonist on to the US antacid OTC market are huge. Mehtha and Isalay expect the first to be generating annual revenues of Dollars 500m (Pounds 320m) within five years, the second Dollars 200m and the third Dollars 100m. The antacid market is worth only Dollars 800m at the moment, according to Merck. Lex, Page 16</p>

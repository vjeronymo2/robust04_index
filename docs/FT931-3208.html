			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: City lukewarm over gilts funding changes MR NORMAN LAMONT yesterday announced a widely expected move to allow purchases of government bonds by banks and building societies to count towards the public sector borrowing requirement. However, the City warned that further significant changes would be needed to the way the PSBR is funded to relieve pressures in the gilts market. The extent of the government's borrowing needs in the coming financial year became clear as the chancellor announced an expected PSBR of Pounds 50bn. This topped most expectations in the City by at least Pounds 5bn and led to a fall in gilts prices by one percentage point. However, investors and analysts said that more important influences were likely to be borrowing needs in future years and the inflation outlook. The move away from the so-called 'full-funding' rule to one of 'underfunding' had been urged on the chancellor by the City. This allows gilt sales to banks and building societies to count towards the PSBR target. By reducing the amount of gilts that need to be sold to other investors, the intention is to ease pressure on the gilts market and prevent long-term interest rates from rising. Banks and building societies have bought Pounds 5.5bn of gilts in the first 11 months of the current financial year, up from less than Pounds 1bn in the whole of 1991-92. However, most said yesterday that they would be unlikely to increase these holdings unless the Bank of England designed some of its gilt sales to suit the particular needs of credit institutions. Referring to yesterday's change, Mr Roger Little, director in charge of dealing at Abbey National, said: 'It doesn't give us any more incentive to buy gilts than before.' A change in policy to issuing more shorter-dated gilts, with maturities of less than five years, would encourage more buying, a number of banks and societies said. This is because banks prefer to hold short-dated bonds for liquidity purposes, and because longer-dated gilts are more vulnerable to changes in inflation and other factors. Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank, said he anticipated discussions among banks and the Bank of England to ensure the issue of more short-term gilts such as one-year notes which the banks would find attractive. 'I cannot believe the Bank wants to force banks to buy the sort of long-term gilts which they believe are unacceptably risky,' said Mr Wood. He said short-term gilts would be appropriate as a response to a 'short-term problem'. Also, banks said that the difference between money-market interest rates and short-dated gilt yields would have to widen to make it more attractive for them to buy gilts. At the moment, money market rates are just below 6 per cent, while five-year gilts yield only around half a percentage point more. This difference would need to rise by at least a percentage point to encourage banks to buy more gilts, said Mr Philip Guy, treasurer of Hill Samuel. Mr Richard Goeltz, chief financial officer of National Westminster Bank, said British banks would require a more attractive yield on two or three year bills if they were to increase their portfolios substantially. He said the Budget had contained 'nothing that would lead us to start building a portfolio of gilts tomorrow.' A wider differential in the US bond market between money-market interest rates and short-term bond yields encouraged US banks to take their holdings of government bonds up to nearly Dollars 700bn at the end of 1992, from about Dollars 450bn two years before. This has helped both to fund the government borrowing requirement and guarantee the banks a healthy profit to rebuild capital resources. The City reacted with disappointment - though little surprise - to Mr Lamont's announcement that stamp duty on share transactions would stay for at least another year, raising an estimated Pounds 1bn. The tax had been scheduled for abolition with the introduction of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's planned paperless settlement system which was scrapped last week.</p>

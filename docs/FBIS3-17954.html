According to reports from Tajik  military, in the Afghan provinces of Takhar and Kondoz,  opposition combat detachments' reinforced wit armored vehicles  are accumulating. Abdullo Nuri, leader of the Tajikistan  Islamic Renewal Council, recently issued another bellicose  statement about his readiness to continue the armed struggle  "against Emomali Rakhmonov's antipopular regime."    The tactical exercises by the CIS coalition peacekeeping  forces in "Tigrovaya balka," which ended last Thursday, were a  kind of reply to this. Soldiers and officers of the 201st  Russian motorized rifle division, the Tajik Army, and an Uzbek  battalion took part. A scenario for the repelling of a massive  attack from the direction of Afghanistan was rehearsed. The  engines of tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, and  Tu-22F "Backfire" strategic aircraft roared in the mountain  gorges. Coalition Peacekeeping Forces Commander Boris Pyankov  believes that the scenario which is being rehearsed could be  real. "It is true that I would not like it very much to  happen," the colonel general added, "but Allah alone knows how  it will all turn out."    Whether Tajikistan will fall into the abyss of a new  fratricidal bloodbath depends largely on the success of the  talks between the opposition and official Dushanbe. Talks on  the subject have long been under way, but the first outlines of  the meeting -- it is planned to hold it in Moscow -- have been  carved more or less clearly.    Delegations of seven people each are to sit down at the  conference table, and the opposition has received a guarantee of  safety. At UN insistence, the talks should begin without any  preliminary conditions. The sides have something to discuss.  There is the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees scattered  not only in neighboring Afghanistan, but also throughout the  former Union, the collapse of the Tajik economy, and the future  identify of the state and power structures. But, of course, the  most important thing is to put an end to the bloodshed, without  which getting out of the rockfall of problems descending on the  young independent republic is inconceivable.    Obviously, the peace process in Tajikistan is encountering a  series of underground rocks. Thus, the radical opposition  defending its interests with weapons in hand is insisting that  the delegation include Chief Justice Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod,  the Muslims' former spiritual leader, and Mukhammad Sharif  Khimmatzad, leader of the banned Islamic Revival Party. They  are both regarded in Dushanbe as the main culprits in unleashing  civil war. For the Tajikistan leadership, sitting down at the  same table with them means recognizing them as equals and in  part "losing face." Most likely Dushanbe's strategic partner,  Uzbekistan, also opposes this twist to the affair. It is hardly  fortuitous that a criminal trial began in Tashkent recently of a  group of officials of the Central Asia Muslims' spiritual  directorate. Arrested nearly a year ago, they are accused not  only of large-scale embezzlement, but also of transferring  $200,000 to the Tajik Muslim leaders to buy weapons. If the  guilt of the "servants of Allah" is proven, and there are few  doubts that it will be, then the Turkestan public will be even  more convinced of "who is who" and Dushanbe will acquire new  trump cards.    The Tajikistan authorities obviously consider it acceptable  for them to conduct talks with the so-called moderate  opposition, which has united in a democratic forces coordination  center with headquarters in Moscow. Representatives of  "Rastokhez" and other organizations are of course far less  involved in the bloody disputes and have nothing to do with the  fierce terrorist actions. And it may be expected that official  Dushanbe will soon find a common language with them.    At the same time the situation in Tajikistan itself is not  that simple. It is no secret that a decisive role in the  victory of the progovernment forces was played by the National  Front, where the Kulyab people set the tone. Today, they have  occupied the majority of key posts in the capital and locally,  and that has destroyed the traditional balance of power  artifically maintained in the past by the Communists.    Gornyy Badakhshan remains a zone of heightened tension. The  drugs mafia have a strong hold there. The former harmony  between Tajiks and local Uzbeks is lacking there. Not to  mention the Russians, who are still leaving the Pamir in droves  since it has become a danger to their lives.    It is characteristic that Tajikistan's opposition and  official powers are in favor of good relations with Russia.  That of course attests to their realism. Moscow, with its CIS  allies, is doomed to be a guarantor of peace in the Pamir.  Formally its troops should leave Tajikistan at the end of this  year, but that is unlikely if only because, as Pavel Grachev put  it, the border with Afghanistan must be held because of the  strategic interests of Russia and the CIS.    Probably as a reserve option in case the talks fail, at a  recent meeting of the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan,  Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Russia, and Kazakhstan in Dushanbe Andrey  Kozyrev suggested convening an international conference with the  participation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. But will that  suit the opposition, which will most likely observe this meeting  from the sidelines?    One thing is clear: We must not lose the chance of a  political solution to the Tajik problem. That is fraught not  only with the danger of the aggravation of the conflict, but  also with the danger of its spread throughout Turkestan,  dragging into the crater of war new participants, among whom the  greatest danger is presented by the Afghan mojahidin and the  extremists from the fundamentalist organizations of the Muslim  world.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Pentagon plans extensive tests this summer on a "Star Wars" concept known  as "Brilliant Pebbles" and may incorporate the theory in its plans as early as  next fall, a Pentagon official said. Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., director  of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, said two groups will study  the space-based defense concept, in which thousands of satellites designed to  knock down enemy missiles orbit the earth. Monahan identified the two groups as  the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon committee, and the Jasons, a group of  university professors, mostly physicists, retained by the department to conduct  independent analysis.  </P></p>

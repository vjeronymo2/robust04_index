			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Seacon reduced to Pounds 818,000 A DROP in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 818,000, was announced by Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted shipping and distribution group, for the half year to March 31. Mr Chris Roth, chairman, said that trade in the second half had so far shown signs of improvement. He said that following an initial bedding-in period the modernisation of the Northfleet terminal would increase profitability. There was an upturn in steel imports in late-February which had been maintained, but it came too late to affect the half year result. Turnover fell from Pounds 9.52m to Pounds 9.09m and there were reduced operating profits of Pounds 472,000 (Pounds 669,000). Earnings per share fell to 5.62p (7.34p) basic and 5.49p (6.88p) fully diluted. The interim dividend is lifted to 2.3p (2p).</p>

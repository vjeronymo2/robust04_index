			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Caradon crows After the warm reception accorded by the market to MB-Caradon's purchase of RTZ's industrial businesses, it seems churlish to ask whether the company has bitten off more than it can chew. The deal takes it a whole stage further down the road towards becoming a specialised building materials group. Though it is paying a full price, it has managed to avoid being saddled with the least attractive parts of RTZ's Pillar division. Yet Pounds 800m is a lot of money for Caradon to spend when its own market capitalisation is only Pounds 1.5bn. To absorb the goodwill it must seek court permission, for the second time in as many years, to cancel the balance on its share premium account. Without yesterday's rights issue it would hardly have had a balance left to cancel. This is not to say that Caradon is condemned to flounder. It has a good record in managing the recession and has sensibly eschewed the temptation to opt for a hostile bid for a company like Pilkington. That would have involved paying a premium for a company heavily dependent on one product and on a weak European market. The stock market is clearly relieved that Caradon has chosen a negotiated acquisition of a collection of businesses poised to enjoy the US and UK upturn. But it may also be underestimating the extent of the challenge that lies ahead. It is easy to claim that the acquisition will enhance Caradon's earnings next year. This year's earnings will be diluted by putting the proceeds of the sale of its CarnaudMetalbox stake on deposits at low interest rates. So almost any acquisition would have enhanced future earnings. The real test is how skilfully Caradon manages to integrate the large family of Pillar companies and push up their margins. That may be easier said than done, especially in the North American building sector. Gearing, too, may turn out less comfortable than suggested by the pro forma 24 per cent in yesterday's statement. Even a modest fair value provision and cash outlay on reorganisation would push the figure closer to 50 per cent. That might prompt disposals, though Caradon would hardly rush to part with its lucrative security printing division. Some of the other businesses acquired as part of the package, such as automotive or aero-engineering, might go. Caradon would then be judged even more as a pure building materials company. Its historic multiple of 22 makes it look cheap against Redland and RMC whose ratings are both over 30. Its more limited recovery prospects mean, though, that at 336p the shares are hardly cheap. RTZ is left with a Pounds 165m exceptional loss and the task of disposing of the rump of its Pillar division. But it has also the satisfaction of seeing gearing fall to 14 per cent. That will allow it to prospect for new investments in mining. Its hand would be even freer if the government goes ahead with the introduction of foreign income dividends. RTZ would then no longer need to worry about maintaining enough UK income to prevent a build-up of unrelieved ACT.</p>

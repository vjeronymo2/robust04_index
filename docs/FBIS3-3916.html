The drive aims to accelerate information exchange through a  global digital system to meet the demands of China's fledgling  market economy.    The current task is focused on expanding and upgrading the  public packet-switching data network, known as Chinapac, said  Hao Weimin, an official with the Ministry of Post and  Telecommunications.    After joining the network, computers across the country can  exchange information and contact with other computers at home or  abroad.    The network covers the capitals of China's 30 provinces,  municipalities and autonomous regions and is linked with 37  switching networks in 19 countries and regions.    By the end of this year, it will cover 500 domestic cities,  as local authorities are building 14 provincial networks.  Another 15 provincial networks have already been established .    According to the official, Chinapac is expected to cover all  the counties in East, South and Central China and part of the  counties in West China by 1995.    Hao also expects that the number of Chinapac users will  triple to 8,000 this year and grow to 20,000 by 1995.    Most of the current Chinapac users are financial  organizations, banks, stock exchanges and government departments.    He stressed the importance of constantly upgrading the  network's technology and facilities to meet customers' needs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 7 April (MTI) -- Parliament this  afternoon began in a festive mood the 21st session of this  spring sittings, which is at the same time the last working day  of the four-year term before elections begin on May 8.    Speaker of Parliament Gyorgy Szabad, having arrived home  from  the United States not long before the session started, called  President Arpad Goncz to speak first.    The president thanked the delegates for their  accomplishment.    "You have succeeded in laying the foundations of the  political, economic, institutional, and legal system of the new,  democratic Hungary. Despite its incompleteness and occasional  clumsiness, this system works steadily," he said.    "The over 400 bills you have passed clearly prove your  successful continuation along the first, four-year phase of the  path toward the future," Hungarian President Arpad Goncz told  deputies today in his final speech to the current parliamentary  body.    He stressed that the bills were hammered out through a  process of developing a consensus between the ruling coalition  and opposition parties. In Goncz's view, this indicates that  the National Assembly, as representatives of the whole of  Hungarian society, sees the historical and future development of  the country in a similar way.    At the same time, Goncz pointed to the fact that the  citizens  did not voice only praise for Parliament.    "This is not your fault. The primary cause of disappointment  is that people were expecting a miracle from the new democracy.  But fate -- not Parliament! -- has failed to provide this  miracle," he continued.    The president went on to list some issues, most of them  related to basic human rights, which have not been settled by  this Parliament and thus await the next one, after the general  elections in May.    He mentioned the establishment of offices of ombudsmen for  human and minority rights, and parliamentary representation of  ethnic groups as examples. He also discussed the need for  creation of a law against all forms of racial discrimination.    He went on to list some of the other issues which he feels  are of vital importance:    "I consider a law on the legal standing of those in the Army  and the police forces another priority, and hope the new  assembly will place it among the first issues on the agenda," he  continued.    "A media bill must also be passed as soon as possible, to  settle the issue of control over the state radio, television,  and news agency, as well as on permitting the operation of  commercial broadcast media and preventing of any kind of media  monopoly."    "Society should be given the power to monitor the state  radio  and television. This is vital because, in my view, it is  inadmissible that the absence of such control should be the  source of ceaseless and poisoning tensions in internal  politics," Goncz stated.</p>

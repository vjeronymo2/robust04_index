			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Eddie George sets out criteria for supporting troubled banks MR EDDIE GEORGE, governor of the Bank of England, last night disclosed in detail for the first time the Bank's principles for deciding whether and how to give financial assistance to troubled banks. Mr George defended the Bank's role in launching a series of financial 'lifeboats' for a number of small and medium-sized banks in 1991 and said it was essential that no bank, whatever its size, expected automatic support. He denied the common assumption that some banks such as the large clearing banks were 'too big to fail'. There was 'nothing automatic about our acting as lender of last resort', and no bank that it helped would be immune from penalty. His lecture was the second in an annual series at the London School of Economics. He said the measures taken to protect 40 banks in 1991 had prompted the Bank to update its principles on such operations. The Bank intervened to support four small banks during the incident, the largest such operation since the 1973-74 secondary banking crisis. It later made provisions of Pounds 115m to cover losses on loans to the banks. The potential for one bank's failure to affect others, Mr George said, had increased with the evolution of the financial system. 'Crises can spread not just from bank to bank, but also from country to country,' he said. The Bank's principles were that: It would explore every option for a commercial solution before committing funds. It would always ask large shareholders to supply support, and, failing that, would encourage the bank to try to find a buyer 'even at knock-down prices'. If it did provide support, it would try to structure it 'so that any losses fall first on the shareholders, and any benefits come first to us'. Support would also be 'on terms as penal as we can make them' without leading to collapse. It would provide only short-term liquidity, and would not 'in normal circumstances' support a bank known to be insolvent. It would 'look for a clear exit.' The company may be required to run down or restructure operations under the Bank's surveillance to the point where it could survive unsupported within a given period. It would try to keep systemic support secret at the time. Disclosure could damage confidence and the Bank might be drawn into 'a position where we were in practice underwriting all the liabilities of the banking system'.</p>

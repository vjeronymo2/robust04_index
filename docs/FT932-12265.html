			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Navy top brass loses its lustre MPs yesterday expressed concern about the number of serving admirals in the Royal Navy. Ministry of Defence officials disclosed there were now 42 admirals, two more than the total number of frigates and destroyers. Mr Roger Jackling, deputy under-secretary for resources, programmes and finance, insisted the number of admirals was being cut in proportion to the rest of the Navy. He said independent assessors, including the Treasury, had recently approved the numbers. The total number of admirals will be reduced to 37 by April 1996. Mr John Home-Robertson, Labour MP for East Lothian, said the committee remained 'concerned' at the numbers.</p>

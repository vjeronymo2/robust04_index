			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (9): Discipline 'vital to strategy' 'Alec Erwin was sent by God. Jay Naidoo, I embrace him.' Mr Derek Keys, the outgoing finance minister, has been overheard to utter such praises about the two men - ironically, both former socialists - who have been his lieutenants, writes Patti Waldmeir. Now that troika is breaking up, with Mr Keys ceding his place to Mr Christo Liebenberg, a respected banker. Mr Liebenberg is untested as finance minister; but Mr Erwin and Mr Naidoo, reconstruction and development minister, have already done much to prove their credentials as fiscal moderates. Indeed, to hear Mr Erwin, deputy minister of finance, defend the need for discipline - with a fervour and passion which few orthodox economists could equal - is to believe that his conversion is genuine. 'You simply cannot meet people's basic needs if you generate rampant inflation. It would be totally counterproductive to our goals if we let inflation rise,' he says with earnestness and conviction. 'Our commitment to fiscal discipline isn't just there because it looks good,' he told his first press briefing after entering public office. 'Fiscal discipline is fundamental to the strategy.' He reiterated the same message less than 24 hours after the announcement that Mr Keys would resign, obviously eager to reassure investors that South Africa's commitment to fiscal discipline would not depart with the minister. Even so, time will test that commitment sorely. And the loss of Mr Keys  - who worked with Mr Erwin and Mr Naidoo for the past two years to develop an agreed economic vision based on discipline - could prove a serious blow. The new troika will lack the rapport built up by the previous team during tough months of negotiations in the national economic forum, the business-labour-government body which brought corporatism to South Africa. And Mr Liebenberg will wield far less political clout than the wily and shrewd Mr Keys. But Mr Erwin is clearly keen to make things work. Once a doctrinaire socialist - he comes from Cosatu, the black union federation - he has made his peace with capitalism. Mr Keys was surely right: Mr Erwin was an inspired choice.</p>

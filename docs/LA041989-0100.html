			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONNER AND STARS &amp; STRIPES ENTERED IN ENSENADA RACE  </P> <P> Dennis Conner will sail one of the controversial Stars &amp; Stripes catamarans  in the 42nd Newport-Ensenada race starting Friday, April 28, and this time  nobody objects.  </P> <P> Vic Stern, secretary-treasurer of the Ocean Racing Catamaran Assn., said  Tuesday that the organization had approved the conventional, "soft-sail" rig  that was the backup boat to the airfoil-wing craft Conner used to trounce New  Zealand's larger monohull in a two-race defense of the America's Cup at San  Diego last September.  </P> <P> The winning boat has since been disqualified by the New York Supreme Court and  the Cup awarded to the Mercury Bay Boating Club of New Zealand in the  resolution of a protest by syndicate chief Michael Fay, although the San Diego  Yacht Club is pursuing an appeal of the decision.  </P> <P> Starting at noon in a fleet of 27 multihulls, Conner and a crew of eight will  be racing the setting sun toward the Ensenada record of 10 hours 31 minutes 2  seconds set by Bob Hanel's Double Bullet in 1983. Stern thinks Stars &amp;  Stripes could finish the 125-mile race before sundown.  </P> <P> "If she gets a steady 12-knot wind, she could be there in 7 1/2 hours," Stern  said. "It's a fantastic boat. When I sailed on it recently, we were doing 20  knots in a nine-knot breeze."  </P> <P> Stars &amp; Stripes is about the same size -- 60 feet -- as Rudy Choy's Aikane  X-5, which has won the last two Ensenada events, but is lighter and carries  more sail. She has been assigned a Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF)  rating of minus-172 to Aikane's minus-58, meaning she must give 114 seconds a  mile to Aikane, or 3.96 hours over the distance.  </P> <P> Stern, who has sailed in a record 27 consecutive Ensenada races, the last  several aboard his own Imi Loa catamaran, said he thinks Stars &amp; Stripes  still could be the overall winner, as well as first to finish.  </P> <P> "Her rating assumes her weather hull will be out of the water 50% of the time,"  Stern said.  </P> <P> That would be much more than it was when Conner sailed the sister boat  ultra-conservatively against New Zealand.  </P> <P> Bill Trenkle, crew member and vice president of marine operations for Dennis  Conner Sports Inc., said: "It's a matter of keeping the speed up when the wind  gets light (in late afternoon off San Diego). They predicted us (for the  handicap) in 10 knots of wind, but we're not going to get 10 knots all the  way."  </P> <P> Also aboard will be Tom Whidden, Conner's tactician for the last four Cup  campaigns, and Tony Wilson, the president of Hobie Cat, which is sponsoring the  effort.  </P> <P> Trenkle said the boat won the last tuneup race against the airfoil rig before  the September event, but Conner chose to sail the airfoil because it performed  better in light air.  </P></p>

The type certification basis for the Model 4101 is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The certification basis for the Model 4101 is established in accordance with &sect;21.29, using the Joint Aviation Regulations (JAR) as a reference point, with appropriate additional requirements incorporated to provide an equivalent certification basis to the FAR requirements for U.S. certification. British Aerospace and Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA)&hyph;UK elected to have the type certification basis be the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _JAR 25 as amended through Change 12 dated May 10, 1988; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _JAR 25 Orange Paper Amendment 88&hyph;1 effective October 18, 1988; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _JAR 1, definitions as amended through Change 4 dated June 1, 1987; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _any additional part 25 paragraphs necessary to provide a composite type certification basis equal to the required part 25 type certification basis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on &sect;&sect;21.29 and 21.17 and the type certification application date, the applicable U.S. type certification basis was established as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Part 25 dated February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;66;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _any applicable special conditions issued; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _any applicable exemptions granted; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _any equivalent safety findings made; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the fuel venting requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 27, including Amendments 27&hyph;1 through the latest amendment in effect on the date of Model 4100 is type certificated, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Part 36, including Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the latest amendment in effect on the date of TC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25 as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Novel or Unusual Design Features <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 30 passenger seat version of Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration as described above for the 29 seat version. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the case of the 29 seat version, the required main cabin aisle widths would be established using measurements taken between seatbacks, which form a path in angular segments. The aisle width measured normal to the fuselage centerline above 25 inches from the floor, would extend from the seat back to the opposite cabin sidewall. Thus, while the required 15-inch dimension at cabin heights below 25 inches from the floor would be completely within the projected 20-inch width vertically, the 20-inch portion would not be centered over the 15-inch portion.

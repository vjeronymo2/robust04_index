			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Fresh juice gets zero-rate VAT FRESHLY-SQUEEZED orange juice was yesterday exempted from value added tax, Andrew Jack writes. Orange juice that has only been pasteurised is not a 'manufactured beverage' and can therefore be zero-rated, a VAT tribunal ruled. Customs and Excise, in an appeal case brought by Tropicana, argued that VAT should be charged Following the defeat, Customs said it would take the case to the High Court. It said the ruling contradicted a VAT tribunal decision against Sunjuice that the product should be standard-rated. Customs said yesterday that traders could temporarily zero-rate orange juice until the outcome of the High Court case.</p>

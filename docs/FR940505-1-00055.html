			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the 1990 Amendments Congress also imposed specific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasingly rigorous requirements for Part D SIPs, depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area's nonattainment classification, with new deadlines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranging from immediately to six years from enactment, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting various components of the plans to EPA. Sections 181,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 182, 186, and 187. In addition, the 1990 Amendments amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(c)(l), the principal provision governing EPA's FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA concluded that these revisions, directing States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop SIPs meeting new requirements and deadlines, and to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIPs to EPA on specific schedules, demonstrated that EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to promulgate FIPs would arise only upon future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapprovals of those newly submitted SIPs. EPA appealed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courts to determine whether the Amendments had relieved the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its pre-existing FIP obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Coalition for Clean Air, 971 F.2d 219 (9th Cir. 1992), a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided panel of the Ninth Circuit held that although Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 110(c)(l) had been revised by the 1990 Amendments, the language of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 110(c)(l)(B), which requires EPA to promulgate a FIP within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two years after it ``disapproves'' a SIP, applies to pre-Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapprovals. Thus, the court ruled that new section 110(c)(l)(B)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates retroactively to retain EPA's preexisting FIP obligation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even though the statutory provisions forming the basis for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation have been repealed. In reaching this conclusion, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> court declined to indicate whether the requirements of the old law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the 1990 Amendments would govern the contents of this FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Court acknowledged that ``the proper contents of FIPs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast are not before us,'' and that ``we need not decide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether EPA would be required to meet any additional requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed by the 1990 Amendments in promulgating FIPs for the South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast,'' 971 F.2d at 225.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA sought, and was denied, a writ of certiorari (113 S.Ct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1361 (1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Applicable law. Thus, although the Ninth Circuit found that the passage of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments did not release EPA from a FIP obligation arising from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a pre-Amendment disapproval, it did not decide whether any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of the 1990 Amendments applies to this continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation. In the absence of any guidance from the Court, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> task falls to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The threshold question, then, is what requirements govern the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of a FIP which will take effect after enactment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act Amendments, but which is based on a plan failure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproval arising from pre-Amendment Clean Air Act provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which have since been repealed. The greatly altered legal regime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the 1990 Amendments creates a discontinuity between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the plan contents required under the new and old acts. Thus, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faced with a choice as to how to design the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) New law applies. It is well settled that ``[c]ourts must apply new laws to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending cases, unless such application would result in manifest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injustice or be contrary to statutory direction or legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ford,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 737 F.2d 1508 (9th Cir. 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Bradley  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> School Bd. of Richmond,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 416 U.S. 696, 711 (1974);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DeGurules  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> INS,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 833 F.2d 861, 863 (9th Cir. 1987);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cartage Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 802 F.2d 353, 357 (9th Cir. 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the principle embodied in these cases, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the 1990 Amendments should be applicable to the FIPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arising from EPA's pre-Amendment disapprovals. But an analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the new Act's provisions reveals that the new Act does not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this FIP to include each and every pollution control program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required of States under the Amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 Amendments make explicit a principle that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implicit in the preceding Act_that a FIP corrects or fills a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> void in a deficient state plan. The amended Act defines a FIP as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a plan to fill a gap or ``correct all or a portion of an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inadequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in a State implementation plan.'' 42 U.S.C. 7602(y) (Supp. II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990) (emphasis added). The California SIPs at issue here were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejected by EPA in 1988 because they were ``inadequa[te]'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate attainment under the pre-Amendment deadlines, and thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's obligation under the pre-1990 Act was to promulgate a FIP in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to correct that ``inadequacy.'' Thus EPA's FIP obligation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to fulfill the requirement to demonstrate attainment. Stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differently, what the Ninth Circuit's ruling preserved was EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing FIP obligation to correct the state plan's failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for attainment. That is the inadequacy that EPA must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address in this FIP, not any failure that might have arisen under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the numerous requirements of the new law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of course, if the State fails to meet any of the new Act's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, that failure would trigger a new FIP obligation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future, but that would be an entirely different obligation, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the one on which the district court orders under the old Act were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premised. And even as to such obligations, the Administrator is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required to promulgate a federal plan until two years after she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproves a deficient state plan or finds that the state has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to submit a required plan element. Section 110(c)(l).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to new requirements imposed by the 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments, there has either been no state failure, or the 24-month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock for EPA to promulgate a FIP has not yet run. When a state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure giving rise to a new FIP obligation occurs, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address that obligation in a separate FIP NPRM. For example, FIPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing state failures to satisfy the VOC RACT catch-up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of the new Amendments may become due late in 1994 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1995. In the absence of approvable state measures correcting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these deficiencies, EPA will issue separate FIPs to rectify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given EPA's position as to the effect of the new Amendments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one might argue that the logical extension is that since the state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not yet failed to adopt an attainment demonstration under new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 182(c)(2)(A), no attainment demonstration is due. But  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the Ninth Circuit conclusively decided that the obligation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgate an attainment demonstration survived, EPA must prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one under the new Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Serbs agree to join talks in NY INTERNATIONAL mediator Lord Owen said yesterday that talks between the Croatian government and Serbs would begin at the United Nations next week in an effort to renew a peace agreement blown apart in recent fighting, Reuter reports from the UN. He said that Serbs in the Croatian enclave of Krajina who had earlier boycotted such negotiations had now agreed to attend peace talks at the UN in New York.

Croatia's defence minister, Mr Gojko Susak, spoke to Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairmen of a conference on the former Yugoslavia, last week. But Lord Owen said initial discussions would be with Croatian Serbs alone. The Croatia meetings, he said, would be parallel to talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina which are expected to resume in the middle of next week after the new US envoy, Mr Reginald Bartholomew, arrives in New York. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, in a report to the Security Council has proposed lengthening the mandate of UN peacekeepers in Croatia by six weeks to give Mr Vance and Lord Owen an opportunity to break the impasse. Lord Owen said the negotiations would consider the mandate, criticised by Croatia and others as being too weak to allow peace-keepers to prevent violations. But he said it was up to the Security Council and did not say how he wanted it changed. He told reporters he thought there was no chance the troops would be withdrawn. 'It is the question of how you reflect a national identity within a country in which you are a minority,' Lord Owen said. 'This is what will have to be done for Serbs in Bosnia-Hercegovina, for Serbs in Croatia, for Albanians in Kosovo.'</p>

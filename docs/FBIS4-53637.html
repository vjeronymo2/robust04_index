			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["No Solution by Pressure" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- U.S. hardline  conservatives are now intentionally rendering the situation  strained with a threat of "sanctions" against the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, while spreading the rumor that the  replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt experimental reactor  of the DPRK is aimed at extracting plutonium enough for the  manufacture of four or five nuclear bombs.    NODONG SINMUN today views their reckless act as a mean trick  to block a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula, lead the situation to an extreme phase, and  find a justification of "sanctions" against the DPRK.    The analyst says:    Some forces are now charging the DPRK with "nuclear arms  development" and "challenge to the international community" as  regards the just refueling of a reactor in the DPRK. This is  nothing but a sinister political plot to pursue another purpose  by breaking up dialogue and increasing tension.    To solve the nuclear issue in a fair way through dialogue is  the principled stand and consistent policy of the DPRK.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has not yet been  resolved because the United States has put pressure on the DPRK,  pursuing a hostile policy for stifling it.    If the United States had renounced such a policy and the  third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks had been held for a package  solution, the DPRK would have been freed from its special status  and routine and ad hoc inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] made. And such outstanding matters as the  preservation of selected fuel rods and sampling by the IAEA  would have been solved automatically.    The U.S. hardline conservatives, however, are persistently  intensifying pressure on the DPRK, far from seeking a fair  solution. After all, they have only laid big obstacles to the  solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, increased  tension and helped munitions monopolies gain fabulous profits  through arms sale.    If those speaking for the interests of the U.S. munitions  industry create obstacles to a fair solution to the nuclear  issue, giving precedence to short-sighted interests, it will  bring nothing good to the United States itself.    The United States should ponder over the grave consequences  to be entailed by its obstruction of a negotiated solution to  the nuclear issue.</p>

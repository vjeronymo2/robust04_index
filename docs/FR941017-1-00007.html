			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed use of the total effective dose equivalent, or TEDE, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon two considerations. First, since it utilizes a risk consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology to assess the radiological impact of all relevant nuclides upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all body organs, use of TEDE promotes a uniformity and consistency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing radiation risk that may not exist with the separate whole body and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thyroid organ dose values in the present regulation. Second, use of TEDE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lends itself readily to the application of updated accident source terms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which can vary not only with plant design, but in which additional nuclides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> besides the noble gases and iodine are predicted to be released into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has examined the current dose criteria of 25 rem whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> body and 300 rem thyroid with the intent of selecting a TEDE numerical value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to the risk implied by the current dose criteria. These risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consist of the risk of developing cancer some time after the exposure (latent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer incidence), as well as a delayed risk of cancer fatality (latent cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatality). For a dose of 25 rem whole body, the individual risk of latent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer fatality is estimated to be about 2.5&times;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; the risk of latent cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidence is about twice that (using risk coefficients expressed by ICRP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publication 60 and in NUREG/CR&hyph;4214). For a dose of 300 rem thyroid, the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of latent cancer fatality is about 2&times;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; the risk of latent cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidence is about a factor of ten higher.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the risk of latent cancer fatality is selected as the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk measure to be used, the current dose criteria represent a risk of about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.7&times;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Using a risk coefficient of about 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per rem, the risk of latent cancer fatality implied by the current dose criteria is equivalent to 27 rem TEDE. (BEIR V estimates a latent cancer fatality risk coefficient of about 5&times;10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per rem, if the dose is received over a period of days or more; however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the exposure period is shorter, such as 2 hours, the risk coefficient is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately double.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If latent cancer incidence rather than fatality were used, the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose criteria would correspond to a value of about 35 rem TEDE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is proposing to use the risk of latent cancer fatality as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appropriate risk measure since quantitative health objectives (QHOs) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it have been established in the Commission's Safety Goal policy. Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current dose criteria are equivalent in risk to 27 rem TEDE, as noted above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission is proposing to use 25 rem TEDE as the dose criterion for plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation purposes, since this value is essentially the same level of risk as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the Commission is specifically requesting comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of TEDE. Comments are requested on whether the current dose criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be modified to utilize the total effective dose equivalent, or TEDE,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept. The Commission is also requesting comments on whether a TEDE value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 25 rem (consistent with latent cancer fatality), or 34 rem (consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latent cancer incidence), or some other value should be used. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the thyroid weighting factor is equal to a value of 0.03, there exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a theoretical possibility that an accidental release composed only of iodine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could result in a TEDE less than 25 rem, yet result in a thyroid dose of over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800 rem. Although the Commission believes that the likelihood that an actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident would release only iodine is highly unlikely, comments are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested as to whether the dose criterion should also include a ``capping''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation, that is, an additional requirement that the dose to any individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organ not be in excess of some fraction of the total.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

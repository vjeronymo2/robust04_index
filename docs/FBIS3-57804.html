And he is making his preparations for a round whose winner has  virtually been declared with Clinton's assertion that "Cyprus is  my personal problem."    Therefore, our question to the president was related to  this.  <H5>  First the People Must Accept </H5>   [Ulku] The developments and in particular the reports and  commentaries in the Greek Cypriot and U.S. press indicate that  the United States will put Turkey in a highly difficult  situation in the aftermath of the elections. What sort of a  path do you want to follow in view of this?    [Denktas] I am also in contact with the Americans and asking  them: There is a fundamental principle. Any agreement will be  submitted to a referendum on both sides; that is, it will be  subject to the will of the people. Will you use force to make  us accept an agreement rejected by the people? "Never," they  reply. The Americans have the mistaken impression that the  package, called the "set of ideas," placed before us is  acceptable to the people, but that we have not been telling the  truth to the people. I am saying that we could only go to the  people if we reach the conclusion that an agreement acceptable  to the people could be concluded. Internal turmoil will ensue  if, without such a conviction, we affix our signature to an  agreement unacceptable to the people. Hence, on the basis of  this, Turkey could easily put up the following defense: "I  might try to make the Turkish Cypriots endorse an agreement  acceptable to them, but I cannot force them to endorse an  agreement unacceptable to them. " Turkey could make this  defense, and is already doing it.    [Ulku] Do you see any hint of retreat or concession on  Cyprus  problem since the 60's and 70's on the part of Turkey?    [Denktas] No, I do not. Turkey is continuing to execute the  necessary maneuver to prove that it has the goodwill and favors  peace, and that the Turkish people in Cyprus too have rights and  a just cause. Because the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus] is a state officially recognized by Turkey, it [TRNC]  will not be subject to the diplomatic erosion that existed  before our declaration of the TRNC, and therefore Turkey will  support us with greater ease.  <H5>  "Papandreou's New Policy Is in Our Favor" </H5>   [Ulku] It appears that the Papandreou government in Greece  is  pursuing a "hawkish" policy on Cyprus problem. Where, in your  view, will this policy end? Could the attacks of the Greek  Cypriot soldiers resume after so many years?    [Denktas] I think that for Papandreou to pursue this policy  is to our favor. It justifies our position. This policy  confirms that he does not want an agreement between us and the  Greek Cypriots. I think that if they take further steps in this  direction, our being on the right will be understood more  easily. I consider their initiative to attack as madness, but  then, these are people who have committed madness before.    [Ulku] My last question will be a bit personal. To what do  you link the persistence of the "Denktas equals Cyprus" formula  that has been around for such long years despite every criticism  against your person? Have you ever contemplated this issue?    [Denktas] I think I link it to the fact that the people have  seen that I have always defended what the people want, that I  have not deceived the people, and that I followed a line aimed  at gaining the people's trust. This is only natural. Had this  not been so, we would not have been able to remain here for  long. However, what saddens me most is that those who say "The  Cyprus problem equals Denktash," or those who look at this issue  from this angle have also concluded that "If Denktas wants to,  he can make concessions and this problem will be settled." This  is very wrong. This is because my very existence here is linked  to the art of assessing my people's sincere desire within a  reasonable framework and defend it. Even Denktas cannot do  what people do not want. Even Denktas cannot make the  concession unacceptable to the people. It will be beneficial if  this is known to all.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall shares fall despite OFTstatement Shares in Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors, fell 9p to 97p yesterday despite a statement from the Office of Fair Trading saying it had no evidence that allegations of anti-competitive practices had any substance. On Monday, the OFT said it would make 'preliminary inquiries' into allegations in the press regarding Healthcall's treatment of potential competitors. Yesterday's statement said: 'At this stage the OFT is merely seeking to establish the facts.' Started 30 years ago, Healthcall's service provides GPs with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply. Under an exclusive agreement first signed in 1966 the BMA promotes Healthcall's service and monitors its standards in return for a fee set at 0.5 per cent of revenues. Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, has asked the OFT to consider whether the agreement falls under the Restrictive Practices Act. The OFT said on Monday that it fell outside the scope of the Act and yesterday added that a decision had been made in June that it did not need to be referred to the Restrictive Practices Court. The other allegations centre on the effective monopoly Healthcall has in many urban areas and its actions against GPs who attempt to set up co-operatives to compete with it. The company dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and denied that it threatened to cut off its service to GPs if they made moves to set up co-operatives. Dr John Cockburn, managing director of Healthcall's smaller rival Nestor Medical Duty Services, said that in many smaller urban areas there was room for only one duty doctor service and it was reasonable for Healthcall to warn GPs that it might have to pull out.</p>

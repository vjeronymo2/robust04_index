But in his traditional New Year's press conference,  Mitterrand said: "I would not wish to see a withdrawal of the UN  troops because that would amount to abandoning the civilians  even more than they are already.    "To say to these people, tear yourselves to pieces (...) I  could not imagine such a thing," said the French leader, who  paid tribute to UN forces in former Yugoslav state who had  "sometimes paid with their lives." [passage omitted]    Mitterrand backed the use of force to carry out the UN  mission in Bosnia but said doing so risked "spreading the  infection of war, little by little," adding that "our policy  must be sufficiently courageous but also very prudent.    "1994 will not go by without some important innovations" in  policy on Bosnia, he said.    The president expressed measured support for a call by  French  Defence Minister Francois Leotard for US involvement in the  conflict, saying "if there was the need for air cover for UN  soldiers, why not?"    In a wide-ranging press conference the French leader  expressed concern for the rise in Islamic fundamentalism in  Algeria, a former French colony, saying "we have the right to be  worried about fundamentalist campaigns."    And in a passing reference to his health the 76-year-old  president, who suffers from prostate cancer, said there was  "nothing to report."</p>

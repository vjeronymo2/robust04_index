			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sergey Omelchenko and Yevgeniy Shmatrikov; from the </F> "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Omelchenko over video of power industry  installations including control room of Russia's unified power  grid] Naturally, the financial crisis has cast a shadow over  the power engineers' professional holiday. Consumers owe the  industry more than 2 trillion rubles. Nonetheless, our unique  power complex continues to function smoothly, without  disruptions.    The 50-hertz reading on the central control panel of  Russia's  unified power grid indicates that the power grid is operating  stably. The stable operation is the result not just of good  equipment and the harmonious operation of the collective, but  also of credits, big credits. Will these, together with the  fairly steep interest rates, not have to be shouldered by  consumers next year?    [A.F. Dyakov, president of the "Russia's Unified Power Grid"  Russian Joint Stock Company] The bill for the credits should be  footed by defaulters. In that case disciplined consumers would  be protected. Their electricity rates would remain unchanged.    [Omelchenko] Despite all the financial difficulties, new  capacities totaling 3,000,000 kW have been commissioned during  the current year. That is quite a lot. There are big plans  also for the coming year. Russo-German joint-production modern,  economical gas turbines are being assembled in St. Petersburg,  the North Caucasus, and Novgorod. Construction is continuing of  the state regional electric power stations at Khoro-Nor in Chita  Oblast, Nizhnevartovsk in Tyumen Oblast, and in Pskov, and also  the Severnaya Heat and Electric Power Station in Moscow.    Power engineers are paying a lot of attention to energy  saving. So, for example, the (?Cryocor) Joint Stock Company is  planning to commission a turbo-expander installation at the No.  21 Heat and Electric Power Station in the capital in the new  year. This installation converts the gas energy in trunk gas  pipelines into electricity and in addition produces cryogenic  products -- nitrogen, oxygen, argon, xenon, and so forth.    [Dyakov] We have 600 such power stations. So there is a  great deal of scope for employing these turbo-expanders as  energy-saving technologies.    [Omelchenko] You have a new control panel here at the  central control room. This is a showcase of the electronic  equipment which is operating in Russia's power grid today.    [Dyakov] What is important is not just the hardware but also  the software, and we have developed it ourselves.    [Omelchenko] The intellectual basis of the power industry is  being created by the sector's leading scientific research  institutes in cooperation with the Professor Solomatin Software  Institute.    [Dyakov] Thanks to our comprehensive collective we have been  able to operate reliably, and I hope that we will always be able  to operate reliably.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- Representatives of the  seven ruling coalition parties failed Monday [7 February] to  reach a compromise on how to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut, a  pillar of the government's planned stimulus package, and only  agreed to meet Tuesday, coalition sources said.    The representatives held three rounds of talks on and off  throughout Monday in a bid to revise Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's tax program that is still threatening to split his  coalition. They agreed to meet at 10:30 A.M. [0130 GMT]  Tuesday, the sources said.    The third round, which started at around 7:00 P.M. after the  previous two rounds broke down, lasted only one hour, because of  persistent opposition from the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  which is demanding a major revision to the program, the sources  said. In an eleventh-hour bid to placate the SDP, Hosokawa  instructed his colleague, Hiroyuki Sonoda, to sketch out a  compromise version of the program combining a new indirect tax  with a tax cut.    Sonoda, leader of the alliance of Sakigake (Harbinger) and  the Japan New Party, immediately devised and presented the  compromise version at a meeting of representatives of the  coalition parties, only to find the SDP remaining unconvinced.    The SDP threatened last Thursday to quit the coalition  unless  Hosokawa agrees to accept its demands to revise the core aspects  of the tax proposal, including a demand to insert a clause  obliging all revenue from the new tax to be used for  welfare-related outlays. Hosokawa, however, has remained  reluctant to completely redesign his national welfare tax  program, making it difficult to narrow the gulf with the SDP,  they said.    The SDP is the biggest force in the coalition. Its  withdrawal would lead to the breakup of the coalition.    Hosokawa wants the issue settled before his departure on  Thursday for the United States for a summit with President Bill  Clinton.    In the morning meeting, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo  told his coalition counterparts that the party will not agree to  further talks unless Hosokawa agrees to revise core aspects of  the tax plan.    The SDP also demanded that the coalition not specify the  rate  of tax when introducing the text of the proposed legislation  onto the Diet floor, they said.    Kubo told the coalition leaders during the morning session,  "if this parley is merely designed to convince us to accept the  original tax proposal, we cannot help but turn it down."  However, Kubo said that if the coalition devised satisfactory  revision proposals, the party would agree to further  negotiations.    The Clinton administration has called on Tokyo to take steps  to implement tax cuts as a way of reviving stagnant consumer  spending and to whittle down Japan's huge trade surplus.</p>

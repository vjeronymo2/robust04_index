			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: New account opens on buoyant note THE first day of the new two-week trading account saw share prices race higher in response to opinion polls in the weekend press indicating a Conservative party lead, and hints of increased scope for another cut in UK interest rates in the near term. Better than expected UK trade figures, and a pledge by finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven countries to promote global economic growth, added to the general bullishness surrounding equities. The FT-SE 100 share index closed 29.5 higher at 2,539.9. This was well below the day's best level, 2,547.6, a rise of 37.2, reached just after a moderately positive start to the Wall Street session. Opening 18.3 points ahead, the Footsie never looked back. Dealers, said to be running extremely tight trading books, and worried late last week about the weekend's spate of opinion polls, marked prices sharply higher in an attempt to head off any big buying interest. A strong opening by the Footsie future also drove the market higher. Marketmakers, who adopted a cautious view on the market late last week, were said to be concerned about the prospect of dividend cuts from some of the UK market's big names in the next few weeks, after last week's dividend reduction by Lonrho. An illustration of the market's concern about possible dividend cuts came late in the session when Rank Organisation shares tumbled amid suggestions that the group may reduce the payment when it reveals preliminary figures on Thursday. There was also the suggestion that Rank could take the opportunity to launch a cash raising exercise via a rights issue. A more straightforward explanation for the steep decline in the Rank shares, according to one specialist, was that one broker had attempted to place a line of some 200,000 shares. The Rank story prompted a note of caution in an otherwise buoyant trading day. It was also pointed out that last week saw a growing number of cash calls in the market. A steady flow of generally small buying orders kept prices high throughout the day. Turnovers, however, remained pitifully thin. Yesterday saw only 448.1m shares traded, well down on last week's numbers which saw the level of business top 600m on two occasions. The better than expected December trade figures helped sentiment and kept sterling on an even keel against the D-Mark. Against the dollar, however, it was a different story. Sterling was sharply lower against the US currency and American buying was said to have been a substantial factor in the strength of the pharmaceuticals sub-sector. Politically sensitive areas of the market responded readily to the opinion poll readings. Water stocks, the Labour party's main target for renationalisation, surged higher, as did the regional electricity shares. There were worries among some commentators about the pace of the market's reaction to what is seen as a glimmer of hope on another cut in domestic interest rates. Mr Ian Harnett at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, the French-owned investment bank, described the market's response as 'an excessive reaction to some small pieces of good news', but expected the Footsie to test the 2,550 level in the short term.</p>

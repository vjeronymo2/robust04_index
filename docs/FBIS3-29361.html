			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- The government will  announce a conditional suspension of this year's "Team Spirit"  military exercise with the United States next week when an  outside nuclear inspection team arrives in North Korea, while  seeking to resume low-level dialogue with Pyongyang on an  exchange of special envoys, officials said Thursday.    At the same time, North Korea and the United States will  announce plans for a third round of high-level talks on  improving bilateral relations.    The government's announcement on Team Spirit will state that  the joint South Korea-U.S. field maneuvers would be suspended  if the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspections  of North Korean nuclear sites and the working-level inter-Korean  dialogue proceeded smoothly, according to the officials.    These were among the topics discussed Thursday at two  meetings of unification-related ministers on inter-Korean  relations after Pyongyang's decision Wednesday to permit IAEA  inspections. One meeting was presided over by Unification  Minister Yi Yong-tok and the other by Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang.    The U.S. announcement on plans for a third round of  high-level talks with North Korea will contain the same  conditions as those in the South Korean statement on Team  Spirit's suspension, the officials said.    The government will seek to exchange special envoys with  North Korea next month, with an eye to solving the North Korean  nuclear issue initially and then to implementing the basic  North-South agreement and arranging reunions for separated  families. But the government will prepare for the possibility  that North Korea might hinder the IAEA inspections or stall on  resuming inter-Korean dialogue to buy time for its nuclear arms  program, the officials said.    Seoul and Washington both maintain that an exchange of  special envoys between North and South Korea must take place  before the next high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, they added.  There will be no other form of inter-Korean contact but the  exchange of special envoys, an official said.    Another official said, however, it was unlikely that the  initial exchange of visits by the two Koreas' special envoys  would precede the high-level North Korea-U.S. talks, adding  that a visit by one side to the other could meet the condition  for resuming high-level discussions between Washington and  Pyongyang.</p>

As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests'' that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related in business matters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See generally Texas-Capital Contractors, Inc. v. Abdnor, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  933 F.2d 261 (5th Cir. 1990). For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition that is identical to the definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR &sect;124.100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 217. In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility rules. Our holding period rule, which, as discussed above, requires that winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks maintain an ownership structure meeting our eligibility requirements for five years, will serve as an additional safeguard against possible abuses arising from kinship relationships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 218. In fashioning rules for competitive bidding for broadband PCS licenses, we seek to promote the public policy goals set forth for us by Congress. We believe that the rules adopted in this Fifth Report and Order satisfy this objective. These rules should facilitate the rapid implementation of new broadband communications services through advanced technologies and efficient spectrum use, thus advancing the public interest by providing consumers with competitive and innovative wireless voice and data services and also fostering economic growth. The rules will allow for the public to recover a portion of the value of the public spectrum, and will promote access to broadband PCS services by consumers, producers and new entrants by ensuring that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women will have genuine opportunities to participate in the auctions and in the provision of service. We expect that the advent of PCS will benefit consumers by raising the overall level of competition in many already competitive segments of the telecommunications industry and providing competition in others for the first time, promote job creation in the communications and information sector of the domestic economy, and enhance productivity and efficiency in industry as a whole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 219. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253. Written comments on the IRFA were requested. The Commission's final analysis is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 220.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Need for and purpose of the action.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended. The rules adopted herein will carry out Congress's intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for broadband PCS licenses. The rules adopted herein also will carry out Congress's intent to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 221.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issues raised in response to the IRFA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IRFA noted that the proposals under consideration in the NPRM included the possibility of new reporting and recordkeeping requirements for a number of small business entities. No commenters responded specifically to the issues raised in the IRFA. We have made some modifications to the proposed requirements as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 222.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Significant alternatives considered and rejected.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All significant alternatives have been addressed in the Fifth Report and Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

Accordingly, it is ordered that part 24 of the Commission's Rules is amended as set forth in the attachment hereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 224. It is further ordered that the rules changes made herein will become effective 30 days after their publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [PASASON 16 April issue: "Lao People Wholeheartedly Welcome </F> Malaysian Government Delegation."]    [Text] In response to the invitation of His Excellency  [H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's  Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin  Mohamed, prime minister of Malaysia, will lead a Malaysian  Government delegation on an official friendship visit to the  LPDR on the morning of 16 April.    In regard to this significant event in the relations between  Laos and Malaysia, multiethnic Lao people throughout the  country, as well as Vientiane residents, are very pleased and  feel highly honored to have an opportunity to wholeheartedly  welcome the delegation of the Malaysian Government. This  official friendship visit to the LPDR by the Malaysian prime  minister and his delegation follows an official friendship visit  to Malaysia by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in early  December 1992, during which the Lao and Malaysian governments  signed agreements for the promotion and protection of  investment; economic and science and technology cooperation; and  air transportation. The three agreements serve as a very  important symbol of the future relations and cooperation between  Laos and Malaysia. Therefore, the visit to the LPDR by the  Malaysian prime minister and the delegation not only shows the  good friendship of Malaysian people with the multiethnic Lao  people but is also a most important event in the history of the  relationship between the two countries, which will become a firm  base for the effective enhancement of bilateral relations and  cooperation in the immediate future and in the long run and will  be a new milestone. All this is to serve the interests of the  two peoples of Laos and Malaysia and contribute to the continued  efforts to promote an atmosphere of peace, friendship, and  cooperation in the Southeast Asian region, as well as in the  world.    Laos and Malaysia belong to same region, have rendered  support to each other, and have shared good friendly relations  and neighborly cooperation. Their peoples have similar  characteristics and behavior. They love peace, maintain  self-mastery and ownership of the country, enjoy independence,  and admire progress and justice. They have never caused trouble  for others. Neither have they interfered or invaded other  countries. They have courageously carried out struggles with  great endeavor and patience for a long time for the sake of the  independence of their respective countries.    Malaysia is an active member of the nonaligned movement,  having played a consistent role and taken an firm stance  regarding the principles and objectives of the movement.  Concerning this, the peoples of Laos and Malaysia have had good  understanding of and trust in each other, and have thereby  enjoyed good bilateral relations for a long time. Both sides  have tried to promote relations in various aspects. In  particular, after the visit to Malaysia by H.E. Prime Minister  Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Malaysian ties have improved more  extensively and rapidly than before.    The multiethnic Lao people wish the official friendship  visit  to the LPDR by the Malaysian prime minister and his delegation a  glorious success, thus contributing to the further enhancement  and promotion of the relations and cooperation between the two  countries in a more expansive and effective manner. All this is  for the benefits of the peoples of Laos and Malaysia, as well as  for peace, friendship, and cooperation in the region and the  world.</p>

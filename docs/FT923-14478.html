			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (31): Sales staff are alerted to future problems - Case Study / Wiggins Teape / Combining a relational database with a fourth generation language has created a sophisticated new order processing system CUSTOMER service is often the key to success for commercial companies. Achieving high levels of customer satisfaction often means that detailed changes must be made to systems during their development. The choice of development tools is crucial to this, writes Michael Powell. Wiggins Teape is the largest paper merchant in the UK, part of the Arjo Wiggins group. It developed a new order processing system which it calls GENISYS (which stands for new GENeration of Information SYStems) to replace a 14-year-old Assembler-based system, using Software AG's Natural fourth-generation language (4GL), and IBM's relational database, DB2. 'DB2 is a strategic DBMS within this company, and Natural is a standard,' says information systems director Russell Storey. 'It also gave Software AG the opportunity to establish Natural/DB2.' The development, started in 1990, is being performed by Software AG, at a project cost of Pounds 1.5m. The initial feasibility study was performed by consultants from Nolan Norton, which led to the decision to go for a bespoke system. Hoskyns was selected to do the systems design on a fixed price contract. Wiggins Teape then went to the market again to tender for a developer. Software AG offered the best deal and was selected. Around 80 per cent of Wiggins Teape's sales orders come in through telephone calls. The system provides all information needed to support the sale. For instance, it displays action messages to alert sales people to potential problems with orders. This enables them to provide a more focused service using information based on exceptions. A system on this scale cannot be introduced in one move - 'we don't believe in big bangs,' says Mr Storey. The first phase, sales from stock, is implemented. The second phase, covering direct and indirect sales from third parties, is being implemented, and the detailed work on the next phase, covering accounts consolidation and stocking - back-office functions - is in progress. The entire project should be completed in September and will then have taken some 25 man-years to develop. The system handles around 2,500 transactions a day, and must provide good information to the sales person, with reasonable response time - 'our previous system was low on functionality, high on response time,' says Mr Storey. 'The new system responds in around two seconds.' He adds: 'We tend to be fairly cautious - state-of-the-shelf rather than state-of-the-art. We do a lot of transactions and need to retain competitive advantage, which means flexibility and the ability to make small changes to the system to improve services to the customer. We've been able to modify the system as we develop. 'Flexibility is the key word as far as we are concerned. That's why we went for Natural, and a relational database - which lets us make changes without massive re-structuring.' Wiggins Teape is developing a complex, carefully designed system, using high-level tools, which has enabled it significantly to improve the levels of service to its customers. The previous system did sterling service for many years but sacrificed flexibility to fast response. The choice of 4GL and relational database has enabled the company to retain flexibility during this development, without compromising the overall design.</p>

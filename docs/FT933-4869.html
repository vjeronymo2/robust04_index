			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Challenging the agency culture - Enterprise agencies are grappling with developments in the business support sector David Irwin and his team helped 136 people start up in business last year. They helped an even larger number decide they were perhaps not suited to going it alone. Irwin's offices are in an area of Newcastle upon Tyne reminiscent of the region's industrial past. But Project North East, the enterprise agency he heads, is aiming for an even brighter future for the region and has already made a considerable contribution. Project North East runs counselling and training sessions for would-be entrepreneurs as well as helping the owners of established businesses improve their management skills. It helps growing businesses raise finance and runs schemes to boost their exports. The organisation is just one of more than 300 enterprise agencies throughout the UK. The agencies, which started in St Helens, Merseyside, in 1978 - though London also claims a founding role - became important contributors to the rebirth of Britain's enterprise culture in the 1980s. They were set up as a private-sector initiative working alongside public-sector organisations, to revitalise local business communities. Last year more than 6,000 companies contributed about Pounds 17m in cash and kind, often by seconding staff, to the agencies' finances. Their initial focus was on helping people who wanted to start up their own business, though many have since diversified into a broader range of business support. Present high levels of unemployment have, however, emphasised their relevance to particular services such as job creation. 'Creating jobs and growth is right back on the agenda,' says Brian Wright, chief executive of the London Enterprise Agency. The agencies have remained a remarkably stable element in the small business support network, in spite of many changes in this area. They have not been untouched by the new developments, the most challenging so far being the creation of a nationwide network of one-stop business advice shops, now renamed 'business links'. The one-stop shops are a government initiative to bring together local providers of business support - chambers of commerce, local authority economic development units, Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and the agencies - to provide more effective services. The creation of the business link network is just one of a number of challenges to the agencies' existing form. Other developments are: A decision by Business in the Community (BitC), which co-ordinates community programmes for its corporate members, to give up its role of umbrella organisation for the agencies. The growing role of the Training and Enterprise Councils in channelling government funds into enterprise development. A revitalised chamber of commerce movement, which is attempting to bring the level of service it provides up to the level of its publicly financed continental counterparts. BitC's decision to end its special relationship with the enterprise agencies came at a time when they were grappling with the effects of some of the other changes in the small business support sector. BitC had acted as a lobbyist for the agencies and encouraged them to increase their professionalism. Its departure from this role has been followed by several months of rivalry as agencies in the east Midlands attempted to forge a national organisation called the Association of Local Enterprise Agencies. But the association failed to win sufficient backing and a national network is now being formed under the National Federation of Enterprise Agencies banner. John Guest, a senior executive for Cadbury Schweppes, has been seconded to the federation as chief executive. He says the strength of the organisation is that it will be 'owned' by the agencies in a way that BitC never was. The federation will provide a national voice for the agencies and give encouragement in areas such as quality management. Guest envisages the federation's ambit going beyond that of simply acting as a trade association for the agencies. He says it should also set out to influence those government policies directed at helping small firms. With the national organisation now in place the agencies should be well placed to address the more fundamental challenges to their role. These centre on their relationships with the Tecs, the one-stop shops and the pattern of corporate funding. Some in the business support field fear that the creation of a one-stop shop network threatens their individual identity and therefore attractiveness to corporate sponsors. Wright says that in many parts of Britain the perception of the agencies as a partnership between the private and public sectors has already been eroded. Public-sector finance channelled through the Tecs has come to play a growing role in the agencies' financing. At the same time large companies face increasing demands on their resources to fund community projects. Guest recognises the potential problem of 'sponsor fatigue' but believes it can be overcome through improved marketing by the agencies to their private-sector backers. The Tecs, Guest says, account for 50 per cent of the agencies' budgets, most of it in the form of payments for training and counselling contracts. Corporate sponsors account for just 20 per cent, but they still provide half of the agencies' 'core funding' to meet overheads and administrative costs. Irwin reckons Project North East received about 13 per cent of its 1993 revenues of Pounds 1.2m from corporate backers, 26 per cent from the UK public sector, 12 per cent from European funds and 49 per cent from fees and other earned income. 'You must handle your sponsors correctly but provided they still get recognition for what they do there should be no reason for them to stop funding you,' he says. Irwin says, however, that it is important for the government to continue to pump money into the small-business sector through programmes such as the Enterprise Initiative, which subsidises consultancy help. Project North East and the other agencies charge their established company clients for services where possible but are still committed to providing a free service to the start-up business. Many involved in enterprise agencies see the maintainance of their individual identity as central to their ability to continue to raise private-sector finance. In theory they have a strong hand. The agencies have unrivalled experience in helping start-ups and advising small established businesses. The chambers of commerce role, in contrast, has always veered more towards providing information and assistance in fields such as exports. And while many Tecs have expanded into providing training and advice they are, in comparison to agencies, only recent arrivals. 'Our unique contribution is our experience operating a business advice service for six years,' comments Bryce Staniland, finance director at DonBAC, the Doncaster enterprise agency, shortly to join the local one-stop shop. Despite the agencies' tradition of providing hands-on help to small firms the picture is inevitably becoming blurred as some become absorbed in the local Tec or merge with chambers. There is already evidence that agency numbers will decrease over the next few years, leaving only those that have a broad financial and operating base. Irwin estimates that 50 agencies at most will be strong enough to survive. Guest says the agencies' federation represents 100 of the 250 agencies in England and the regional associations are signing up new members all the time. He hopes that the regional associations will form networks so that the larger agencies support the smaller ones. But he acknowledges the agency movement will not be served by maintaining weak agencies that cannot offer a good level of service. David Grayson, managing director of BitC's business strategy group, contends that the one-stop shops are the natural successors of the agency movement of the 1980s. The agencies face considerable change but should not feel threatened, he says. Agency directors and the small business community will be hoping that he is right. At the same time many in the community must be concerned that one of the most successful sectors of small business support faces such an upheaval.</p>

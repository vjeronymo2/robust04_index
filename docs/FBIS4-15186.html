			<p>BFN     [Text] Lithuanian-Russian economic relations are impeded by  political reasons, Lithuanian Ambassador to Russia Romualdas  Kozyrovicius maintains.    Russia has not yet ratified the treaty on trade and economy  signed last fall granting the most favorable trade regime. In  an interview to the daily LIETUVOS RYTAS [MORNING OF LITHUANIA],  Kozyrovicius maintains that Russia does not intend to ratify  this treaty until a packet of agreements on the Kaliningrad  region have been signed.    According to the ambassador, when last fall the Russian and  Lithuanian prime ministers signed the inter state economic  treaty, there was no condition raised to Lithuania that the  agreement coming into force was directly linked with the  political agreement on the Kaliningrad region.    Speaking about new treaties with Russia, the draft treaty on  transit through Lithuania to Kaliningrad was singled out by the  Lithuanian ambassador. According to the ambassador there was no  need to have such a treaty at all. He believes that it would be  best if the Lithuanian Seimas could adopt a law on transit,  which would embrace all the conditions.    Speaking about the agreements on the Kaliningrad region,  Kozyrivicius stressed that the treaty should be of an inter  state and not a geographical nature. At the same time the  ambassador pointed out that the continuing militarization of the  Kaliningrad region caused concern to Lithuania. He also  stressed that Lithuania recognized all Russia's rights to this  territory and that Lithuania had no claims.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lloyd's suffers setback in battle with Names LLOYD'S of London has suffered a setback in its legal battle with dissident Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting at the market. Judge Morris Lasker in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a restraining order last week, temporarily preventing Lloyd's from pursuing lawsuits against two Names. The order will remain in force until August 19. Lloyd's has issued the writs to try to force the Names to pay cash calls needed to pay insurance losses. The Names are among a group of 110 represented by New York-based Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn. The group alleges that Lloyd's violated US securities laws by inducing its members to participate in syndicates trading at the insurance market. Meanwhile, Mr Gordon Pollock QC said in the High Court yesterday that an effort by dissident Lloyd's Names to seek a judicial review of the insurance market was 'doomed to failure'. Mr Pollock, representing Lloyd's, said the market was 'not subject to public law'. Lloyd's has applied for leave to set aside a motion from six Names seeking a judicial review. The Names are members of loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates and contend that by permitting a series of cash calls, Lloyd's has not met its obligations to members. Mr Pollock said that the interests of policyholders must be paramount. The case continues today. David Owen writes: Lloyd's will proceed with plans to double the size of its central guarantee fund through a one-off levy on all Names without awaiting the results of a ballot on key motions proposed for an extraordinary general meeting later this month, Mr David Coleridge, chairman, told senior Tory backbenchers at Westminster last night.</p>

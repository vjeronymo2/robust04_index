			<p>BFN     [Text] Carabineros (Acting) Director General Fernando  Cordero has assured that relations between Carabineros and the  government are absolutely normal and that it is not possible to  say whether there is a winner or a loser.    He made this statement during a rally held to pay tribute to  Carabineros martyrs at the memorial on Alameda Avenue corner  with Namur Street. Cordero said the tribute is paid every year  to dead Carabineros and to Carabineros martyrs. The institution  is commemorating its 67th anniversary.    He also confirmed that General Rodolfo Stange did not attend  the ceremony and that he is spending his leave in southern  Chile. Cordero reiterated that Stange's request for leave  without pay for another 60-day period is consistent with a  previous decision to facilitate the investigation by the judge  probing the so-called slain people case.    Asked about the dinner hosted on 2 May by President Eduardo  Frei for the high command, he replied it was a "very pleasant"  and "very interesting" meeting, adding that relations between  the government and the Carabineros "are appropriate for the  government and for a state institution like the Carabineros."  He emphasized that relations are absolutely normal. "We must  continue to work. There are many things to do," he said.    Asked about the influence of the situation affecting Gen.  Stange on the Carabineros, Cordero replied: "The institution, as  such, has not been harmed at all. It is a state institution  that must continue working." He admitted, however, that  "obviously, there have been personal problems,  misinterpretation, and things like that, but the institution  remains absolutely sound, united and at work, and this is the  most important thing."    As to whether the government had "won a confrontation with  the Carabineros," Cordero replied that "it is not a point of  winning or defeating anyone. We are a state institution at the  service of society and we cannot seek to either win or lose  against anyone. We are state servants."</p>

This revised part will contain the policies and the procedures applicable to REA borrowers and contractors when purchasing materials and equipment and constructing electric system facilities by contract or force account (the REA borrower's own construction crews).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These policies and the procedures implement certain provisions of the REA standard form of loan documents regarding the borrower's purchase of materials and equipment and the construction of its electric system by contract or force account. In order to facilitate the programmatic interests of the RE Act, and, in order to assure that loans made or guaranteed by REA are adequately secured, REA, as a secured lender, has established certain standards and specifications for materials, equipment, and the construction of electric systems. The use of standard forms and procurement procedures helps assure REA that: (1) appropriate standards and specifications are maintained; (2) REA's loan security is not adversely affected; and (3) loan and loan guarantee funds are used effectively and for the intended purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

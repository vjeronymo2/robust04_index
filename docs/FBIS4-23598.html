			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- People should not have  exaggerated expectations of the government's Reconstruction and  Development Programme [RDP], President Nelson Mandela said on  Thursday at the World Economic Forum's two-day meeting in Cape  Town. Leaders had a duty to point out to the people their basic  demands could not be met overnight. It could take up to five  years.    The government had raised R2.5 billion [rand] from its own  resources for reconstruction.    Past wastage of resources and distortion of priorities had  to  be borne in mind. For instance, R10 billion had been spent on  arms and ammunition while South Africa had been under no threat  from its neighbours, although only R2 billion had been spent on  housing in the same period.    Mr Mandela said the government proposed a more balanced and  effective tax collection system.    Once the country had addressed its internal problems,  especially violence, it would be on the way to creating a  climate for investment.    Mr Mandela said the development programme and the African  National Congress' manifesto also addressed the problems of  small business in South Africa.    He encouraged investors to form partnerships with black  businessmen and said the government was looking at the  difficulties black businessmen had in obtaining credit from  banks. It was considering the formation of a bank to finance  black business.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: WORLDS APART: HE TAKES MANHATTAN, SHE TAKES THE FARM  </P> <P> Q. I am in my late 60s, my lady is in her mid-70s. The age difference is of no  importance, but our life styles come between us. She is happy on a ranch two  states away; I like living in a city where I have lived for 20 years and have  activities, associations, a few friends. She is warm and hospitable; I am more  introverted and solitude-seeking.  </P> <P> Her children know about our friendship, mine do not. I can't ask her to leave  her country life, and I don't want to leave my urban one. We are both  comfortably well-off. How do we arrange our future? No one has ever made me as  happy as she does, and my company seems to be very pleasing to her.  </P> <P> A. What's the rush to settle down in one place or the other? If you are well  enough fixed for income, you can spend time with each other sometimes in her  place, sometimes in yours. That sounds sensible, but something keeps the two of  you from adopting this simple plan, or rather letting yourselves drift into it.  </P> <P> It would seem that you each have preoccupations connected with your places of  residence. You mean so much to each other, but not enough to give up your  interests. In fact, your interests are more interesting to you than your  affection for each other. This is no crime. It is a good thing to have a life  you like living, concerns that keep you occupied. You are not ready to accept  living out on her ranch, but maybe in a while it will seem a pleasant life and  your city preoccupations may not seem so important. Or the pleasures of living  in town may captivate her. Why not go along as you are for a while, and find  out what happens?  </P> <P> Q. I am 60 and I have been stimulating myself to orgasm regularly since  puberty. At present I would say I do this about six times a week. Is this  likely to impair my future health?  </P> <P> A. No. There is no medical evidence that doing this has any health effect at  all.  </P></p>

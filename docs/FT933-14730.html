			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Letter: Relatively imprecise about kin Sir, I've read with satisfaction and joy that Donald Duck and his kin - plus a certain mouse called Mickey - have returned to Chinese news stands. That's good news. However, I'd like to call your attention to a number of imprecisions ('Mickey Mouse squeaks back into Beijing on best behaviour', international and early UK editions): 1. Donald Duck does not have 'exuberant offspring' because, of course, Hughie, Dewey and Louie are his nephews, not his sons. They were sent to Mr Duck by a certain cousin Della in 1937. 2. You call Mr McDuck, the money-worshipping arch-capitalist, 'Dagobert' by first name. In fact, his name is Scrooge McDuck, while 'Dagobert' is the Christian name chosen for the German edition. I don't think that you, even as a leading paper in economic and financial affairs, will get invited to Mr McDuck's billionaires' parties if you continue to use his name wrongly. 3. You mention Mr McDuck's 'habit of bathing in piles of dollar bills'. This is not entirely correct. Mr McDuck does in fact swim in heaps of money (three cubic hectares, to be precise). However, he relishes coins as much as or more than bills. Allow me to draw your attention to 'Only a poor old man' (1952): 'And I like to dive around in my money like a porpoise] And burrow through it like a gopher] And toss it up and let it hit me on the head]' All this would be very difficult if he had nothing but dollar bills.

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bank loan would open door to a pension Sir, I read with some interest the comments from Roger Key, partner at consulting actuaries, R Watson, concerning retrospective pension accrual for part-time workers ('The European pensions ruling', September 29). Mr Key is reported as saying that, in the context of contributory schemes, part-time workers were unlikely to have the sums necessary to buy retrospective benefits. In order to protect the financial interests of such employees, I feel that it is important to take issue with this view. Consider the simplified example of a part-time worker who is one month from normal retirement date with back-service to 1976. A short-term bank loan could be taken to pay for past employee contributions. In principle, one month later such a loan can be repaid in full from tax-free cash arising from the pension benefits. The pensioner would then be free to enjoy the residual pension in return for a nil net outlay. A little creative thought will also produce solutions for less convenient cases (eg, exploiting any early retirement provisions or exploring the practicalities of waiting until retirement date before claiming past pension rights).

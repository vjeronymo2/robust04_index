			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Gooda Walker hearing date set A HEARING date of April 26 was set yesterday for the legal action by some 3,000 Gooda Walker Names. It means the case will come to court up to a year earlier than had been expected. Mr Justice Saville, who presides in all Lloyd's actions, will hear the case, which is the biggest by Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market. The news follows the announcement that the Serious Fraud Office is to investigate transactions by the Gooda syndicates, which have left Names with losses of more than Pounds 900m incurred between 1987 and 1990. Mr Philip Rocher, of Wilde Sapte, solicitors to the Gooda Names, said the decision to hear the cases so soon represented 'a very substantial advance for the Names' action groups'. He added: 'It will increase pressure on the market's authorities to settle the dispute out of court.' The Names allege negligent underwriting and are seeking more than Pounds 500m in damages from 67 Lloyd's agencies. The case, expected to last 12 weeks, will involve presentations by a number of expert witnesses, including Mr Ulrich von Eichen, a former executive of Munich Re, the German reinsurance company. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, which represents Names involved, said the 'size and complexity is such that the case was not expected to be heard until 1995'. Mr Deeny said: 'Our legal advisers believe that the fraud investigation will not impede our civil case. We have seen the standard wording of the errors and omissions policies that insured Lloyd's agencies against actions like our's for negligence. The policies explicitly cover fraud.' Mr Justice Saville last week set a hearing date in October next year for another large case being brought by more than 1,000 Feltrim Names. The commercial court will also conduct hearings on a preliminary issue relevant to both these and other Lloyd's cases in September this year. This concerns the vicarious liability of members' agents, which handle Names' affairs, for the actions of managing agents, which administer syndicates.</p>

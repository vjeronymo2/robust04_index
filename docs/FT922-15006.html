			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: La Cinq judgment today may black out channel LA CINQ, the troubled television station, will today discover whether it is to become the first national French TV channel to go off the air. Mr Michel Rouger, president of the commercial court in Paris, has spent the past two months analysing the financial situation at La Cinq, which filed for bankruptcy at the beginning of this year. He is expected today to deliver his judgment on whether it can continue broadcasting or should close. Until last week it looked as though Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian businessman,might have rescued La Cinq. Fininvest, one of the Berlusconi companies, had tabled a FFr1.5bn restructuring package intended to keep the channel afloat. Mr Berlusconi, a founding investor in La Cinq and still one of the largest shareholders, alongside Hachette, the French media group, with a 25 per cent stake, had hoped to persuade other investors to participate in the scheme. However, he failed to attract enough support for his proposals and announced his withdrawal on Tuesday last week. Fininvest has since held further talks with other interested parties, including the Union des Annonceurs, the body that represents France's advertisers, in the hope of putting together a last-minute package. Last night, they appeared to have come to nothing. In the meantime, other companies have been putting together plans for stations to broadcast on La Cinq's frequency. TF1, M6 and Canal Plus, three other French TV stations, have been working on a project for a French language version of CNN, the news channel. There have also been reports that the French government favours relaying Arte, a cultural channel, in La Cinq's place. As La Cinq's 600 staff wait to hear their fate, the company's shareholders are counting the cost of its problems. Earlier this week, Hachette disclosed that it envisaged making a provision of FFr1.8bn for its losses on La Cinq, which will take such a toll on its balance sheet that it has been forced to ask its banks for an injection of capital in a formal financial restructuring.</p>

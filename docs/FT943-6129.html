			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Macfarlane (Clansman) rises 33% - Cash pile currently at Pounds 20m and further acquisitions in the offing Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Glasgow-based packaging group, lifted pre-tax profits by almost 33 per cent in the first half of 1994. Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said the economic climate 'had gently been getting better' and that the trend was still upward. A packaging company with all its activities confined to the UK was a reliable bellwether, he added. Pre-tax profits grew to Pounds 7.09m (Pounds 5.35m) on turnover up 13 per cent at Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 46.3m). Interest receivable expanded to Pounds 573,000 (Pounds 363,000), though, with current low rates, Lord Macfarlane admitted that the group's Pounds 20m cash pile could be used better than remaining on deposit. Cash balances in March had stood at Pounds 21m. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 4m in the first half, with another Pounds 4m pencilled in for the second. In August Macfarlane bought Centurion Packaging for Pounds 5.5m in cash and shares. This added the manufacturing of film products for packaging to the existing merchanting activities. Lord Macfarlane said he was seeking further acquisition possibilities, probably of a similar size to Centurion. As well as packaging, which accounts for about 75 per cent of sales, the group has two other divisions - plastic moulding and development. The former makes bottle closures for whisky distillers and closures for the detergents industry. Within development is a self-adhesive labels business, which 'makes a lot of money' and to which Lord Macfarlane admits to being sentimentally attached, and a contract furniture merchanting business. Acknowledging it was an oddity within a packaging company, he said it occupied 'a good site in the centre of Glasgow' and he was 'waiting for a good fairy' to show interest. He expected to be able to sell it within the next two years. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.44p), payable from earnings of 6.14p (4.74p).</p>

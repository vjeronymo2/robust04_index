			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness slides on results International drinks group Guinness was the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 stocks yesterday as it reported dull results undermined by sliding margins and continued tough trading. The shares retreated 18 to 484p on turnover of 10m. Although profits came in line with expectations - the company gave a good indication following its restructuring with French group LVMH in January - some market specialists were disgruntled by two exceptional items of Pounds 17m which they felt slightly flattered the headline figure. The 9 per cent drop in operating profits at United Distillers also disappointed some, as did the retreat in Spain. Kleinwort Benson said the poor figures pointed to another year of earnings decline, with little in the way of optimism for 1995. The broker, which has reduced its profits forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 925m, has the stock as a long-term hold but believes further weakness is likely in the short term. NatWest Securities disagreed, pencilling in 7 per cent earnings growth this year after taking into account the recent restructuring with LVMH, and with a profits forecast virtually unchanged at Pounds 935m. The broker pointed out that Guinness's key markets - the US, UK and Japan - have bottomed out.</p>

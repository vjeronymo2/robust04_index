			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / More Russian cabinet changes Russia's prolonged cabinet shuffle continued yesterday with the appointment by President Boris Yeltsin of two new deputy prime ministers: Mr Oleg Davydov, the foreign trade minister, and Mr Alexei Bolshakov, an industrialist. Mr Yeltsin said the changes were part of a broad effort to bring 'professionals and not politicians' into the government. But Russian observers, perplexed by a week of new appointments and resignations which appear to have favoured reformers and conservatives in equal measure, are interpreting the changes as part of a complex power struggle between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, his prime minister. By replacing Mr Alexander Shokhin as deputy prime minister, Mr Davydov - who upset markets over the summer with an impromptu demand for debt forgiveness  -will assume responsibility for all of Russia's foreign economic negotiations. Mr Bolshakov is to be responsible for relations between Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. He is a favourite of the conservative parliament and is expected to strengthen the 'red barons', the former Soviet factory directors, against the younger, academic market reformers in the cabinet.</p>

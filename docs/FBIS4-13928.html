			<p>BFN     [Text] A NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in al-Nabatiyah  reports that the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights came under concentrated  artillery fire from the occupation forces' positions at about  1930 today. The shelling, which was accompanied by heavy  machine-gun fire, was directed mainly at Mlita, al-Luwayzah, and  Jabal Safi. At 2000 the forests of al-Litani were raked by  bursts of machine-gun fire from positions held by the Agent Lahd  militia [South Lebanese Army] in 'Alman and al-Shumariyah.    The occupation forces this afternoon shelled Qabrikha and  Tulin with mortars and tank guns, causing heavy material damage.  The Qabrikha-Majdal Silm road also came under sniper fire from  the occupation forces' positions in Tallusi.    Meanwhile, the Amal Movement has announced that one of its  groups attacked an enemy mechanized patrol on the  al-Qantarah-al-Tayyibah road at 1745 today, using rockets and  automatic weapons.

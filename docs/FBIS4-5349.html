			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Finance Minister Yun Ki-chong to the second day </F> morning session of the Seventh Session of the Ninth Supreme  People's Assembly on 7 April: "Review of the Performance of the  DPRK State Budget for 1993 and the State Budget for  1994"--recorded]    [Text] Comrade deputies: Under today's grand circumstances  in which all the people are responding to the party's appeal and  displaying their infinite devotion by vigorously accelerating  the general march of socialism, we will discuss the result of  the execution of the state budget of last year and this year.    Today, our people are accelerating the struggle to implement  the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song at the 21st plenary session of the  sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and  the letter he sent to the historic national agricultural  meeting. They are also effecting a new great upsurge in the  major fronts of economic construction, including agriculture and  light industry.    Enhancing the genuine appearance of our society's  single-hearted unity firmly rallied around the party and the  leader [suryong] and their beautiful communist virtues which  show our people's noble ideological and mental features, all of  our working people are vigorously advancing, while breaking  through all sorts of difficulties and the challenge of enemies,  and the whole country is filled an unprecedented upsurge in the  popular masses' revolutionary zeal.    We should strengthen the country's might and further exalt  the superiority of the popular masses-centered socialism of our  own style by successfully executing the immense tasks of  economic construction that we are facing and this year's state  budget on the strength of our masses' surging revolutionary  zeal. By the authority of the Government of the Republic I will  now present a report on the settlement of the execution of the  state budget for 1993 and the state budget for 1994.    Comrade deputies: Last year our people won a great victory  in  socialist construction by surmounting the grim trials laid  before the fatherland and the revolution and by fighting  heroically under the party's leadership.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Winning  successive victories in political and military confrontation  with enemies under the party's leadership, our people vigorously  accelerated socialist economic construction with surging  revolutionary zeal last year and, as a result, adorned the last  year of the Third Seven-Year Plan as a brilliant year.    Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries perpetrated  offensives and aggression manuevers designed to oppose our  republic, a fortress of socialism, and to crush our socialist  cause more adventurously and viciously. However, they could not  frighten our people, nor could they block our people's advance.    Our party took a stern self-defensive measure of placing the  whole country, all the people, and all the Army in a semi-war  state to cope with the extremely acute situation which was  created due to the Team Spirit joint military exercise staged by  the U.S. imperialists and, thus, vigorously inspired all the  people throughout the country into a struggle to defend the  sovereignty aof the country and the gains of the revolution.    Brave officers and men of our People's Army and all of the  working people who are infinitely loyal to the party and the  leader [suryong] bravely rose up with a do-or-die determination  in response to the party's call and heroically braved the  enemies' offensives, holding aloft the banner of socialism to  thus honorably defended the fatherland's dignity and security.  [applause]    Upholding our party's call, our people waged a vigorous  and continuous battle of loyalty, maintaining the spirit of  general mobilization heightened during the period of a semi-war  state, registered great labor exploits, and grandly celebrated  the 40th anniversary of the victory in the Great Fatherland  Liberation War. Through this, they strongly demonstrated the  heroic spirit of our people vigorously advancing firmly rallied  around the party and the leader and the might of chuche Korea.  [applause]    In the forceful blaze of the external struggle and of the  socialist general onward march which was vigorously waged  greeting the 40th anniversary of the war victory, the  revolutionary ranks of our wholehearted unity were solidified  more firmly into an invincible force, and a great upsurge was  brought forth in socialist economic construction. By so doing,  a great victory was won in the battle for the final year of the  Third Seven-Year Plan.    In connection with the conclusion of the Third Seven-Year  Plan, the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth WPK Central  Committee held last year proudly summed up the great advance our  people had achieved in all sectors of socialist construction  under our party's great leadership despite grave trials and  difficulties during this period when the situation at home and  abroad was most complex and acute. By so doing, the plenary  meeting highly demonstrated again the heroic spirit of the  chuche Korea and the might of our-style socialism which is  firmly maintained in a corner of the Orient and is victoriously  advancing.    All the victories our people achieved in acute confrontation  with enemies last year were a great victory of the  ever-victorious strength of our party's iron will and tested  leadership and independent, self-reliant, and self-defending  revolutionary line. They were the victory of the wholehearted  unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. They were the  powerful demonstration of the superiority and invincibility of  our-style socialism centered on the popular masses. [applause]    In the all-people general onward march last year, our people  brought forth great upsurges in socialist economic construction,  thus successfully executing the state budget as well. The total  state budget revenue last year was 40.5712 billion won. This  represents our overfulfilling the plan by 0.3 percent. Because  our people vigorously waged a mass campaign to increase the  financial revenue by effecting production upsurge in all sectors  of the people's economy and effectively utilizing the existing  economic base, the budget revenue scored an increase of 2.6  percent over the previous year.    The total state budget expenditure last year was 40.24297  billion won. This represents an execution of 99.5 percent of  the planned amount and an increase of 2.4 percent over the  previous year.    The state budget last year satisfactorily ensured the  increasing financial demands in various domains of socialist  construction based on the increased budged revenue, and was  successfully summed up with financial reserves of 328.23 million  won.    During the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan which was  embroidered with great creation and construction, state budget  income in our country increased with a rapid average speed of  5.2 percent per year and the total scale of budget income  increased 1.4 times.    As a result, the state budget in our country excellently  contributed to strengthening the might of the self-reliant  socialist economy, to promoting and developing a socialist  national culture, to promoting the people's material and  cultural welfare, and to highly displaying the superiority of  our own-style socialism.    This clearly demonstrates incomparable superiority and  firmness of the state budget of our country, which is developing  in a planned manner based on independent financial foundations,  as well as the justness of our party's financial policy.  [applause]    Last year, the government of the republic increased  disbursement of funds to the national economy 2.5 percent over  the previous year with a view to accelerating socialist economic  construction and to further promoting the people's living  standard. Of the funds, the investment in precedent sectors of  national economy, in light industry, and in rural economy was  drastically increased.    Last year the state budget increased the investment in coal  industry, mining industry, electric power industry, and metal  industry, by 3.5 percent over the previous year, and ensured  production conditions with priority. Thus, it directed great  efforts to effecting a production upsurge in these domains.    By cherishing ardent loyalty to the party and the leader,  the  working class of the coal industry domain effected collective  innovations last year, and completed construction of Hwapung  mine in Anju district mine complex; the project of in-pit  belt-conveyer transport line in Namyang mine, Pukchang district  mine complex, and first and second-phase construction project of  long-range conveyor-belt transport line in Yongdae mine. The  working class in this domain vigorously pushed ahead with  construction of new mines and new pits, and expansion project of  existing pits, and accelerated modernization of in-pit transport  means and coal mining facilities, thus drastically increasing  coal production capacity.    Last year, the mining industry sector completed construction  of No. 12 pit and No.24 vertical pit in Komdok mine complex; ore  dressing site in (Taeduri) mine; ore dressing site in Changsang  mine, and [word indistinct] in Munmuri mine. The mining industry  sector further expanded mines with bright prospects and  drastically increased production of various types of ore  including lead, zinc, and copper.    Construction of large-scale hydroelectric power stations and  thermoelectric power stations, Kumgangsan power station, and  Yongwon power station was vigorously pushed ahead last year,  thanks to the devoted labor struggle of the working class of the  electric power industry sector which is endlessly loyal to the  party and the leader, and of the builders of the power stations.  In addition, the No. 1 generator in Namgang power station and  No. 2 generator in Tongpyongyang thermoelectric power station  began operation, and a large number of small and medium-size  hydroelectric power stations were built in many places.    Last year in the metal industry sector, the construction  project of the steel plate [words indistinct] in the Hwanghae  Iron and Steel Complex, the construction project of the [word  indistinct] in the Chollima Steel Complex, and the expansion  work of the ferroalloy workshop in the Puryong Ferroalloy  Complex were completed because of the strength of the state's  vast investments and steel workers' creative efforts and  struggle. The processes of steel and rolling steel manufacturing  were readjusted and strengthened, and, as a result, metal plants  were more firmly built into a chuche-oriented and modern  metallurgical base.    Last year, our party and the government of the republic  concentrated great efforts on developing the light industry. The  state budget allocated a large amount of funds--which increased  4 percent over the previous year--to the light industry sector  in accordance with our party's revolutionary policy of  increasing investments in the light industry and of thoroughly  carrying out the revolution in the light industry sector.    Thanks to our party's active measures and the devoted labor  struggle by the working class in the light industry sector, a  great innovation was effected in the production of various kinds  of daily necessities urgently required in improving the people's  living. Along with this, the expansion work of the Kusong  textile plant, the construction of the 4 March plant, the  construction of the Nanam clothing plant, and the construction  projects of various other modern textile and clothing plants,  shoes plants, and food processing plants were completed and put  into operation. Thus, the modernization of light industry plant  facilities were vigorously carried out.    Last year, the government of the republic also allocated a  large amount of funds--which increased 4 percent over the  previous year--to the railway transport sector. The working  class and builders in the railway transport sector readjusted  and strengthened major trunk lines into heavy-duty rails by  accelerating the modernization of railway transport and the  introduction of heavy-duty railways, upholding the party's  policy of carrying out the revolution in the transport sector.  They also actively carried out the work for technological  innovation and completed the electrification of the  Yongkwang-Saju line, the construction of the turning line  [tollimson] railway construction between Kowon and Kurae, and  other railway electrification projects and new railway  construction in many areas. Thus, they further increased the  railway transport capabilities.    Last year, the rural economy sector vigorously waged the  struggle to implement the demands of the socialist rural theses  and the chuche farm methods and, as a result, achieved a great  progress in agricultural production.    Last year, the state sharply increased its investment in  agriculture--2.8 percent over the previous year--in an effort to  strengthen the material and technological foundation of the  rural economy by carrying out the rural technological  revolution. Last year, on the strength of the vigorous support  from the people throughout the country, our agricultural working  people completed the construction of the Sohae lockgate  (Haesan)-Ongjin waterway and, thus, more smoothly resolved the  water supply problem in our country's plain areas. They also  built 1,000 water pumping stations and drainage facilities and  more of water reservoirs and underground water supply facilities  in various areas. Thus, they more properly perfected the  irrigation system in our rural areas.    Thanks to our party's active measures to achieve the use of  chemicals in the rural economy, last year more of various kinds  of chemical fertilizer were produced and supplied in the rural  areas, and, as a result, the amount of chemical fertilizers  applied on fields across the country increased by far.    Last year, a large number of tractors, trucks, and various  types of modern farm machines were produced and supplied to  cooperative farms.    By vigorously carrying out the huge nature remaking  project to build a tideland towards the West Sea, our brave  tideland builders have registered a brilliant feat of reclaiming  vast areas of tidal land by completing construction on Kumsong  and Chongsudo tidelands.    Under the banner of the socialist rural theses, irrigation  and electrification have already been completed at a high level  in our country's rural areas, and new progress has also been  made in mechanizing and scientizing rural areas. Thus, a  significant [kyolchongjogin] victory has been achieved in  implementing a technological revolution in rural areas.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historic letter  to the national agricultural meeting held on the 30th  anniversary of the publication of the theses on our country's  socialist rural problems. In the letter, summing up the great  victory achieved by our party and people in the struggle to  implement the rural theses, he announced proudly that the  historic task of implementing the technological revolution in  rural areas, which is presented in the socialist rural theses,  has basically been completed [kibonjogurowansong toeodda] with  the realization of irrigation, electrification, mechanization,  and scientization in our country's rural areas. [applause]    This is the change of the century made in our country's  rural  areas and the most brilliant victory achieved in the course of  the struggle to realize the rural theses. [applause]    Because of the technological revolution realized in rural  areas under the brilliant rays of the socialist rural theses,  the material and technological basis of agriculture has been  strengthened further than ever, and we could achieve a bumper  crop last year despite unfavorable weather by completely  observing the chuche farming method.    The brilliant result achieved in the rural economic  development under our party's leadership clearly demonstrates  the great vitality of the socialist rural theses, which has  opened the broad way to solve rural problems, and the  superiority of our country's socialist rural economic system,  which has been consolidated and developed under the banner of  the rural theses. [applause]    The republic's government appropriated an enormous fund, 1.5  percent up from last year, to build more houses and to further  develop cities and other territories of the country.    Upholding our party's intent to build a grand capital,  builders and supporters in Pyongyang built the Kwangbok and  Tong-il streets and 50,000 modern houses and completed the huge  and difficult construction in the short space of one and half  years by continuously effecting mass innovations. Last year,  they registered another brilliant feat of completing the  construction of an additional 30,000 modern houses.    The newly built magnificent, luxurious modern houses in the  capital are proud creations whose construction was due to the  great benevolence of our party, which has led builders to create  an unprecedented speed of construction with a high goal to  arrange better living conditions for our people.    Last year, in Pyongyang city, greeting the 40th  anniversary of the war victory, the commemorative tower of the  victory of the Fatherland Liberation War was built reflecting  our party's lofty will and farsighted plan to hand down the  heroic exploits of our People's Army and our people who  honorably defended the freedom and sovereignty of the fatherland  to the next generations forever. Along with this, the three  revolutions exhibition newly opened; a hotel for (?scientists),  Pyongyang cold noodle restaurant equipped with 5,000 seats in  modern facilities, the road between Pyongyang and Kangdong, the  (Munsong) (?playground), and Pyongyang bowling hall--which  reflects the patriotic spirit of the industrialists of the  General Association of Koreans residing in Japan and their  families--were outstandingly built. As a result of this,  Pyongyang has been turned into a more splendid, modern city.    Numerous monumental edifices which have been built in  Pyongyang in succession very year and the grand appearance of  Pyongyang which is being changed clearly shows the dignified  appearance of chuche Korea which is enjoying infinite grandeur  and prosperity and the wisdom and heroic mettle of our people  who are glorifying the era of the Workers Party.    Last year, the state built many modern houses not only in  local cities such as Sinuiju, Haesan, Haeju, and Kaesong, but  also in rural areas and, thus, provided more cultural living  conditions to the people.    Last year, the government of the republic further increased  social, cultural, and housing expenses to further develop all  fields of socialist cultural construction. Last year, the state  further increased scientific and technological development work  expenses 7 percent over the previous year. Our scientists and  technicians fully demonstrated their creative ability and wisdom  with infinite loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] and  outstandingly solved various valuable scientific and  technological problems arising in making the national economy  chuche-oriented, modernized, and scientific. Thus, they actively  contributed to the country's scientific and technological  development.    Last year, the government of the republic raised  expenditures  for educational work 3.5 percent over the previous year and  built anew some additional 20 colleges, including engineering  colleges, agricultural colleges, and physical culture colleges,  in provinces. It also built some 1,000 classrooms in various  schools and provided schools with modern educational equipment  and facilities. Thus, it has provided a firmer foundation for  education for the next generations and for the training of  national cadres.    Last year, the government of the republic also raised  expenditures for cultural work, public health work, and sports  work in an effort to smoothly guarantee the development of  literary and arts, public health, and sports.    Last year, not only the (Namdaebong) secret camp and the  (Pukdaebong) secret camp--which were founded by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song during his anti-Japanese armed struggle in  the area of central Korea as strong points for his local  leadership--were rebuilt as they were, but also various  historical battlefields of the revolution and historical sites  of the revolution which will glorify the immortal revolutionary  achievements of the party and the leader forever were more  outstandingly rebuilt as strongpoints for the indoctrination in  the revolutionary traditions.    At the same time, last year, thanks to the policy of  correctly inheriting and developing national cultural relics  elucidated by the great leader and thanks to the wise leadership  of our party, the royal tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder king  of Koguryo, which was a powerful big country in the Orient, and  the royal tomb of King Wanggon, the founder king of Koryo, were  outstandingly rebuilt. With the unearthing of Tangun's tomb we  could discover again the founder king of our nation and the  5,000 year history of our nation, and the work of rebuilding the  tomb was vigorously carried out, thus, making the hearts of all  fellow countrymen filled with national dignity and honor.    Thanks to the measures taken by our party--which  ceaselessly gives unsparing love and concern to bring our  children up well culturally and emotionally, and promote their  health--the Songdokwon International Children's Union Members  Camp has sprang up magnificently. The first stage of  construction for the Hamhung Municipal Children's Union Members  Camp has been finished, enabling it to open to the republic. In  addition, thanks to young compatriots' patriot devotion, the  splendid Aeguk Preventives Manufacturing Plant has been newly  built, greatly contributing to implementing the party's lines of  preventive medicine.    Last year, the state offered additional benefits to our  people by increasing various popular [word indistinct] to  promote the people's welfare.    Not long ago, our people observed the 20th anniversary of  the  proclamation of the historic law on totally abolishing the tax  system. Without collecting a penny for taxes, our country last  year supplied food to workers and office employees almost free  of charge at state expense, and implemented the systems of  overall free education and free comprehensive medical care. In  addition, our country provided well-furnished houses to workers,  office employees, and peasants, and electricity, service water,  and even fuel were supplied free of charge. In this way, the  state last year envisaged a great amount of funds worth billions  of won to implement these policies alone.    Amid the rapidly changing situation and difficulties during  the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, Our party and the  government of the republic invariably carried out all sorts of  popular communist policies for the people without trimming a  penny from the state's huge financial expenditure even under a  difficult condition in which many things had to diverted  economically to the defense due to stern situation prevailing on  the Korean peninsula.    During the same period, our party and the government of the  republic drastically raised the wages [saenghwalbi] of all  workers, technicians, and office employees to 43.4 percent on  the average, and sharply increased social security funds for  welfare recipients [sahoebojangja] and scholarships to students  in each school. Our party and the government of the republic  implemented the epoch-making policy to increase the income of  peasants of cooperative farms by increasing the purchase price  of paddy rice, maize, and other agricultural products.    Our country, in which the most powerful socialist  self-reliant economy has been established as a result of the  brilliant embodiment of the great chuche idea, grants the most  advanced social, cultural policies and popular policies. Thus,  all of our people are firmly guaranteed with a stable life and  fully enjoy a self-reliant political life and a happy material  and cultural life.    These clearly show the superiority of popular-mass centered  socialism of our own style, which cannot be compared with  others, in which the party and the state not only practically  ensure the people's political rights and freedom, but also do  everything for the people's welfare and assume total  responsibility for their life.    Last year, the government of the republic earmarked 12.5  percent of the total state budgetary expenditures for defense  spending to thoroughly implement our party's military line of  self-defense and to firmly defend the socialist fatherland's  security and the gains of the revolution.    Today, our military might has been further solidified  enough for us to be able to beat the enemy's any provocation and  surprise invasion. Our one-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary  forces are dependably defending the country's defense line with  high vigilance.    The state budget last year smoothly met with the financial  needs for the enormous tasks to accelerate socialist economic  construction and cultural construction, to enhance the people's  living standard, and to firmly solidify the country's defense  capability, thus actively contributing to strengthening the  country's might and defending, adhering to, and further adding  luster to our style socialism.    The proud summation of the execution of the state budget  last  year clearly demonstrates the justness of our party's financial  policy, our state budget's people-oriented nature which embodies  the popular masses' independent demands and aspirations and  serves the people's welfare thoroughly, and the solidity and  superiority of the socialist finance of our country.    All the successes we attained last year in socialist  construction and in the execution of state budget is a noble  fruition of the revolutionary guideline for socialist economic  construction and the direction of the socialist finance  elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and of the  struggle of all the people exerting boundless devotion and  spirit of sacrifice under the leadership of our party with  wholehearted unity around the party. [applause]    Comrade deputies: Today we have a rewarding task to attain  new greater success in socialist construction by thoroughly  implementing the strategic guideline of economic construction  which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth in the 21st  plenary meeting of the Sixth WPK Central Committee.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In  socialist economic construction, we will set aside a period of  adjustment for three years from now as decided by the 21st  plenary meeting of the sixth party Central Committee. During  this period, we must thoroughly implement the agriculture-first,  light industry-first, and trade-first policies. At the same  time, we should give definite priority to coal mining industry,  power industry, and railway transport--the leading sectors of  the people's economy--and continuously develop the metal  industry.    The revolutionary economic strategy put forth by our party  is  to thoroughly implement, during the period of adjustment, the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first  policies and to give priority to the coal mining industry, power  industry, and railway transport--the leading sectors of the  people's economy--and continuously develop metal the industry.    The party's revolutionary economic strategy is a  revolutionary guideline for economic construction to solidify  the country's self-reliant economic base as firm as a rock in  conformity with the demand of the new stage of development of  our country's socialist construction, to drastically improve the  people's living standard, and to firmly solidify the springboard  to bring forth a new leap forward in all fronts of socialist  construction.    The 1994 state budget has been compiled in order to  implement  the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first  policies according to the revolutionary economic strategy put  forth by our party, to concentrate the country's financial  resources on giving priority to the leading sectors of the  people's economy, and to further strengthen the might of our  country's socialist self-reliant economy.    The total revenue and expenditure of the state budget for  1994 amount to 41.52519 billio won each, up 2.4 percent in  revenue and 3.2 percent in expenditure from last year.    The state budget for this year will firmly achieve an  increase of the budgetary revenue based on the creative zeal of  our people, who are accelerating the general onward march of  socialism, and the great potential of our country's socialist,  self-reliant national economy.    It is an invariable policy of our party and the Republic  government to make the state budget put great emphasis on  expenditure for the national economy in order to enhance the  national economic strength and to improve the people's living  standard.    The government of the republic will increase expenditure for  the national economy by 3.2 percent from last year, and a huge  state fund will be appropriated for developing agriculture,  light industry, and trade with foreign countries.    In order to consolidate and develop the achieved result in  the course of the struggle to implement the socialist rural  theses, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  historic letter to the national agricultural meeting, the state  will drastically [hoekkijoguro] increase investment in the  agricultural sector by 6 percent from last year and will  continue to accelerate the socialist rural construction.    The government of the republic will consolidate the result  that has been achieved basically in the technological revolution  in our country's rural areas and let it demonstrate its might.  In particular, the government will concentrate its effort to  expand and develop the result of mechanization and scientization  under the condition that irrigation and electrification has been  completed at a high level.    Our party has recently sent 500 tractors 250 automobiles,  all  at the same time, to rural areas in Chongdan, Yanan, and Taechon  counties to elevate the level of general mechanization of rural  economy and to accelerate the industrialization and  modernization of agriculture.    According to the party policy, the state will send more  tractors, automobiles, and various modern farming machines to  rural areas by normalizing the production by farming machinery  plants at a high level. The state will also concentrate efforts  to increase the fertilizer production by chemical fertilizer  plants and will supply well-assorted chemical fertilizer to  rural areas more than before.    All agricultural working people and supporters will make all  valuable results achieved in the course of implementing the  technological revolution in rural areas take effect, upholding  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter to the  national agricultural meeting and upholding the banner of the  socialist rural theses. They will also carry out all farming  work tenaciously and methodically in a scientific and  technological way while thoroughly implementing the chuche  farming method. By doing so, they will make another great  upsurge in grain production and all other areas of agricultural  production.    This year, the government of the republic will increase  investment in light industry by 5.4 percent from last year and  will vigorously accelerate the light industrial revolution.    The state will also concentrate its efforts to actively  modernize facilities and processing lines of existing central  light industrial plants and local industrial plants, to expand  and develop branch plants, workshops, and work teams that  produce 3 August people's consumer goods, to increase the  production by synthetic fiber and synthetic resin chemical  plants, and to supply various light industrial materials.    With a high sense of loyalty toward the party and the  leader [suryong], all workers in light industry this year will  highly display their positive creativity to operate the light  industrial plants at full capability, normalize production on a  high level, and greatly increase the production of textile goods  of various sorts, daily necessities, and processed foodstuffs  and decisively improve their qualities. In this way, we will  make decisive turns in the production of people's consumer goods.    The state budget for this year foresees massive expenditures  for increasing exports to thoroughly implement the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song's instruction on developing foreign trade to  comply with the changed environment and our party's policy  toward that end.    The government of the republic will increase the state  investments for expanding and strengthening the existing  production bases 4.2 percent this year compared to last year,  establish more plants, shops, and work teams for producing  export goods and further strengthen their technological basis in  production, and build more bases for processing trade [kagong  muyok kiji].    All sectors of the people's economy and all regions will  thoroughly implement our party's trade policy, find more sources  for exports, positively advance into foreign markets, thoroughly  maintain their credit [sinyongul cholchohui chikigo], and  vigorously carry out trade-related activities. In this way,  they will make new progress in foreign trade.    Giving top priority to the coal industry, the power  industry,  and railway transportation, and developing the metallurgical  industry is an important task to implement the plan on the  agriculture-, light industry-, and foreign trade-first principle  and vigorously accelerate the country's overall economic  construction.    The state budget for this year foresees an increase of 3  percent in investments in the coal industry, the power industry,  and railway transportation compared to last year. The  government of the republic will accelerate drilling and the  construction of pits in all coal mines and exert efforts to  build more [word indistinct] and coal pits and modernize coal  mining equipment. In the power industry, it will accelerate the  construction of large-scale hydraulic power stations and thermal  power stations and build many small and medium-size power  stations everywhere, thus strongly consolidating the country's  resource and power bases.    Also, in the railway transportation sector, the government  of  the republic will improve railway systems strong enough for  heavy-duty trains [choldo chungnyanghwa] in the  Pyongyang-Chongjin railway line and other major railway lines,  electrify more and more railway lines, and accelerate the  modernization of means of transportation, thus further  increasing the railway system's transportation capability.    This year, the state will increase its investment in the  metallurgical industry 2.6 percent compared to last year, better  repair and maintain facilities in metallurgical plants,  positively realize the chuche-orientation of the metallurgical  industry, and, thus, further strengthen the production basis of  steel products.    According to our party's [word indistinct] economic  strategy,  we will score new gains in important fronts of economic  construction; have all people in a few years [kakkaun yongange]  fulfill our people's earnest desire to eat rice and meat soup,  wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house in a few  years; and further consolidate the self-reliant basis for the  economy of popular masses-centered socialism of our own style  like a rock.    Accelerating the cultural revolution and making socialist  culture bloom and develop is an important task to highly display  the superiority of socialism of our own style and complete the  socialist cause.    This year the government of the republic will increase  expenditure for practicing its socialist cultural policy by 2.8  percent compared to last year to further develop all areas of  our socialist cultural construction.    The state will increase expenditure for (?science  activities)  by 4 percent and education by 2 percent compared to last year so  as to arrange better conditions for educational organizations  intensifying scientific research and improving the quality of  education in conformity with the demand of developing realities.    At the same time, the state will also increase expenditure  for culture, public health, and sports to advance the socialist  national culture and art, to strengthen medical service for the  people, and to implement the policy of popularizing sports so  that working people's health can improve.    The government of the republic will increase expenditure for  its people-oriented policy this year so that various state  benefits, such as free education, free medical care, the  nurturing and indoctrination of children at state expense,  socialist insurance, and socialist security, can be well granted  to the people.    The government of the republic has provided a huge amount of  educational aid and stipends every year for the development of  democratic, national education for Korean children in Japan.    This year, too, the government of the republic will send a  huge amount of educational aid and stipends to Korean children  in Japan. This great, repeated benevolent care granted by our  party and state under the respected and beloved leader's  consideration will vigorously encourage the democratic national  education of the General Association of Koreans Residents in  Japan and will greatly encourage patriotic activities of Korean  compatriots in Japan who are devoting their all to achieving the  fatherland's independent and peaceful reunification.    The government of the republic envisages 11.6 percent of the  total state budgetary expenditure as defense appropriations this  year to firmly deepen the country's defense capabilities in  coping with the enemies' provocation maneuvers.    By thoroughly implementing the party's self-defensive  military line, we will iron-tightly harden the military strength  of the People's Army and the all-state- and all-people-oriented  party system. Also, by advancing the beautiful virtue of unity  between the Army and the people, we will firmly make every  preparation to cope with any unexpected situation on our own  initiative [chudongjoguro].    This year's state budget submitted to the Supreme People's  Assembly for deliberation is a chuche-based solid budget that  guarantees financial support for the huge tasks of economic  construction presented by the party, with our own financial  resources on the firm foundation of the self-reliant socialist  economy. It also a people-oriented, revolutionary budget that  will improve the people's material and cultural living  conditions, strengthen the country's might, and enhance the  superiority of socialism of our own style. [applause]    Comrade deputies:    Successfully executing this year's state budget is an  honorable task to add luster to the popular masses-oriented  socialism of our country by making a new change and a greater  victory in socialist construction.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: Upholding the  party's militant slogans, all functionaries, party members, and  working people should continue to innovate and advance in the  spirit of Chollima plus the nineties' speed, so that they can  make the new year 1994 a historic changeover in the revolution  and construction in our country.    In order to successfully execute this year's state budget  while implementing the party's revolutionary economic  strategies, all domains and units of the national economy should  vigorously carry out the struggle for increased production and  economization as a mass movement.    To vigorously carry out the struggle for the maximum  increased production and economy is an important principle to be  firmly adhered to in the whole course of socialist economic  construction. To do so is also an important task to demonstrate  the substantial superiority of our country's socialism and is a  sublime duty of all the working people who are masters of the  country and the society.    Intensifying the produce-more and save-more campaign is a  basic way to vigorously push ahead with economic construction  under the present situation. It is a decisive guarantee for  increasing the revenue sources in conformity with the socialist  state budget's people-oriented nature and for successfully  executing this year's budget. The functionaries and working  people of all the sectors and units of the people's economy  should place themselves into general mobilization, according to  our party's call, with high revolutionary self-awareness and  with an attitude befitting masters, and wage an all-people  struggle to produce and save to the maximum degree.    The functionaries and all the working people at plants and  enterprises of all sectors of the people's economy should exert  high creative wisdom and positive attitude, find all sorts of  production reserve and potential, operate all the facilities at  full capacity, and wage a vigorous struggle to increase  production to the maximum degree.    All sectors and units should wage an active struggle to save  as much as possible fuel, energy, and various kinds of raw  materials and facilities and to mobilize all sorts of reserves.  At the same time, they should highly exert such an attitude  befitting masters as producing more with available materials and  facilities and managing the state's economic life assiduously  and methodically.    The best wisdom in producing more and saving more at the  present time lies in vigorously conducting the technological  innovation campaign. All sectors of the people's economy should  have the scientists, technicians, and producing masses give full  play to their talents and creativity and wage a vigorous  campaign of mass technological innovation, thus developing new  technology and apply advanced technology actively to the  production.    To successfully execute this year's state budget, we should  properly implement the independent economic accounting system  [tongnip chaesanje] in conformity with the demand of the great  Taean work system, intensify the local budgetary system [chibang  yesanje], and further improve and intensify the financial  management work. To properly implement the independent economic  accounting system in conformity with the Taean work system is  our party's consistent policy. It is also an important  requisite to improving and intensifying managerial activities  and financial management.    The independent economic accounting system is a planned and  rational managerial and operational method of the socialist  state-run enterprises in which the plants and enterprises make  both ends meet and give benefit to the state while engaging in  managerial activities with relative managerial independence  under the state's central guidance. All the plants and  enterprises should work more scrupulously to properly implement  the independent economic accounting system in conformity with  the demand of the Taean work system in order to have the working  people give full play to their political self-awareness,  revolutionary enthusiasm, and collectivism. In so doing, they  should rationalize their production and managerial activities,  making both ends meet and increasing profit, so that they can  give greater profit to the state.    The local budgetary system which the great leader founded is  a new-type budgetary system of our-style socialism which makes  it possible to manage the overall economic life of both local  area and the state well by enhancing the local area's  responsibility and creativity while firmly ensuring the state's  central guidance. The local budgetary system has displayed  great vitality in the management of the state's economic life  over the last 20 years. Giving full play to the superiority of  the local budgetary system, all the local areas today are  increasing the local budget revenue every year and turning over  much funds to the state after smoothly appropriating the funds  necessary for the development of the local area's economy and  culture and for the local area's economic life.    The basic unit of the local budgetary system is county. In  order to develop the local budgetary system, we should  thoroughly implement our party's consistent policy to enhance  the function and role of the county--the base of the local  area's economic and cultural development. All counties should  make exceptional efforts to develop agriculture and local  industry in conformity with the party's policy and the county's  own special characteristic. At the same time, they should carry  out good work of earning foreign currency and actively conduct  service activities in order to earn more money, so that they can  keep their local area in better shape and further enhance the  people's standard of living.    Intensifying the system of daily summing up production and  finance put forth by our party is an urgent demand to improve  and reinforce financial management, as well as production  management, by having the producing masses give full play to  their revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity.    Plants and enterprises of all sectors of the people's  economy should more properly organize production and finance  management by further strengthening the summing system of  production and finance and by organizing and proceeding the  system in a normal and orderly manner.    In order to improve finance management and correctly execute  the national budget, the role of finance management  organizations should be enhanced. The finance management  organizations should thoroughly establish the principle of the  unitary management of the nation's finance and the principle of  planned agreement, utilize funds in a well-planned manner in  accordance with the national financial plan, strictly follow the  financial regulation, and strengthen financial control to make  sure no national funds are wasted.    Organizing economic organizational work and production  command and making a new turn in the business ethos of  functionaries are fundamental methods for thoroughly  implementing our party's economic strategy and executing our  national budget in a phased manner.    Functionaries should conduct economic operations for  implementing the economic strategies and policy presented by the  party and properly carry out planning work and material supply  work in conformity with the demands of new economic strategies,  and establish strongly disciplined regulations of economic works.    With a high spirit of revolution, all economic guidance  functionaries should work in a militant and revolutionary manner  filled with confidence and optimism, and volunteer to open a  breakthrough in difficult and tough works.    All functionaries should ceaselessly make themselves  revolutionary upholding the great leader's philosophy of taking  the people as heaven and our party's slogan of serving the  people, and should become true people's servants who always  involve themselves with the masses, share joy and sorrow with  them, and dedicate their all for the people.    To achieve brilliant victory in the combat of this year's  economic construction, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude should be highly displayed. Self-reliance is the  traditional revolutionary spirit of our party which has always  won in the long and arduous revolutionary struggles, the party's  revolutionary slogan which should be upheld more than ever in  today's situation, and a victorious banner which firmly  guarantees the result of this year's combat.    All functionaries and working people should vigorously  advance with the same struggle spirit, which effected the  Chollima upsurge amid postwar dust and dirts with the strong  spirit of self-reliance that filled the Paektu secret camp, so  that another revolutionary great upsurge may be effected in all  fores of this year's socialist construction.    Strengthening our revolutionary rank's single-minded unity  upholding our party's leadership is a decisive guarantee for the  victory of this year's advancement.    Our party is the heart of our single-heartedly united  society, the party's leadership is the lifeline of the socialist  cause. It is our people's unequaled desire and honor to carry  out the sacred revolutionary cause while following the great  leadership of the party.    All functionaries and working people should uphold our  party's leadership, be endlessly faithful to the party's cause,  and thoroughly implement our party's line and policy in all  domains and sectors.    We should defend the single-hearted unity of the party and  our revolutionary ranks as if we were the rulers, safeguard our  party with our lives, and achieve a new brilliant victory in  this year combat with the might of single-hearted unity.    Our people, who are following the leadership of the great  leader and the great party and vigorously fighting on with  revolutionary optimism and confidence, are ever-victorious and  indomitable. [applause]    Let us all firmly unite around the party central committee  headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song and  vigorously fight on for the victory of chuche revolutionary  cause and socialist cause.

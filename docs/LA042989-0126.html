			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POWER, THE NEWPORT BEACH ARTS COMMISSION, CENSORSHIP AND THE FULL NAKEDNESS OF  ADAM  </P> <P> I am writing with regard to the shabby and disrespectful treatment of Rosa  Williamson's artwork at the Newport Beach City Hall Gallery.  </P> <P> If people are offended by the subject matter of her paintings, the rational and  adult solution is simply not to look at them.  </P> <P> The arts commission, which invited Ms. Williamson to exhibit her work, has not  come to her defense, has not decried the abominably childish and scurrilous  behavior of the city employees in their willful and malicious defacing of Ms.  Williamson's property.  </P> <P> If, as Cathy Curtis wrote in her column of April 16, "shunning works as  innocent as nudes for any reason, at any age, is the mark of a provincial  mentality," then invasion of personal property is the mark of an uncivilized  mentality.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Art Commission owes Ms. Williamson an apology.  </P> <P> MARDELL BURRUS  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

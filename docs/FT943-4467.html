			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Astra raises US profile with OTC listing Astra, the fast-growing Swedish pharmaceutical group, yesterday moved to enhance its profile in the US by obtaining a listing on the over-the-counter market in New York. The company said American depository receipts matching its A and B shares already quoted in Stockholm and London began trading yesterday. Astra, which last week reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the first half to SKr4.5bn (Dollars 590m), claims a 17 per cent US market share for its most successful product, the anti-ulcer drug Losec. Losec is marketed in the US through a licence agreement with the US group Merck. Under the terms of a 1982 agreement, the two companies must decide whether to create a new joint venture by early next year.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Arbed sells holding in cement group Arbed, the Luxembourg steel manufacturer, is to sell its 50.05 per cent stake in Ciments Luxembourgeois to the German company Dyckerhoff. Arbed refused to reveal how much the German company, which currently owns 17.5 per cent of Ciments Luxembourgeois, had paid for the stake. But it said that Dyckerhoff would now be seeking to pursue a policy of 'modernisation and expansion' for the Luxembourg cement company. Arbed yesterday unveiled a total consolidated loss of LFr5.7 bn (Dollars 158.3m) for 1993, compared to a loss of LFr2.9bn in 1992. The group loss, excluding minorities, was LFr4.7bn, against LFr2.9bn the previous year.</p>

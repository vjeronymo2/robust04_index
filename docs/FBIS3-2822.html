			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Haizheng (3769 3189 1767) and Zhang </F> Sutang (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, member of the  Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress [NPC], arrived at the Sichuan auditorium of the Great  Hall of the People this morning to participate in the group  discussion of all members of the Sichuan delegation. He said:  Sichuan has many favorable conditions for accelerating  development; it has great potential. I hope the cadres of  Sichuan will make the best use of these favorable conditions,  avoid the effects of unfavorable conditions, and make serious  efforts to accelerate the province's economic development.    The morning plenary session of the Sichuan delegation was  presided over by Yang Xizong, chairman of the Sichuan Provincial  People's Congress Standing Committee. At the session, deputies  continued to enthusiastically deliberate the government work  report delivered by Premier Li Peng. Deputies Zhao Wenxin,  Huang Yongguang, Wang Hongju, Ma Kaiming, Li Shenkuan, and Yan  Shenggui delivered speeches, expressing their opinions on issues  concerning rural reform and development; policies concerning the  development of town and village enterprises in the central and  western regions; the Three Gorges Project; support for minority  areas and maintenance of stability in these areas; strengthening  of construction in the old revolutionary base areas; and  development of agriculture that stresses high yields, high  quality, and high efficiency.    After carefully listening to their speeches, Chairman Qiao  Shi voiced his opinions concerning Sichuan's development, a  question of interest to the deputies. He said: Sichuan is a  large province with a huge population. It has made important  contributions to national construction since the founding of New  China. The province has witnessed significant development in  the past few years. Compared with the past, Sichuan's growth  rate is still relatively fast. In the days to come, Sichuan  should make better use of its favorable conditions and bring the  enthusiasm of the masses into full play in order to accelerate  economic development.    Qiao Shi said: It is a very difficult task for Sichuan, a  large hinterland province with more than a 100 million people,  to catch up with the open coastal areas in the east within a few  years' time. However, Sichuan is very promising. It has a  strong industrial base, especial heavy industrial base. In the  past, when the state launched the Industrial Streamlining  Program in Sichuan, many railways, iron and steel factories, and  armament-producing enterprises were built here. Moreover, large  cities like Chongqing and Chengdu have their own relatively  sound foundation for development. It is quite promising to  accelerate development on such a basis. Of course, Sichuan has  many mountainous and hilly areas, but it has the Pingchuan  Plain, similar to the plain around Chengdu, where there is great  potential. With a rich labor force, Sichuan should make  vigorous efforts to develop economic crops in its hilly areas in  order to push forward its diversified undertakings and  comprehensive agricultural development.    Qiao Shi pointed out: Foreign investment is beginning to  move into inland areas and this is very beneficial to Sichuan.  Meanwhile, Sichuan has advantages in the areas of land and  material prices, and labor force. All these have formed a basic  investment environment attractive to foreign investors. Such an  environment will certainly attract more foreign capital.    Concerning the evacuation of residents in the Three Gorges  area, Qiao Shi said: The task of evacuating residents in the  Three Gorges area falls mainly on Sichuan. Resettling more than  700,000 people through explorative evacuation is a big job.  This process itself will offer a good opportunity for  accelerating development. It is necessary to be good at seizing  opportunities and transforming pressures into motive forces; it  is necessary to fulfill the task of evacuating the Three Gorges  residents and speed up the construction of new settlements for  the evacuated people, to thoroughly change the state of poverty  and backwardness.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng also participated in the  Sichuan delegation's discussion meeting today and spoke about  the issue of agricultural production.</p>

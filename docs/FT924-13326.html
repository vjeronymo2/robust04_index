			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Gore leads attack on foreign policy PRESIDENT George Bush's Democratic challengers are trying to turn the tables on some of his proudest achievements in the foreign policy arena. Senator Al Gore, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, has led the attack on Mr Bush's handling of Iraq, acknowledging his successful handling of the Gulf war but saying his earlier policies led directly to the war. This week, Mr Gore opened up a new line of attack on the nuclear missile cuts that President Bush agreed earlier this year with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. Mr Gore claimed the June pact, under which the US and Russia agreed to cut their nuclear arsenals beyond the levels agreed in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to 3,800-4,250 warheads apiece by 1999 and to eliminate multiple warhead missiles, had come unravelled because Mr Bush had taken Secretary of State James Baker away from the negotiations to supervise his re-election efforts. State Department officials denied the so-called Start II agreement had been hindered by Mr Baker's departure, but acknowledged that they had not yet succeeded in translating the Bush-Yeltsin agreement into a formal text. Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, said the discussions were largely technical. He knew nothing about reports that Russia was reluctant to destroy the silos holding multiple warhead SS-18 missiles, which are to be eliminated under the Bush-Yeltsin accord, he added. Mr Gore charged in his debate on Tuesday with Vice-president Dan Quayle and Admiral James Stockdale, Mr Ross Perot's vice-presidential running mate, that the Start I treaty would eliminate only half of the SS-18 silos, and that Mr Bush had made a mistake by not winning the elimination of the other half. Mr Quayle contended that Russia remained committed to the elimination of its SS-18s, but did not respond on the silos, which critics of Salt II contend could still be used to launch multiple warhead missiles if they are not destroyed. 'The President does have a commitment from Boris Yeltsin to eliminate the SS-18s; that is a commitment,' Mr Quayle said during the debate.</p>

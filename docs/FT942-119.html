			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Bonn sets out EU presidency agenda Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday set out a modest programme for the country's six-month presidency of the European Union, which begins tomorrow, insisting that it went no further than what was agreed by all other member states. 'We will do everything in our power to promote the cause of Europe in this limited period,' he told the German Bundestag in Bonn. But he added: 'The German image of Europe is identical with that of our partners.' Mr Kinkel's conciliatory comments came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, sought to draw a line under the row between London and its partners over the Commission presidency by suggesting that 'five or six' new names were now being discussed as an alternative to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene. All were 'broadly acceptable' to the UK, said Mr Hurd. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, took the same tack by stressing Britain's decision to veto the appointment of the Belgian prime minister did not foreshadow a decisive shift in Britain's commitment to the EU. Mr Clarke, in a speech that angered Tory Euro-sceptics, emphasised his personal support for the eventual goal of economic and monetary union and said the government was prepared to see a successor to Mr Jacques Delors committed to deepening as well as widening the European Union. Diplomats in Brussels are mentioning three names in particular for the presidency: Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, his Portuguese counterpart, and Mr Giulano Amato, the former prime minister of Italy. Meanwhile, in a further effort to ensure that Anglo-German relations do not suffer protracted damage as a result of the clash at Corfu, Mr Kinkel denied that there was any link between Germany's moves this week to ban British beef imports and Britain's veto of Mr Dehaene.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edvard Popovic: "NATO Wants to Set Up Bases in </F> Croatia"]    [Text] NATO is asking for Zadar airport, the plateau above  Slano (around Cepikuce), and for two islands (Vis and another  one) for its future bases -- this information has been leaked  from the state leadership and has been unofficially confirmed by  a high-ranking official of the Croatian Army Supreme  Headquarters. Official sources have so far not said whether this  is just an indication of NATO's growing presence within the  activity of the UN in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the  first step in taking Croatia, through the "Partnership for  Peace," into full membership in NATO. Only the growing presence  of NATO forces -- provided that elements of the Croat-Muslim  agreements are implemented -- could guarantee the  re-establishment of the disrupted balance, i.e., introduce a  lasting and more stable peace in these parts.    The choice of location is no accident. Belgrade headquarters  knows that very well, for many examinations for the rank of  general in the former Yugoslavia were based exactly on variants  of defending the hinterland of Zadar, the valley of the Neretva  River, and the Kupres valley from potential landing operations  and attacks by NATO forces.  <H5>  Strategic Routes </H5>   Zadar and its hinterland, Ravni Kotari, is the widest  gateway  to the Balkans. This is where a more serious marine-airborne  assault could take place, one including an army group (about  three divisions or 45,000 men) for further penetration toward  the Balkan interior (toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia). No  other part of the Adriatic coast, from Albania to Slovenia, is  so suitable for assaults by major forces, for their  consolidation and advance north- east. The potential assault  would be made easier as Zemunik [Zadar] Airport is nearby and  also as Croatian forces control a good part of the hinterland  and the saddle of Mali Alan. A radar installation positioned on  that saddle could knock out [Serb-held] Udbina Airport, thus  establishing total control -- both on land and in the air -- of  forces moving toward the heart of the Balkans, whose keys are  held by those who control Kupres and the Kupres gateway, the  main operational route for the Balkans -- the Serbs, in the  present case. Establishing a bridgehead in Ravni Kotari and  total control of the area would open the road to Kupres.    Another important Adriatic route toward the gateway to the  Balkans is the Neretva valley. In comparison with the Zadar  route, it is definitely a less suitable variant for penetrating  into the Balkans, but only if the forces controlling the banks  of the Neretva are hostile to those penetrating into the  territory. That is not the case this time: The banks of the  Neretva are controlled by the Croats and the Muslims.  Consequently, it would not be very difficult for NATO to send a  major fleet along the Neretva River from Ploce all the way to  Capljina. The plateau above Slano, in the area of Cepikuce,  which was liberated by the Croatian Army in a large-scale  operation, is actually a lookout from which eastern Herzegovina  is controlled and it is an ideal starting point for all actions  toward Trebinje, Bileca and deeper into Bosnia-Herzegovina  territory toward the Drina valley.  <H5>  The Mosaic of Outcomes </H5>   If Vis should become a NATO base, it would keep the role it  played in the defense doctrine of former Yugoslavia; it would be  an vital logistic base, an unsinkable warehouse of military  supplies for land forces.    Such an outcome of the crisis in these parts, a replaying of  the Yalta agreement moving the border of U.S. interests east of  Trieste to the banks of the Bosna River or the Drina, is  becoming increasingly certain. It is with this in mind that one  must view the pronounced interest of Washington in the  Croat-Muslim conciliation and the presence of U.S. soldiers in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  (the Vardar valley is still an extremely important operational  route for penetration into the Balkans). The statement of  General John Shalikashvili, who said that interests in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are important enough to send 25,000 U.S.  soldiers, sheds more light on U.S. interests. At any rate,  Washington's message is that the Bosnia-Herzegovina fire must be  extinguished in order to prevent it from spreading to Albania,  Macedonia, and Greece, for, in that variant of the outcome of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem, "some other forces" might come  into conflict as well. If we also consider the statement of the  UN secretary general, who said that, after Russia and the United  States came into the Balkan pot, the international Conference on  Former Yugoslavia has become superfluous -- the mosaic of  outcomes of the crisis will definitely appear in its more  integral version. In any case, the UN has been unable to find a  good model for peace in the Balkans. That organization -- in  the Yugoslav crisis and in the war there -- has shown too many  weaknesses, and if it really intends to be a moving force of the  new world order, it must undergo thorough repairs. At any rate,  it was announced that the UN would be completely reconstructed  by the end of 1995. In these circumstances, a new world order  means nothing else than realizing old global deals without (for  the time being) large-scale military conflicts.   <H5>    Croatian Gains </H5>   The potential Croatian gains in the new circumstances --  that  is, at a time of a more engaged presence of the United States  and Russia in the Balkans and in the negotiations between Zagreb  and Sarajevo -- have lately been discussed by general Anton Tus  in his interview for VECERNJI LIST. The biggest gain is, of  course, Washington's determination, in agreement with Moscow, to  extinguish the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and stop the conflict  between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Linking the airspace of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is here  very important for Croatia. "In military and defense terms,  this joint area is extremely important for Croatia. There would  be no critical intersecting points and there would be fewer  unsafe borders. It would be much better to have a friendly  neighbor without having to expect a strategic surprise from the  territory. We would also gain with regard to strategic depth of  the territory; consequently, Dalmatia and Slavonia would not  have to fear a flank attack. Geopolitically and  geostrategically speaking, the situation would be much better  and balanced."    We still do not know the solution to the problem of the  trans- continental main road stretching from the port of Ploce  to the Neretva valley and the Bosna River, through Vinkovci and  Vukovar, the Danube valley toward Budapest, Vienna, Slovakia,  the Czech Republic, and further west on the Danube-Rhine-Danube  canal. It is the shortest traffic route leading from the  southern Adriatic to Central Europe and its geopolitical and  geostrategic importance surpasses local interests. At present,  the main road is cut in several places in Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it is therefore important that the two  countries, Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina, establish complete  control over it.  <H5>  The Legendary 50-50 </H5>   Washington's fear that the war will spread to Macedonia,  Albania, and Greece indicates the extreme importance of the  events in Bosnia- Herzegovina for the stability of southeastern  Europe. In that context, let us remember a Croatian initiative  made at the CSCE, viz. the initiative for disarmament and arms  control in countries created on the territory of former  Yugoslavia, which was, in the future, to improve the stability  of that territory and south-east Europe in general. According  to our information, Croatia has already agreed to a quota of  23,000 professional military forces. Judging by the military  activities of the Serbs in Bosnia- Herzegovina and Croatia, and  by the fresh supply of forces and equipment coming to  [Serb-occupied] Croatia from Serbia, Belgrade is still not  thinking about peace, security, or cooperation. The Serbian  announcement that they would yield to the Muslims 16 percent of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory that they have conquered, and  the announced arrival of the Knin team at the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb for negotiations are encouraging, though weak signals of  changing views (unless it is another case of a verbal trick).    By arranging the Croat-Muslim agreement, Washington has done  its part of the job, and now it is Moscow's turn to put some  pressure on the Serbs. With regard to that, it is encouraging  to hear the announcement of closer military cooperation between  Russia and NATO. Such cooperation is not possible without solid  arguments. NATO could strengthen its arguments by setting up  bases in Croatia. Anyhow, the U.S.-Russian deal could ultimately  mean the surfacing of the final solution for the crisis in these  parts and realizing the legendary 50-50 division and Russian  access to a warm sea. Let us hope it will be east of the Drina  route, not east of the valley of the Neretva and the Bosna.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Choosing a WTO leader Less than three weeks before the World Trade Organisation is due to come into being, deadlock appears to have developed over the choice of its leader. Governments' failure to agree on such a central question is doubly disturbing. Not only does it threaten to handicap the WTO's start in life; it augurs badly for decision-making in the longer term. The WTO has been set ambitious objectives. Realising them calls for skilful, clear-sighted, intellectually imaginative and determined leadership. Without firm direction from the outset, the organisation risks degenerating into an ineffective talking shop. Deadlock also raises questions about plans for the WTO to operate by consensus. That principle worked well in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, because the smaller members usually went along with the wishes of the US and Europe, in order to ensure the larger players' continued participation. But the compact is likely to become steadily less effective, as the economic preponderance of the older industrialised countries declines in favour of emerging economies, notably in Asia. The planned expansion of the WTO's membership  - above all the admission of China  - will test cohesion still further. This shifting balance makes it vital for the WTO head not only to be able to mediate between diverse and sometimes conflicting national and regional interests, but to articulate a clear intellectual vision around which members can cohere. It is healthy that the contest has attracted three candidates from countries at varying stages of economic development and located on different continents. It is regrettable, however, that their support remains sharply divided along regional lines. Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas has strong backing in North and South America, but almost nowhere else. Support for Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister, is heavily concentrated in Asia. On the face of it, Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister and the EU's official candidate, counts a wider following, which includes much of Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. However, this show of support is deceptive. It is drawn overwhelmingly from countries which already belong to the EU, plan to do so, or depend on its aid and trade largesse. If Mr Ruggiero's claims to lead the field are to be convincing, he needs to demonstrate that his support is based on objective assessments of his ability, not on self-interested allegiances centred on Brussels. The WTO contest should not be a crude trial of strength between economic blocs. That would be divisive and could undermine the post's authority. It is, in any case, absurd to suppose that any vital interest would be served by installing a candidate of a particular nationality. What is needed instead is to unite around a highly qualified candidate. If governments cannot agree soon on any of those now in the race, they may need to consider a fresh approach, rather than settle on an unsatisfactory interim arrangement. One answer would be to entrust the choice to a selection committee composed of a representative sample of Gatt members. That might prove the best way to settle on an appointee possessing the qualities, and enjoying the confidence, needed to do the job well.</p>

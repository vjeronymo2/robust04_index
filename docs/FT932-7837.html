			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: UK shipbuilding policy riddled with anomaly Sir, Your editorial ('Swan song', May 17) arguing that the downfall of Swan Hunter was inevitable is flawed. Despite assertions to the contrary, the argument that there is too much shipbuilding capacity in the UK does not stand scrutiny. A reasonable level of success in export markets, together with the Ministry of Defence's plans to procure further logistics and assault vessels as well as Type 23 frigates, suggests that the market will provide enough work for all the warship yards. Indeed, some observers fear that government procurement strategy may be creating a potential capacity shortage, especially of design and technical skills, later in the decade. The government should take account of this possibility in its dealings with the sector. Your editorial also ignores both the fact that Swan Hunter has a record of producing merchant ships and that most predictions are for this market to grow in the 1990s, largely because of the ageing of the world fleet. Swan Hunter is the only UK yard that has a record of producing both merchant vessels and the full range of military vessels in its own right. As a monopsonist in the naval sector, the government should have made this a factor in its decision to order the helicopter carrier. More importantly, it should make this a consideration in the vital effort to save shipbuilding on the Tyne. The position of the government is riddled with anomaly and inconsistency. It allowed a consortium that included Kvaerner, a merchant yard whose contracts have been supported with intervention funding, to compete with Swan Hunter, whose diversification efforts were hindered by the government's refusal to support an application for intervention funding for the yard. As a consequence Swan Hunter's very future depended on winning naval orders. Good luck to Kvaerner, but where is the logic in all of this? Finally, your implication that because UK yards struggled to maintain market share in the past, the UK should withdraw from shipbuilding, seems neatly to encapsulate the reasoning that has underpinned the manufacturing decline that is at the heart of the UK's economic problem.

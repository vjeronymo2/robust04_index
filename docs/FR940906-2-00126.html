It is the central point of contact for all news media at the scene of the incident. Public information officials from all participating Federal agencies should collocate at the JIC. Public information officials from participating State and local agencies also may collocate at the JIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Joint Operations Center (JOC) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Established by the LFA under the operational control of the OSC, as the focal point for management and direction of onsite activities, coordination/establishment of State requirements/priorities, and coordination of the overall Federal response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Joint U.S. Government/Foreign Government Space Venture <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Any space venture conducted jointly by the U.S. Government (DOD or NASA) with a foreign government or foreign governmental entity that is characterized by an ongoing U.S. Government interest in the successful completion of the mission, active involvement in mission operations, and uses radioactive sources and/or classified components, regardless of which country owns or provides said sources or components, within the space vehicle. For the purposes of this plan, in a situation whereby the U.S. Government simply sells or supplies radioactive material to a foreign country for use in a space vehicle and otherwise has no active mission involvement, it shall not be considered a joint venture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Lead Federal Agency (LFA) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _The agency which is responsible for leading and coordinating all aspects of the Federal response is referred to as the LFA and is determined by the type of emergency. In situations where a Federal agency owns, authorizes, regulates, or is otherwise deemed responsible for the facility or radiological activity causing the emergency and has authority to conduct and manage Federal actions onsite, that agency normally will be the LFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> License <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _An authorization issued to a facility owner or operator by the NRC pursuant to the conditions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended), or issued by an Agreement State pursuant to appropriate State laws.

Establishment of a National Defense Area temporarily places such non-Federal lands under the effective control of the Department of Defense and results only from an emergency event. The senior DOD representative at the scene shall define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier, and post warning signs. The landowner's consent and cooperation shall be obtained whenever possible; however, military necessity shall dictate the final location, shape, and size of the NDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> National Security Area (NSA) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _An area established on non-Federal lands located within the United States, its possessions or territories, for safeguarding classified information, and/or restricted data or equipment and material belonging to DOE or NASA.

The senior DOE or NASA representative having custody of the material at the scene shall define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier, and post warning signs. The landowner's consent and cooperation shall be obtained whenever possible; however, operational necessity shall dictate the final location, shape, and size of the NSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Nuclear Facilities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Nuclear installations that use or produce radioactive materials in their normal operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Offsite <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _The area outside the boundary of the onsite area. For emergencies occurring at fixed nuclear facilities, ``offsite'' generally refers to the area beyond the facility boundary. For emergencies that do not occur at fixed nuclear facilities and for which no physical boundary exists, the circumstances of the emergency will dictate the boundary of the offsite area. Unless a Federal agency has the authority to define and control a restricted area, the State or local government will define an area as ``onsite'' at the time of the emergency, based on required response activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Offsite Federal Support <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Federal assistance in mitigating the offsite consequences of an emergency and protecting the public health and safety, including assistance with determining and implementing public protective action measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Onscene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _The area directly affected by radiological contamination and environs.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roman Kalisky: "Miklos Duray and Bela Bugar </F> Keep Writing...."]    [Text] The TA SR has published as a document a letter from  the Coexistence Movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic  Movement [MKDH] to the Council of Europe [CE], dated 19 January  1994, signed by the gentlemen named in the headline. The letter  consists of five points, and its authors address the letter's  addressees as "Esteemed Mr., Esteemed Mrs.," from which it is  easy to infer that each gentleman and each lady of this  respected institution will find his own copy on his or her desk.  If only our respected Ministry of Foreign Affairs acted as  promptly!    "Representatives of the Slovak Republic (who is meant by  that?--R.K.) and the Slovak Parliament pledged to develop and  implement their policy vis-a-vis minorities in accordance with  CE Recommendation Number 1,201," the signatories of the letter  state, and deplore that this has not happened.    Messrs. Duray and Bugar announce with "deep regret" that in  December 1993 the Slovak Parliament "approved Resolution Number  309, thereby abolishing its Resolution Number 225 of June 1993,  in which it pledged to proceed in its policy toward the  minorities from the principles of CE Recommendation Number  1,201."    Thanks be to God that this happened because, as each citizen  of the Slovak Republic who is at least a bit conversant with the  matter knows, the notorious Recommendation Number 1,201 was only  a working draft that has meanwhile been "withdrawn from  circulation."    The letter from Coexistence and the MKDH rejects the  National  Council of the Slovak Republic law on the use of Christian names  and surnames, which supposedly "orders the declension of female  surnames according to the Slovak grammar," protests against the  division of the "compact Hungarian community in southern  Slovakia" according to the territorial and administrative setup  now under preparation, demands that "Hungarian towns be given  their historical names" (that is, names Magyarized by force in  the years of the most brutal oppression of Slovaks--R.K.), and  protests against the possibility of "alternative education" at  schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction "at the  order of a few parents" (!). On the other hand, the letter  observes that "90 percent of Hungarians speak fluent Slovak,"  which raises the question why and through whose endeavor we come  across the words "nem irtem," [Hungarian for "I do not  understand"), spoken with a smile on the face, daily in shops  and other institutions in southern Slovakia.    The authors of the letter refer to the Komarno protest of 8  January 1994, which, along with the five points raised,  supposedly testifies to the unacceptability of Slovak Government  policy "for the minorities (Messrs. Duray and Bugar suddenly  speak in the name of all minorities?--R.K.), which consider this  to be a restriction of their right to self-determination."    This single sentence reveals it all! The right to  self-determination, which is a collective right, belongs to  nations and not to ethnic minorities--that is, not even to the  one, about which the writers of the letter to the CE are  concerned. They, too, know this very well. Still, they keep  writing.... Let them write. It seems that Europe, including  its Council, has at long last begun to see who seeks coexistence  and who is after confrontation and destabilization in Central  Europe.</p>

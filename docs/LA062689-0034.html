			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCKY FLATS  </P> <P> I am writing in regards to articles in The Times (Part I, June 10) concerning  events in China and the FBI probe of the Rocky Flats facilities.  </P> <P> In both cases governments evidence a callous disregard for the rights and  welfare of the citizenry. In response to the repression in China there is  widespread outrage and protest. In regards to Rocky Flats nothing comparable  has occurred, although thousands of people in the Denver area have been exposed  to toxic pollutants illegally released from the plant and, likewise, because  officials believe that they know best the priorities for this nation.  </P> <P> DENISE S.

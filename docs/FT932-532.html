			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (10): Strong interest in new products - Mark Payne on the car of the future NEWSPAPER and magazine features on 'the car of the future' usually outline futuristic technology applications. While there is a host of futuristic technologies which will one day be used in mass car production, there also already new product areas on the threshold of a global 'take-off.' Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have been with us for some time, although a period of unprecedented growth in new applications for these systems is under way. According to figures from the Varity Corporation's Kelsey Hayes group in Livonia, Michigan, the global ABS market will treble in size for the period 1992-97, growing from an estimated 8.2m units to a projected 24.1m units by 1997. North American installation rates will rise to 77 per cent by 1997, compared with 30 per cent in 1992. For western Europe, the comparable figures are 58 per cent and 22 per cent; in Japan, they rise from a slender 9 per cent in 1992 to 33 per cent by 1997. The reasons for these surging sales are enhanced vehicle safety and declining real unit costs as volumes increase. Airbags are another safety-related product area which is set to become one of the biggest growth markets in the 1990s. Airbags, designed to inflate in milli-seconds in the event of a vehicle crash and to cushion the driver - and increasingly, passengers, too - from chest and head injuries, are rapidly making their appearance in quite modest vehicles. In north America, legislation on airbag fitment provides further market impetus. TRW Repa of Alfdorfin Germany has market projections which suggest that the level of airbag system sales at the original equipment level in north America, Asia and Europe will amount to 20m units in 1993. By 1998, the company expects this total to treble to 60m units. Among this year's sales, 12m units are expected to be driver-side airbags, and perhaps 8m passenger-side airbags. By 1998, the total driver-side airbag market is forecast to grow to 33m units, and the passenger-side market to 26m units. Multivalve technology is a third sector which offers considerable growth prospects for suppliers. The design and development of passenger car and light truck engines which feature more than the standard two valves per cylinder is expanding quickly. Although several numbers of valves can be employed, the norm for the future is becoming the four-valves per cylinder engine, in view of the various technical advantages conferred by this configuration. There are big benefits in multi-valve technology: not only can engine power output be boosted for a given cylinder capacity, but this factor alone relaxes the previously- accepted rules of engine physical size/capacity/weight/power output relationships. Quite simply, a smaller engine - with all the attendant cost and design/styling flexibility which that allows - can be used to obtain greater power output than would otherwise be the case with traditional valve configurations. The converse of this is that an engine of the same physical size with four valves per cylinder can be used in the manufacture of a far more powerful vehicle than would otherwise be the case. Another benefit of multivalve technology is the potential offered both for emissions reduction and fuel economy. Projections by TRW Valves in Wednesbury, West Midlands, illustrate the growth potential of the multivalve sector: in 1992, average engine penetration in the passenger car and light truck sector was over 13 per cent in western Europe. By 1998 the company expects the level to rise to more - than 30 per cent of such engines fitted in West European output. In numerical terms, TRW Valves expects the number of engines featuring multivalve technology to grow by around 180 per cent, to over 5m units by 1998 compared with 2m in 1992. Projected levels for the UK are far higher than the west European average, at 35 per cent in 1992 and over 70 per cent projected for 1998. Electronic control systems for diesel engines: these developments are being spurred by issues such as emissions control and fuel economy. Lucas Automotive, which has developed its EPIC fuel-injection system for passenger cars, is forecasting that, by the year 2000, all diesel-engined cars built-in western Europe will have some form of electronic control. According to Lucas Diesel Systems, in order for such engines to meet the 1999 European emissions regulations, even small cars will have to feature electronically-controlled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to achieve compliance. Lucas predicts that diesel penetration amongst the west European cars and light vans will rise from 26 per cent today to 33 per cent by the year 2,000; worldwide penetration will increase from 18 to 22 per cent. Legions of other forward-looking systems and component areas offer suppliers substantial market opportunities for the next few years - they include gas discharge lamps, multiplexing, electronic suspension or ride control, electronic tyre pressure inflation systems, traction and new control systems, automatic transmission control, limited-slip differentials, steer by wire systems, vehicle navigation systems, anti-collision radar and recyclable plastic parts.</p>

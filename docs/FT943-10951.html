			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: The sky's no limit for Mr Gooding - A look at GCE's latest satellite TV equipment venture 'The City thinks anyone going into brown goods is bonkers,' said Mr Alfred Gooding. 'But we in Europe have to compete with the Far East and America, and with modern techniques and investment, I believe it is possible to do so.' Mr Gooding, a Welsh entrepreneur in his early 60s, was speaking of Gooding Consumer Electronics, a private company formed 14 months ago by himself and Mr Koen van Driel, a Dutch businessman. Based in south Wales, GCE is seeking to reverse the trend of recent years by becoming a leading British group in the sector. Last December, GCE paid FFr160m (Pounds 18.5m) to take over a French television factory owned by Grundig, the German consumer electronics manufacturer. In March, it set up an Pounds 8m joint venture with Grundig to make satellite television receivers in Wales. In its latest move to create an integrated operation, it was announced yesterday that GCE had again joined forces with Grundig to acquire GEC-Marconi's LNB Division, which makes a vital component for satellite reception. The division will be renamed Gooding Microwave Technology. Mr Gooding is gambling - with Pounds 18m of his own money - on his judgment that a UK-based consumer electronics business can be competitive with those in east Asia. Far fewer components, he said, were now needed to make electronic products. This had drastically cut assembly time and labour costs. In addition, European retailers buying from east Asia had the disadvantage of working to a long timescale from order to delivery. 'We are confident we can provide better quality service than competitors and alter designs far quicker to meet the demands of the market,' he said. The French television factory, which Grundig wanted to close to consolidate manufacture elsewhere, has the capacity to make more than 1m sets a year. GCE is designing low-cost small-screen models and the plant will start deliveries in November. As part of the acquisition, GCE purchased two brand names: Minerva from Grundig and Continental Edison from Thomson. Products will sell under these names on the Continent and under the Grundig label in the UK and Ireland. Grundig Satellite Communications, the joint venture with Grundig, is chaired by Mr Gooding with Mr van Driel as managing director. GCE owns 70 per cent and Grundig, which has two directors on the board, 30 per cent. While the venture itself is new, Mr Gooding and Mr van Driel have much experience of satellite television equipment. Mr Gooding is chairman of Race Electronics, the contract manufacturer which makes own-label receivers. Mr van Driel, an ex-managing director of Grundig UK, is a former commercial director of Societe Europeene des Satellites - owner and operator of the Astra satellite system. 'I recognised I didn't have the experience with European manufacture,' Mr Gooding said, 'and with his background he could set up a sales and marketing network to compete with the Far East.' 'We concentrated on the design and then started discussions with Grundig,' Mr van Driel said. 'Our proposition was that if we joined forces we could have a pragmatic approach with down-to-earth designs. For many large organisations that is not simple - there is a culture of being over-engineered. 'We could offer efficient production with our background of contract manufacture, experienced management and a very respected brand name in Grundig, which has a large resource of research and development expertise and a strong distribution network.' Production began in April at Llantrisant, in Mid Glamorgan - Mr Gooding is a strong advocate of the merits of a Welsh labour force. A Pounds 3m advertising campaign aims to challenge the market leaders, Amstrad and Pace, and, more indirectly, cable television. In the UK, the GSC range starts at Pounds 199. 'We believe the consumer will be less and less prepared to pay a hefty premium for a brand name,' Mr van Driel said. The target is to capture, within three years, between 25 and 30 per cent of the UK market of about 900,000 units. The company claims to have already reached half of that target. Over the three years, it expects to build up to an annual production of 1m units, with the Llantrisant workforce increasing from 200 to 600. About two thirds of this output is intended to be exported to continental Europe, India and east Asia, and the Americas. Mr Gooding's confidence is undiluted. 'We will have a turnover of Pounds 150m in 1995. There are no two ways about it.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Beijing Municipality Makes Six-Point Suggestions </F> on Completing, Perfecting Reform of Nongovernment-Run  State-Owned Enterprises"]    [Text] First, improve understanding of the necessity of  state ownership with private management. The reform of state  ownership with private management is a product of when small  state-run commercial enterprises change from the planned  economic system to the market economic system and is an  innovative choice for small enterprises to get themselves out of  a difficult position.    Second, strengthen guidance for the reform of state  ownership  with private management so as to standardize it. Judging from  practical results, we should lead, to the best of our ability,  staff and workers to choose the management form of leasing,  particularly individual leasing and partnership leasing.  Compared with the contract responsibility system for profits,  the leasing system conforms more to the requirements of the  socialist market economy and the rights and obligations of the  two parties to the lease are more clearly defined.    Third, thoroughly promote the method of inviting bids and  choosing leaseholders and enterprise managers.    Fourth, guarantee the independent decisionmaking rights of  the leasing enterprise and the contracting enterprise.    Fifth, improve the statistical methods of state-owned  privately run enterprises. Change the statistical system in  which enterprises report their management situations to higher  authorities to a method in which enterprises report their  management situations to taxation organs. Taxation authorities  together with individual associations make appraisals of the  same trade or industry and match them with verification by  taxation organs to confirm the reported figures, and  enterprises' management situations are summed up and reflected  on by the taxation authorities.    Sixth, party committees and governments at all levels should  create a fine macropolicy environment for the reform of public  ownership with private management.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Fine for Colgate-Palmolive Hungary intends to fine Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer and products group, Ft30m (Pounds 176,300) for what it considers 'misleading advertising' in a toothpaste TV commercial. The decision follows a complaint by Procter &amp; Gamble of the US, one of the company's main rivals, to the economic competition office in Budapest. The office said a commercial by Colgate-Palmolive which claims calcium helps prevent tooth decay had not been scientifically proved.</p>

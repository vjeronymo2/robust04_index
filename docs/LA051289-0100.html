			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> ROYAL COURT ROCKS OUT, RATTLES NOGGINS  </P> <P> Between its first and second albums, the Royal Court of China adopted a less  regal, more raucous sound -- though it's not surprising that the band's style  would change with a turnover of half its personnel. Did this shift mean that  the group's show Wednesday at the Roxy was a case of musical split personality  between the tuneful country-ish and folk touches from the first LP and the  crunching rock from the second?  </P> <P> A loud and aggressive no! These guys from Nashville are head-bangers now, pure  and simple. They were introduced by a deejay from a heavy-metal radio station,  and they stormed through an 11-song set of mostly current material with all the  noggin-rattling fervor a Pure Rock fan could hope for.  </P> <P> Indeed, in embracing the metal life, the quartet is likely to win such fans  (and maybe a few others) wherever it plays. From the get-go of the opening  number, "Mr. Indecision," the band unleashed a wildly spirited attack,  musically and visually. Singer-guitarist Joe Blanton has immensely powerful  pipes, but avoids that Siamese-cat screeching endemic to metal vocalists.  </P> <P> And just when you might have been thinking that this conversion to rollicking  rock is pretty convincing but could use a bit more humor, they encored with a  tune called "This Is the Shortest Song in the World," which consisted of those  eight words. Sung once. DUNCAN STRAUSS  </P></p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool DESPITE RELATIVELY slow buying interest from Japanese brokers, Australian wool sale reports indicate a generally firm and unchanged market in the second week of the new selling season. There was some disappointment when wool sold at virtually unchanged prices after the July recess, but no downturn followed. The Australian Wool Corporations market indicator, which closed at 545c/kg at the end of June, was down to 535c/kg on August 5, but this was only one cent down on the previous day. In the wool using industry some sectors are busy but others are more directly affected by recession and continue to find trade difficult.</p>

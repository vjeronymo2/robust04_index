			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reckitt off on buy talk Household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman slid on speculation that it was poised to buy Eastman Kodak's household products division for between Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 2bn. Reckitt ended the day down 7 at 614p as analysts wondered how the company would get hold of the necessary cash and decided that a tap on shareholders was the only way. However, Lehman Brothers argued that Reckitt was an unlikely candidate and that global rivals Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble were more plausible buyers. Ms Jo Walton, Lehman's pharmaceuticals analyst, said the company would be able to service additional debt of only Dollars 1.55bn. She said it was more likely that the company could buy some lines of Kodak's Stirling Winthrop arm that might provide a good fit. Meanwhile, Unilever, which reports second-quarter figures on Friday, strengthened 14 to 1081p. The Anglo-Dutch group is expected to announce profits of between Pounds 550m and Pounds 590m.</p>

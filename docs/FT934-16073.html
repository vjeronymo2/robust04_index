			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / DIY lobbying mailbags MPs: How the sub-postmasters got their message across at Westminster THE ART of political lobbying has developed strongly in recent years. For one, there is much more of it: one Labour MP recently put annual growth in the specialist lobbying sector at between 20 and 25 per cent. Moreover, techniques are increasingly sophisticated, but one of the best ways to get results - especially when the government has an inadequate majority - is still through filling MPs' mailbags. By this yardstick, the most successful campaign of the last parliamentary session was masterminded, a little improbably, by the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. The federation's aim was to derail plans to save money by 'pressurising' people into having pensions and benefits paid direct into a bank or building society accounts instead of collecting them at a post office. The sub-postmasters feared this would hit the post office network hard. Mr Colin Baker, the federation's general secretary, said the sub-postmasters had 'a number of offers' from specialist lobbyists but 'declined them all'. The extraordinary public response the campaign generated suggests this was the right decision. The federation was persuaded that a campaign was necessary when in early March the government circulated to new pensioners three batches of trial forms inviting them to decide how they wanted to be paid. One variant did not mention post-office payment as an option; another referred to it only cursorily. Mr Baker regarded this as 'withholding information'. After letters to ministers failed to elicit a satisfactory explanation, the federation took matters into its own hands by publicising the position on local radio and drafting leaflets for all 23,000 post office branches. A total of 6m went out, under the heading 'Beware] Your post office is under threat', urging customers to write to their MPs. It was left to individual sub-postmasters to decide whether to hand out the leaflets in branches or deliver them with the morning post. The approach was simple but the effect was the talk of Westminster for some weeks. It was not unusual to hear MPs, huddled in corridors and bars as they wearily awaited the next Maastricht vote, comparing the size of their post office mailbags. Mr Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party said: 'After 22 years' membership of the House, I have some experience of large postbags. But no constituency issue has ever brought a bigger one than this issue.' Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat victor in the Newbury by-election, used his maiden speech in the Commons to say he was 'struck' by how often the subject was raised on the doorstep. He said: 'If the secretary of state has done anything for post offices lately, it is perhaps that many extra stamps have been sold to pensioners who have written to their members of parliament on this subject.' Mr Baker suspects that the form of the letters was important as well as the numbers in which they came. 'They were not organised petitions or stereotyped letters,' he said. 'We did not put words in people's mouths.' Even in the days of three-figure majorities, the government would have been hard-pressed to ignore such a show of opinion, which was soon being exploited gleefully by Labour. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, promised swiftly that forms to be sent to those approaching pension age would 'mention the post office option'. The torrent of letters may even have influenced the government's decision to delay privatising the Post Office by excluding the necessary legislation from its outline programme for the next parliamentary session. Perhaps more importantly for the Post Office's long-term future, the government has begun to examine how new technology might be used to improve the efficiency of paying benefit through post offices. Mr Baker believes this could be the key to keeping everyone happy, providing improved efficiency for the government and better service for customers, while helping to ensure that the post office network is preserved.</p>

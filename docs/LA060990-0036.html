			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST STILL TO COME FOR SUNDAY SILENCE  </P> <P> Your June 4 headline treatment of the story about the accident at Hollywood  Park last Sunday focused attention on the lesser part of the story.  </P> <P> My opinion is that it should have read, "J. Nic's Desire, a Beautiful  4-Year-Old Colt, Killed After Senseless Accident."  </P> <P> A minor footnote might have added: "A professional jockey, pushing the eager  young colt beyond its physical limits, contributed directly to the decision to  kill the injured and therefore economically valueless thoroughbred." If space  permitted, the name of the jockey could have been included in the body of the  story.  </P> <P> JOHN FRETER, Yucca Valley  </P></p>

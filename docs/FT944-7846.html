			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Labour on attack over Tory leak The Labour party will today attempt to add to the government's discomfort at the leak of a Conservative campaign document by proposing legislation based on the draft paper's policy recommendations. Much of the draft paper, written for the prime minister by Mr John Maples, the party's deputy chairman, is supported by Conservative backbenchers though its policy recommendations have not been adopted. The paper urged postponing the implementation of the second instalment of value added tax on fuel, increasing tax on executive share options and slowing the pace of reform of the National Health Service. Very similar proposals will be made today by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in his amendment to the Queen's speech. His proposed amendment also draws liberally on criticisms of the government's performance contained in the paper, which is based on a survey of disenchanted Conservative voters. The paper, obtained by the Financial Times, also says: 'Press coverage of good stories (about the economy) is crucial . . . Can we have a network for gathering these stories? I am sure the unions give the broadcasters many of the job loss stories. Through the DTI and Invest in Britain Bureau we could capture most of the big foreign investments.' Mr Brown said last night that this was a proposal 'to use public bodies as outposts of the Conservative party's public relations department'. The paper is particularly critical of the government's economic policy. It says: 'It is no use pursuing fiscal and monetary rectitude if there are no rising living standards and job opportunities until too late.' It says, however, that the government's image will be improved if it can find outsiders to make public statements of support: 'Third party endorsers are infinitely more believable than ministers.' Another suggestion is that 'we must avoid antagonising our friends in the police, CBI etc if we can possibly help it'.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A federal court jury hearing a mock trial in Cincinnati said it would award  neighbors of a Department of Energy plant $136 million in damages from the  former operator of the facility, which processes uranium used in producing  nuclear weapons. The jury, in a non-binding verdict intended to encourage a  settlement, ruled that National Lead of Ohio Inc. operated the Feed Materials  Production Center at Fernald in a way that lowered property values and caused  emotional distress to neighbors. The company, which operated the plant under  contract for the government from 1951 through 1985, and its parent company,  National Lead Industries Inc., are defendants in a class-action lawsuit on  behalf of 14,000 people. The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of  radioactive dust have been released from faulty filters since the plant opened.  </P></p>

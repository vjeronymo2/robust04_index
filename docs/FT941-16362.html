			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Institutions to finance lottery bid by Rank The Rank Organisation plans to bid for the National Lottery licence with finance largely provided by a consortium of institutional investors. Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive of the leisure group, has reached agreement in principle with a range of large UK institutions, said to be household names. If it won the licence Rank would be the operating company. It would probably hold a minority of the equity, and choose all suppliers by tender. Although Rank is a serious contender, it is unlikely to announce formally its intention to bid much before the February 14 deadline. Meanwhile Ladbroke, the hotel and leisure group, and MAI, the television, financial services and market research group, confirmed their intention to bid, unveiling a heavyweight board for the joint venture known as Games For Good Causes. Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons, the Ladbroke-owned football pools company, will be chief executive of the lottery consortium. He said yesterday that the National Lottery might eventually raise nearly Pounds 1bn a year for good causes and Pounds 500m for taxpayers. This implies annual revenues of about Pounds 4bn. He also promised that, if successful, the operation would be based in Liverpool, home of Vernons, although it would be independent of the pools organisation. The consortium is chaired by Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of Boots. Lord Hesketh, former government chief whip in the Lords, is deputy chairman. The board also includes Sir Michael Lickiss, a senior partner in Grant Thornton, the accountants, Sir Michael Jenkins, an executive director of Kleinwort Benson, and Ms Elizabeth Filkin, the Inland Revenue's independent adjudicator, who would act as a lottery ombudsman. Ladbroke and MAI would each take a third of the equity with the rest being offered to institutional investors. All the consortium's technology would be supplied by the UK subsidiary of AT&amp;T/NCR, the communications and computing group, which would draw on the lottery equipment of Automated Wagering International of the US. Sir Christopher said yesterday that the consortium was 'looking at a high street operation' but declined to say whether this might include Boots. He promised Games For Good Causes intended to be 'as open as we can' on its application after the bids have gone in. Eight consortia have so far indicated serious plans to bid for the lottery licence with signs of two further 'dark horses' in the wings. Lex, Page 18</p>

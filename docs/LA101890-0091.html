			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BARGAINS: FREDDIE KRUEGER, BATMAN HOLD HALLOWEEN EDGE  </P> <P> Hollywood continues to dominate the field in Halloween costumes, with Freddie  Krueger and Batman characters as the top runners in this year's costume race.  </P> <P> The entertainment industry almost has a total hold on the costume choices of  children and grown-ups alike this year.  </P> <P> Costume shop managers estimate that the biggest sellers for the younger set  this season will be Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles.  </P> <P> John Tolson of Magic World, the San Fernando Valley's largest source of weird  and wild get-ups, has a solid inventory of Ninja Turtle outfits ranging from  $9.95 for a single mask to $19.95 to $28.97 for a complete outfit.  </P> <P> Magic World, 10122 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Chatsworth, (818-700-8100) is  predicting that the cartoon Simpsons will run a close second. Bart, Homer and  Marge latex heads cost $35, which may seem high, but since the costume is  completed with everyday attire, the head is all that's needed to play the role.  </P> <P> For adults, Magic World has a good quality Dick Tracy hat and coat, which rent  for $45; if you want to add shoes, pants, tie, etc., the ensemble is $85.  </P> <P> The gory look is always hot on Halloween night. Heads of Freddie Krueger --  from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" films -- are $12.95, and a new entry, a  latex head of Michael Myers -- from the "Halloween" films -- is $39.95.  </P> <P> Little girls still like to look pretty, and so the Little Mermaid costumes are  expected to be big sellers this year. Magic World has one for $44.95, complete  with fins and shells, on top of a leotard. Clever mothers can probably come up  with a good facsimile. A wig is an extra $12.95.  </P> <P> Robinson's Beautilities in West Los Angeles has a wide range of costumes at  good prices. The complete Little Mermaid costume here starts at $22.95, and the  bright red wig sells for $12 to $25. The owner, Belle Fisher, says Batman is  still in demand (at $14.50) and Superman (at $16.95) still captures the  imaginations of the little ones.  </P> <P> Robinson's has the Dick Tracy outfits plus the latex heads of all the Tracy  gang -- Mumbles, Pruneface, Flattop, etc. -- for $45. Robinson's Beautilities  has a good supply of costume makeup on sale right now from 50 cents to $2.95.  Robinson's is at 12320 Venice Blvd., West Los Angeles; (213) 398-5757.  </P> <P> For grown-ups who are still in the Halloween swing, the Center Theatre Group  Costume Shop offers rental costumes from productions staged at the Music Center  theaters.  </P> <P> High on the list of requests certainly will be the Phantom of the Opera  costumes. The masks are for sale at $6, and if your closet holds a cape and  hat, you've got a deal. If not, you can rent the cape and hat for $50 and the  whole suit for $75. Almost all the costumes from Shelley Duval's "Faerie Tale  Theatre" productions are available for rent for that special party, for $40 to  $150. Nothing for the small fry here, but what a place to get in the dress-up  mood! The address is 3301 E. 14th St., Los Angeles; (213) 267-1230.  </P></p>

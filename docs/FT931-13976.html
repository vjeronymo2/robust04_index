			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: US banks' recovery trend continues - Chase Manhattan advances 23% over year in wake of staff cuts THE RECOVERY trend among big US banks was underscored by improved fourth-quarter and full-year 1992 results from Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking in New York, Banc One in Ohio and Wells Fargo in California. Net profits at Chase Manhattan, the New York bank that has been cutting staff and restructuring operations, were 23 per cent higher at Dollars 639m, or Dollars 3.46 per share, for the whole of 1992. The earnings were up despite bad debt provisions that rose to Dollars 1.22bn for the year from Dollars 1.09bn in 1991. Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 169m, or 87 cents, against Dollars 135m, or 80 cents, last time. Provisions for the quarter were Dollars 305m, down from Dollars 315m a year earlier. Net loan write-offs for 1992 were Dollars 1.27bn, against Dollars 1.93bn in the previous year, while write-offs on US commercial property loans were Dollars 453m, compared with Dollars 377m last time. Chase said it reduced its commercial property loan exposure in the US to Dollars 6.7bn in 1992 - from Dollars 8.6bn at the end of 1991. The bank's earnings last year were helped by net interest revenues of Dollars 3.6bn, up from Dollars 3.4bn in 1991. Chase's common equity-to-assets ratio was 5.25 per cent at year-end, up from 4.36 per cent a year earlier. The return on assets was 0.64 per cent, against 0.52 per cent in 1991. Chemical Banking had its first full year of operations since the merger of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover Trust. It achieved fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 304m, or Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with a Dollars 420m (Dollars 2.49 a share) loss in the same quarter of 1991, or up by 48 per cent when compared to the 1991 quarter's profit before merger-related restructuring charges. For the whole of 1992, Chemical's net profit was a healthy Dollars 1.086bn, or Dollars 3.90, against Dollars 154m, or 11 cents, in 1991 after restructuring charges and 39 per cent higher with the 1991 charge stripped out. Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said the strong earnings 'clearly validate the merger'. Chemical's bad debt provisions in 1992 were Dollars 1.365bn, little changed from Dollars 1.345bn in 1991. Total loan write-offs, excluding less-developed countries' debt, were Dollars 1.365bn, against Dollars 1.191bn in 1991. The bank's common equity-to-assets capital ratio was 5.7 per cent at year-end, up from 4.1 per cent in the previous year. The tier one measure used by regulators was 7.2 per cent, up sharply from 5.1 per cent at the end of 1991. In Ohio, the Banc One Corporation showed it was able to turn in solid profits even as it continued to make acquisitions. The fourth-quarter 1992 net profit was Dollars 193.1m, or 81 cents, up by 27.7 per cent from Dollars 151.2m, or 65 cents. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 114.3m in the quarter, down from Dollars 171.9m in the same period of 1991. The provisions level was slightly higher for the year, at Dollars 510.5m, against Dollars 502.7m. For the whole of 1992 Banc One had Dollars 781.3m, or Dollars 3.28 per share, of net profits, a rise of 32 per cent on the 1991 net. Banc One's 1.34 per cent return on assets in 1992 was nearly twice the industry average and its common equity-to-assets ratio of 8.1 per cent made it one of the best capitalised banks in the US. Wells Fargo, the California bank that has been hit by commercial property loan problems, had net profits of Dollars 283m, or Dollars 4.44 per share, in 1992, against Dollars 21m, or 4 cents, in 1991. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 58m, or 83 cents, compared with a Dollars 231m (Dollars 4.59 a share) loss in the same period of 1991. The bank's bad debt provision in the last quarter was Dollars 300m, down from Dollars 700m a year before. At the close on Wall Street, Chemical's share price was Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 41 5/8 ; Chase was Dollars  7/8 lower at Dollars 29 5/8 ; Banc One was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 52 1/4 ; Wells Fargo was Dollars 13 higher at Dollars 99.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / City argues benefits to environment of security cordon THE SECURITY cordon around the financial heart of the City of London may become permanent as a result of unforeseen environmental benefits. The Corporation of London yesterday cited these to support its proposal that the cordon, set up in the wake of April's IRA bombing, should stay in place indefinitely. 'There have been some quite astonishing environmental benefits,' said Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources committee. The effects of the cordon had been 'wholly positive', resulting in reduced pollution, less car traffic, and greater freedom of movement for pedestrians. The Corporation will list these benefits in making a case for closing the roads on environmental grounds under the Road Traffic Act. It has decided not to attempt to persuade the government to allow the closures on security grounds, as opponents argue that there is a risk of handing a propaganda victory to the IRA. The environmental case for closing the roads may be disputed by surrounding boroughs, concerned that the City's cordon will increase their traffic problems. The proposals for a permanent security cordon were part of a Pounds 5m package of anti-terrorist proposals, which are subject to public consultation until August 23. Other measures include efforts to co-ordinate companies' security systems; a pager alert system; and the removal of litter bins. Technically advanced cameras at checkpoints will photograph drivers entering the City, at a cost of Pounds 500,000. The cordon, introduced on a temporary basis on July 3, involves closing 18 roads and setting up vehicle checkpoints. If surrounding boroughs oppose the road closures, the proposal will go to a public inquiry. The issue would be decided by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. Tower Hamlets, one of the surrounding boroughs, is considering whether to oppose the proposal to make the cordon permanent. It is worried that the cordon may increase car parking by people using the Underground for the final part of their journey. The City police said extra police presence and extra cameras had contributed to a fall in the crime rate by 16.4 per cent in the first six months of the year. Mr Colin Coxall, acting commissioner of the City police, said that, while the system could not be totally foolproof, 'the measures make it much more likely that another terrorist attack would be thwarted and those responsible arrested'.

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Markets: Goodbye to bearers of bad tidings - The Election and You / Wall Street IT WAS perhaps fitting that this was the week that saw the withdrawal from presidential politics of Paul Tsongas - the man who refused to sugar-coat his views on the US economy. A few scattered statistics - a jump in housing starts here, improving retail sales there - were meanwhile being seized on by many as evidence that the US economy is in a recovery phase. Bearers of bad news such as Tsongas, the one politician who made it clear that he would not be Santa Claus, are clearly not welcome. In the Bush camp, Nicholas Brady, the President's tennis partner and the Secretary of the Treasury, took heart from the Federal Reserve's latest survey of economic conditions and interpreted the improving picture as evidence that recovery is officially underway. Predictably enough, less politically high-profile analysts of the US economy have been less categorical in their projections. 'Yes, a recovery seems to be approaching, but it is by no means clear that it will be strong, or quick, or decisive.' Wall Street, of course, had expressed its own sugary vision of the macro-economy at the start of the year, rallying on the bet that lower interest rates and the law of averages would help US industry and finance to emerge from its prolonged period of stagnation. The problem for US equity investors is that, having discounted a strong recovery three months ago, the trickle of data which indicates improving conditions is having little impact on day-to-day trading. This week's ho-hummish equity market was thus more narrowly focussed. For example, the Treasury bond market's rally on Thursday, based partly on reduced fears of inflationary pressure, pushed the yield on the benchmark long bond below 8 per cent for the first time in several days. This in turn made bonds a less interesting alternative to equities and brought Thursday's trading volume up to a respectable 197m shares, compared to the anaemic 151m-share volume of last Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has not, however, seen any dramatic movements lately. It is an article of faith that the Dow is hovering comfortably above the 3,200 level, but the atmosphere is listless. The equity market more the province of professional traders than retail investors because of yesterday's 'triple witching' expiration of certain options on individual stocks and of the March Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures options. In such a patchy market, it was far more interesting for investors to sit on the sidelines and watch Japan-bashers from the car industry score more rhetorical points. Equally entertaining was the little soap opera that was played out last weekend in the boardroom at Chrysler, where the mercurial Lee Iacocca was finally persuaded to make good on his promise to retire as chairman at year-end. Iacocca spent last Saturday in meetings that lasted until midnight with members of his board and Robert Eaton, the head of General Motors Europe who on Monday was named as Iacocca's successor. The big loser was Robert Lutz, the former Ford executive who was supposed to be heir apparent, but who confounded skeptics on Monday by loyally promising to stay at Chrysler even though he has been effectively demoted by the appointment of Eaton. Chrysler's share price has improved by 29 per cent over the last two months. It stood at Dollars 18 at lunch-time yesterday. The confirmation that Iacocca is finally prepared to hand over the top job seemed to appeal to investors, since Chrysler's share price has risen by nearly Dollars 2 in the wake of Monday's announcement. Another corporate story that could affect share prices was the news that Dow Corning, the world's leading maker of silicone gel breast implants, is pulling out of the business. Dow Corning has been hounded by Congressional investigations, allegations about the safety of its implants and hundreds of lawsuits that could result in expensive product liability claims. The company, a 50-50 venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, is not quoted, but Corning's share price has taken a beating in recent weeks. Dow Chemical, which is much less reliant on revenue from breast implants, has not been affected. But, depending on how the terms of claims and settlements turn out, there could be more of an impact on the share price of both companies.  -------------------------------- Monday      3236.36  +   0.45 Tuesday     3256.04  +  19.68 Wednesday   3254.25  -   1.79 Thursday    3261.40  +   7.15 Friday      3276.39  +  14.99  --------------------------------</p>

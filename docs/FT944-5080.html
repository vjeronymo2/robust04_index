			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Arab world 'in pollution crisis' The Middle East and North Africa are in environmental crisis, with a quarter of the Arab world living without access to safe water supplies and a fifth in cities with 'unacceptable' levels of air pollution, Mr Ciao Koch-Weser, regional vice-president of the World Bank, said yesterday. He was presenting a 78-page World Bank environmental strategy plan to an annual meeting of Arab League ministers responsible for the environment. The bank was ready to double lending for environmental projects in the region to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) a year, he said. The report paints a grim picture of pollution in the Arab world, which it says costs Arab League states Dollars 10bn a year, or about 3 per cent of their combined gross domestic product, half of which is accounted for by the health costs of respiratory and other pollution-related diseases. It says 60m Arabs have no access to safe water, nine Arab states are annually consuming more than 100 per cent of their renewable water resources, and 45m people live in cities with air pollution at least five times World Health Organisation-accepted levels. The report urges Arab states to increase institutional structures to deal with environmental problems (only a handful of states have ministries for the environment, for instance), to cut energy and water subsidies, which it says amount to Dollars 25bn a year, and substantially to increase information and awareness about the levels and dangers of pollution. 'This region is still quite far behind in terms of this awareness,' Mr Koch-Weser said. The bank puts the cost of properly addressing such issues at Dollars 6bn-Dollars 8bn for the Arab League states, which it says can be 'paid for from domestic sources without substantial hardships'. It suggests raised petrol taxes, pollution charges and more efficient pricing and cost recovery. Unchanged policies, the report continues, would result in a 60 per cent rise in air pollution from vehicles alone and a 50 per cent rise in municipal solid waste and toxic pollution in the next decade. This would double present health costs attributable to pollution. In Cairo alone, according to Mr Bjorn Larsen, a World Bank environmental economist, lead pollution levels are at present 2-10 micrograms per cubic metre, against WHO acceptable levels of 0.5-1 mcg per cubic metre. About 80 per cent of lead pollution comes from vehicle emissions in Cairo, where the vehicle stock is on average 15 years old and the estimated health cost of this pollution is estimated at 7 US cents per litre of petrol.

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Mandarin The truth about Britain's spies is duller than you could possibly imagine. That is why it is so startling. Bear with me a moment, and I'll explain. First it is necessary to establish that we are talking mainly about the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly referred to as MI6, and a little about the security service, or MI5. The former spies on foreigners, the latter on the domestic population. Until 1987, the government hardly admitted the existence of either department. In 1989, a bill put through the house by Mr Douglas Hurd, then the home secretary, bestowed the dignity of a statutory existence upon MI5. It also provided what I believe are inadequate safeguards against abuse, which may occur when operatives are authorised to bug telephones or enter properties to steal documents. An independent judicial tribunal does hear complaints, but that is a wholly internal affair. It would be more reassuring to have some means whereby bell-ringers can be heard outside the charmed circle, such as by a parliamentary committee, or a panel of privy councillors. A similar bill to be put through this year or next by Mr Hurd, now foreign secretary, will legalise MI6. The question of safeguards is yet to be publicly debated. The argument in favour of an external port of call for complainers is less compelling in this instance than with the domestic service. On top of that, a natural preference for consistency will doubtless weigh with Mr Hurd as a reason for copying large chunks of text from his earlier Secret Service act. Against that, the political climate has changed. The 1988 bill was produced under the watchful eye of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. She did let slip in autumn 1987 that the SIS existed, and she did appoint Sir Philip Woodhead as an internal ombudsman to the two services, but her general approach was gung-ho: spies were something you did not mention. Mr John Major's administration is less childish. The appointment of Mrs Stella Rimington as the new head of MI5 was publicly announced well in advance of her arrival in her new office in February. On Wednesday, Mr Major told the world what only the uninterested did not already know: that Sir Colin McColl is head of MI6, with direct access to him on demand. This announcement should be the deciding factor. If government is to be more open, as Mr Major has to his credit said it will be, there ought to be the maximum possible parliamentary scrutiny of every branch of the administration, including the secret services. For it is here that the startling truth about our spies comes in. At bottom they are civil servants, operating within Whitehall as part of the everyday process of government. When I visited MI5 some years ago, I was struck by how like any clutch of well-mannered civil servants the senior officers were. Their troubles were those of most departments: recruitment, promotions, a career ladder recognisably like any other within the government. It turns out that the same is true of MI6. Their higher officers - those who work in their 'intelligence branch' - have to blend in with the foreign office, so they tend to be upper-class or at the very least Oxbridge types, some recruited from the defence forces, some from the older universities. The domestic service, which has to be invisible within the general population, draws on a wider range of recruits. At the sharp end, most of MI6's work consists of managing people. They solicit information by being friendly and confidential or, in extremis, they buy it. The joint intelligence committee (JIC) of the cabinet sets out what is required; the product, which is in the form of raw information, goes to the interested ministries (defence, the foreign office, the Treasury, the department of trade and industry and others according to need). It also goes to the cabinet office where an assessment staff sifts it, adds in publicly-known or other information, and produces judgments on the significance of what has come in. Most Whitehall officials are accustomed to appending the SIS to circulation lists at the top of their documents. Ministers may instruct their officials to find out 'more about that'. The private secretary will mumble assent, then ask the SIS or MI5 contact within that department to make the right telephone call to the right intelligence officer. This is much less of a free-ranging system than pertains in the US, where the CIA and the State Department spies make their own assessments of the basic data. One result was a set of competing proposals on Nicaragua. In Britain, Whitehall rules constitute a restraint: when an MI6 informant told of the Iraqi supergun being made in English factories, the service could only pass the news along. It has no standing on domestic issues. There was some concern about the future of the SIS when the Cold War ended, but the JIC has given it plenty of work to do. An entrepreneurial moment has arrived: it advises east European countries on how to set up a democracy's secret service and keep it honest; the unfortunate Hungarians, Czechoslovaks and others have little to thank their communist spy services for. That is, however, a small task. More regularly, MI6 watches nuclear proliferation, tracks ex-Soviet weaponry and scientists, provides reports on the politics of certain countries, offers up a small amount of economic information and ad hoc bits and pieces of commercial news, and, increasingly, tracks international terrorists and drug dealers. The latter is its only really dangerous work; most MI6 officers had a rather cosy relationship with their opposite numbers in the KGB, when it was the enemy. They knew each other: they met at cocktail parties. They competed, but by and large did not kill one another, as John le Carre would have us believe. Real life intelligence work is more mundane. There is little violence and, I am assured, no assassinations. Mr Hurd knows all this. He is prone to tease those of us who think his previous bill, and its accompanying sharply-focused official secrets act, was flawed. As he points out, no editors have gone to jail since its passage. Yet he will understand the case for harmonising his new bill with the promise of more open government made by Mr Major. There should be only the slightest of differences between the law as applied to run-of-the-mill civil servants and their run-of-the-mill colleagues in MI5 and MI6.</p>

Such a conclusion inevitably arises when one  reads, ``A Handbook on Urgent Measures for Reducing the  Ecological Risk from Technogeneous Accidents and Catastrophes,''  prepared by the RF Federal Mining and Industrial Inspectorate  for a session of the RF Interdepartmental Commission on  Ecological Safety.    The development of industrial production, particularly the  most dangerous ones--the chemical and petrochemical, the oil and  gas-refining sectors, and the mining and metallurgical  complex--in and of itself already increases the risk of  technogeneous accidents. What with the existing technical  equipment at the majority of our enterprises, the danger  increases manyfold. In 1992 there were 430 accidents at  production facilities and sites monitored by Gosgortekhnadzor  [probably, State Committee for Technical Oversight of the Mining  Industry], the material losses from which amount to nearly R2  billion. Twelve train wrecks and 1,020 other incidents occurred  during rail shipment of hazardous materials, in the course of  which there were 817 cases of leakage of petroleum products,  chemicals, and other toxic substances. In the first half of  1993, 196 accidents took place, with material losses amounting  to nearly R1.6 billion.    The causes are the commonly-known and traditional ones. The  level of scientific research on industrial safety is inadequate  to the demands of the present, which has a significant effect on  the quality of design and planning work, and retards the  redesign of systems for insuring stable, accident-free  industrial production facilities. The grossest violations of  safety requirements result from deviations from modern  technology, and improper engineering decisions. The obsolesence  of fixed capital at enterprises in the chemical complex, for  example, amounts to 70-75 percent (having been in operation for  20 years and more). And finally, the very practice of financing  environmental-protection measures out of ecological funds.  According to data from Mintopenergo Rossii [RF Ministry of Fuel  and Energy], in 1992 only 25 percent of the funds were expended  as directed.    In major industrial regions--Angarsk, Kemerovo, Ufa,  Dzerzhinsk--an enormous amount of highly-toxic substances are  piling up--cholrine, ammonia, hydrocyanic [prussic] acid. In the  event of the development of a chain of accidents at such  enterprises, the scale of the consequences is hard to imagine.  Fires, explosions, and discharges of toxic products are  increasingly the causes of people perishing. In the last year  alone, at sites of the chemical complex, there were 82 accidents  involving the destruction of production facilities and  significant discharges of harmful substances. Material losses  from these accidents amounted to R55.7 million.    In the first eight months of this year 24 accidents took  place. The handbook cites examples of the major ones. In 1992,  at the Bratsk Chlorine Plant, as a result of loss of hermetic  sealing on a condenser shell, chlorine was discharged into the  atmosphere for 16 minutes, and it became necessary to evacuate  the personnel at two neighboring enterprises. An investigation  established that the enterprises had not resolved questions of  accidental release of gases. An especially dangerous situation  came to pass at enterprises in Irkutsk Oblast. In 1990 alone, 50  accidental discharges took place for which emergency gas rescue  equipment was employed.    Enterprises for extraction of minerals and the exploitation  of mineral resources are exceedingly dangerous to the  environment. Here it is necessary to solve the most complex  problems with respect to engineering. Pumping wastes deep  underground and discharge of waste waters--sooner or later turn  out to be time-bombs. Special threats are posed by landslides,  sudden destruction of the sides of quarries and dumps, and the  destruction of rock faces. Carrying on underground mining  operations beneath water-bearing strata poses significant risk,  and protecting mines from flooding is an almost unsolvable  problem. For instance, beneath the cities of Berezniki and  Solikamsk, after many years of mining operations, 170 million  cubic meters of empty space has been formed; in the event these  spaces were to be accidentally flooded, the catastrophic results  would be hard to predict. There has already been one such  instance in the history of our potassium industry. In 1986 at  the Verkhnekamsk deposit, a mine with a capacity of 7.6 million  tons per year was flooded. Losses subsequently amounted to over  R300 million.    The working group which prepared ``A Handbook on Urgent  Measures for Reducing the Ecological Risk from Technogeneous  Accidents and Catastrophes,'' proposes a number of measures  which, in its opinion, would permit stabilizing the situation in  the next two-to-three years. Apart from the stereotypical  ``intensification of criminal, administrative and economic  liability,'' it proposes developing a concept for a ``National  Policy of the Russian Federation in the Sphere of Technogeneous  and Economic Danger,'' and also other draft laws which establish  the legal basis for industrial and ecological safety.    In addition, state oversight organs have taken special pains  to point out the following circumstance: Under conditions of  changing the forms of property, and the transfer of  responsibility from the level of ministries and departments to  the level of associations, corporations and concerns, the latter  do not envisage or do not attribute the proper significance to  the functions of managing ecological and industrial safety. Some  entrepreneurs and enterprise managers are reducing or entirely  eliminating the corresponding services, and are using the assets  thus freed up as reserves for reducing expenditures and  guaranteeing immediate profits. Thus, Gosnadzor RF [RF State  Committee on Oversight] certifies that the economic mechanisms  of today do not permit employing economic levers and stimuli to  ensure production safety.    It only remains to point out the fact that over the course  of  the many decades of the Soviet period a ruinous ecological  policy was pursued, in the absence of any new economic  conditions. Moreover, many joint stock companies and  associations are--yesterday's ministries and departments, as a  rule with the previous leadership intact, and consequently the  former level of thinking.</p>

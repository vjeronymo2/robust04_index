The proposed change does not increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes affect the Action Statements which are to be taken when it is discovered that the Quadrant Power Tilt Ratio (QPTR) is greater than the value specified in the Limiting Condition for Operation. The frequency for determining QPTR has been reduced. The requirements to reduce power to below 50% RTP and to reduce the power range flux trip setpoints based on QPTR have been replaced by similar requirements based on F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) and F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=4 --> D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The requirement to correct the cause prior to increasing power and verifying QPTR hourly is replaced with specific requirements to verify that F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) and F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=4 --> D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are within their limits, the safety analyses remain valid, and the excore detectors are re-normalized to indicate zero quadrant power tilt. If the proposed actions are not met, a requirement to reduce power to &gt;50% RTP within 4 hours was added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only item above that could affect the probability of an accident is the removal of the requirement to reduce the power range neutron flux setpoints. However, because the Protection Cabinets must be entered to make these adjustments, eliminating the requirement to adjust these setpoints actually slightly reduces the probability of an inadvertent plant trip. Thus, the changes do not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated and may reduce the probability of a plant trip.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Action Statements, require that accident analyses be re-evaluated to confirm that the results remain valid within 24 hours. Prior to completion of this confirmation, the plant is not permitted to operate at a power level higher than is permitted under the current specification. If the re-evaluation of accident analyses cannot confirm that the plant is within the accident analyses results, the required actions are similar to the requirements of the current specification. Although higher initial power levels generally increase accident consequences, once the accident analyses are confirmed to be valid, the consequences of any accident will be within analyzed acceptable limits. Thus, the higher plant power levels permitted by the proposed changes do not significantly increase the consequences of any accidents previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed specification does not require a reduction in Power Range Neutron Flux_High reactor trip setpoints during the time the appropriate peaking factor surveillances are being performed. The interval during which the proposed specification permits operation without reduced setpoints (and unverified peaking factors) is longer than is permitted under the current specification. However, the consequences of any accident which could occur during this interval are the same as for the conditions prior to resetting the trip setpoints in the current specification. Therefore the change does not increase the consequences of any accident which could occur during this interval. The impact of the extended interval is addressed in response to question (3) below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the discussions above, the proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve any hardware changes. System operation has not been changed to create any new system configurations which were not previously allowed. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limits for the parameters of concern (QPTR, F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) and F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> N <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=4 --> D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) remain unchanged. The acceptance criteria for analyzed events also remain the same. The margin of safety established by the LCOs [Limiting Conditions for Operation] remains unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only impact of the proposed changes is an increase in the allowed duration of operation above 50% RTP without a reduction in the Power Range Neutron Flux_High trip setpoint. This could potentially affect a margin of safety by allowing operation at conditions which are potentially outside the assumptions of the accident analyses for an interval longer than is permitted under the current specification. The impact on safety margin is not considered to be significant, however, because: the allowed interval is still small (24 hours versus the current 6 hours); the likelihood of an accident during the interval is small; and, it is considered unlikely that the peaking factors would be outside their limits without outer indications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> University of Texas at Arlington Library, Government Publications/Maps, 701 South Cooper, P.O.

The proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC assures that appropriate core operating limits are established by requiring that they be determined using NRC approved analytical methods. These approved methods are described in the documents listed in TS Section 6.9.1.6b. TU Electric has developed the analysis capability to evaluate the core operating limits. The methodologies used by TU Electric have been documented in a series of TU Electric submittals which were reviewed and approved by the NRC. This TS revision adds the topical report which describes the TU Electric steamline break analysis methodology to TS Section 6.9.1.6b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the Westinghouse report which describes the methodology previously used in the analysis of Unit 1 large break LOCAs is no longer used and is being deleted. Large break LOCA analyses for Unit 1 are now performed using NRC approved TU Electric methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the revisions are administrative only, they cannot directly affect the probability or the consequences of any previously evaluated accident. The steamline break analysis methodology is part of a group [of] methodologies which are authorized by the technical specifications to be used to verify that each reload cycle continues to satisfy the core operating limits. The core operating limits are set to assure that relevant plant parameters are maintained such that potential accidents are within the bounds of the accident analyses. Because the applicable limits of the safety analyses will be verified to be satisfied using authorized methodologies, there is no significant impact on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. In addition, since the core operating limits do not affect any accident initiators, the change has no impact on the probability of any accident previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes involve a change in the permissible analysis methodologies for determining core operating limits. As such, the changes play an important role in the analysis of postulated accidents but none of the changes affect plant hardware or the operation of plant systems in a way that could initiate an accident. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing and approving the methods used for safety analyses, the NRC has approved the safety analysis limits which establish the margin of safety to be maintained. Satisfaction of event-specific acceptance criteria ensures that the approved safety analysis limits are met and thus provides the margin of safety. The methodology being added to the TS demonstrates, in a conservative manner, that the event acceptance criteria are satisfied. Therefore, including this method in the TS does not change the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

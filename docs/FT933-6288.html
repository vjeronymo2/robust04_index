			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Money Markets: German concerns THE Bundesbank yesterday added liquidity to the German money market via a repo rate at 6.90 per cent in an attempt to stop a growing scramble for short-dated funds, writes James Blitz. The central bank's move did not imply any tightening of monetary policy. Emergency funds have been provided at more-or-less the same rate in recent weeks when the market has found itself illiquid. Instead, by announcing a repo to Wednesday, the Bundesbank was helping to calm the market over the next two trading days. There were strong expectations that a fixed rate repo would be set at 6.80 per cent again on Wednesday. The provision of DM17.9bn of liquidity was required because dealers had decided not to purchase funds on Thursday in the belief that there would be a cut in the discount rate. When the cut failed to materialise, there was a sudden scramble for funds in the interbank market - especially with end of month pressures. If the repo funds had not been provided, call money would have soared above yesterday's already high level of 7 per cent. The Bundesbank is becoming increasingly concerned by the discrepancy between expectations of interest rate cuts and its own intentions. The events of the last few days may encourage the central bank to be even more cautious about signalling cuts in official interest rates over the next few weeks. Mr Manfred Korber, the Bundesbank's chief spokesman, warned yesterday: 'The Bundesbank views with concern the fact that expectations, which are heightened by apparently scientifically backed predictions, contribute to large market fluctuations and to volatility.' But the discrepancy continues. There have been strong advances in some European equity markets in the belief that German rates are coming down. And expectations remain of a cut at the next Bundesbank meeting. Sterling futures reflected little disappointment with German policy last week. The December contract rose 5 basis points yesterday to close at 94.59. Three month sterling was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent. There was a shortage of Pounds 850m in the discount market and late assistance of Pounds 460m.</p>

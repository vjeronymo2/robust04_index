			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'WATER CONSERVATION DAY' DRAWS MIXED  REVIEWS  </P> <P> In case you missed it, Thursday was "Water Conservation Day" in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> And though it received little fanfare, proponents say it was a rousing success.  </P> <P> Water consumption dropped by 22% Thursday, as compared with the same day last  year. And that, according to City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, is a clear  demonstration of residents' willingness to save water without mandatory  rationing.  </P> <P> But Mayor Tom Bradley, who is seeking to impose rationing this summer, said  Flores is all wet.  </P> <P> "It's ludicrous to make a decision about the future of the city and the supply  of our water based on statistics from one day -- particularly when that day was  unseasonably cool, and front lawns throughout Los Angeles were still damp from  an unusual late-May rainstorm," Bradley said.  </P></p>

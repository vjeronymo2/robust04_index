			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / O'Reilly submits Pounds 30m bid for stake in Independent Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman and newspaper publisher, last night increased the stakes in the increasingly bitter battle for the future of The Independent newspaper by submitting a formal offer for up to 29.9 per cent of the company. The offer, worth in the region of Pounds 30m, has been assembled by Charterhouse merchant bank and will be the only formal offer on the table when the board of Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent, meets today. It is clear that the lossmaking Newspaper Publishing, which is in need of a cash injection, could have a cheque for between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m by Friday, depending on the precise shareholding involved. A consortium, including Mirror Group Newspapers and Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, main founder of The Independent, which announced on Monday that it intended to bid for the company, has not yet agreed a price and no formal bid is expected before next week The consortium, whose other members include existing Independent shareholders El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, is talking about an offer in the region of Pounds 2 a share. This would value Newspaper Publishing at around Pounds 40m. The proposed price would take into account the injection of around Pounds 20m into the company to pay off debt of around Pounds 5m and provide working capital and money to promote both The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Mr O'Reilly, the chief executive of HJ Heinz, the international food company, is chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland and a substantial shareholder. The offer may only be the opening shot in the battle. The O'Reilly camp has made clear it is prepared to make a full bid for the paper. It is believed the Dublin company has been approached by a large UK group not in the newspaper business. Mr Giles Elliott, of Schroders, the merchant bank which represents El Pais and La Repubblica, said yesterday his clients would vote against an O'Reilly offer. MGN, which would under its proposal take a 40 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, would offer help on everything from printing and distribution to general management. The journalists at The Independent have rejected the proposals of the consortium mainly because of the involvement of MGN and its chief executive, Mr David Montgomery.</p>

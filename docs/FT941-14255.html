			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Gatt set to shelve workers' rights agenda The controversial question of whether the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should try to draw up international rules covering worker rights is likely to be shelved until after the Uruguay Round package of agreements is signed next April in Marrakesh. There is already agreement among Gatt members to draw up a work programme on trade and the environment for approval by ministers in April. In recent weeks President Bill Clinton and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, have also strongly backed including labour standards in future global trade negotiations. However, the idea is strongly opposed by many developing countries which fear a new pretext for protectionism, and it has aroused mixed feelings in the European Union. At a meeting yesterday of the Trade Negotiations Committee, which oversees the Uruguay Round, senior trade officials agreed that the Marrakesh agenda should focus on implementing the trade talks that have just ended rather than trying to launch new ones. Negotiators expect trade-environment discussions to be difficult enough without adding more contentious issues. As well as worker rights, international rules for competition policy, currency movements and investment are all candidates for inclusion in future trade talks. The immediate priority for the 117 nations taking part in the Uruguay Round is to complete negotiations on tariffs and services by mid-February. By April they will also have to agree recommendations concerning the structure and budget of the new World Trade Organisation.</p>

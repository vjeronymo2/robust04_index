			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (4): 'Bureaucratic monster' turns against its maker - The education crisis IN A small, sweltering classroom in Alexandra township, 87 five-year-old children sat on red and blue plastic chairs or knelt on the floor, using the chairs as makeshift desks. The teacher battled for their attention as the sounds of the densely populated township drifted through the broken windows. There was no electricity, for as in 91 per cent of black schools in South Africa, Skeen Primary has yet to be connected to the national grid. 'Effective learning is impossible under conditions like this,' said principal Mr Matlhabegoane. 'The children are hot and thirsty and they don't have enough books. I am surprised they continue to come to school.' Skeen Primary is a typical township school - in the rural areas, facilities are often more primitive. Results reflect the quality of the system. Last year only 36.4 per cent passed the school-leaving examination - the worst on record. The political upheaval of recent years, in which school children have been at the forefront, is partly to blame. But at the heart of the problem lies the nature of the system itself. The state of black education, already markedly inferior, received a further setback in the early 50s when Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd adopted the policy of Bantu education, designed to stifle the ambition of the 'native' and create a working class, and entrenched it by different funding for black and white pupils. Now, in the context of a changing South Africa with a growing and desperate need for skilled and trained black employees, the government has accepted that apartheid education has to go, and equal education opportunities for all must be provided. The steps they will have to take to dismantle the system are huge, and they have yet to make a start. There are still 19 departments of education: five administering white education, one each for Indians and coloureds, 11 for black education - in and out of 'independent homelands' and 'self-governing territories' - and one umbrella department controlling the purse strings and setting different 'norms and standards' for the rest. In only a tiny minority of government schools can children of all races learn side by side in the same classrooms, under a new law introduced at the beginning of the year. Concerned organisations and educationists, spearheaded by the ANC, are calling for a single education system with open schools and equal education provision for all, but the prospects for fundamental change in this area are limited by severe financial constraints. Mr Punday Pillay, lecturer at the University of Cape Town (UCT), has calculated that between two and three times the amount currently spent on education (19 per cent of total government expenditure) would be required to equalise yearly expenditure on children of all races at the current level of the whites. (While the ratio of spending on black and white children has narrowed in recent years from 8:1 to just under 4:1 the disparities remain formidable.) Black education has long lost credibility. Even Minister of black education Stoffel van der Merwe has called it a 'bureaucratic monster' and numerous academics, educationists and community members believe that not until a single education system has been established will normality be restored to the beleagered area of education. In his speech at the opening of parliament in February, State President F. W. De Klerk admitted the present education system 'shall and must be changed'. But instead of giving a clear indication of how and when, he appeared to equivocate: 'Distinctive or autogenous education, conducted with government assistance within a single system by those who desire it, has to remain an option.' On separate occasions, two ministers of education, Louis Pienaar and Stoffel van der Merwe, indicated the education system could only be radically changed when a new constitution is drawn up. On the face of it therefore, it seems education will be one of the last areas to be reformed. In practice things may turn out somewhat differently. At the request of Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy-president of the ANC, a joint ANC and government working group has been convened to look at the 'burning issues' - the lack of textbooks, classrooms and other facilities - and also 'procedures to establish a fully representative forum' to discuss a new education system. The working group has yet to report back or come to any concrete conclusions. The route to equal education is a matter of debate. Mr Pienaar and Mr Van der Merwe favour a more 'bottom-up' reform: addressing the imbalances of the system within the current framework, bringing into line the divergent 'norms and standards', and gradually working towards equal provision of education for all pupils irrespective of race. They state that equal funding is impossible and growing backlogs will take even longer to rectify. Eventually, Mr Pienaar believes: 'We will have to apply whatever we have to a basic education, and if you want education after that, you will have to pay for it. There is a great likelihood that education at a secondary level will not be as free as we would like. We just will not have the money to pay for everything.' More community-based educationists believe the measures being taken do not go far enough. They say children will not return to schools administered by the politically discredited Department of Education and Training (DET) and resume 'normal' education until the DET is dismantled and a unitary department erected in its place. According to Professor Charles 'M. C' Mphahlele, dean of education at the University of the North, the government's first priority must be the 'top-down' formation of a single department - in essence, a cosmetic change. Meanwhile time is running out. Figures calculated by Johan van Zijl from the independent Education Foundation predict that by the year 2000, South Africa will have a deficit of more than 500,000 skilled workers and an unemployed surplus of 2.7-million unskilled workers - the majority black. The philosophy of separate education is cemented in the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act of 1983, which defines the concept of 'own affairs' and defines education at all levels as an 'own affair'. It is this Act the government is unable - or presently unwilling - to dismantle. The reasons for this reluctance centre on the readily given excuses that it will be necessary to wait to see the shape of the future constitution, and that the economy cannot afford to restructure the system. The other important reason - not as often heard - is that the government knows it stands to lose a sector of its white constituency if the education standards of whites are lowered, as would be inevitable with a wholesale redistribution of funds.</p>

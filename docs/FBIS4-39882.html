			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [No video available] </F>   [Text] It seems that the people of Rustavi do not see among  the six candidates for deputy a replacement for Zhiuli Shartava,  who died in tragic circumstances. The reason for this may be  the fact that by noon no more than 300 voters had turned up at  any single polling station, in some of which up to 2,300 people  are eligible to vote. The Central Electoral Commission still  has no precise information (?on the turnout) due to the failure  of telephone lines.    Unfortunately, the elections were not trouble-free either.  For example, polling stations Nos. eight and 27 were closed  owing to serious violations of the election law there.    At about 1800 hours, Rustavi Mayor Soso Areshidze told us by  telephone that the situation in the city had become tense at  about noon. At many polling stations there were incidents  involving the intimidation of voters and Electoral Commission  members, the disappearance of voters lists, the removal of seals  from ballot boxes, and other serious violations of the electoral  law.    At about 1900 hours this evening tension grew even further.  At five stations elections were suspended. Many Electoral  Commission members and some commission chairmen abandoned their  polling stations.    The Rustavi mayor's office possesses information that an  unidentified armed formation has entered the city and is acting  without authorization. It is searching citizens, and there have  also been incidents involving physical abuse.    We have just received information that the elections in  Rustavi have in effect ended. A number of political parties  have attempted to wreck the elections but they were,  nevertheless, held against the background of a low turnout. The  results are now being counted.    We will have more on the elections in our later bulletins  today.</p>

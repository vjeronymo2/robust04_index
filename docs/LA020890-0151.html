			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE PARTY WARNS FOES AGAINST TRYING SOVIET PATH  </P> <P> China's Communist Party responded quickly Wednesday to radical changes in the  Soviet Union by warning its opponents that taking a similar path in China would  set off civil war.  </P> <P> "In China, without the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, new  turmoil and wars would surely arise, the nation would be split and the people,  not to mention state construction, would suffer," the party said in an  editorial in the party newspaper People's Daily.  </P> <P> The message was released in advance by the New China News Agency.  </P> <P> It raised the age-old Chinese fear of chaos to justify the need for a united  and supremely powerful authority to govern 1.1 billion people.  </P> <P> Neither the Soviet Union nor Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was  mentioned by name, but diplomats said the message was clearly aimed at heading  off any unsettling reaction among the Chinese people to events that have shaken  the foundations of communism.  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party leadership agreed Wednesday to surrender its  70-year-old guaranteed monopoly on power, paving the way for the possible  creation of a multi-party democracy.  </P> <P> China's state-controlled media have maintained a blackout on the Soviet party  plenum that ended its three-day session in Moscow on Wednesday, but many people  have tuned in to foreign radio broadcasts.  </P></p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Big number, but deferred - Tim Burt and William Lewis look at reaction to Peter Davis's Pounds 2.02m compensation package When Mr Peter Davis, the former co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, returns next week to the London office suite provided by the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, he will be more than Pounds 650,000 richer than when he left for his holiday. The 52-year-old executive, who was a leading figure in last year's merger of Reed International and Elsevier, will also be able to contemplate Pounds 70,000 of fringe benefits and a retirement cushioned by Pounds 1.3m of enhanced pension payments. His former employers, however, yesterday acted to defuse the potential row over the Pounds 2.02m compensation package by pointing out that Mr Davis's bank account would have looked far healthier had he not resigned in a dispute over management responsibilities in June. 'It looks a big number,' a senior company source admitted yesterday. 'But most of it is deferred payment. We've negotiated a good deal and he's lost out by not staying with us.' The group's lawyers and actuaries have agreed a package which, they claim, reflects Mr Davis's contribution during eight years at the helm of Reed International, a period in which profits almost doubled and the share price climbed from 160p to 805p. Although the headline figure puts Mr Davis third in the league of executive pay-offs this year - behind the Pounds 3.1m paid to Mr John Cahill of British Aerospace and a combined Pounds 2.9m payment for two former Lasmo directors - Reed Elsevier claimed to have secured a 'conservative' package. A senior company official said the pay-out was below top expectations because of the group's use of mitigation: payments adjusted for Mr Davis's chances of finding another job and early retirement. The group, which operates a final payment scheme for pensions, is said to have extracted a discount of more than 30 per cent on what Mr Davis would have received had he stayed until he was 60. 'Being blown out of a final salary scheme is very expensive,' said one City analyst. Mr Davis is also receiving enhanced pension entitlements for only two years of his three-year rolling contract. Nevertheless, the size of those entitlements - worth Pounds 650,000 a year - has angered some institutional shareholders. 'The pay-off is excessive and difficult to justify, said Mr Michael Taylor, a fund manager at Royal Insurance. Another, who asked not to be named, said he would be seeking clarification from Reed. 'This looks like the pay-off of a man who was asked to leave. We have to find out what exactly happened.' Other institutions have voiced concern at the value of Mr Davis's share options. The company declined to comment on reports that he had options on more than 180,000 Reed shares, but it admitted he could receive a pay-out 'in the event of a significant enhancement of earnings per share' under a long-term incentive sch-eme. The Top Pay Research Group, however, said the final package was not excessive. Mr Peter Brown, the group's chairman, said: 'The cash payment is not much more than a year's pay. For those angry at over-compensation, there are better examples than this.'</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Books: Operatic Czech JANACEK'S OPERAS: A DOCUMENTARY ACCOUNT by John Tyrrell Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 25, 405 pages JUST AS recognition in his own country came late to Janacek, so his reputation was slow to spread more widely. Outside Czechoslovakia his growth to popularity has been a post-Second World War phenomenon; that of the Janacek literature has been even more recent. Through his writings over the last 25 years John Tyrrell has established himself as a leading scholar in this and the wider field of Czech opera; this book, based on his work in the Janacek archive at Brno, draws together a wealth of documents relating to the genesis, publication and early performances of Janacek operas. Janacek, one of this century's greatest musical dramatists, endured many setbacks and suffered particular humiliation at the hands of unsympathetic theatre directors. His long struggles run through the book like a leitmotif, making reading that is at once illuminating and depressing. Since the composition of Jenufa took him the best part of ten years, and was overshadowed by the death of his daughter Olga, its rejection in 1904 by the National Theatre in Prague proved a severe blow. It was only in 1916, after the first Prague performance finally took place, that the 61-year-old composer was able to write, 'I am beginning to believe in my life and my mission'; in 1904 his sole response had been to 'deaden the pain with work'  -but, as he added, 'I've got problems with a libretto'. That work was Osud ('Fate'), and while the libretto did indeed prove problematic (Janacek made up the scenario as he progressed, and to this day it verges on the incomprehensible), its complications were overshadowed by the difficulties he incurred writing The Excursions of Mr Broucek. At least his troubles with publishers here were his last. After Broucek, the composer produced his librettos virtually single-handedly, and the remaining four operas flowed more freely (his last, From the House of the Dead, was written in under 11 months). But it would be simplistic to link this too closely to the great flowering that characterised Janacek's final phase: there was also his growing love for Kamila Stosslova, which, though unrequited, gave him added creative impulse. Perhaps most interesting is the background to Janacek's seldom-heard early operas Sarka and The Beginning of a Romance. The first took a libretto by the Czech symbolist poet Julius Zeyer which both Dvorak and Smetana had turned down. Janacek based the second on a short story by Gabriela Preissova, whose The Stepdaughter he later made into Jenufa. As the title of the book suggests, this is a collection of sources which relate to the nine extant operas. One longs for more - Janacek's thoughts on the genre, or on the operas of other composers, would be fascinating, though some of these would admittedly lie outside the scope of the book. It is a pity that little account is given of his projected operas. Though the evidence for some of these may be slight, musical sketches for at least four incomplete stage works exist: The Housewife was to have been based on another of Preissova's texts, and two others, Anna Karenina and The Living Corpse, two Tolstoy projects, evince the deep sympathy for Russian subjects reflected elsewhere in his oeuvre. In general, though, Tyrrell has marshalled his material splendidly, to make it both scholarly and readable. His sources are meticulously listed in an appendix, leaving the text arranged and linked as a flowing documentary narrative. Containing as it does much material that has not appeared in English before (and some, indeed, that has not been published anywhere), this is a major addition to the Janacek bibliography.</p>

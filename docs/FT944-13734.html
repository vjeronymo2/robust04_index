			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Noranda posts third-term turnround Buoyant metal, wood pulp and natural gas markets helped propel Noranda, the Canadian resources group, to a strong third-quarter turnround. The group, which is controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, had earnings of CDollars 78m (USDollars 57.7m), or 35 cents a share, compared with an CDollars 8m loss, or 8 cents. Revenues climbed to CDollars 1.8bn from CDollars 1.29bn. The mining and metals division, which includes a 46 per cent stake in Falconbridge, the nickel producer, earned CDollars 62m, compared with a CDollars 10m loss. Mine production has returned to 'expected levels', and refineries and smelters are running close to full capacity. Earnings at Noranda Forest rose to CDollars 28m from CDollars 10m. Pulp operations were profitable for the first time in two years, boosted by strong markets for lumber and panelboard. Oil and gas income fell to CDollars 11m from CDollars 16m, with higher gas prices and oil volumes offset by lower oil prices and gas shipments.</p>

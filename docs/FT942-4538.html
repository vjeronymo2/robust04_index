			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Book Review: In the long run, Keynes is still dead PEDDLING PROSPERITY By Paul Krugman W W Norton, Dollars 22, 303 pages Unlike a starry-eyed reviewer for The Economist. I feel no urge to nominate Paul Krugman for a Nobel prize. Krugman has a rare gift for conveying complex ideas in simple, entertaining prose. But his central argument - that a revived version of Keynesian theory has superseded conservative economics  -is too wrongheaded to deserve support. The best parts of the book deal with new theories. The chapter on 'QWERTY' economics is vintage Krugman. The top line of keys on a typewriter, he notes, reads QWERTYUIOP. This choice is not particularly easy on the fingers. It just happened to be chosen by the first makers of typewriters. But since typists learned their trade on QWERTY machines, future manufacturers had to cater to their needs. As a result an inefficient keyboard design quickly became 'locked in'. Krugman believes the structure of modern economies is heavily influenced by such accidents of history; just as a wise bureaucrat could, in principle, have stipulated a more efficient keyboard so, today, judicious industrial intervention could improve on unfettered market outcomes. He also recounts the supposed death blow to conservative macroeconomics dealt by George Akerlof, a Berkeley economist. Akerlof pointed out that most economists assume people are totally rational. But in the real world it is irrational to be perfectly rational because you would spend forever collecting the information needed for an efficient decision. Most people are thus slightly irrational. But the collective results of slight irrationality can be devastating. For example slight deviations from rationality might lead workers to refuse even small wage cuts. But if everybody refuses to adjust, the result is high unemployment and widespread economic dislocation  -something nobody wanted. The root argument here is that the cumulative result of individually sensible decisions can be serious inefficiencies and, occasionally, disasters such as the Great Depression. To Krugman and friends, such reasoning provides a powerful theoretical justification for government intervention - both to prevent or ameliorate recessions and to improve industrial structure. While admiring Krugman's style of argument, I find the book neither consistent nor, ultimately, convincing. Just consider the plot. Krugman spends the best part of a decade poking holes in the classical theory of free trade, gaining in the process a reputation as one of leading 'new Keynesians'. The general tenor of his work inspires future policy makers such as Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the White House chief economist, and Robert Reich, the labor secretary. Once in power they try to implement more interventionist policies. Now Krugman pulls away the rug, declaring that he always believed that free trade, in practice, was the right approach: Clinton officials have just failed to grasp the subtleties of his argument. Isn't this a bit rich? There is an ugly twist to the story. Krugman is not content to attack the arguments of 'policy entrepreneurs' - his pejorative term for Reich and other supposedly shallow thinkers. He is an unabashed 'credentialist' - a snooty professor who believes that only people with the right paper qualifications deserve to be taken seriously. He pulls academic rank on Reich, telling readers that he has no formal training in economics and was only a lecturer at Harvard. Krugman, of course, is a full professor at MIT. In a similar vein, he attacks Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street Journal, and a peddler of a different kind of prosperity in the early 1980s. Instead of confining himself to an economic critique of Bartley's tax-cutting philosophy, he relates how Bartley 'began work as a reporter at the age of 22'. How absurd, in other words, to pay him any attention: he does not even have a graduate degree. More important, Krugman exaggerates the significance of the revival of Keynesian theories. We have already seen that he violently opposes any attempt to draw practical policy conclusions from QWERTY economics - perhaps because he knows that 'government failure' is usually a more serious problem than 'market failure'. The only moral he draws from the new Keynesian macroeconomics of Akerlof and others is that central banks must lower interest rates during recessions. Big news. Would Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and a lifelong conservative, disagree? I would hate readers to gain the impression that an intellectual revolution has occurred in which Krugman and friends have vanquished the arguments of conservatives such as Milton Friedman. It just is not true. Indeed, the striking thing is how much conservative economics Krugman now accepts. In 1968 Friedman argued that there was no long-run trade off between inflation and unemployment. Attempts to maintain unemployment below a 'natural rate' would simply lead to accelerating inflation. The argument was rejected by most academics, including Krugman's mentors - the leading Keynesians at Harvard and MIT. The economic misery of the 1970s was largely caused by policy makers' vain attempts to refute Friedman's logic. Now Krugman, the new Keynesian, describes Friedman's argument as 'one of the decisive intellectual achievements of postwar economics'. He also accepts that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon, that fiscal fine-tuning does not work, that high taxes destroy incentives, that government regulations undermine business, and that trade should not be managed. How peculiar then that he should write so contemptuously of the 'moral and intellectual decline of conservative economics'. If this is decline, perhaps we should have more of it.</p>

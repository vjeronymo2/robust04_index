			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Market for recovery awaits its starting orders: FT writers asks a range of businesses whether they believe a recovery may have begun Signs of a modest revival in consumer demand have begun to raise hopes of recovery. The outlook for unemployment and new credit business remains bleak but the governor of the Bank of England thinks that 'in all probability' the recession is over. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist of Nomura Research Institute in London, says there are 'enough green shoots to make a salad' but the downturn in Germany and other Continental markets bodes ill for exports, and consumer confidence at home remains fragile. ON AN overcast mid-week afternoon, Binns department store in Middlesbrough is remarkably busy. Steady streams of customers compare flowery duvet covers and study the fine china. Mr Graham Bishop, the manager, is not surprised at the bustle. Since the New Year he has seen an upturn, confirming his store's place in the top-10 sales-growth table of the House of Fraser group. His ledgers chart the store's sales performance in the first three months of the year. Compared with early last year, overall turnover is up 6 per cent. Menswear, furniture and furnishings are up 9 per cent and electrical appliances up 14 per cent. Children's wear is up 16 per cent, cosmetics 22 per cent and white goods a thumping 36 per cent. Mr Bishop should be a happy man, but there is a snag. He is delivering the orders, but can British industry deliver the goods - and on time? 'We're finding industry in this country generally unable to react to positive signs,' he says. 'It's totally frustrating.' Mr Bishop quotes examples: the towel company that wanted up to five weeks to supply a standard line, and the linen producer which, having joined House of Fraser in a joint promotion, had no stock in hand when orders flowed in. Then there was the company whose top-of-the-range hi-fi was temporarily dropped because of delays in supply. Binns, Middlesbrough's biggest department store, turns over more than Pounds 10m a year and employs 192 full-timers and part-timers. That will rise beyond 200 this year, mainly because of a move to more part-time working to maximise the efficient use of staff. Mr Bishop believes the upturn has started. 'We've been through the worst fear of redundancy. People are now starting to settle down.' But he worries that British suppliers may lose out to overseas competitors unless industry starts re-employing and investing to boost output. 'People are going to pull their orders. There's a limit to how long people will wait. My message is: wake up industry, there's a market out there.' New markets have proved a fertile ground for Tenhill Computer Systems, the West Yorkshire-based software company. Mr David Haycox, founder, chairman and managing director, believes such companies will not grow fat on the signs of recovery in Britain. He is convinced that growth for his company - which produces software for the leasing and credit industries - lies overseas. 'The market isn't big enough to keep Tenhill growing in the UK.' Last year about 15 per cent of Tenhill's sales were exports but this should rise sharply in coming years. After two years cultivating the German market  -mostly using British staff seconded to Germany - Tenhill has appointed a German managing director for its Frankfurt office. It will be recruiting this year, mainly Germans, in Germany. Mr Haycox plans a move into Spain this year. It is not that the UK is showing no signs of interest, but orders tend to be prospective. He says: 'We're certainly getting more prospective business in our books than we've had for two years.' Prospective new UK orders exceed Pounds 2m. Most new inquiries have come from the vehicle leasing sector, which is enjoying improved business because customers unsure of a recovery prefer to lease vehicles rather than buy them. In the last three months the company has sold three systems worth more than Pounds 200,000 each, compared with three in all of last year. Further firm orders will be needed, however, if the company is to maintain staff numbers as people return from a period working in Germany. Even then, future recruitment is likely to be limited. Mr Haycox says the UK's leasing market, his main customer, is way ahead of the rest of Europe - perhaps excepting France - in its range of financial tools. But, to his frustration, hardly any of his customers are growing by selling their expertise abroad. 'What is happening is the UK finance market is being swallowed up by overseas players. I've said to my customers they are foolish in not looking outside the UK market.' Exquisitely tended landscaped grounds surround Tenhill Computer Systems' Georgian mansion near Leeds. Inside, visitors step into an entrance hall dominated by chandeliers, gilt plasterwork and Corinthian columns. For a company founded in a Leeds back-bedroom 15 years ago, turnover of Pounds 4.5m in 1992 and a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 392,000 suggests some immunity from the recession for the 100-strong workforce. Mr Haycox says: 'I have it in mind to lengthen our order backlog. That creates a bit more stability for us.' He insists responsiveness will remain 'excellent', but is averse to running with excess staff capacity. Overseas sales hold no fears for one of Britain's more traditional manufacturers. Mitchell Shackleton, the Greater Manchester-based crankshaft maker, exports more than 60 per cent of its output to Europe, Scandinavia and North America. For six years in the late 1980s the company, a subsidiary of US-based National Forge, made serious losses, peaking at Pounds 600,000 on a Pounds 3m turnover. But after a management restructuring in mid 1990 it is back in profit on turnover of about Pounds 4m and fighting its corner in a fiercely competitive world market. At the large end of its product range it is the UK's sole representative. Mr Brian McGuinness, the managing director, is confident: 'Our order book value today is infinitely better than it was 12 months ago.' But he rejects any suggestion this indicates 'green shoots' in the wider economy. 'In that context I don't sense things are on the up at all. If we had to rely on the UK market we wouldn't survive. I honestly believe it's due to getting off our backsides.' Warning that recovery in this sector is some way off, Mr McGuinness cites crankshaft regrinding, in which 90 per cent of the company's business is UK-based. Demand remains slow. Intensive marketing of the regrinding service is serving more to retain demand at current levels than to increase it. The 91 employees of the 105-year-old heavy engineering company produce huge crankshafts for the diesel engine, pump and reciprocating gas compressor industries worldwide. The company's traditional methods of making crankshafts do not, Mr McGuinness says, permit the orders growth vital to its future. 'No business can stand still. You either go up or down. We've got to grow.' To that end, the company has lined up new supply sources of forgings which will enable it to get into new crankshaft markets and reduce the costs of some end products. With the more buoyant mood there has been capital investment of Pounds 400,000 last year and about the same is planned for this year. But the cost of survival has been high. The workforce has fallen from 300 in the mid 1970s, although jobs have been created since the late 1980s, when only 75 were in work. Mr Alan Brown, the works convener, puts the company's continued success down to management initiative rather than emergent green shoots. 'I don't think anybody can be 100 per cent confident,' he says. 'Since Brian took over this place two years ago it's turned around. I don't think anybody outside has done anything to improve it for us.'</p>

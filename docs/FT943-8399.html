			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Shinawatra posts sharp advance Shinawatra Computer and Communications, the Thai telecoms and computer group, has almost doubled net profits of Bt1.21bn (Dollars 48.3m) for the first half, compared with Bt632m the same period last year. The buoyant figures were helped by a sharp rise in net profits to Bt784m at its mobile phone subsidiary, Advanced Information Services, compared with Bt384m last time. Accounting adjustments have muddied the parent company's half-year advance, but brokers HG Asia reckon its forecast of Bt2.63bn net for the full year is achievable. The parent company's second-quarter net profits jumped to Bt400.4m from Bt231m; Advanced's second quarter rose from Bt384.7m to Bt784m. Shinawatra Computer has placed 20 per cent of its previously wholly-owned overseas investment arm, Shinawatra International, with 15 strategic partners, giving the company an Bt840m after-tax gain. A further 20 per cent of Shinawatra International is due to be offered to the public. Shinawatra Satellite, which was set up last year, made a loss of Bt16.2m.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / US unit lifts Tate &amp; Lyle to record A strong performance from US cereal sweeteners and starches helped Tate &amp; Lyle overcome weaker US sugar markets and modest growth in Europe to report a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to a record Pounds 273.8m for the year ended September. The main factor behind the rise was the turnround at Staley, the US subsidiary it acquired in 1988 for Dollars 1.2bn. It reported a record profit thanks to higher volumes, strong demand particularly from the soft drink makers, new uses for starch and lower costs. The upturn came after several years of labour disputes over working practices at its Decatur, Illinois plant. Staley's profits, however, masked a downturn in the group's sugar profits in the US where margins were eroded by record beet supplies. Tate &amp; Lyle declined to give specific figures in line with a decision to reduce the data it publishes. 'We believe it's detrimental to the business' to give more information than do competitors, many of which are private companies, Sir Neil Shaw, chairman, said. Several analysts said they found it difficult to split out the figures to assess fully the results. Operating profits from North American sweeteners and starches rose 31 per cent to Pounds 147.6m on sales ahead 13 per cent at Pounds 1.64bn. In the past the group gave separate figures for cereal sweeteners and starches, US sugar and Canadian sugar. European profits from sweeteners and starches rose 5 per cent to Pounds 136.5m on a similar rise in sales to Pounds 1.3bn. In the UK profits 'held up well' with sales to industrial customers rising but exports falling. Amylum, its European cereals subsidiary, enjoyed strong sweetener profits but weaker starch profits. Profits from sweeteners and starches in the rest of the world rose 32 per cent to Pounds 20.8m on a 54 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 513.2m. Bundaberg, the Australian sugar miller acquired in 1991, performed strongly. The board recommended a final dividend of 9.8p making 14.4p for the year, up 11 per cent. Earnings per share were up 13 per cent at 37.1p fully diluted against 32.7p a year earlier, reflecting higher minorities and a tax charge of 27 per cent against 25 per cent. Lex, Page 24</p>

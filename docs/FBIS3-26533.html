			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, Feb 9 (AFP) -- China's ageing  paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, on Wednesday made his first  appearance on television in more than a year, looking frail and  apparently speaking with difficulty. Deng, 89, was filmed at a  Lunar New Year's reception in Shanghai, the television said.  The report of more than four minutes on the national evening  news showed him looking frail, with a somewhat vacant look, and  walking with difficulty, supported all the while by two of his  daughters, Deng Rong and Deng Nan. The presenter, however, said  Deng was "in good health, smiling and walking with a firm step."    The television said Deng spoke to local officials, wishing  them a successful new year and predicting "new victories" for  China. But the report did not give the sound of Deng's voice,  merely reporting his message. The few words he spoke were  apparently pronounced with difficulty. Waving his hands with  apparent difficulty, Deng's emaciated face betrayed no emotion  and he appeared unable to respond directly to the words of local  officials, with his daughters needing to repeat their words  close to his ears. [passage omitted]    Wednesday's news also showed footage of Deng in Shanghai on  December 13 and 31, visiting a new bridge and a new hotel.  Deng's last television appearance was in January last year.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVAL PLAN, PERU INCIDENT STRAIN LATIN TIES, U.S. SAYS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: HEMISPHERE LEADERS ARE ASSURED THAT EVENTS DO NOT SIGNAL INCREASED  AMERICAN AGGRESSIVENESS.  </P> <P> The proposed deployment of Navy warships off Colombia has further strained  inter-American relations and complicated the drug war, the Bush Administration  acknowledged Tuesday.  </P> <P> At the same time, U.S. relations with Peru suffered a strain after U.S. troops  surrounded a Peruvian diplomat's residence in Panama City.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S. officials are  providing assurances to Latin American leaders that the two incidents do not  signal an increased U.S. aggressiveness in the wake of last month's invasion of  Panama.  </P> <P> She said that a team of U.S. representatives will arrive in Colombia on Friday  to participate in planning sessions for a scheduled Western Hemisphere drug  summit on Feb. 15, and it appeared that Colombia, Bolivia and Peru still would  participate as planned.  </P> <P> The government of Peru said Tuesday that it has granted diplomatic asylum to  five Panamanian army officers and seven family members and has officially  protested the posting of U.S. troops near the home of Peru's ambassador to  Panama.  </P> <P> U.S. authorities ordered the posting of 10 U.S. soldiers there Monday after  receiving information that Lt. Col. Luis Cordoba, a police chief under deposed  Panamanian dictator Manual A. Noriega, had taken refuge in the residence.  Peruvian officials deny Cordoba is there.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources said Peru has asked Panama to provide safe conduct for the  12 asylum seekers, who sought refuge in the ambassador's house after Noriega  was ousted in the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> The five officers include senior military aides to the deposed strongman and  Noriega's personal secretary. Panama's Foreign Minister Julio Linares said they  will be granted safe passage if no criminal charges are pending.  </P> <P> U.S. officials, meanwhile, said their plans to deploy two naval vessels on  drug-fighting duty off Colombia have been placed on hold and will not be  pursued without the concurrence of the Bogota government.  </P> <P> Administration officials had said the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the  nuclear-powered cruiser Virginia left Norfolk, Va., last Thursday headed for  international waters off Colombia on an assignment to monitor and intercept  drug shipments.  </P> <P> But disclosure of the deployment plans caused a furor in Colombia, where the  action was characterized as an American "blockade," and the U.S. government  said the two ships instead will be conducting "routine operations" off Florida.  </P> <P> Tutwiler acknowledged that the incident at the Peruvian residence in Panama and  the aborted deployment of the two ships had further strained already tense  relations with Latin American leaders who objected to the U.S. invasion of  Panama.  </P> <P> But she rejected suggestions that the Peruvian and Colombian concerns have  become major problems, saying only that they had "complicated" diplomatic  consultations.  </P> <P> "All of our ambassadors who are on the ground, all our political officers, all  our embassy personnel, (Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America) Bernie  Aronson and all our staff here, sure, they're working in this region to assure  them," she said.  </P> <P> Tutwiler repeated President Bush's statement that the Panamanian invasion was  not a pattern for future U.S. action in the region.  </P> <P> Even so, she refused to rule out the use of warships in the U.S. campaign  against international drug trafficking. She said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  has not yet recommended to the President a final plan of action for Colombia.  </P> <P> Tutwiler blamed the Colombian concerns on "misinformation" about U.S. plans to  use warships to intercept drug traffickers off the coast of that country, the  source of much of the world's cocaine supply.  </P> <P> Planning sessions for the drug summit begin today in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with  meetings of Bolivian, Peruvian and Colombian delegates. U.S. representatives  will join the discussions Friday. The four-nation summit will be held next  month in Cartagena, Colombia.  </P></p>

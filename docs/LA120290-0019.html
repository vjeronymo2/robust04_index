			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: KID 'N PLAY GROW UP  </P> <P> New Line Cinema also has "House Party II" in pre-production, aiming for a late  winter start, and this time out, those two teen-age cut-ups -- the rap duo Kid  'n Play -- have to grow up.  </P> <P> The sequel "will be a bigger film in every way," says Janet Grillo, New Line's  executive on the "under $5-million" production.  </P> <P> "The themes will be more mature, but it will still be an entertaining caper  comedy."  </P> <P> Kid, the central character, will leave his black neighborhood and head for  college, where he will encounter "a whole new world" -- including new styles of  racism. His father -- played by the late Robin Harris in "I" -- will have died,  and Kid will "take on issues of manhood" as he tries to fulfill his father's  hopes.  </P> <P> Actor-comic-playwright Rusty Cundieff wrote the script for the sequel; video  and stage director Paris Barclay will direct. (Both are black.) The original  film's creators, brothers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin, have moved on to a  three-picture deal at Columbia but will serve as executive producers on the  sequel.  </P> <P> "House Party," shot for $2.5 million, grossed about $26 million in North  America earlier this year. Although New Line hoped to reach a white audience  with the picture, Grillo says ticket buyers were "almost exclusively inner-city  black teen-agers."  </P> <P> With its collegiate backdrop, she feels, "II" may have "more crossover  potential."

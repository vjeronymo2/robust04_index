In their resignation  letters, the officers said they rejected a new escalation of war  in the south and a government plan to send a military expedition  to the south comprising nationalist officers who are not  affiliated with the National Islamic Front. The plan is seen as  a government attempt to liquidate these officers in war.    The "Brothers" learned that the commander in chief has not  yet replied to the resignations, both because the Army needs the  officers' expertise and because there is no cash to pay the  allowance to which they would be entitled.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Biffen sees EU 'evil' A European constitution is an impending and evil political reality which seeks to hijack partnership among nations and turn it into a tightly knit political and economic bloc, Mr John Biffen, the former Conservative cabinet minister, warns in The European Journal, the Euro-sceptic monthly, David Owen writes. Mr Biffen says such a constitution would be preventable 'only if the most vigilant arguments' were continually deployed. 'The determined search for a centralised Europe, with a constitution that further erases national government, is no longer an idealistic search for the holy grail of peace and co-operation. It is a contest about power and pay-off.' Mr Bill Cash, the Euro-sceptic Conservative MP, presses the case for a new referendum on Europe. He says 16m of the present UK electorate did not take part in the 1975 referendum on membership and a new referendum would not be inconsistent with constitutional practice.</p>

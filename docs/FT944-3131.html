			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Trafalgar House considers bid for Northern Electric: Regional power shares jump 5 per cent The first hostile bid for a privatised UK utility loomed yesterday after Trafalgar House, the engineering and property conglomerate, announced it was considering making an offer for Northern Electric. Trafalgar House disclosed its potential bid after intervention from the Takeover Panel following a substantial rise in Northern's share price during the past few days. Shares in Northern, which is based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, rose 100p to 1010p, valuing the company at Pounds 1.25bn. Trafalgar House, the world's fourth-largest engineering and construction contractor, owns the Cunard shipping line and a large property portfolio. Earlier plans by Trafalgar to bid today appeared to have been shelved. Trafalgar was said to be considering its position, although an attempted takeover still seems likely in the near future. Some observers believe that Trafalgar House's emergence as a predator makes restructuring in the sector inevitable, with companies seeking mergers to avoid an unwelcome bid. Shares in all 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales rose an average 5 per cent as investors considered the possibility of Trafalgar House's announcement flushing out other prospective bidders. At yesterday's close the regional electricity companies were valued at Pounds 17.1bn. Any attempted takeover will be politically contentious. The Labour party is likely to say the regional companies are attractive to buyers because they operate under a slack regulatory regime. The government owns a golden share in each of the 12 companies, which prevents any bidder from buying more than 15 per cent of a regional supplier's shares. However, the golden share expires at the end of March and some analysts believe the government may be persuaded to allow a bid before then. Northern is likely to resist a Trafalgar House bid, which its executives believe is motivated by a desire to gain access to Northern's potential cash pile. The company said it had received no proposals from Trafalgar and advised shareholders to take no action. Some electricity analysts were puzzled by Trafalgar's motives. 'There is no synergy apart from finances,' said one. Some Trafalgar shareholders also expressed doubts about the move, arguing that it had more to do with the strategic interests of Hongkong Land, which owns 25 per cent of the shares, than with the interests of Trafalgar. Hongkong Land is a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong conglomerate which is trying to reduce its dependence on the colony before the hand-over to China in 1997. By funding the acquisition of Northern Electric, Jardine would channel Hong Kong cash into a UK business, which would provide reliable profits. Hongkong Land has effective control of Trafalgar after engineering its financial rescue over the past two years. Trafalgar's shares rose 1p yesterday to close at 72p.

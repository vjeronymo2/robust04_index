			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK composites Sun Alliance will be mightily relieved to have got rid of most of its 13 per cent holding in Commercial Union at a small profit yesterday, not least after bungling its first attempt at a bought deal earlier in the week. To be fair to Sun the CU share price has outperformed the market by 23 per cent since the day in August 1989 when it first picked up the loose stake. As the company is all too painfully aware, however, this was no ordinary portfolio investment. Sun's ambition was to protect the UK insurance industry from foreign predators anxious to build a UK presence ahead of the single European market. But the widespread expectation was that it would not stop there. In the event CU's relatively young management team was not prepared to countenance a merger on friendly terms, and a hostile bid was never on the cards. More pertinently, Sun's once legendary financial strength has been sapped by huge losses on its mortgage indemnity account, a nightmare which will overshadow its results until the mid 1990s. CU shareholders are doubtless relieved that they have not had to shoulder the burden of this black hole, though one can argue that a combined Sun Alliance/CU would have gone some way to sorting out the UK insurance sector's overcapacity. Further rationalisation is inevitable, but it will happen more slowly and less visibly than might have been the case. The late 1980s enthusiasm for cross border alliances - once touted as the biggest spur to greater efficiency - has been badly dented by bad experience and a poor operating environment. Forthcoming interim results from the French insurers are likely to demonstrate that it is not just Sun Alliance which has to concentrate on putting its own house in order.</p>

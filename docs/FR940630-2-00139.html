(``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

The text of the proposed rule is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Additions italicized. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Article XXXIV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 17 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interpretations and Policies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .01 Utilization of Exempt Credit. Exchange Members registered as equity market makers are members registered as specialists for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as such are entitled to obtain exempt credit for financing their market maker transactions. Members and/or prospective members who are anticipating becoming registered as equity market makers as well as those clearing firms who are or will be carrying the accounts of market makers should be aware of the following interpretation relative to the use of such credit: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Only those transactions initiated on the Exchange Floor qualify as market transactions. This restriction prohibits the use of exempt credit where market maker orders are routed to the Floor from locations off the Floor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Fifty per cent (50%) of the quarterly share volume which creates or increases a position in a market maker account must result from transactions  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> which are either <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  consummated on the Exchange  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or sent from the Exchange Floor for execution in another market via ITS <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Only those positions which have been established as a direct result of bona fide equity market maker activity qualify for exempt credit treatment. This restriction precludes exempt credit financing based on an equity market maker registration for positions resulting from options exercises and assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change relates to the utilization of exempt credit by market makers. Under current rules, in order for a market maker to obtain exempt credit for the financing of its market maker transactions, fifty percent (50%) of the quarterly share volume in its market maker account must result from transactions consummated on the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change would amend this interpretation and policy under the Exchange's rules so that the fifty percent (50%) volume test also would include orders that, although initiated on the Exchange Floor, are sent to another market for execution via the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS''). The Exchange believes that when a market maker initiates an order on the Exchange Floor and clears the post, the market maker should not be penalized when there is no order against which it can be executed or when the specialist does not accept the order for placement in his book. As a result, if a market maker clears the post, sends the order to another market via ITS and the order is executed, under the proposed rules, that transaction would count towards the fifty percent (50%) quarterly share volume requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments where solicited or received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consent, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing.

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / People: Consumers' champion to leave her Shelter Continued turbulence at the Consumers' Association is guaranteed with the appointment of Sheila McKechnie, currently head of the housing charity Shelter, to the director's post at CA. McKechnie, 46, will take over in January from John Beishon, who retires at the end of the year after a controversial eight years in the post. Beishon's abrasive style has not endeared him to many of the staff at the organisation which publishes the consumer bible, Which? magazine. Hostilities came to a head recently when union members at the association went on strike over pay. Insiders who had hoped, after Beishon's departure, for a return to the more gentlemanly old ways will be disappointed. McKechnie, a forthright and energetic Scot, has not been known to sidestep confrontation during her 10 years at Shelter. It is just as well that CA is going to be kept on its toes; the number of subscriptions to Which?, the organisation's main source of income, has plunged to about 600,000 from a peak of nearly a million in the mid-1980s. McKechnie is widely credited in the voluntary sector with having re-established Shelter's role, bringing it back into the limelight after a period of languishing in obscurity. Her job now will be to update Consumers' Association's appeal to today's increasingly sophisticated consumers.</p>

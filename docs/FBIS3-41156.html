			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A high-ranking officer at the Santa Lucia police  base has reported that a group of peasant patrols located in  Peru's coca-producing regions is offering protection to drug  traffickers operating in these areas, in exchange for large sums  of money.    The police officer, who asked not to be identified, added  that in view of this it is very likely that the peasant patrol  members will refuse to hand over the guns that were supplied to  them by the government to protect their towns against terrorists.    He said that the Peasant Patrols have cooperated actively in  the pacification of the country, and that through their active  presence Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary  Movement] lost a great deal of their prevalence.    He said that, unfortunately, the strong economic incentive  offered by drug traffickers for looking after coca farms allows  the peasant patrols to improve their standards of living, while  no alternative development programs have been promoted for  cultivating other products instead of coca.    Moreover, intelligence service reports state that there are  bad armed forces and police officers detached in the area who  are also offering protection to drug traffickers in exchange for  money.    The staff at the Santa Lucia base, which was built with the  DEA's support to combat drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga  region, is already aware of the situation.    As an example of these charges, the police officer said that  the peasant patrols in Palmapampa, in La Mar Province, Ayacucho  Department, "do not allow the police to enter the area, and  openly support drug traffickers."</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Foschini advances 25% to R103m FOSCHINI, the South African clothing and jewellery retail group, overcame a difficult trading environment last year to record a 25 per cent increase in net attributable income to R103.3m (Dollars 32.4m). Turnover rose 19 per cent to R1.16bn for the year ended March. Operating profit was 20.6 per cent higher at R225m. Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 232 cents. Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman, said it was difficult to predict a sustained economic upturn, but said Foschini was confident of 'an improved result' in the year ahead. He said the results reflected 'our spread of stores, effective preparation in anticipation of a difficult year, and a commitment to managing costs, enhanced systems, and sharpened focus on product range'. Foschini had invested more in the centralisation of group credit operations, and in strategic systems development, Mr Lewis said. With new stores opened during the year, and an accelerated refurbishing programme, the group expanded by 20 to 713 stores. Foschini has four principle operating divisions - Foschini, American Swiss, Markhams, and Pages - which together retail clothing, jewellery and accessories to the middle-income market. The company also holds an effective controlling investment in Oceana Investment Corporation, which has a 36.4 per cent interest in UK fashion retailer, Etam. The company is paying a final dividend of R63.4m, making a total payout for the year of R102m. This is to be satisfied by the issue of new shares, in the proportion of one for 41 held. Profits for the year were helped by lower interest charges but had to take account of reduced income from associates.</p>

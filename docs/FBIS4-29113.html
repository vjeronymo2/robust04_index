			<p>Yamagishi   <F P=102>   OW1406134294 </F> <F P=103> OW1406134294 </F> <F P=104></F>    BFN     [Text] According to Yamagishi, when former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation on the night of 8  April, Uchida and Washio one after the next asked Yamagishi over  the phone to have a meeting with Ozawa. Four days later, on 12  April, Ito met with Yamagishi in person and urged him to meet  with Ozawa.    Uchida says: "I often told Yamagishi that 'it is about time  to meet with Ozawa.' Yamagishi must have had a feeling that 'it  is that guy who canceled the meeting, though he is a mere  stripling.'"    About that time, the Ozawa side seemed to have a motive to  arrange a meeting between the two men in order to prevent the  move toward "a union between the LDP and the SDPJ, because it  was thought that that union could be effected only through the  mediation of Yamagishi, if it was to be effected at all. The  circles close to Ozawa asked for Ito's cooperation by  whispering: "We have positive evidence that Yamagishi is  working for a union between the LDP and the SDPJ."    Ito explains the situation: "Ozawa asked me to arrange a  meeting with Yamagishi because he had something to explain.  Ozawa wanted to know if he could obtain a promise that the tax  problem could be solved within the year in policy discussion  with the SDPJ."    At the meeting of Yamagishi and Ito on 12 April, it was  decided after all that "now is not the time for a meeting  between Ozawa and Yamagishi." Three days later, on 15 April,  Ito met with Yamagishi again, and after saying that "he will  meet with Ozawa tomorrow," he had a meeting with Ozawa at All  Nippon Airline's hotel in Tokyo on the following day, 16 April.  The exact contents of the meeting are not known, but it seems  that a discussion was held concerning the evaluation of the  LDP's Michio Watanabe, the former deputy prime minister and  foreign minister.    Incidentally, Washio, another mediator, is said to be the  leader of the next generation in Rengo as well as a strong rival  of Yamagishi. Moreover, Washio has close ties to Ozawa and is a  positive advocate of political alignment.    Yamagishi is a born member of the SDPJ and has a deep  feeling  toward the SDPJ, while Washio's generation, which is twelve  years younger than Yamagishi's, is gradually losing nostalgia  for the SDPJ. The Japanese Federation of Iron and Steel  Workers' Unions, of which Washio is chairman, conducted in the  last year's general election "selective recommendation" in order  to exclude SDPJ left- wing members from recommendation, and  recommended, instead, five candidates from Shinseito.    When Ozawa asked for additional assistance, Washio gave him  a  forward-looking answer: "I will ask some of our locals to give  their cooperation to Shinseito's candidates."    It is no wonder that Washio's and Ito's action as  intermediaries for arranging a meeting between Yamagishi and  Ozawa seemed to Yamagishi as Ozawa's intervention in Rengo.  That is what Yamagishi means by "divide and rule."    Yamagishi explains the reason for his refusal to meet with  Ozawa: "I am conducting legitimate self-defense against a  surprise attack aimed at inducing the breakup of the SDPJ and at  luring some of the right-wing members of the party. Moreover,  if the cheerleader of the SDPJ meets with Ozawa, that will incur  distrust."    However, he is very shrewd because he conveyed an unofficial  message to the Ozawa side at the same time: "I am not saying  that I will not meet with Ozawa." Yamagishi has not discarded  "the Ozawa card," and Diet upper house member Sadao Hirano, a  close aid to Ozawa, holds the view that the relationship between  the two men is not thoroughly estranged. Hirano says: "The two  men are fully aware of each other's political power. However,  to think of the labor union is one thing, to think of Japan is  another. When Ozawa had to make a decision under the  restriction of time, that may have appeared too hasty to  Yamagishi."

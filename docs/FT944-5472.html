			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Korea likely to approve Samsung car project The South Korean government is set to approve Samsung's project to become the country's fifth car manufacturer. The company plans to start production in 1998, with an initial annual capacity of 50,000 cars increasing to 500,000 by 2002. However, Mr Park Un-so, the vice-minister for trade, industry and energy, said yesterday the government was likely to approve Samsung's application to import car technology from Nissan of Japan after Samsung promised to take measures to avoid disrupting the Korean car industry. The application is expected to be submitted next week, Korea's car companies have opposed Samsung's plans, arguing that it would lead to excessive competition and weaken the industry, which is rapidly expanding production capacity to become the world's fourth biggest vehicle manufacturer. The government shared those doubts and tried to discourage Samsung, Korea's second largest industrial group, from proceeding with its Dollars 5bn project. Samsung will recruit engineers from abroad and source most car components from within the group, which would reduce competition with other Korean carmakers for these resources. It promised that most of its output would be for export, to avoid affecting the domestic sales of the other carmakers, which rely heavily on the local market. Samsung has lobbied the government intensely for the past year to approve the project, which it regards as vital to its ambitions of developing its heavy machinery operations to match the success of its electronics business. Although Samsung will be much smaller than the other Korean carmakers, it plans to focus on the upper end of the market by producing three models of 2,000cc cars based on Nissan technology. In what is regarded as an astute political move, Samsung will locate its car plant in the south-eastern port of Pusan, the home town of South Korean President Kim Young-sam. Pusan has recently suffered job losses due to the decline of its textile and footwear industries.</p>

The figures show that around a quarter of current HIV  infections are heterosexually caused, although the vast majority  of these have been through contacts with high-risk partners,  people overseas, or from people from other countries living in  Britain. However, there is a small but growing number of people  infected in this country who had partners in no high-risk  categories.    The report by Professor Nicholas Day of Cambridge  University,  for the Public Health Laboratory Service, has looked at the  likely level of AIDS cases up to 1997, and current levels of HIV  infections. Taking all risk groups into account, the forecast is  that there will [be] around 2,400 new AIDS cases a year by 1997  in England and Wales, compared with some 1,600 from the whole UK  over the past 12 months.    The 1997 figures predict 1,350 AIDS cases among gay men, 165  among injecting drug users, and 770 among heterosexuals. Each  year between now and 1997, around 85 haemophiliacs infected with  contaminated blood products will develop AIDS.    After 1997 AIDS figures are expected to fall, reflecting  behaviour changes in the mid-1980's by gay men and to a lesser  degree injecting drug users.    AIDS cases among gay men may peak this year or next year,  says the report, but this depends on continued safe sex  behaviour, and there are signs that in younger gay men this is  not happening. The unknown factor is how fast heterosexual cases  will increase.    "Whereas AIDS incidence in homosexual males may peak in 1993  and 1994, the incidence in those exposed heterosexually is  expected to increase steadily."    Estimates of those with HIV now, as opposed to those known  to  be infected because they have come forward for testing, puts the  probable figure for England and Wales at about 27,200, although  Professor Day said yesterday he inclined to a figure of around  24,000.    The report says that of these 27,180 infections, homosexual  exposure accounts for 14,890 cases, injecting drug use 4,450,  heterosexual exposure 6,340, and blood products 1,500. The  current total number of known HIV infections is 19,524.    Researchers have looked at all the known heterosexual cases  of AIDS and HIV between 1982 and 1992. They say that of the  total 2,237 infections, 73 percent were probably exposed abroad,  and 13 percent had a high-risk partner.    However, there have been 117 cases of people infected within  the UK with no known high risks. The researchers have looked in  detail at 30 of these.    The report states: "Although half had previously contracted  another sexually transmitted infection, the sexual lifestyle of  these 30 cases was otherwise unremarkable.    "Their median number of sexual partners in the previous five  years was three, 23 had never practised anal intercourse, and  only one had ever paid for sex."    At a press conference yesterday, Professor Day said the  number of low-risk heterosexual infections was still small, but  all epidemics began with small numbers and stemmed outwards from  high-risk groups.    He added: "The heterosexual community has to be infected  from  somewhere and initially it gets infected by the groups who are  themselves infected. Once it's in the heterosexual community,  infection is going to accelerate."    Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, warned that the  predictions of a falling number of AIDS cases did not mean the  threat was over. There were no grounds for complacency.

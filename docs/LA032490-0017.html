			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> TOKYO MARKET'S ADVANCE HELPS DOW RISE 8.56  </P> <P> The stock market scored a modest gain Friday, helped by an overnight rise in  the Tokyo stock market but pressured by fears of higher U.S. interest rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks gained 8.56 points to close at  2,704.28, after a steep 32.21-point loss Thursday.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached a modest 132 million shares,  compared to 175.9 million Thursday.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones in nationwide trading of New York  Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 884 up, 571 down and 527 unchanged.  </P> <P> "We did see some decent buying this morning," said Tom Callahan at Yamaichi  International. "Psychology is recovering; maybe the worst of the blood bath is  over."  </P> <P> Friday's move was not nearly strong enough to offset the massive selling  pressure that left the Dow index down 36.94 points for the week.  </P> <P> Still, the market tried to stage a comeback. New York traders picked up the  trend in Tokyo, where the badly battered market rebounded Friday from a sharp  loss. The key Nikkei 225-share index rose 528.82 points, or 1.77%, to 30,372.16  after a 3.13% fall Thursday.  </P> <P> The market also got a boost from the Commerce Department's report of a modest  3.3% rise in February orders for durable goods after a record fall in January.  </P> <P> The market, however, sagged quickly following a news report from Japan that the  Japanese government may issue dollar-denominated bonds in an effort to support  the sagging yen, raising fears that the bond market may be flooded with a new  supply of issues that would lower prices and lift interest rates on bonds. High  interest rates could also pressure stocks.  </P> <P> IBM was down 1 1/2 at 105. A newspaper report said the computer giant has told  customers it won't deliver an upgrade to its line of mainframe computers this  year.  </P> <P> Stock prices also closed sharply higher on London's Stock Exchange, propelled  by a burst of buying when a new two-week trading account opened. The Financial  Times 100-share index was up 25 points, or 1.1%, at 2,283.9 at the close.  </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Rise on Economic Signs  </P> <P> Bond prices posted small gains after a volatile session during which prices  climbed on new signs of economic weakness and fell on worries that the Japanese  may start issuing dollar-denominated securities.  </P> <P> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point, or about $1.25 per $1,000  in face value. Its yield slipped to 8.47% from 8.48% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Analysts said bond prices initially rose after the government released its  durable goods report.  </P> <P> The 30-year bond rose more than 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 in face  value, on that news.  </P> <P> But Wood said prices lost ground after the news report that the Japanese  government may be considering issuing dollar-denominated securities.  </P> <P> The report raised fears that the market would be unable to absorb the extra  bond supply.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from Thursday.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Goes Higher Except Against Yen  </P> <P> The dollar was mostly higher in domestic and foreign trading but fell sharply  against the yen as investors regained some confidence in the Japanese currency.  </P> <P> Analysts said a rise in interest rates in Japan and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's  recovery following a string of steep losses helped support the yen, which  itself has fallen sharply in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc., said traders  believed that Japanese yields would go even higher, which would make the yen  even more attractive.  </P> <P> The dollar fell to 154.30 yen in New York from 155.095 late Thursday. In Tokyo  early Friday, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a closing 155.07 yen, and in London,  it was quoted at a sharply lower rate of 153.85 yen.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Gold Futures Fall in Heavy Selling  </P> <P> Gold futures prices tumbled to 4 1/2-month lows Friday on New York's Commodity  Exchange amid heavy European selling as the dollar resumed its advance against  most other major currencies.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, silver also retreated; grains and soybeans fell;  energy future advanced, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Gold futures settled $5.30 to $5.60 lower, with the contract for delivery in  April at $389.40 an ounce, the lowest settlement for a near-month gold contract  since Nov. 10.  </P> <P> Silver futures ended 4.1 to 4.7 cents lower in New York, with March at $5.043  an ounce.  </P> <P> Analysts said buying interest in gold has faded as prices have skidded from  near $430 an ounce over the past six weeks. April gold fell by $11.50 in this  week alone.  </P> <P> Gold is traded in dollars on the world market, so a stronger dollar makes the  metal more expensive in terms of other currencies, discouraging foreign buying.  </P> <P> But analysts said gold's decline in the face of global political and economic  uncertainty suggests other factors are also at play.  </P></p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Shepherd Neame expands 10% to over Pounds 4m Shepherd Neame, the independent Kent brewer, raised pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 4.06m in the year ended June 27, 1992, on turnover 14 per cent higher at Pounds 35.82m. Operating profits climbed 20 per cent to Pounds 6.22m indicating the economies of scale from supplying an enlarged pub estate. Finance charges were up 27 per cent at Pounds 2.18m. Mr Robert Neame said the increase had been achieved despite the company trading almost exclusively in the south east, where the recession had been most severe. The Faversham-based company had leased 58 pubs from Whitbread, which offered the opportunity of increasing volume throughput without further capital outlay. Together with the purchase of other pub packages from Bass and Courage the previous year, this took the Shepherd Neame pub estate to 372.</p>

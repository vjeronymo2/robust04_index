Islamic Writer Raps TV Ban on Islamic Announcers  <H5>  CORRUPTION AND FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY </H5>   In its 15 February edition, Cairo AL-SHA'B, the mouthpiece  of  the opposition Labor Party, features articles and commentaries  on corruption in Egypt. In an approximately 2,500-word article  on pages 1 and 2, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn notes that  although everyone in Egypt is aware that corruption is rife, the  "clique of rulers and those who are up to their ears in  corruption" denies it. He says that at a time when every case of  corruption is hushed up, a decision is made to try "the symbol  of honor and patriotism, Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri."  The rulers cover up corruption cases and put pressure on the  official newspapers not to report on corruption, he says and  highlights the recent accusations of corruption exchanged  between two former interior ministers, noting that they were  involved in private business during their terms in office in  violation of the Constitution. He notes that Islamic  jurisprudence, which some people believe to be backward, bans  public figures form engaging in private business. He stresses  that both ministers were in Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's  cabinet and so Sidqi is "inescapably responsible" for their  misconduct. He notes that THE WASHINGTON POST, London's THE  GUARDIAN, and THE TIMES of London report on corruption in Egypt  but it seems that Sidqi does not read these papers. The author  stresses that the free press will continue to uncover cases of  corruption and will struggle until "real democracy" is  established "in which no one is above the law."  <H5>  WRITER ON GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION </H5>   In a 700-word article on page 2 entitled "Corruption and  Lies  in the Government," Jamal As'ad claims that corruption in Egypt  is "rife and exceeds bounds." He maintains that the prime  minister's statement that the government does not ignore  corruption is untrue and that anyone who tries to belittle  corruption cases is "an accomplice and colluding." He notes  that attempts by senior writers to cover up corruption cases are  not in Egypt's interests. He says that there is political,  economic, administrative, moral, artistic, and cultural  corruption in Egypt. He contends that the People's Assembly is  "restricted by constitutional clauses" and cannot withdraw  confidence from any Cabinet minister because this requires the  president's approval. As'ad notes the recent campaign of  defamation between two former interior ministers, who were  supposed to combat corruption, saying that both have been found  to have made money through corruption. He wonders why their  file has been closed and why they and the prime minister have  not been called to account.  <H3>  OPPOSITION LEADER ON CORRUPTION, DIALOGUE, ANTI-ISLAM  CAMPAIGN </H3>   In an approximately 1,500-word report on page 1 and 4 on  Labor Party leader Shukri and Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad  al-Sharif's "Ramadan tours" of Egyptian governorates, Jamal  Imbabi cites Shukri as telling a seminar in al-Mansurah that the  party "insists on resisting corruption despite the pressure."  Shukri says successive interrogations of the Labor Party  leaders and AL-SHA'B correspondents will "not intimidate us."  He notes that the government is still postponing the national  dialogue with the opposition and says the Labor Party called for  "guarantees to render the dialogue successful." He calls for  enacting a new constitution. Shukri warns of "the Muslims'  slumber in confronting the Western onslaught to destroy Islam"  and warns against "a scheme to 'disunite the Muslims and  Copts,'" noting Islam's sound stance on the Copts, which  maintains that they "have the same rights and duties as  Muslims." Shukri said that following the Cold War, the West  sees only Islam as "the new enemy that must be destroyed." He  says that in America, the leader of the Western camp, there are  those who warn of the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet  Union and they all fear the Islamic revival.    Preacher Muhammad al-Sharif pointed to the dispute between  the two former interior ministers, saying that the corrupt  establishments are fighting one another. He said that every day  that passes paves the road for change and salvation so that  those who will rule by God's shari'ah will take over.    in a 400-word article on page 7, Muhammad al-Murshidi  suggests that when the government proposed a national dialogue  with the opposition parties, some opposition leaders believed it  would be a futile political maneuver to divert the public's  attention. Others believed that the rulers might have returned  to their senses and realized the serious security, political,  and economic situations. The writer notes that the government  then repeatedly postponed the date, casting doubts on its  seriousness about it. The writer notes that Prime Minister  Sidqi claims he does not cover up corruption, yet he sent  several AL-SHA'B writers for interrogation just because they  revealed one aspect of corruption. He says King Husayn of  Jordan permitted honest elections that allowed fair  representation of the opposition. The writer goes on: The  Algerian leaders realized their serious mistake when they  finished off the democratic experience and realized that the  only way to emerge form the crisis is to hold a dialogue with  the opposition and the Islamic Salvation Front. We thought, he  says, that the Egyptian rulers might learn this lesson. But, he  stresses, we were surprised to hear President Mubarak say that  what happened in Jordan and Algeria will not happen in Egypt.  What is the use of the dialogue with the government, the writer  wonders.   <H5>    PRAYERS FOR BOSNIANS </H5>   In a 100-word report on page 1, Khalid Yunis notes that tens  of thousands of people performed prayers at al-Azhar Mosque in  Cairo last Friday over the souls of the Bosnian martyrs killed  in the criminal bombardment of Sarajevo. The report notes that  the awqaf minister agreed on the prayers for the martyrs in the  mosques that belong to the Awqaf Ministry. In his Friday  sermon, Shaykh Isma'il Sadiq al-'Adawi stressed the significance  of jihad and willpower for the Islamic nation during Ramadan,  stressing that the continuation of the Muslims' tragedy in  Bosnia is due to the international community's "defeatism and  collusion" and to the failure of the regional, Arab, and Islamic  organizations to do their duty.  <H5>  ISLAMIC WRITER ON SIGNIFICANCE OF RAMADAN </H5>   In a 1,700-word article on page 5, Islamic writer Mustafa  Mashur welcomes the advent of Ramadan and elaborates on the  values it signifies for the Muslims. He urges Muslims to unite,  saying that divisions among Muslims made them victims of the  enemies of Islam in various parts of the world. He urges  Muslims to exert serious efforts and to rally in support of  Muslim brothers and sisters who are exposed to genocide,  blockades, starvation, and displacement in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Palestine, Kashmir, and elsewhere.  <H5>  SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI DEPLORES THE AFGHAN WAR </H5>   In a 300-word article by famous Islamic preacher Shaykh  Muhammad al-Ghazali, he assails those who seek personal  interests and those who don the garb of Islam although they are  not true Muslims. He cites examples of those Afghan leaders  who, after their struggle and victory over the communists, have  become embroiled in a power struggle that has devastated their  country and displaced their people. He says he is distressed  when he hears about fighting for booty in Afghanistan. He  stresses that these leaders have "distorted and defamed Islam."  <H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN AGRONOMISTS SYNDICATE ELECTIONS </H5>   A 50-word report on page 1 notes that the Islamic trend  representatives won the agronomists syndicate elections in Cairo  and al-Jizah for the first time, despite rigging and pressure by  the government organs to prevent the Labor Party member from  winning.  <H5>  IMPROVING TIES WITH ISRAEL </H5>   In an approximately 3,000-word article on page 5, Dr.  Muhammad Hilmi Murad discusses Egyptian Government newspapers'  reports intended to prepare public opinion to welcome joint  projects with Israel even before a comprehensive peace is  reached in the region. He notes AL-AKHBAR chief editor's article  calling for warming up peace and promoting ties with Israel. He  notes AL-AHRAM chief editor's call for establishing gas pipes to  Israel and even to supplying Nile water to Gaza, the West Bank,  and Israel. Murad argues that it is important to study the  effects of the Israeli projects and the "conditions outlined to  control our national economy." He says that the government  newspapers skip over these issues to pave the way for what the  United States and the Western countries are trying "to impose on  us to enable Israel to dominate the economic cartel designed for  the Middle East" and to eliminate any attempt to establish  Arab-Islamic economic unity. He notes that Israel has not given  up its motto of a greater Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates  and has not agreed to give up its nuclear weapons. He wonders if  anyone can imagine a spirit of cooperation, accord, and peace  prevailing between a country in possession of nuclear weapons  and others that have only conventional weapons. He argues  against accepting joint projects in Sinai because it is  "demilitarized in favor of Israel."    Mustafa Bakri is the author of an approximately 1,000  word-article on page 8. He criticizes Agriculture Minister Dr.  Yusuf Wali's statement before the People's Assembly in which he  praised the benefits gained from agricultural cooperation with  Israel. He says that Wali shows disdain for the people's  feelings when he says that the peace agreement signed between  Israel and Egypt in 1978 brought about numerous benefits and  introduced the use of Israeli technology and expertise into  Egypt. He contends that cooperation "serves the Israeli and not  the Egyptian economy." He notes that Israel lacks capital and  that its "lifeline lies in opening up Arab markets before it."  He says that Israel enters Egypt and the region "not to  contribute to its development but to control its resources and  bolster its economy." He contends that the Israeli plan to link  the Red Sea to the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea to the  Mediterranean is aimed at "eliminating the strategic importance  of the Suez Canal." He exhorts citizens that their support of  the Zionist treasury means that they antagonize their homeland,  interests, and religion," which urges struggle against enemies.  <H5>  ISLAMIC COLUMNIST RAPS TV BAN ON ISLAMIC ANNOUNCERS </H5>   In his regular column, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus, noted Muslim  Brotherhood writer, features a 500-word article on page 12 in  which he assails those in charge of the Cairo Radio and  Television, saying that their thinking "runs counter" to Islam  and freedom. He says that they ban female announcers who wear  the head covering. He wonders how Egypt can claim to be an  Islamic country when it bans an announcer wearing a head  covering. He says that the government's ban on the Radio and  Television employees' establishing a union to defend their  interests runs counter to freedom and Islam, noting that this is  a "totalitarian mentality" and indicates "absolute rule." He  argues that the Egyptian man in the street resents the  television reports glorifying the ruler, noting that the people  cannot forget the uproar that accompanied the nomination of  President Mubarak as the only candidate for the presidential  elections. He notes that Egyptian television is a master at  twisting reality and turning it upside down.</p>

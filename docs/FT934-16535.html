			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Fishermen offer plan to replace time curbs FISHERMEN in England and Wales yesterday proposed measures aimed at persuading the government to abandon its controversial limits on the number of days trawlers can spend at sea. The measures did not include a proposal put forward last week by representatives of Scotland's 8,000 fishermen that the government should temporarily abandon the EC system of quotas on the type and quantity of their catch. The government has opted to restrict time at sea from next January as part of its effort to comply with EC rules by cutting the capacity of the UK fleet by 19 per cent by 1996. Mr Barrie Deas, secretary of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, representing 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, said his organisation has put forward some similar alternative proposals to those of the Scottish fishermen, notably on increasing the size of mesh in nets and introducing compulsory square mesh panels which allow young fish to escape. The NFFO, which will seek judicial review of the limits on days at sea on November 1, called for increases in minimum landing sizes for fish and no-fishing zones to protect young and breeding fish.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARABS SEEK TO DEFUSE WHO CRISIS  </P> <P> Arabs seeking to placate Washington have passed word to European and other U.S.  allies that they will not consider abstentions "hostile" when the World Health  Organization votes Tuesday in Geneva on the admission of the Palestine  Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> They argue that abstentions, instead of votes for admission, could soften the  impact of the heavy majority that is expected to favor the PLO's admission,  which has so far been publicly opposed only by the United States and Israel.  </P> <P> Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition that they not be named, said PLO  leader Yasser Arafat was reluctant to confront the Bush Administration over  joining the U.N. health agency because official talks between the United States  and the Palestinians have been under way in Tunis, Tunisia, since late last  year.  </P> <P> But one said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III "pushed us into a  corner" by announcing his opposition to PLO membership in WHO and threatening  to cut off U.S. funding for the agency if the Palestinians are admitted to full  membership.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeals for PLO Retreat  </P> <P> WHO's general director, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, appealed for a PLO retreat  because loss of this year's $73.8-million U.S. assessment, plus another $25  million in back dues, would virtually halt the agency's work. The United States  pays a quarter of the budget of the agency, which finances immunization,  nutrition and other public health programs largely benefiting people in the  Third World, including Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories.  </P> <P> Arab diplomats said the PLO is merely following a path blazed by "national  liberation movements" in the former Portuguese colonies in Africa in the 1970s.  Despite opposition from Western nations, such movements in Angola, Mozambique  and elsewhere declared themselves governments and were admitted to membership  in U.N. agencies with the backing of African, Arab and Soviet Bloc votes.  </P> <P> A simple majority of WHO's membership can raise the Palestinians from observer  to full status, despite the assertion of opponents that the PLO fails to  qualify as a government. There is little doubt that the votes will be  forthcoming, and Arab diplomats meeting with Baker last week urged him to  accept the PLO bid for membership, the sources said. But the secretary remained  obdurate.  </P> <P> "We explained to him that Arafat badly needs some kind of gesture of support  from Washington because he's under heavy attack from Palestinians to his left  and right," an Arab diplomat said. "His critics contend that Arafat has made  all the concessions and Israel has made none in attempting to build a base for  negotiations."  </P> <P> One of the suggestions made to Baker, they said, was the reopening of the PLO  information office in Washington that was closed by congressional order in  1987.  </P> <P> They said that Baker, however, resisted reopening the Washington office as well  as suggestions that he press Israel to adopt a more liberal stance toward the  PLO.  </P></p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Architecture Award: A talent for picking winners over three decades The Financial Times Architecture Award 1993 is the 26th to be made. It began life as the FT Industrial Architecture Award and grew out of a desire to find ways of improving the working environment in the 1960s. Industry and manufacturing then took more conventional forms and the award juries were restricted to looking at the manufacturing process and its visual consequences. Looking back at those early days it is significant to note how successful the juries were in spotting talent. Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Nicholas Grimshaw and Michael Hopkins were all singled out as key developing talents long before they reached their current international fame. This has been a record year with 154 entries - remarkable in a recession. The jury had a new layman - Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of WH Smith and a former chairman of the Design Council. He is known for his interest in architecture and his own developed skills as a patron. The architect members were Nicholas Grimshaw and John Outram. The FT has always tried to ensure that the jury represents all sides of the architectural debate. Grimshaw is a leader of the 'high tech' school and the opening of his Waterloo Channel Tunnel Eurostar Terminal is eagerly awaited. He is also currently engaged in the design of the new Berlin Stock Exchange  -a scheme he won in international competition. Outram has recently won two important architectural competitions - the Judge Management School at the University of Cambridge; and a key new facility for the Rice Campus of the University of Texas. The jury always visits as long a 'short list' of buildings as possible and this year the members were especially impressed by the very high architectural standards. The final shortlist of commended schemes for 1993 was: Stansted Airport by Sir Norman Foster and Partners. Bracken House, City of London, by Michael Hopkins and Partners. Schlumberger Research Centre, Cambridge, by Michael Hopkins and Partners. Cranfield University Library by Sir Norman Foster and Partners. Bedfont Lakes, (IBM, joint venture with MEPC), near Heathrow Airport, by Michael Hopkins and Partners. Chichester Car Park, Avenue de Chartres, Chichester, West Sussex, by Birds Portchmouth and Russum. City Offices in Winchester by Hampshire County Architects. The jury looked for that elusive quality in a winner which shows the hand of the architect in every aspect of the design. But a key realisation every year is that the best new buildings come about through the collaborative efforts of a good client with a talented architect. Such creative partnerships not only produce businesslike new buildings but also provide ones which are aesthetically rewarding.</p>

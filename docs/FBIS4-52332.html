			<p>CSO     [Text] The government held an emergency conference of  cabinet members concerned with economic affairs on the afternoon  of 30 April to discuss its response to the strong yen and  reconfirmed its efforts to promote deregulation and strive for  tax reform. However, policies of this nature have been  reiterated by Prime Minister Hata in the past and the view is  that only minimal restraining effect can be realized thereby in  the future if yen-buying pressure increases in foreign exchange  markets because of the nature of the intervention posture  assumed by U.S. currency authorities. For the time being, the  government will probably seek to stabilize the foreign exchange  markets through market intervention, while emphasizing the early  implementation of interim economic reform such as working for  deregulation and negotiating with the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on the  implementation of tax reform.    After the conference, Economic Planning Agency Director  General Terasawa stressed, "We affirmed the fact that we are  serious about deregulation, because some quarters have taken the  passive attitude that the idea is not feasible." Reportedly, a  conference of administrative vice ministers of the ministries  and agencies will be held on 9 May to confirm work to be done on  deregulation.    After the conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai  stated,  "Positive efforts will be made to negotiate with the SDPJ,  Sakigake [Harbinger] and New Pary Mirai [Future] (which are not  represented in the Hata cabinet) relative to tax reform.  Needless to say, we must also seek the understanding of the LDP."    The cabinet officials stress a positive attitude about both  deregulation and tax reform, but, looking behind the scenes, you  might say that the cabinet's statements are being made with the  knowledge it will be difficult to realize those goals.  Implementation of deregulation was part of the International  Economic Reform Outline prepared in March, but indications are  that the bureaucrats have lost some enthusiasm on the matter  partly because of the unstable political situation.    Difficulties are also seen in making progress on tax reform  because the SDPJ which is negative about raising the consumption  tax has removed itself from the coalition.    The markets have already reflected these developments and  the  yen is in the process of rising, but 30 April did not see  deployment of any form of countermeasure capable of providing  immediate relief.    The government and the Bank of Japan have already solidified  plans to further reinforce market intervention through  yen-selling and dollar-buying to prevent a higher yen. As far as  monetary policy is concerned, no action will be taken in the way  of monetary adjustment such as lowering short-term market rates.  It appears that there is no choice but for efforts by Japan,  Europe, and the United States to collaborate in market  intervention in response to the sharp rise in the yen.</p>

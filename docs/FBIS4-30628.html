			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The national rice production, which is facing a  slight problem due to drought in several areas in Java, was the  topic of discussion that Ibrahim Hassan, state minister for food  affairs and chairman of the National Logistics Agency, gave to  members of parliament's Commission III. Currently, the  nationwide rice stock stands at 850,000 tonnes, while in  previous years, it stood at between 1.4 and 1.5 million tonnes.  However, people are urged not to be alarmed because as many as  650,000 tonnes of rice loaned to several friendly countries will  be returned to Indonesia. The Philippines and Cuba will each  return 200,000 tonnes of rice to us.    Whether we admit it or not, agriculture is a complicated and  fundamental issue for us. While farmers play an important role  in supporting development and national stability, it is not easy  for them to produce food due to the vagaries of nature, such as  pests, long droughts, and floods as well as a limited area of  cultivation.    Some people have even blamed the food-producing subsector as  a source of inefficiency or unemployment demanding our special  attention in our efforts to combat poverty. What is strange is  that the economically weak farmers seem to subsidize the  industrial sector and other members of the society with stronger  economic clout.    In this connection, (Jurgen Habbermash) may be correct when  he said that human interaction based on professional interest  only is basically wrong. He cited the example of Karl Marx, who  failed to understand that human interaction was based on the  need of human beings to communicate; because of this, Marx also  failed to realize his dream, namely, to liberate the oppressed  people.    This being so, it is obvious that the Indonesian  archipelagic  concept and its basic principles should be popularized and  translated into action for the sake of national development  because all development sectors are equally important; all  scientific disciplines have equal potential; and all fields of  work have equal status.    No government of any country in this world dare scrap the  agricultural sector, even if its industrial sector is highly  developed. This shows that agriculture is one of the important  ways to maintain and safeguard the survival of an independent,  united, and sovereign nation among other nations.</p>

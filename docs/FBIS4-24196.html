			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sven Lunsche] </F>   [Text] The government's debt-financing policies are under  the spotlight after the Budget revived fears that SA [South  Africa] is heading toward a debt trap.    Finance Minister Derek Keys received good news from  taxpayers, whose contributions in April and May -- the first two  months of the current fiscal year -- were substantially over  budget. On the other hand he has been confronted with Reserve  Bank criticism that excessive state spending has pushed SA into  a "debt trap", a fact which he vigorously disputes.    Figures released by the Central Statistical Service on  Friday  show that revenues from taxes and customs duties in April and  May at R14.2-billion [rand] to R20.4-billion, leaving a deficit  before borrowing of R6.14-billion (1993: R7.84-billion).    Mr Keys has budgeted for a 10.2 percent rise in spending to  R135.1-billion and a 11.2 percent increase in revenue to R105.8-  billion for the year as a whole.    "While there are some technical factors coming into play,  higher corporate earnings and rising consumer spending should  ensure that the government's revenue targets are easily met this  year," says Mike Brown, economist at stockbrokers Frankel Pollak  Vinderine. He is, however, concerned that the new departments  will not be able to stick to spending targets, which could raise  the deficit above the budgeted R29.3-billion (6.6 percent of  GDP).    Financing the deficit, the R15-billion debt of the former  TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and  R7-billion losses related to gold and foreign exchange reserves  will lift state debt to about R244-billion by February 1995 --  just under 55 percent of projected GDP. In March this year the  debt totalled R192- billion, or 48 percent of GDP, according to  the Reserve Bank's latest Quarterly Bulletin.    The mounting debt burden and the high deficit have already  placed SA in a debt trap, says the Bank's deputy Governor, Jaap  Meijer. Using the rigorous IMF formulation of a debt trap, he  says that the government needs to borrow money to pay the  interest on its debt burden, which 1994/95 will amount to  R24.6-billion.    Interests payments on government debt have risen by 19  percent yearly over the past five years and constitute the  second largest expenditure item in the Budget, after education.    If the proportion of interest payment to total spending  continues to rise, spending on other sectors, such as education,  health and housing, will have to be progressively reduced. "A  continuation of this trend is unsustainable and the government  will have to take corrective measures," Dr Meijer says.    Appearing before Parliament's joint standing committee on  finance on Thursday, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals also  warned that the high deficit, capital outflows and low savings  were placing upward pressure on interest rates.    Dr Ernie van der Merwe, head of the Bank's economic  department, says, however, that government debt has not yet  reached the levels where a further increase cannot be prevented,  either by higher taxes or a decline in spending. "I believe  that Mr Keys' commitment to a restructured tax system and a real  cut in state spending will ensure that we will not be caught in  a debt trap," he says.    Dr van der Merwe also points out that the ratio of public  debt to GDP at 54 percent is not excessive in international  terms. The European Union had prescribed a ratio of 60 percent  in the Maastricht treaty.    Mr Keys dismisses fears of a debt trap. In an interview this  week he said that international guidelines were not strictly  applicable in SA, "where a sizeable proportion of the debt --  the deficit on the state pension and provident funds -- is owned  by the civil service".</p>

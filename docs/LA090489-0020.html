			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHILE PROTESTS BRAZIL'S FIREWORKS AFTER 1-0 LOSS  </P> <P> Brazil apparently became the first team to qualify for soccer's 1990 World Cup,  but its 1-0 victory over Chile on Sunday was thrown into doubt when fireworks  thrown by a fan appeared to knock down the Chilean goalkeeper with 22 minutes  remaining.  </P> <P> Roberto Rojas was carried off the field on a stretcher and his teammates walked  off the field and did not return. Referee Juan Carlos Loustau of Argentina  waited 20 minutes and then called the match after consulting with Agustin  Dominguez of Spain and Eduardo Rocca Couture of Uruguay, members of the 1990  World Cup Organizing Committee.  </P> <P> Antonio Careca scored for Brazil four minutes into the second half before  160,000 fans in Maracana Stadium at Rio de Janeiro.  </P> <P> "Chile has filed a protest asking FIFA to annul the game and to apply sanctions  against Brazil and Maracana Stadium," said Sergio Stoppel, president of the  Chilean Soccer Federation. "It was physically impossible for us to compete."  </P> <P> In other games, Trinidad and Tobago beat Guatemala, 2-1; Bolivia upset Uruguay,  2-1, and Colombia and Ecuador tied, 0-0.  </P> <P> Rojas slumped to the field next to the fireworks rocket, which billowed green  smoke. He was taken off on a stretcher.  </P> <P> Stoppel said the rocket opened a 1 1/4-inch cut that required five stitches.  However, Eurico Miranda of the Brazil Soccer Federation said the apparent  bleeding was faked.  </P> <P> "The rocket did not hit the player," Miranda said. "The Chileans threw  Mercurochrome on his face and said he cut himself."  </P> <P> Added Brazilian Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni: "The rocket went up, fell behind  Rojas and he threw himself on the ground. Then Chile made a scene."  </P> <P> Brazil finished South America Group Three with a 3-0-1 record and six points.  Chile finished 2-1-1.  </P> <P> At Port of Spain, Trinidad, Kerry Jameson scored for Trinidad and Tabago with  two minutes left. It was his goal that beat Guatemala two weeks ago at  Guatemala City.  </P> <P> Trinidad (3-1-3) has nine points with one match left, a Nov. 19 home game  against the United States. The U.S. (2-1-1) has five points. Costa Rica (5-2-1)  has completed play with 11 points. The top two teams in the North and Central  American and Caribbean region qualify.  </P> <P> Guatemala (1-4) lost its fourth straight. Guatemala took the lead on Julio  Rodas's goal in the sixth minute but Philbert Jones tied it four minutes later.  </P> <P> At La Paz, Bolivia, Alfonso Dominguez gave Uruguay the lead with seven minutes  left in the first half but Alvaro Pena tied it a minute into the second half  and Ruben Sosa scored two minutes later.  </P> <P> Bolivia (2-0) beat Peru, 2-1, at home on Aug. 20 and plays Peru next Sunday at  Lima. Bolivia lost to Uruguay, 3-0, in their last meeting, a first round match  of the America Cup last July 4.  </P> <P> Uruguay (1-1) beat Peru, 2-0, last Sunday. Uruguay plays host to Bolivia Sept.  17 and Peru Sept. 24 in the final Group One match.  </P> <P> At Guayaquil, Ecuador, Colombia moved into first place with a 1-1-1 record.  Paraguay (1-0) is second and Ecuador (0-1) is third.  </P></p>

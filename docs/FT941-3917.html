			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Chemicals start to smell sweeter - Bayer/BASF Germany's recovering chemicals stocks are expected to be given a further boost tomorrow when Bayer, star of the domestic sector, officially closes its books for 1993. Although Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, has already as good as promised an unchanged DM11 (Pounds 4.33) pay-out for the year, noting in January that fourth quarter earnings and sales seemed better than expected, the market is hungry for any snippets which support its view that the chemicals cycle is out of the dumps. If tomorrow's announcement, following a meeting of the supervisory board, follows tradition, there will be little indication of progress in the current year. A clearer picture of present conditions and prospects can be expected on Thursday and Friday, when BASF and Bayer host their annual press conferences. BASF, which is considered the most sensitive of the German chemicals groups to the vagaries of the cycle, last week unveiled a DM2 cut to DM8 in its 1993 pay-out. But that had long been discounted by the markets, and the news did nothing to affect the stock's recent sharp climb. Hoechst, which meets the press a week tomorrow, has also proposed a DM7 dividend - down DM2, but better than many expected.</p>

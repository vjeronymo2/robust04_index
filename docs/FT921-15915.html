			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Rates edge higher MONEY market interest rates edged slightly higher in London yesterday, with only a small liquidity shortage emerging on the first active trading day since the year-end holiday period. The Bank of England made an early forecast of a Pounds 750m liquidity shortage, later revised to Pounds 800m. Early assistance consisted of the purchase of Pounds 57m band 4 bills at 10 1/8 per cent, with a further Pounds 33m purchased at the same rate later in the morning session. During the afternoon the bank injected a further Pounds 217m, mainly through the purchase of band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance totalled Pounds 155m, leaving a shortage of around Pounds 440m. Although the shortage was not relieved during the day, breaking the recent pattern, overnight money rates were little changed on the levels seen last week. By the close, unsecured overnight money was quoted at 10 3/4 -11 per cent, although traders reported some business being done at a higher 11 1/2 -11 per cent rate. Three months inter-bank money was quoted at 10 13/16 -10 per cent, up just  1/16 of a point on the day. The March short sterling futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closed little changed at 89.32, implying base interest rates of 10.68 per cent by the spring from the current level of 10.5 per cent. However, market rates could come under more pressure later this week when more substantial liquidity shortages, running into billions of pounds, are likely. In Tokyo, overnight call money fell sharply from the last close before the national holiday that began on Decem-ber 31. Call money was trading at 5 9/32 per cent, down from the year-end 5 9/16 per cent. The Bank of Japan cut its overnight discount rate by  1/2 point to 4 1/2 per cent a week ago. The authorities are seen as keen to prevent money market interest rates falling further, however. Today the market is anticipating a Y200bn liquidity shortage, with speculation that the Bank of Japan may not act to relieve the pressure in an effort to keep short rates firm. In Frankfurt, call money was little changed at around 9.45-9.55 per cent, comfortably below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency funding rate for financial institutions. In the US, the Federal Reserve added Dollars 2.5bn liquidity via customer repurchase agreements.</p>

He said his conversation with head of the Spanish  Government Felipe Gonzalez was interesting and substantial.  They discussed a number of international problems, as well as  prospects of the development of Spanish-Ukrainian relations.    On the same day, Zlenko continued, he had talks with his  Spanish counterpart Javier Solana. The two sides initialled the  Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Ukraine and Spain,  signed a document on the freedom of movement of their citizens  on each other's territory and discussed a number of agreements  due to be signed soon. Aside from it, during the talks some  matters were settled, which are connected with the preparation  of an official visit of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to  Spain, which is planned to take place in the first half of the  current year.    According to Zlenko, a lively interest of Spanish business  people in developing cooperation with Ukraine came as a surprise  to him. He discussed the development of economic relations with  Minister of Trade and Tourism Javier Gomez Navarro and at a  meeting with representatives of the Spanish business and  financial circles.    During the talks with Defence Minister Julian Garcia Vargas  the sides devoted much attention to the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, where both Spanish and Ukrainian soldiers  are serving as part of the U.N. peace-keeping contingent. They  exchanged views concerning the propopsals on the settlement of  the Balkan conflict, which are being discussed at the NATO  headquarters. The stands of Ukraine and Spain on those  proposals are almost identical. Both sides believe it is  necessary to further look for political ways of settling the  conflict. Maximum effort should be exerted for attaining a  peaceful settlement without permitting the militarisation of  that region. Otherwise U.N. troops made up of soldiers from  Spain, Ukraine, Russia and other countries may become hostages  of the ill-considered decisions taken by politicians or  diplomats, Zlenko said.</p>

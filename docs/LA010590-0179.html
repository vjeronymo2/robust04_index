			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> L.A. GIFT TO MINN. ART MUSEUM  </P> <P> A $3-million gift from a Los Angeles art collector and philanthropist appears  to mean the University of Minnesota art museum will finally get a home of its  own, designed by one of America's most prominent architects.  </P> <P> The new building has been made possible by a gift from Frederick Weisman, whose  $3-million gift qualifies for a matching grant from the University of Minnesota  Foundation.  </P> <P> The museum will be designed by Santa Monica architect Frank Gehry. Gehry has an  international reputation for designing buildings that are themselves considered  works of art.  </P> <P> The $6 million generated by Weisman's gift, plus $1 million previously raised  and matched by the foundation, means that the museum needs only the approval of  the university Board of Regents. Weisman is expected to attend the Jan. 12  meeting of the board, where they will discuss the new $8-million structure.  </P> <P> Weisman, who was born and raised in Minneapolis, will decide whether the museum  will bear his name or that of his parents, William and Mary Weisman.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WON'T BE CHARGED IN FAILED STORE  ROBBERY  </P> <P> Citing insufficient evidence, county prosecutors declined on Thursday to file  charges against a man arrested in connection with an attempted robbery of a  Downey discount store and gunfight that left two officers injured.  </P> <P> Samuel Tim Fountain, 33, of Downey, was found in a brushy area near the Santa  Ana freeway behind the Pace warehouse that was invaded before dawn Tuesday by  six heavily armed would-be robbers.  </P> <P> The holdup went sour when police, alerted by a call from a store employee,  arrived on the scene. Officers said the robbers communicated with two-way  radios and wore bulletproof vests.  </P> <P> Eighteen witnesses failed to identify Fountain as one of the assailants, said  Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Fountain, a  parolee from Folsom Prison, remained in custody on a "parole hold" as Downey  police continued their search for at least five suspects who have eluded a  manhunt.  </P></p>

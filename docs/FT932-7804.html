			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brewers' heads down for prolonged in-fighting - The effects of discounting, the latest weapon in the battle for market share A WAR of attrition is being fought in the UK beer market: a series of sporadic, intensive, skirmishes between national brewers intent on gaining or defending market share. None of the participants so far has gained much ground; all are beginning to show the cost of their efforts. Bass, the UK's leading brewer, this week reported that it had advanced its market share by 0.2 percentage points in six months, while its profit margin had fallen from 9.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent. The aggression is likely to continue for some time, as market conditions have rarely been better for winning share - or for losing it. Government orders which forced the national brewers to free about 11,000 pubs - about 10 per cent of the total - from exclusive beer supplies have opened opportunities for competitors to move into outlets from which they were previously excluded. The free trade will expand further. The proportion of beer sold through the brewers' tied pubs is forecast to decline from 44 per cent of the total in 1989 to about 20 per cent by the end of the decade. At the same time, take-home trade volume - beer sold through supermarkets and off-licences - is expected to grow from 18 per cent of the total market to 30 per cent. Against a background in which total beer consumption is set to fall by about 5 per cent during the 1990s, largely because of demographic changes, the national brewers have been forced to sharpen their competitive edge. With the loss of much of the assured, high-margin flow of sales through their own pubs, they must now battle to capture outlets controlled by new pub retailing companies and multiple grocers, by individual licensees and liquor stores. The initial response to this prospect saw Courage seek to strengthen its position by acquiring Grand Metropolitan's breweries and beer brands; and Allied-Lyons merge its brewing operations with Carlsberg in Carlsberg-Tetley. Like GrandMet, regional brewers Greenalls, Boddington and Devenish quit the industry to become retailers. Since these dispositions, the struggle for market share has been fought with a variety of weapons: discounts, supply agreements, loan ties, and increased marketing. Courage, despite its denials, is widely regarded as the most aggressive price-cutter. As its outlets in the GrandMet and Inntrepreneur pub estates are freed over the next four years, it may be left at a disadvantage with rivals who each retain several thousand pubs. That prospect, says one analyst, has led to 'erratic and sometimes frantic' discounting to gain a more secure position. But, whoever may have started the latest campaign, discounting is, and has long been, a weapon in the armoury of all the other brewers - Allied, Bass, Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle. In the competition to supply some of the bigger pub companies - where increased volumes may compensate for lower prices - discounts have risen to about Pounds 80 a barrel, or about half the list price. The signs are that discounting, though on a lesser scale, is spreading to other areas of the free trade. The key question is how far the brewers will be prepared to go, and for how long. Mr Martin Hawkins, analyst at Nikko Securities, says: 'It does not make commercial sense for the national brewers to have maintained a high level of capital investment in restructuring brewing and distribution operations if it is accepted that the overall return will continue to diminish. 'A committed volume-oriented strategy can ultimately only be successful through bankrupting the competition and running the risk of bankrupting oneself. It is in no-one's interests to discount so aggressively for a protracted period that the major players go broke in the process.' Brewers, facing equal pressures on margins in the expanding take-home market, are well aware of the dangers. Some of the pressure has been eased by cost benefits from the closure of breweries and other rationalisation measures. But there is still substantial over-capacity in the industry. It would take the closure of another brewery by each of the nationals to remove it, says Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Carlsberg-Tetley. It seems more likely that weaker regional brewers could be forced out of the industry first. However, brewers are already finding that discounting alone is not enough to secure more volume. It is significant that the price war so far has been confined to standard lagers and keg ales - and even there the better-known brands have had to concede less. All the brewers' leading brands - Whitbread's Boddington and Stella Artois; Bass's Carling Black Label and Worthington; Allied's Tetley and Castlemaine, have increased volume without price cuts. Such brand portfolios, backed by a supporting package that combines value for money, and quality of service including loans, long-term agreements, and promotional and business support, hold increasing attraction for retailers. Provision of such packages does not come cheap: bad free trade debts have cost Whitbread Pounds 37m. Allied's bad debt charges were Pounds 17m last year and Bass's provisions nearly doubled to Pounds 19m in its first half. But the costs do not have quite the unnerving effect on investors as the prospects of a full-scale price war. That consideration may help to restrain the present hostilities.</p>

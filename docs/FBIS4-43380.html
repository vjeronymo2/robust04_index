			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "Europe Votes for `Europe </F> Light'"]    [Text] In the early postwar days, "More luck than sense"  could have been the (West) Germans' secret motto. The economic  miracle and the return to the international community were  brought about within a very short time. Today, following the  European elections, the stress must be on "sense." It is true  that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] are unhappy about their serious losses,  but the whole of Europe can only be happy about the behavior of  the German voters. The Germans have rejected the rat catchers  and the terrible simplifiers more clearly than the voters in  other countries.    The Republikaner (1990 -- 7.1 percent) are no longer in the  European Parliament, the "German mark above everything else"  party of Manfred Brunner got no more than 1 percent, and the  National Democratic Party of Germany stays where it belongs --  at 2 per mill. Even the Christian Social Union [CSU], which  conducted a hidden anti-European election campaign in a  regionalist disguise, had 1.5 percent less than in 1990. The  conclusion is that, in view of these election results, our  friends' concerns about the "renationalization" of the Germans  are unfounded.    The known fact that basically, the European elections are  local elections of a national nature changes nothing about this.  Even though the Germans (like all the others) have voted on  themselves, the outcome is doubly good news for our neighbors.  Helmut Kohl, the man with the large Europe button on his lapel,  has been clearly confirmed and the Federal Republic has proved  to be a model of internal stability, compared with France,  Italy, and Britain.    The problem child rather is France, where the tickets of  outsiders -- bankrupt people like Bernard Tapie, genuine  reactionaries like Philippe de Villiers and racists like Le Pen  -- have collected a total of 34 percent. If we add the 8  percent of the communists, we have a 42-percent bloc of those  who cannot be forced under one flag, but tell people with their  ticket that they do not want this system.    Britain? It is true that John Major's Conservatives were  defeated by Labour, but this is instability of the good kind. A  change of power following 15 years of Tory rule is taking shape,  which is no reason for concern for any sensible democrat to whom  the permanent domination of any political party must be a thorn  in the side. What is more, the strong enmity of the British  left wing toward Europe has long ebbed away; a Tony Blair would  not have to permanently soothe a powerful nationalist wing, as  John Major must do.    Italy? The ominous fog over Rome has not yet cleared up.  What is clear is this: Berlusconi has made considerable gains  (10 percent), the neofascist voters do not show any remorse (the  percentage of the Alleanza has remained the same), the old  parties had substantial losses. Perhaps the 10-percent gains  will make it easier for Berlusconi to bring the neofascists down  to earth again. However, this would not change the general  picture of Italy. With the confirmation of Berlusconi and  company, a strong anti-European group is moving into the  Strasbourg parliament.    Pars pro toto, this is also the 1994 European message: It is  not the mild shift to the right, which is of importance, but the  strengthening of the European sceptics -- in France and Italy,  in Denmark and Belgium. This has also been indirectly confirmed  by the low voter turnout -- 56.5 percent is the lowest ever  percentage, which signals indifference. In the fourth direct  elections, the Europeans have apparently seen how weak the  parliament is, compared with those who really wield power -- the  Commission and the Council of Ministers.    Formulating it more sharply, Europe's fate will not be  decided by its parliament in the fourth legislative period  either. What is more important is the larger field of forces.  The strongest figure in the European structures is Helmut Kohl,  but perhaps this is only so because the CDU [Christian  Democratic Union]/CSU has recently distanced itself one or two  steps away from "Maastricht." In European policy, France, the  "driving force of Maastricht," could block itself and thus also  the German-French "tandem," which has seen itself as the  spearhead of accelerated merger.    There is an additional decisive event that happened to  coincide with the European Union [EU] elections -- Austria's  audible yes to European membership. This will at first  encourage the "imitators" in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, and  subsequently, it will greatly advance the enlargement of the EU  by the Eastern European reform states. Looking beyond the  European horizon, Euro skepticism, the reluctance to go to the  polls, and the EU enlargement may become a historic watershed  behind which a light Europe emerges -- a larger but loose  integrated system.    The more sovereign states seek to become members of the  exclusive club, the more sovereign it will be. This is a  natural law of international politics, and not even the best  intentions can change anything about it. Classical federalists  will deplore this. However, what is the alternative? An "axis"  between Bonn and Paris? Small European special alliances? What  the Six and Twelve failed to achieve in the Cold War, they will  be even less able to achieve now. Moreover, following the end of  the division of Europe, the principle should be -- "less with  many" is better than "much with few."</p>

The best estimate of 1994 herring biomass is 196,229 mt. This amount was derived using 1993 survey data and an aged structured biomass projection model developed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). Complete analysis of the 1993 spawning data was provided by the ADF&amp;G at the Council's December 1993 meeting. Therefore, the herring PSC limit for 1994 is 1,962 mt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations under &sect;675.21(b) authorize the apportionment of each PSC limit into bycatch allowances for specified fishery categories. Regulations at &sect;675.21(b)(1)(iii) specify seven fishery categories (midwater pollock, Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish, rock sole/other flatfish, yellowfin sole, rockfish, Pacific cod, and bottom pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species''). Regulations at &sect;675.21(b)(2) authorize the apportionment of the non-trawl halibut PSC limit among three fishery categories (Pacific cod hook-and-line fishery, groundfish pot gear fishery, and other non-trawl fisheries). The PSC allowances are listed in Table 5. In general, the fishery bycatch allowances listed in Table 5 reflect the recommendations made to the Council by its AP. These recommendations were based on 1993 bycatch amounts, anticipated 1994 harvest of groundfish by trawl gear and fixed gear, anticipated changes in fishery bycatch needs pending approval of a final rule implementing Amendment 24, and assumed halibut mortality rates in the different groundfish fisheries based on analyses of 1991&hyph;1993 observer data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, NMFS exempted groundfish pot gear fisheries from halibut bycatch restrictions in Amendment 21 to the FMP (March 18, 1993, 58 FR 14524). During 1993, the halibut mortality associated with this groundfish catch was 2.5 mt, based on an assumed halibut mortality rate of 5 percent. The Council recommended continuing to exempt groundfish pot gear fisheries from halibut bycatch restrictions during the 1994 fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

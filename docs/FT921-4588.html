			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Letter: A method to determine any bias of risk among Lloyd's syndicates Sir, You report on the problem of so-called 'insider dealing' at Lloyd's ('Lloyd's inquiry starts as insider row grows', March 5). It is certainly important to look at the membership of particular syndicates, in a 'vertical' manner as it were, to see whether this shows bias. However, it is perhaps even more important to look 'horizontally' at the spread of syndicates, and especially at the underwriting lines on high risk syndicates, of individual Names. That information should then be correlated with the members' agents through whom the Names underwrote. A Name's contract with his agent stipulates that the agent is wholly responsible for the Name's underwriting, without interference from the Name. It is therefore the agent's job to strike a sensible and safe balance for the Name, as between risk and reward. A 'horizontal' analysis would show up whether there is a significant difference between working and external Names as to the risks they were taking, and whether particular members' agents were more liable than others to expose their Names (whether working or external) to undue risk. Evidence is beginning to emerge, via the Name's Action Groups, that certain agents may have a very bad record in this respect. An analysis of this kind is essential if a true picture is to emerge. The problem relates not only to insider dealing but also to the LMX 'spiral', since a Name's membership of LMX syndicates is the main factor determining whether he had excessive risk exposure and will now be bankrupted. Since Sir David Walker's investigation is to look at insider dealing and the spiral, I trust he will make a full study of individual Names' risk exposure in relation both to their membership of LMX syndicates and to the agents who placed them on those syndicates. I can illustrate the need for this analysis by mentioning that there are Names whose underwriting was entirely on LMX, and that there is a large number of Names who are on several disastrous LMX syndicates. Most of these people face bankruptcy as a result. It is a highly significant problem. Richard Platts, Belmont, New Road, Littleton, Winchester, Hampshire SO22 6QR</p>

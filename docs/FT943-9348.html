			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying helps Dow to modest rise Wall Street Early computerised program buying, strong demand for technology shares and a moderately successful auction of new government securities in the bond market helped US equity prices post modest gains across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.00 at 3,766.76. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.37 at 460.30, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished 1.75 higher at 443.97 and the Nasdaq composite 5.60 ahead at 728.21. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 279.5m shares. As during the first two days of the week, there was little interest in buying stocks among retail investors at the opening yesterday, primarily because they were waiting for a lead from the bond market, which was in the middle of digesting billions of dollars of new government securities. The second leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding round - the sale of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes - was due during the afternoon, and bond prices were subdued ahead of the auction. Share prices were also little changed, but some selected program buying helped stocks edge higher at mid-morning. Prices held on to their gains later in the day when the 10-year auction passed off uneventfully, with demand from investors for the new paper slightly stronger than expected. Sentiment, however, stayed unsettled, primarily because of concern about the July inflation data. The figures, due out today and tomorrow, are nervously awaited by the markets because, if inflation is shown to be gathering pace, the Federal Reserve could decide to sanction another interest rate increase. Such a move would depress stock prices, although growing expectations of another monetary policy tightening mean that the impact of a rate increase has partly already been priced into the market. Technology shares were in demand for the second consecutive day, with Texas Instruments climbing Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 84 1/8 , Hewlett-Packard Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 82 1/4 and Compaq Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 . Procter&amp;Gamble, which reported a 24 per cent jump in second-quarter underlying earnings yesterday, advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 . Among the biggest losers of the day was Dillard Department Stores. Shares in the retailer dropped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 in volume of 3.9m as investors reacted harshly to news of second-quarter earnings that were below market expectations. Reports that Kidder, Peabody, the troubled Wall Street investment bank, lost between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m in the month of July, mostly because of problems in the mortgage-backed securities market, unsettled the shares of its parent group, General Electric, which shed Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 in heavy trade. On the Nasdaq market, Lotus forged ahead Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 in volume of 4.1m shares after the company said that it was entering into a world-wide marketing and product development pact with leading chipmaker Intel. The latter put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 59 3/4 . Canada Toronto finished solidly higher, supported by recent strength in the Canadian dollar. The TSE 300 index closed above 4,200 with a rise of 18.3 at 4,205.1. Advances outpaced falls by 389 to 304 after volume of 62.2m shares. Eleven of the 14 sub-indices were higher, led by transportation, up 1.5 per cent. Financial services and industrial products each rose 1.2 per cent. Nova firmed CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 13 1/2 on the day's heaviest volume of some 5.8m shares. The company attributed the strong interest in its stock partly to an explosion earlier this week at an ethylene plant of Exxon, a key competitor of Nova in the US ethylene market. Mexico Stocks ended moderately easier, with profit-taking continuing to determine market movement. Traders said short-term investors sold off shares for the third successive session, with not even a cut in primary interest rates giving much support to the market. A 65 basis-point fall in the bellwether 28-day Cetes rate to 15.15 per cent at the weekly auction yesterday boosted shares only briefly in opening transactions. Equities soon moved into reverse as profit-taking dominated transactions, and falling prices of New York-traded American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Mexican blue chips also dragged the local market down. The IPC index lost 20.29 at 2,574.67.</p>

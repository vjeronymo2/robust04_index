			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: ALVARADO FOLLOWS LOFRANO AS COACH OF SCOUT TEAM  </P> <P> Manny Alvarado has replaced Bob Lofrano as coach of the Chicago Cubs scout  team, but the Kennedy High baseball coach said that he has no plans to follow  Lofrano at Chatsworth High.  </P> <P> Lofrano resigned his position at Chatsworth this month to become an assistant  coach and physical education teacher at Pierce College. Alvarado, who led  Kennedy to the City Section 4-A Division championship in his first year, has no  teaching assignment at the Granada Hills campus. He teaches physical education  at Sepulveda Junior High.  </P> <P> "I'm not considering applying at Chatsworth because I've already developed  loyalties at Kennedy," he said. "The people at Kennedy have been good to me and  I'm willing to be patient."  </P> <P> Patrick Byrne, a recent magna cum laude graduate of Cal Lutheran and captain of  the Kingsmen track team, has been named an academic All-American.  </P> <P> Byrne, an at-large, second-team All-American choice, qualified for the 1989  NAIA championships in the steeplechase. He won the 1988 NAIA District 3  steeplechase championship and finished third in the same event this year. He  compiled a 3.77 grade-point average.  </P></p>

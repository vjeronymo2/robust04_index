			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AT STAKE AT TRIAL  </P> <P> A San Diego County lawsuit that seeks to increase state funding for local  mental health programs begins today in Superior Court in a trial that could  have far-reaching implications in the way these funds are distributed  statewide.  </P> <P> County officials hope the lawsuit will force the state Department of Mental  Health to allocate funds according to population. Opponents of the lawsuit,  which include several other counties, said that funding formulas should remain  unchanged.  </P> <P> Opponents argue that San Diego County receives less money because local  officials did not bother to establish an effective mental health program in the  1960s and early 1970s, when funding for these programs was plentiful. The  county is now paying for its inaction and lack of vision, they said.  </P> <P> Deputy county counsel Michael Poynor brushed the opponents' arguments aside and  said the "bottom line" is that the state uses "an unequal historical" method to  allocate mental health funds, based on how much the counties received more than  30 years ago, that has put San Diego County at a severe disadvantage.  </P> <P> Although San Diego is the second-largest county in the state, it ranks near the  bottom of California's 58 counties in funding it receives for mental health  programs.  </P> <P> "The ultimate goal is to have the judge declare the state scheme for funding  mental health unconstitutional," Poynor said. "We're going to ask for an order  to the Legislature to reallocate funds on a reasonable basis among the 58  counties."  </P> <P> According to Poynor's figures, counties receive an average of $28 per person  for mental health care from the state. San Diego County's share actually comes  out to $19 per person, he said. By comparison, San Francisco, which has  one-third the population of San Diego County, receives $62 per person, Poynor  added.  </P> <P> County officials estimated that San Diego County has lost up to $18 million a  year in state funding for the mentally ill since 1980.  </P> <P> The root of the problem dates back to 1957, Poynor said. In 1957, when counties  began applying to the state for funds to run their mental health programs, San  Diego chose not to participate because it was building a 100-bed county  facility. At the time, San Diego County was the only county in the state to own  its own mental health facility, he said.  </P> <P> In 1964, when San Diego County decided to begin applying for state funds, "the  other counties had gotten a head start" and had their state-funded programs in  place.  </P> <P> "This head start has remained a key advantage for them ever since," Poynor  said.  </P> <P> In addition to having the state's funding formula declared unconstitutional,  Poynor said the lawsuit also seeks a refund or credit of $20 million from the  state. The state has withheld that much from the county for using more than its  share of beds in state-run mental hospitals over the past 15 years.  </P> <P> "Here's another example of inequality. The state has allocated San Diego, with  2.5 million people, to use 31 hospital beds free of charge. San Francisco is  entitled to use 240 beds," Poynor said.  </P> <P> However, opponents of the lawsuit remain unconvinced by the county's argument.  </P> <P> "They (San Diego County) are basically trying to take money from counties with  long-established mental health programs," said Stewart Foreman, San Francisco  deputy city attorney. "They got into the program late, at a time when funding  limits, because of Proposition 13 and other considerations, have made it  impossible from a political standpoint to put more money into the system."  </P> <P> Smaller counties, such as San Francisco, and larger counties, such as Los  Angeles, get more money because they have established programs and need the  funds more, he added.  </P> <P> Foreman represents nine counties, including Los Angeles County, who have sided  with the attorney general's office to defeat the lawsuit. Both Foreman and  Deputy Att. Gen. John Venegas, who is representing the state Department of  Mental Health in the lawsuit, said the complaint is "without merit."  </P> <P> The lawsuit will be heard in a non-jury trial by Superior Court Judge Barbara  Gamer and is actually a consolidation of two lawsuits filed by the county  against the state since 1986.  </P> <P> In addition, Fresno County officials agreed to consolidate a similar lawsuit  they had filed against the state with the complaint filed by San Diego County.  </P> <P> Venegas said he will argue that the state has been allocating the funds  according to the Legislature's wishes.  </P> <P> "San Diego's share of funds was allocated by the Legislature," said Venegas.  "The state Department of Mental Health has followed what the legislature told  it to do."  </P> <P> If San Diego County wants to get the funding formula changed, it should go to  the Legislature rather than try to change it in court, Venegas argued.  </P> <P> "We believe that what San Diego is complaining about is not for the courts to  decide," Venegas said. Poynor said the state is also violating existing law by  allocating less money to under-funded counties like San Diego.  </P> <P> "We view current law as saying when new money comes into the state mental  health budget, it should go to counties that are below the state average. . . .  The state continues to take new money, almost half of it, and give it to  counties already above the state average," he said.  </P> <P> Ironically, the state's cutback in mental health funding this year put San  Diego County's funding somewhat more in line with other counties. Of the $61  million cut by the governor statewide, San Fancisco lost $12 million, while San  Diego suffered only a $500,000 cut.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Malaysia will  make the necessary moves to overcome United States opposition to  the establishment of the EAEC [East Asia Economic Caucus].    A U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo reportedly presented to the  Japanese Government on 7 June a report stating Washington's  opposition to the establishment of EAEC because it could cause a  negative impact on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC.  This is the first time that the Clinton administration has  issued a clear signal that it opposes the setting up of the  EAEC. Prior to this, the administration embarked on a  wait-and-see attitude.    Speaking to newsmen after witnessing the signing of two  agreements involving the transfer of waste water treatment  technology to Thailand and Iran, the prime minister confirmed  that this was Washington's official stand regarding EAEC.    Regarding Japan, which has yet to articulate its stand on  the  EAEC, Dr. Mahathir said the government will continue to make  clarifications so that the country accepts the establishment of  the caucus.</p>

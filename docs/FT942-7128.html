			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (13): Relaxed attitudes - Rio de Janeiro / Guide for business visitors For Cariocas, as Rio de Janeiro residents are called, the beach is the soul of the city, writes Patrick McCurry. Each beach has its own personality and 'crowd'. A swim before dusk, surrounded by Rio's spectacular scenery, is an unforgettable experience. But visitors should remember that those romantic sparkling lights coming from the hills pinpoint the city's notorious favela shanty towns  - and that robbing tourists, particularly in the Copacabana district, is a popular beach activity. Valuables such as cameras should not be displayed in the street, on the beach or on buses. Taxis are generally safe but they often take the longest route possible and at speeds usually not permitted outside Formula 1 racing circuits. The tube system is reliable and secure. Business visitors should not be surprised when meetings start late or executives are informally dressed. This sometimes relaxed attitude is counterbalanced by the Cariocas' strengths: quick and creative thinking. Away from the beach, visitors can take an electric train to the Corcovado peak, site of the famous statue of Christ, or a cable car to Sugar Loaf Mountain for an aerial view of the city's beauty.

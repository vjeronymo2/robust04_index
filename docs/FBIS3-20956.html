The Intas, which was created on the initiative of the  European Commission, will contribute up to 21 million ECUs to  these 509 projects, each of which associates at least two  European laboratories and one laboratory in a former USSR  country. The funds will be used primarily to pay CIS researchers.    The projects selected concern all scientific fields, from  the  exact and natural sciences to the applied, social, and economic  sciences. The principle of this cooperation is to ensure that  laboratories remain in the new CIS states and are able to  continue their work.    Created in June 1993, the Intas includes the twelve members  of the European Union, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland, and  the twelve members of the CIS.</p>

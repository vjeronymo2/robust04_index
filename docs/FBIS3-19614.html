			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Toward a Referendum in November"] </F>   [Text] Norwegian voters may have to fight their way  through storm, snow, cold, and darkness to cast their votes on  EU [European Union] membership.    So far it seems most likely that the referendum on the EU  will be held at some time in November, and probably in the  latter half of the month. However, a precondition is that the  EU next week clears up its internal disagreement on voting  rules. This would then mean that the European Parliament could  debate the matter in May, and that the new members could be  admitted beginning on 1 January next year.    At her news conference in the early hours of Tuesday [15  March] morning, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland indicated  that the referendum will come toward the end of the year. She  also announced that the party leaders and the leaders of the the  yes and no movements will be invited to discuss the date.    Formally, the government will put a proposal to the Storting  fixing the date. It is the Municipal Affairs Ministry that is  responsible for the holding of the referendum. Municipal  Affairs Minister Gunnar Berge has told AFTENPOSTEN that as soon  as the situation has finally been clarified, he will be able to  put a bill with a concrete proposal for the date for the  referendum before the Storting relatively quickly.    Last fall the Storting adopted a surprising resolution  requesting the government to initiate contacts with the aim of  adopting a common date for the referendums in the three Nordic  applicant countries. At the recent meeting of the Nordic  Council, Berge announced that such contacts had been made, but  that the other countries would choose dates on the basis of  their national political processes. In Sweden, June and  November are possible alternatives, while the Finns are looking  at a referendum in September.    Reports that the Swedes are now looking at a referendum in  November has given new fuel to Norwegian hopes for a common  referendum date. A Norwegian referendum before the summer is  not being considered.    The Labor Party will hold its regular national congress from  10 to 13 November. The party's position on the membership  agreement will be decided at an extraordinary national congress  in May or June.    Some people take the view that if there is not a common date  for the referendums in all three countries Norway should at  least go to the polls on the same day as one of the other  countries. Christian People's Party leader Kjell Magne Bondevik  backs this alternative, as does Center Party leader Anne Enger  Lahnstein.    Paul Chaffey of the Socialist Left Party would like the  referendum on the same day as Sweden, but is less concerned  about Finland.    The Conservative Party has a different position: According  to Per-Kristian Foss, the deputy leader of the party's Storting  group, it would be an advantage for Norwegian voters if they  know how things have gone in Sweden and Finland. In the  Progress Party, deputy chairman Hans J. Rosjorde takes the same  view.</p>

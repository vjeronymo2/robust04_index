			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gianni Baget Bozzo: "Europe and the </F> Countries of the East"]    [Text] The issue of the Italian ministers belonging to the  National Alliance has created a controversy with regard to the  elections to the European Parliament. Having raised some  problems in the field of public ethics, Italy now poses a  growing issue with regard to Europe's identity as a community  based on certain values. But it is not Italy alone that makes  the 1994 elections different from all its predecessors.    Now Europe extends no longer from the Atlantic to the Elbe,  but from the Atlantic to Vladivostok, the city where  Solzhenitsyn is deliberately beginning his voyage of rediscovery  through Russia. Basically, this strengthens the cohesion and  force of attraction of the Twelve. As long as the communist  empire existed, the Russian system had a rigid and limited  scope. Now between the borders of Russia and those of the  European Union [EU] there extends a no man's land that is bound  neither to the West nor to the East and that is seeking links  with the West because it fears another Russian era in the  European East.    It is as a consequence of this innovation in the East that  the innovation in the north has occurred: The Nordic countries  and Austria are becoming part of the Community, while other  countries of the East have applied. The EU may become a focal  point on the continent in the face of possible developments in  Russia.    What is certain is that Russia will try to regain influence  over the lands of the former USSR, offering as an alternative to  the West a guarantee of balance in the East. But this is no  easy objective, because Ukraine is a difficult problem to  resolve. Be that as it may, the East, starting with Russia, is  in a state of flux, and this is causing a real change in the  Europe of the Twelve.    Postcommunist parties are in power in all the countries of  the East that aspire to join the Union, apart from the Czech  Republic.    This does not mean that the membership of the countries of  the East is imminent, because it is impossible for them to  implement EU policies, starting with agriculture. But it does  mean that Europe will be governed by different systems of  association with the Community, which already exist within the  EU as a result of the exemptions granted to the British and  especially the Danish in order to secure their adherence to the  Maastricht Treaty.    National differences are therefore destined to prevail. For  that matter, the principle of subsidiarity established in  Maastricht is basically the reverse of the principle of  federalism. Under European federalism it is a virtue to  transfer responsibilities from the nations to the European  authorities: Under the principle of subsidiarity, the opposite  is true. In any case, in Italy's domestic debate federalism  correctly means increasing local powers to the detriment of the  central authorities. In some European countries, the principle  of subsidiarity established in Maastricht is cited as an  addition to the responsibilities of local authorities. The era  of European federalism seems to have come to an end, and what is  starting now is basically similar to an ancient institution,  that of the "European concert of nations," in other words, the  accord among the major European states to establish the common  interests of the whole.    The protagonists of this European concert of nations can  already be seen: They are Germany and France. The old  Carolingian Europe is at the center of the new European system,  particularly because it has determined its course. And it is  certainly Germany that is steering events: If Chancellor Kohl  wins the elections, it will be not because he is Adenauer's  successor, but because he has radically updated policy, pushing  Germany eastward in accordance with an ancient tendency --  Germany as organizer of the Slavic world.    From the viewpoint of the Community institutions, this means  an increase in intergovernmental activity, that is, in the role  of the Council of Ministers and of the permanent  representatives. For that matter, in the years before  Maastricht the most important event, established in the Single  Act of 1985, was political cooperation, that is, a body not  envisaged by the treaties, which established permanent meetings  on all matters of common interest on the part of the foreign  ministers of the Twelve. Maastricht incorporated this  institution into the Treaty of Rome, and perhaps this is one of  the most significant modifications.    Overall European cooperation, at the military level too,  will  become all the more demanding as America's foreign policy  becomes vaguer with the accession to power of the Vietnam  generation: The "new order" and the "unipolar world" envisaged  by Bush's strategists lasted less than a year. Now Europe must  provide with its own forces. The terrible tragedy in Bosnia,  far from being over, will cause us further difficult times, when  we can even foresee a European disengagement, open warfare  between the sides involved, and an end to the arms embargo. It  is a very different Europe from that of 1989 that is about to  elect its fourth Parliament.</p>

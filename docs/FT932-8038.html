			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Chemical wins debt trade approval CHEMICAL Banking has received permission from the Federal Reserve to underwrite and sell corporate bonds through its securities arm. It is the fifth leading US commercial bank to be granted debt underwriting powers, after JP Morgan, Citicorp, Bankers Trust and Chase Manhattan. Several big foreign banks have also been allowed into the business, including Union Bank of Switzerland and Industrial Bank of Japan. Traditionally, the commercial banking and securities businesses have been kept apart in the US. In recent years, however, the Fed has exploited loopholes in the Glass Steagal Act, the depression-era legislation that enshrined the separateness of banking and securities business, to allow a few well-capitalised banks to operate in the corporate debt markets. However, the banks are not allowed to derive more than 10 per cent of gross revenues from underwriting and dealing in certain corporate debt securities for two years. Chemical hopes to build a presence in the corporate debt market to go alongside its dominant presence in the bank loan market. It has already arranged Dollars 33bn of loans this year, making it by far the biggest lender among US banks. Initially, the bank, through its Chemical Securities subsidiary, will concentrate on selling high-yield debt, where the underwriting fees are higher than on investment-grade debt. Because of its dominant share of the bank loan market, Chemical believes it has a large client base among likely issuers of junk bonds. The Fed's decision was not unexpected. After last year's merger with Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical became the third-largest US bank, with consolidated assets of Dollars 147.5bn, and has one of the strongest capital bases in the industry. Although Chemical had begun to hire staff with experience in the debt markets in anticipation of Fed approval, the bank is expected to hire some traders and bankers who specialise in junk bonds. The main task facing the bank is to assemble a sales force to distribute the corporate bonds it underwrites to institutional investors.</p>

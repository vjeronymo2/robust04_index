			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies The dollar's weakness must be exasperating those who were predicting a steady recovery in 1992. Against the D-Mark, however, its behaviour is easily explained by interest rate differentials. With Germany apparently condemned to tight money for the foreseeable future, it has become expensive to go short of the D-Mark - all the more so since there is no sign of a US recovery strong enough to prompt a rise in US interest rates. April may have seen a 0.9 per cent jump in US retail sales, but this has to be set against a downward revised fall of 1 per cent in March. The 3.9 per cent annual rise in core US inflation (retail prices excluding movements in food and energy) even suggests room for the Federal Reserve to ease policy again. Harder to explain is what is happening to the yen, which has been the main beneficiary of the dollar's fall this week. The interest rate differential with the dollar is small, but Japanese insurance companies have turned heavy sellers of the dollar. With the Nikkei off its lows, it is unlikely that this has to do with the need to repatriate funds to bail out the banks. More likely, the institutions are responding to the renewed attack from the US Treasury on Japan's trade surplus. Accompanied as its remarks are by allegations of Chinese and Taiwanese currency manipulation for export gains, it looks as though the US means business. The natural response by Japan would be to talk the yen higher. Since higher short-term interest rates are hardly appropriate for the present stage of the cycle, it is difficult to see how this could produce a sustained effect on the currency - unless it is accompanied by fiscal pump-priming which would boost the economy and push bond yields up to more attractive levels.</p>

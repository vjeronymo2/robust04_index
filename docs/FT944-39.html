			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (7): Pick a long-term achiever - Performance: why it is so hard to pin down Performance arguably is the most important factor that affects the final value of your fund at retirement, but it cannot be seen in isolation. Charges and contract flexibility must also be considered, as these may reduce overall returns considerably. However, whereas providers' charges and contract flexibility can now be assessed with some degree of accuracy, good performance remains a notoriously elusive creature. Five years is a long time in investment management, as the table with this article illustrates, yet there are still many providers keen to lock investors in for 20 years or more. Using past performance as a guide to the future clearly is risky, but with careful analysis the process can provide a more reliable indication of what is to come. Consultants and actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow supplied the five star guide to performance used in Table 1, on page 2 of this survey. The performance screens eliminated funds that achieved below-average returns, were inconsistent or volatile. Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at B&amp;W, explained the process: 'The use of past performance statistics is probably the best guide to gauge future performance, provided it is coupled with a clear understanding of how past performance was achieved, an assessment of the current investment style of a management team and a knowledge of whether the individuals responsible for past performance are still in place.' The screening process examined performance over quarterly time periods in the three-, four- and five-year periods ending 31 March, 1994. The following tests relate to the five-star ratings. Screen 1 excluded funds whose average percentile score was below 50.5. Screen 2 selected those funds which had appeared in the top two quartiles most frequently and in the bottom quartile least frequently. This weeded out funds that passed the first screening yet were consistently below median. Funds were awarded two stars if they had appeared in the top two quartiles more than 11 times and in the bottom quartile less than five times over the 20 quarterly time periods. Screen 3 selected funds that achieved low volatility. This third star was awarded where the percentile scores had below average standard deviation. Screen 4 examined performance trends. Graphs were plotted showing the percentile scores, and a 'best fit' line was drawn through these moving average points. Those funds with an upward trend were awarded a fourth star. Screen 5 involved a series of interviews with fund managers who had passed the first four tests. The interviews were based on responses to a questionnaire which sought details on, among other points, the growth in size of the managed fund, contributions and withdrawals, the number of managers and analysts on the fund management team, the asset allocation and stock selection processes, the background of the principals of the team and the fees charged to the fund which are not included in the published annual management charges. Several managers were awarded a fifth star on the basis of the interview results. Only funds with a five-year record and Pounds 20m under management made it through to the final shortlist. This excluded Professional Life's external funds (managed by Morgan Grenfell and Gartmore) and Mercury Life's fund, although B&amp;W stressed that in other respects these were 'promising'. We asked Bacon &amp; Woodrow to provide a star rating for all managed unit-linked funds, although several of the poor performers in particular declined the invitation to take part in today's survey. Looking purely at performance, five stars were awarded to: Gartmore, Legal &amp; General, M&amp;G, Norwich Union, Standard Life and Sun Life. Four stars were awarded to Abbey Life, Allied Dunbar, Britannia Life, Clerical Medical, Commercial Union, Equitable, General Accident, Hambro Guardian, Irish Life (Opportunity fund), Lincoln National, London &amp; Manchester, Prudential (corporate fund), Royal London and TSB. At the other end of the spectrum, all too many failed even to gain one star. These include AEgon, Albany, Axa Equity &amp; Law (balanced fund), Barclays Life, Canada Life, Century Group, Colonial Mutual, Confederation Life, Cornhill, Crown, General Portfolio, Hearts of Oak, Laurentian, London Life, Manulife, MGM, Midland, National Provident, Premium Life, Provident Life (apart from the S&amp;F balanced fund), Provident Mutual, Prudential (but the corporate fund achieved four stars), Royal Life, Save &amp; Prosper, Scottish Amicable, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Widows, Skandia (own fund), Sun Alliance (own fund) and Windsor Life. Moreover, bear in mind that data was not available for a significant proportion of providers. If the entry shows 'no data', this may be because it is a relatively new fund - but it is important that you check this point. Bacon &amp; Woodrow operates on a fee basis, and in practice also excludes providers which are not prepared to strip out the commission costs and reinvest this in the fund. Further screening with B&amp;W's survey analysed contract terms similar to the product flexibility ratings in Table 1. On this basis, several providers awarded four and five stars purely on performance would not be recommended by the firm. Bacon &amp; Woodrow's advice stresses that long-term consistency should be favoured above the occasional years of exceptional returns achieved by the more volatile managers. Indeed, there is considerable danger attached to chasing last year's 'winners'. John Sheffield, senior partner with pensions advisers and employee benefits consultants AIS Pensions, said: 'The publicity given to the 'top five' funds can make them an irresistible draw to the pension purchaser and produce a business bonanza for the companies concerned.' Sheffield analysed survey statistics over a five-year period to show how the top managers in 1989 fared over the following five years. The results (see the table with this article) are startling: 'Out of 1989's top five, only London &amp; Manchester maintained a high position in the subsequent five years, but even here there is need for caution. L&amp;M have two personal pension contracts, and under the wrong one you would have found yourself in 71st place,' he said.

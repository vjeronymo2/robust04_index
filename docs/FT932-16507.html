			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Flooding in Ecuador wreaks havoc ECUADOR HAS been hit by one of the worst natural disasters in its history, leaving thousands homeless and an unknown number killed, writes Raymond Colitt in Quito. A landslide last week in the southern province of Azuay has created a dam in the river Paute, causing the backwater to flood surrounding areas. Dozens of dwellings have been flooded and the rising water level is threatening to engulf several more communities. President Sixto Duran Ballen has declared a state of emergency and relief efforts are now concentrating on providing shelter for homeless, as well as evacuating those still threatened by the rising water level. So far the death toll has been placed at 32 but it is not known how many more are buried beneath debris.</p>

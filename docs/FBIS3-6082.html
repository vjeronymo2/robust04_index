			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Market Access Equivalent to Agreement on Mobile </F> Phones Urged"]    [Text] Japan-U.S. negotiations over the issue of opening  up the Japanese mobile telephone market finally produced an  agreement in Tokyo on 12 March. Because of this, there is no  possibility that a retaliation list, which the United States  prepared, will be disclosed. Since the mobile telephone issue  was not included in the agenda of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive  economic talks, which ruptured, attention was focused on recent  discussions. The discussion over the phone issue was a part of  the Japan-U.S. comprehensive talks. However, we positively  appraise the fact that retaliation has been avoided for the time  being.    The intention of the United States, which tried to solve the  issue of economic friction by introducing strong measures, was  to open up the Japanese market, and the marketing strategies of  Motorola Inc., which wanted to make inroads into Japanese market  by riding on the wave of the government's attempt, combined into  one. It seems that Japanese businessmen, who were troubled from  beginning to end by the offenses of the United States, just  could not help but feel that the U.S. demands were unreasonable.    In the field of mobile telephones, Japan and the United  States have intermittently had friction over the past ten years.  Japan liberated the communications market in 1985. The United  States immediately decided to treat the mobile telephone issue  as a main theme of the Japan-U.S. Market-Oriented Sector  Selective (MOSS) talks and demanded that Japan open up its  market to the Motorola method. In 1986, the United States  managed to obtain a pledge from Japan.    From the beginning, Japan was lacking individuality in its  countermeasures and, without clarifying problem points, adopted  the NTT and the Motorola systems, which are not compatible with  each other, in this small country. Succumbing to the hard-line  stance of the United States, Japan continued to make  inconsistent compromises one after another, even after  acceptance of the Motorola system. However, causes of friction  continued to exist.    In 1989, the United States pointed out that the Japan had  violated the MOSS agreement for mobile telephones and named  Japanese goods which are subject to retaliation based on the  strength of the 301 provision of the trade law. After this,  Japan, in addition to the NTT method, allowed Motorola to  introduce its system in Japan. At that time, the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry said "there are no more available  frequencies." But the ministry allotted frequencies to Motorola  at the last moment.    The friction over the mobile telephones was created by the  fact that Motorola's share in the Japanese market did not grow  as they expected and that the United States assumed a hard-line  stance due to its fear that it would lag behind Japan in  introducing a digital system. As far as the United States is  concerned, the share did not grow because Motorola "was not  given market access equal to that of the NTT."    In comparison, Japan actually assumed a passive stance.  Japan repeated hasty negotiations as it did several years ago.  Since Japan did not have firm conviction at the beginning of  the negotiations, it continued to negotiate with the United  States without serious commitment. Due to such an optimistic  stance, the electric communications field became a main target  at negotiations over trade friction.    As a result, Nippon Ido Tsushin Corp. (IDO) was forced to  make a major compromise. Japanese businessmen, who sat at the  negotiating table while feeling that U.S. demands are  unreasonable, were once again obliged to bow to U.S. pressure.  Now, IDO has to make a significant increase in the number of  base stations for the Motorola system. Motorola successfully  managed to win more frequencies as well.    However, it was progress that Japan and the Untied States  became more willing than before to settle issues on a  private-level. Both countries need to study the differences in  feelings about "equal market access" and to deepen mutual  understanding. We hope that Japanese and American businessmen  will attach importance to their conversations to prevent public  intervention from becoming excessive.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Hertfordshire set to keep structure The Local Government Commission for England yesterday proposed that no change be made to Hertfordshire's local government structure. The proposal is subject to local consultation for two months before a final recommendation to the government. The commission also proposed, as a second preference, that four unitary councils could be created in Hertfordshire, based on mergers of the present 10 borough, city and district councils. These would be: Eastern Hertfordshire, merging the present Broxbourne borough with East Hertfordshire district; Northern Hertfordshire, merging Stevenage borough with North Hertfordshire district; Central Hertfordshire, merging Hertsmere borough, St Albans city and Welwyn Hatfield district; and Western Hertfordshire, merging Watford and Dacorum boroughs with Three Rivers district. This unitary option would cost between Pounds 29m and Pounds 34m to start up, creating annual savings after that of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m.</p>

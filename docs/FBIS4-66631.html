			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kamran Qurrah Daghi--first two paragraph </F> AL-HAYAH introduction]    [Text] A few years ago, some Israeli Kurds presented a  theatrical play by the name of "I am a Kurd." In response to a  question about the reason for choosing this name, one of those  who had taken part in the play answered saying: "We wanted to  send a message to the Israeli people telling them that it is  okay to be a Kurd."    Kamran Qurrah Daghi believes that this response is an  indication that there is a Jewish-Kurdish special relationship  that started in the year 720 BC.    Kurdish Jews in Israel cherish their Kurdish identity and  sympathize with and support Muslim Kurds. Israeli Kurds compare  the annihilation of Iraqi Kurds in the al-Anfal and Halbajah  operations in May 1988, when poisonous gas was used, to the  annihilation of Jews during the Holocaust. At the time of the  above mentioned operations, Kurdish Jews organized protest  campaigns and tried to adopt those children who were saved in  Halbajah. However, Turkey, where a large number of Iraqi Kurds  had taken refuge, refused to help Kurdish Jews reach their goals.    Moreover, Israeli Kurds tried to give humanitarian support  to  Iraqi Kurds during the refugee catastrophe in April 1991, yet,  sensitive relations with Turkey hindered that; they still do to  the present day.    Kurdish Jews state that their emigration to Israel was to  flee neither ethnic nor religious persecution, but was due to  their Zionist affiliation. Until now, they continue to have  their affiliation with Kurdistan. If Kurdish Jews are to be  compared with the Jews of Baghdad, it is found that the isolated  mountainous geographic environment has impacted the Kurdish Jews  and made them cling to Kurdish rather than to Arab or Turkish  values. Though Kurdish Jews have been in Israel for decades, the  nonreligious aspects of their culture, such as language,  customs, and social values, have not much changed.    However, as for the new generation of Kurds born in Israel,  because they have had no contact with the Kurdish society, it is  found that their understanding of Kurdish affiliation is  different from that of the generation raised in Kurdistan.  Nevertheless, the latter feel that if the current political  circumstances continue to prevail, their Kurdish life-style  might vanish in the long run.    This state of affairs made Israeli Kurds long very much for  their past Kurdish environment. It is the elderly from among  them, in particular, who are bound to feel the pain when Israeli  Kurds become cut off from their roots. Even the youths still  cling to Kurdish customs, such as food, dance, music, and even  sometimes the Kurdish language, which many of these youth insist  on learning. Moreover, Kurdish Jews in Israel are still inclined  to intermarry.    In order to remain in touch with the Kurdish culture, the  national council of the Society for Kurdish Jews in Israel in  1971 decided to organize an annual festival [Saharanah] for the  Israeli Kurdish community. This festival is a good opportunity  for them to "express their joy, brotherly feelings, and to bring  back to life the prayers, singing, dancing, food, costumes, and  life-style of this ethnic group. This culture developed over  about 3,000 years while the group lived in Kurdistan." Around  25,000 to 30,000 Kurdish Jews take part in this two-day open-air  festival. The head of state, the prime minister, and other  official dignitaries usually attend this festival. Yitzhaq  Rabin, the current prime minister, inaugurated the last festival.    Before establishing the Jewish state in 1948, there were  about 20,000 Kurdish Jews in Palestine. Between 1950 and 1951,  another 40,000 Kurdish Jews immigrated to Israel from Iranian  and Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish Jews in Israel are currently  estimated at 100,000, most of whom have come from Iraqi  Kurdistan. In Jerusalem 35,000 of the 100,000 Kurdish Jews live;  in Tiberias, 5,000; in Haifa, 7,000; and in the settlements and  the rest of Israel, about 20,000.    A number of Kurdish Jews have become prominent in Israel's  political and public life. Some of these are representatives and  prominent members of political parties and municipalities. Habib  Shaymuni [name as transliterated], current president of the  Organization for Kurdish Jews, who was born in the Iraqi Kurdish  city of 'Aqrah, was a Labor Party member of the Knesset.  However, the most prominent Kurdish Jew would be General Yitzhaq  Mordekhay, commander of the northern front, who was also born in  the city of 'Aqrah and is considered one of the most active of  Israeli Kurds.    This elite group of Kurdish politicians, lawyers, and  academicians took the initiative to establish an organization  that brought together Kurdish Jews in Israel. This organization  is especially interested in cultural activities. Besides, it  tries to establish relations with Kurds resident outside Israel.  It also supports Kurdish researchers and artists and sometimes  invites them to visit Israel. However, the activities of the  organization outside Israel remains limited, because it cannot  establish relations with Iraqi, Iranian, or Syrian Kurds. The  organization therefore has contacts only with Kurds resident  either in Europe or in the United States. Israeli Kurds can only  visit Turkish Kurdistan, which they do in disguise. Moreover,  with the worsening of the Kurdish-Turkish war, these visits have  become difficult.    Travelers and scholars who visited Kurdistan from the 12th  to  the 20th century indicated that there were Jews who shared the  life-style of Muslim Kurds living among the Muslims. This meant  that honor and disgrace were important values for Kurdish Jews  just as they were for the Kurdish society as a whole. Only  religious rituals differentiated Jews from either Christians or  Muslims in Kurdistan.    A number of Kurdish Jews immigrated to Palestine at the  beginning of the 20th century, yet, most of the rest immigrated  in the 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s. Between 1970 and  1973, about 3,000 Jews, who had remained in Baghdad, helped the  Kurds flee across the Kurdish borders to Iran, from where they  traveled to Israel. It is no secret that through Iran, Israel  offered material and military aid to the Kurdish movement in  Iraq during the 1963-74 period. The original language of the  first generation of Kurdish Jews in Israel was Aramaic, which  resembles contemporary Hebrew and is sometimes wrongly called  "Kurdish" in Israel. Their second language was Kurdish, which  was dominated by the "Karmangi" [as transliterated] dialect.  These languages were followed by Turkish, Persian, and Arabic.  However, currently, Hebrew is considered the first language for  the majority of Israeli Kurds.    It seems strange that the Israeli Kurdish environment is the  only one where the term "Kurdistan" is used officially and  legally. Many Kurds do not know which country currently rules  the region where their ancestors lived. The museum of Israel in  Jerusalem displays some samples that are described as "Kurdish"  so that they may be distinguished from "Iranian," "Turkish," or  "Iraqi."    Kurdish Jews came to this homeland in the first temple era.  Some Kurdish Jews believe that they are the descendants of the  10 Jewish tribes that the Assyrians captured and enslaved after  they destroyed the Kingdom of Israel in 720 BC. They were joined  by the Jews captured and enslaved in Babylon 150 years later.  Since that time, Jewish settlements were established in this  region. However, for geographic reasons, these settlements soon  lost contact with the Jewish centers in Babylon. However, in  spite of this isolation, Kurdish Jews managed to preserve their  religion and religious identity. In the 12th century, a  messianic movement sprang up. It was led by two false  "messiahs," Miyhim ben Shalumu ibn Ruhi [name as  transliterated][?Shlomo Molkho] and David al-Ruwi [name as  transliterated][?David Ha'renveni], after whom the Jews named  the first settlement in Kurdistan.    In the 13th century, the Moguls invaded Iraq and a large  number of Jews fled to the Kurdistan mountains where they built  settlements in protected areas. Due to the national instability  that lasted for many centuries, because of the struggle between  Kurds and Ottomans, many Jews were killed. However, Jews did not  face any religious persecution from Muslim Kurds. There were  natural social relations between Jews and Kurds; friendships  were also established between the heads of families.    Kurdish Jews had developed folklore-type literature inspired  by the Old Testament. Music using drums and flutes, which are  the two instruments common all over Kurdistan, accompanied their  dancing and singing. Like Kurds, both men and women take part in  Kurdish dancing [al-Dabkah]. Kurdish Jews verbally transmit from  one generation to another stories from their folklore, relating  historic events.    However, because there were no religious schools [Yishivot]  in Kurdistan, Jews who wished to study Judaism had to go to  Baghdad. One of the two prominent rabbis in Baghdad was of  Kurdish descent. Only a few Kurdish Jews who resided in  al-Mawsil and Karkuk could provide a European-style education  for their children after the British occupation of Iraq.    Since the beginning of the 18th century, relations have been  fostered between Kurdish Jews and Jewish centers in Palestine. A  group of Kurdish Jews immigrated to Palestine in 1812 and  resided in Jerusalem. However, the major immigration happened  after the establishment of the Jewish State in 1950 and 1951.  This immigration was known as the two campaigns of "Ezrah" and  "Nehemiah." Currently, only a few Jews are left in Iranian,  Turkish, and Syrian Kurdistan.    Will the new peace and openness between peoples open these  folders that have remained closed and abandoned for a long time?</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Forecast hits Goodyear shares Shares in Goodyear closed down at a 52-week low yesterday after the chairman of the US tyre group forecast record second-quarter earnings of between Dollars 158m and Dollars 164m, or between Dollars 1.05 and Dollars 1.09 a share. But the forecast results - which also represent a solid improvement on the same quarter a year ago, when Goodyear earned Dollars 137.6m, or 95 cents a share - were slightly lower than Wall Street had been expecting. Industry analysts had forecast that Goodyear would report earnings of between Dollars 1.10 and Dollars 1.15 a share in the quarter. It was this disappointment which prompted some investors to sell Goodyear shares yesterday. Earlier they had fallen as much as Dollars 2 to Dollars 34 3/4 but later rallied to close down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 35. Mr Stanley Gault, Goodyear's chairman, outlined the company's expectations for the second quarter in a television interview. He said sales in the period would be just over Dollars 3bn, marginally higher than a year ago. Excluding revenues from previously divested assets, however, April-to-June sales should set a record. Mr Gault also said that demand for Goodyear products in North America was strong, with plants running at near full-capacity, and that Latin American and Asian operations should report strong performances. But the European market was soft.</p>

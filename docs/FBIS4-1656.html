			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of seven lectures cosponsored by the State Economic </F> and Trade Commission and the State General Administration of  Taxation entitled: "Answers to Questions on Enterprise  Implementation of the New Tax System," moderated by Jiang  Qiangui, director of the State Economic and Trade Commission's  Enterprise Department; this one entitled: "Characteristics of  Value-Added Tax (VAT), Part One" -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Jiang] Viewers and comrades, we are  presenting today the second lecture in the series "Answers to  Questions on Enterprise Implementation of the New Tax System."  Today, we would like to discuss VAT issues. VAT yields the  largest tax revenue of all the taxes since we carried out reform  of the enterprise tax system. It accounts for about 40 percent  of total tax revenues from enterprises, or more than 60 percent  of total tax revenue from all industrial and commercial  undertakings. Enterprises, therefore, are very interested in  any reform of this tax. Chen Jie, deputy director of the State  General Administration of Taxation's Circulation Tax Department,  will you please tell us the differences between the old and the  new VAT?    [Chen] There are many differences between the old and the  new VAT. The major ones are: First, the old VAT only applied  to certain industrial end-products. We only levied product tax  and VAT, with each accounting for about 50 percent of total  industrial tax revenue. We did not previously charge VAT on  wholesaling and retailing processes. They were only subject to  business tax. Under the new VAT system, however, we have  imposed VAT on all processes, including production, wholesaling,  and retailing. This is the first variation.    Second, we have considerably reduced and thoroughly assessed  tax rates. In the past we had more than 30 different rates for  product tax and VAT. The figure was even higher if you include  rates for wholesaling and retailing processes too. Under the  new VAT system, we have only two rates, a basic rate of 17  percent and a low rate of 13 percent.    Third, we have changed the taxable bases or foundations on  which we levy taxes. Previously, we included taxes such as  product tax, VAT, and business tax in the sale price. Under the  new VAT system, we have listed taxes on all the processes,  including production, wholesaling, and retailing, separately  from the sale price.    Fourth, we have implemented a system of tax refunds  according  to invoices. In other words, when selling commodities,  enterprises should issue to buyers a special VAT invoice,  listing the sales price exclusive of tax, and VAT. When  applying for tax refunds after making the purchase, buyers can  only quote the tax payments listed on the invoices. Previously,  we did not use invoices when handling VAT refunds: The value of  a tax refund is equal to an enterprise's purchase price of  commodities or procurement cost multiplied by the deductible tax  rate.    Fifth, we have made remarkable improvements in tax reduction  or exemption: 1. The number of items eligible for tax reduction  or exemption has been greatly reduced. 2. Tax reduction or  exemption for individual enterprises has been revoked.  Previously, an enterprise with difficulties could apply for tax  exemption, but that is forbidden under the new tax system.    Why have we instituted these five changes? The reasons are  as follows: We want to fully incorporate the principle of  equitable taxpaying. Under the old tax system, for instance,  product tax was levied in accordance with sales revenues and  [words indistinct]; it was charged in accordance with various  sales prices at every stage without any deduction. Therefore,  the more specialized an enterprise's processes were, the heavier  tax burden it shouldered. The more generalized an enterprise's  processes were, the lighter the tax burden. This was unfair.    Another seemingly unfair aspect was that among enterprises  producing identical products, some had to pay tax in accordance  with regulations, while others qualified for tax reduction or  exemption. Such injustice was gravely detrimental to rational  competition among enterprises. [passage omitted]    With a built-in mechanism to beat tax evasion, the new VAT  system will greatly increase tax revenue and be easier to  manage. The new tax system requires that, when making a sale,  an enterprise must issue an invoice listing the tax paid. When  applying for tax refunds after making the purchase, the buyer  can only quote the tax payment listed on the invoice. If the  vendor evades tax, he cannot list the tax payment on the  invoice; consequently, the buyer will not be eligible for a tax  refund. The buyer will, therefore, insist that the vendor issue  him an invoice listing tax payment.

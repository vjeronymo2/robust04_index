Kukan, Slovakia's permanent representative to the UN up to  date, said Slovak-Czech relations were good and that it was  necessary to rule out beforehand any possible disputes.    Slovak diplomacy will also continue to focus on the gradual  integration into European structures, creation of good  neighborly relations and contribution to the country's economic  development, Kukan said.    He said he would also see to the most effective possible  functioning of the existing diplomatic representations abroad  whose staffs are limited due to financial reasons. In this  connection Kukan did not rule dismissals of some diplomats.</p>

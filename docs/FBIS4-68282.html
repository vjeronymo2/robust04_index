			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Dokuchayev: "The Russian Army: Footnote </F> to Assessments and Conclusions"]    [Text] The Creation of the Russian Armed Forces began  on May 7, 1992  <H5>  Military Review </H5>   Judging from the many press articles, the Russian Army is  today the focus of attention of experts and analysts both  Russian and foreign. Their assessments strongly diverge. Some  believe that the Russian Armed Forces pose a threat to the  security of some neighboring states, while others conclude that  the Russian military is today incapable of performing its  mission of protecting the Fatherland. There are many opinions,  but only one truth. What is it then?    Before that, a word about one assessment, that of the  President. He believes that the Russian Armed Forces are  presently combat-ready and as a whole are accomplishing their  assigned missions. That is what it says in the presidential  Message to the Federal Assembly.    But now, let us distance ourselves for a time from the  official assessment and conclusions of various independent and  dependent experts and analysts, and let us try to see, through  the prism of factual material, what baggage the Russian Army has  carried with it to its two-year anniversary. Here then are the  facts.    In the Russian Army, basic reliance is placed on the  Strategic Nuclear Forces (SYaS), which deter an aggressor from  unleashing large-scale wars against Russia, and no less  importantly, allow us to reorganize the General-Purpose Forces.  Undoubtedly one can speak of existing difficulties encountered  in the Russian SYaS. In the Strategic Rocket Forces (RVSN), for  example, today they are doing the difficult job of withdrawing  missile units from the territories of Belarus and Kazakhstan.  But there is no reason to doubt the combat capacity of the  Russian SYaS and their readiness to perform the mission assigned  to them. Incidentally, dozens of journalists who were invited to  the ceremony assigning three missile regiments, armed with the  mobile RS-12M (Topol) missile systems, to the RVSN were  convinced of this just recently.    The General-Purpose Forces have also been transformed in  these two years. Today, in the military lexicon it is  increasingly rare to hear regrets being voiced about the fact  that the best troops, the troops of the border districts of  yesterday's still-united power have been left in the near  abroad. And this is primarily because the Russian western  districts, the Northern Caucasus, Moscow and Leningrad  districts, are being qualitatively transformed.    And one other thing about the new quality of the  General-Purpose Forces: The principle of mobile defense, which  was made the basis for creation of the troop groupings (it  presupposes the availability of small but adequately strong  forces ready for operational use wherever there is a real threat  to Russian security) has acquired tangible outlines. The active  creation of Mobile Forces, as a new inter-service  operational-strategic formation of the Russian Army, has begun.    Reform year 1994. In order to create qualitatively new  Armed Forces which meet the demands of the present  military-political situation in the world and their tendencies  of development, and [correspond to] the real degree of military  danger to Russia, in 1994 the main tasks will be:     -  continuation of the development of troop (force) groupings  and infrastructure on the territory of the Russian  Federation    -  conclusion of the withdrawal of troops (forces) to  the territory of Russia    -  creation of Mobile Forces    -  conduct of  research to justify the structure, composition and numerical  strength of the Armed Forces for the period after  1995    -  development of a concept of development of the RF Armed  Forces from 1996 to the year 2000 and in the future up to the  year 2005.        Another fact. Despite the costs incurred by the start of the  development of the Armed Forces and the grave economic situation  of the country, questions of combat readiness and operational  and mobilization training were resolved with rare persistence  and consistency. In 1993, according to official statements, the  Russian Army moved to a new system of combat readiness. After  this came a chain of major exercises and training sessions at  the strategic level. These were conducted by the Minister of  Defense and his deputies. To name just a few: the command-staff  exercises "Zapad," "Tsenter," and "Vostok," the strategic  training sessions to repel an aerospace attack, and in command  and control of the SYaS and the Armed Forces as a whole. Around  100 operational exercises and training sessions were conducted  under the leadership of the CINCs of the Armed Services and the  commanders of military districts and fleets. Operational and  mobilization training were directed toward assimilation of the  new system of combat readiness and the newly developed  operational plans of the troops and naval forces.    Reform Year 1994. The most important task is  maintaining units and tactical formations in combat readiness  and combat capability at a level ensuring the protection of the  state under any conditions, and accomplishment of the tasks  defined by the Basic Provisions of Military Doctrine.    In the four months of 1994, the plans for training of troops  and naval forces were basically accomplished. Two command-staff  training sessions were held at the strategic level, more than  ten command-staff training sessions at the operational-strategic  level, and the regional command-staff exercises "Baykal" and  "Severo-Zapad" were held.    Before the end of the training year, plans are to conduct  one  training session in command and control of the Strategic Nuclear  Forces, and a number of front command-staff exercises and the  operational-rear exercise "Zapad."    These exercises help prevent a reduction in the level of  combat readiness, promote proficiency of the troops and naval  forces and coordination of the command and control elements and  troops withdrawn to Russian territory to new garrison points.    The Russian Army is demonstrating its combat capacity not  only in exercises. Its units and tactical formations are  successfully accomplishing peacekeeping functions in accordance  with the international obligations of our country. Two separate  Russian battalions are helping to keep the peace in Yugoslavia.  Units of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division, garrisoned in  Tajikistan, are participating with the Collective Peacekeeping  Forces in guarding and defending the Tajik-Afghan border and the  most important economic installations; in patrolling, escorting  columns with humanitarian cargoes, and acting as a guarantor of  peace and security in the region. There are peacekeeping efforts  of Russian subunits in Pridnestrovye, South Ossetia, and  Abkhazia. A total of more than 16 thousand service members have  been put into action in the "hot spots."    These examples are just a fraction of the components that go  into the combat capacity of the Russian Army and the degree of  work that has been done in two years to reform the units and  tactical formations inherited from the USSR Armed Forces. Let me  focus the attention of the reader on this point. Today there is  a lot of talk about the great manpower shortage of subunits and  units, which affects their combat capability. Today this is  problem number one. But paradoxical as it may seem, it is being  resolved. The manning of the subunits has increased in two  years, and is currently at around the 65% level. And this  while  the existing legislation allows the drafting of scarcely more  than 20% of conscripts.    This breakthrough became possible because reliance was put  in  time on a mixed manning system, by contract and conscription. At  present there are more than 160 thousand professionals in  uniform.    Reform Year 1994: The draft remains the basis of  manning. However, around 80% of young men have legal  grounds  for exemption or deferment from conscription (in other states  they are no more than 20-30% of conscripts). For this  reason,  there are high hopes in the program for manning the army and  navy with contract service members.    In 1994, 150 thousand professionals will be selected,  of them 14 thousand women.    In speaking of the Russian Army today, one must say that its  development and the course of military reform as a whole are  associated with many difficulties which are objective in nature.  Thus, the creation of troop groupings is directly linked to the  laborious task of withdrawing units and tactical formations to  the territory of Russia. (In 1993, for example, more than 100  thousand service members were withdrawn, more than 5 thousand  pieces of armored equipment and artillery systems, and around  700 combat planes and helicopters). The withdrawal of units and  formations requires their accommodation and creation of new  elements of the infrastructure. What is the result? Despite the  fact that the withdrawal of troops is being implemented  according to plan, in accordance with the schedules that were  devised, it is significantly outstripping the rate of [troop]  accommodation. While in 1992 there were 98 thousand service  families lacking apartments, today there are more than 120  thousand. These figures cannot be heard without pain. Not only  are apartments in short supply, but also the corresponding  elements of the infrastructure, academic, material and technical  facilities, and much else.    The leadership of the Armed Forces aims to prevent a  critical  military-technical and technological lag behind the developed  states of the world in the main areas of development of military  equipment. Despite this fact, because of the cut in the military  budget, the purchases of the latest weapon models have been  reduced. Here, it is not irrelevant to point out that, as was  noted at a press conference by the Defense Minister, General of  the Army Pavel Grachev, today the Russian Army allows itself  only those expenses without which it cannot get along, and which  are associated with supporting the activity of the troops and  personnel. There have been substantial changes in the structure  of the military budget, and its tendency toward reorientation in  the direction of the social sphere is clearly evident.    Reorientation of the military budget is not a tribute to  fashion, but is a forced measure associated with tight  financing--especially since it is necessary to accomplish a  truly state-level task, safeguarding the prestige of serving in  the Armed Forces. As you know, our Army has always drawn its  strength from its people. Approaches toward accomplishing this  task today are defined, and consist in an able combination of  legislative means, financial and material incentives, and  propaganda and educational measures. While the approaches have  been determined, the main work lies ahead.    Problems, difficulties, problems. There are many of them.  But  for all that, it seems to me that the Russian Army has arrived  at its second anniversary as an army which is gathering combat  might, an army capable of accomplishing its mission of defending  the Russian state.</p>

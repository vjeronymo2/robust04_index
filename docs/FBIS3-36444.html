			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Political scientist Viktor Bondarev article: "Reading TRUD </F> Mailbag. Not So Much `For' As `Against'"]    [Text] Journalists, politicians, and scientists have been  given various explanations for the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon."  But what do the voters themselves think, how do they account  for their choice, and what are they saying in their letters to  the newspaper?    Many people believe that "voters voted not for Zhirinovskiy  but against the ruling team's inability to cope with reforms"  (V. Ogorodnikov, Kemerovo). A. Medyantsev from Yekaterinburg  says effectively the same thing: "People only voted for  Zhirinovskiy because he highlighted society's sore points to  which our leaders are deaf." The question is that many people's  living standard has been reduced to the lowest possible level  and they have been made the dregs of society. It is a question  of specific things like, for instance, losing savings as a  result of "shock therapy." Here is one of the most emotional  letters: "You made us all beggars. Had I been able to get my  hands on Gaydar, I would have gone for the jugular," an elderly  woman living in the north, who has lost both her savings and the  chance of ever leaving there, writes. Another newspaper reader  remembers the "Moskvich, for which I had saved for a long time  and almost bought; but that hope has vanished like the mist."    People are equally indignant at the ineffectiveness of the  fight against crime: "When the militia shrugs helplessly in  response to calls for help and officials do not even deign to  answer your complaint, there is no question of whom to vote  for...." (L. Shlyapnikova, Perm).    Or: "Total license, bribe-taking, robbery, treachery,  racketeering, pavement sex, a low birth rate, high mortality,  rising unemployment, the bankruptcy of even profitable  enterprises, the bankruptcy of our military-industrial complex,  murders, assaults for virtually everyone to see, homeless people  picking through garbage heaps -- Russian citizens are opposed to  all this and protest where they can" (A. Kuznetsova, Irkutsk).  Admittedly, the last letter indicates not so much that the  person is unhappy but rather that they actively read newspapers.    It is hard to agree with Yekaterinburg resident A.  Medyantsev's viewpoint in this connection -- he says that the  government "is not aware of the sore points" in society. Not at  all: Everyone is aware of these sore points, even the  illiterates who merely enumerate our socioeconomic ills. The  causes of and the means of escaping from the crisis most  speedily are another matter.    As I read letters from people lusting for violence against  the powers that be, I remembered the events of late last  century: There was an epidemic in Russia, and the peasants  murdered the doctors because they thought they were to blame for  their misfortunes. The situation with our reforms is a similar  one although, thank God, reformers are not yet being murdered....    While agreeing (how can you disagree!) in many respects with  TRUD readers and sharing their indignation and perplexity at the  obvious distortions with the implementation of reforms, I would  nonetheless also point out that we have surprisingly short  memories. Two years ago we were in a crush waiting in line for  vodka and sugar, we were moreover crushed in a very real sense  when we tried to exchange ration cards for goods. The stores  were completely empty. Mobs blocked streets and boulevards  demanding cigarettes. There were shortages of bread, butter,  and meat, while cheese no longer seemed to be produced in the  country at all. There was not even any milk for young children.  If there were rubles, there was nothing to do with them.    The economy went great guns [shla vraznos] between May  1991, when Pavlov and Ryzhkov tried unsuccessfully to "regulate"  prices, and this December: Barter and exchange in kind  prevailed and oblasts posted militia cordons on their borders to  ensure that foodstuffs did not "overflow" from one region to  another. Why have we forgotten this?    If anyone brought the economy down, it was the people who  directed it by Bolshevik distributive-administrative methods and  the hapless reformers of the Gorbachev era.    Needless to say, Gaydar also had "a part to play." But, to  be fair, he came along at a time when no one wanted to assume  responsibility.... It is not for nothing that his policy is  called "shock" policy. It was indeed an attempt at treatment  using overly severe means. Did Yegor Gaydar and his "buddies"  cure the economy? No. But at least a "fatal outcome" may have  been averted for a while.    Admittedly, this was not only therapy, but by no means  entirely well-considered surgery, resulting in a drastic drop in  the production of many kinds of output and a host of enterprises  ending up on the verge of bankruptcy.    People are saying that Gaydar is a monetarist, who follows  the recommendation of his U.S. masters blindly, and his policy  of "financial stabilization" could have actually destroyed the  country. But here are Russia's budget figures for the fourth  quarter of 1993: income -- 15 trillion rubles [R], expenditure  -- R22 trillion. Thus the state spends R3 for every R2 it  receives. But you cannot spend what you do not have. This is  the result not only of Gaydar's miscalculations but also of  pressure from his enemies and their demands that he spend as  much as necessary for "social equilibrium."    Judging from the letters, Zhirinovskiy's promises to restore  people's lost savings made a particular impression on many  people. The authorities also say from time to time that they  will repay their debts -- the latest presidential edict promises  something of the kind. But something has obviously not been  thought through here! In actual fact nothing can simply be  accomplished in a fairly rapid timeframe. Before 1992 people  had around R300 billion in savings, so should they today be  given R300 trillion (since today's R1000 is roughly equivalent  to the former ruble)? Russian produced output, so-called GDP,  was worth around 100 trillion rubles for the whole of last year.    So, three times as much as the entire country produces in a  year has to be repaid? Is that possible now? The answer is  obvious. Nevertheless some action is needed. And here the  government is to blame for not being inventive enough in finding  at least a partial solution to the situation. For instance, all  savings could be registered as a state debt, a state loan to be  paid off over so many years. As for Zhirinovskiy's proposals  regarding switching to repaying lost savings "in noncash form,"  I suggest that you take a look at any newspaper that carries  advertisements. There are plenty of "encashment" offers there.  That, is noncash money rapidly becomes cash ,and then what  happens to prices?    By voting for Zhirinovskiy people were often protesting  against the price that has to be paid for securing a market  economy and true democracy. However, you can see something  else. There are plenty of people who think Zhirinovskiy is the  person who will (maybe) save the country. They were impressed  by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's way of  dealing with voters: "On television he spoke not to everyone at  once, like certain turncoat Communists, but as it were to  everyone individually" (anonymous letter). Another reader is  convinced that "If Zhirinovskiy does not betray his election  promises and implements a policy in the interests of Russian  citizens and Russia, he will move mountains" (V. Bushuyev,  Krasnodar Kray).    A number of other (more ironic, shall we say) people express  partial solidarity with him: "The Zhirinovskiy option, the  'stick and carrot' option suits us more in these conditions.  And when he runs for president, you see, he will poll 90  percent of the vote." (G. Kozharskiy, Rostov Oblast). Thus,  some people do not merely reject "shock therapy" but also see  the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" as an alternative. A bad  mistake!...    Incidentally, for some reason no one is paying attention to  the name of the party led by Vladimir Volfovich -- the "Liberal  Democratic Party." If readers are so unhappy with the  democrats, why do they trust a "Liberal Democrat"? After all,  who are these Liberal Democrats. They are people who presumably  are in favor of using Western models for organizing society and  the economy. In principle most democrats would most likely  subscribe to this party's slogans and postulates (I will not  venture to judge the program -- is there one?). But "Liberal  Democracy" as practiced by Vladimir Volfovich is a strange  thing: For some reason there are lots of Communists in his  party. The businessman Zavidiya, the LDPR's former chief  financier, is a Communist. Deputy Lukava, who as an elder  opened the Duma session speaking on behalf of the LDPR faction,  is a Communist. And some of this faction's other deputies are,  as it were, members of two parties at once. Hasn't Vladimir  Volfovich got confused with the name of his party...?    But if Zhirinovskiy is not a Liberal Democrat, what is he  then? Let me cite a few quotations from a book: "Troubles for  Russia have always come and will always come from the south...  We must carry out this operation code-named the Last Dash  to the South. Our Army will perform this task. This will  be a method of ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole;  it will be the basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army.  New armed forces can be reborn only as a result of a combat  operation. But the whole world must believe that, if Russia has  to do this, it is fine. You have to proceed from the majority  will. It is to the advantage of the majority of mankind for the  Muslim world to be carved up [rassechen].... And across this  new space to the shore of the Indian Ocean everybody will speak  Russian...." These are extracts from Zhirinovskiy's book  entitled Last Dash to the South. The author says that  this is the "juice of my brain."    Some readers are indignant that the views of their elected  representative are often described as profascist. "Since the  elections people have been insulting not only the LDPR and the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation but also those who  voted for them. We voters are called sheep, fascists, fools"  (A. Khlebova in Volgograd). "You are frightening us once again  with the advent of fascism in Russia. Perhaps we have had  enough of being frightened. There is no need to pigeonhole Mr.  Zhirinovskiy; we have already experienced that...," others say.    Yes, but if you agree with Zhirinovskiy's ideas and support  the conquest of Afghanistan and Turkey, what kind of person are  you...? Hitler called for eastward expansion, and Vladimir  Volfovich is not averse to annexing the south. Admittedly, the  people who voted for him stress that he is proposing to do all  this by nonviolent means: "He is promising to revive Russia not  by force but by other means, making it rich, and the process  will happen on its own. Zhirinovskiy believes that we should  drive to the Indian Ocean with the minimum use of force, since  he believes that the countries involved will join us  themselves." (L. Vedrov, Saratov). But how will this happen?  Why would other peoples, those Afghans who fought the USSR for  instance, suddenly join us voluntarily? Who can believe that?  If we are right in our reading of Zhirinovskiy, who is coming  up with these fantasies, it is hard to believe that sensible  Russian people are willing to give power to that kind of man.  But some are....    ...In 1917 virtually the same percentage of Russian citizens  voted for the Bolsheviks in the Constituent Assembly elections.  The civil war with its millions of casualties began soon after.    But Russian citizens say in amazement: "Many democrats seem  mere children on television" and "Why are you fussing, guys?"  Others say: "The people have decided.... Should you be  reproaching the people" (Yu. Vasnetsov, Yekaterinburg).  Zhirinovskiy has promised to turn virtually the whole world  into an area of combat operations, while the good-humored  writers of other letters take political scientists and  journalists to task: "Don't you dare insult the people's  elected representative." If someone is extremely fond of  Zhirinovskiy I suggest that they remember the film "Seventeen  Moments of Spring." There are so many smart and in their own  way extremely sympathetic national-socialists in it (Mueller and  Schellenberg, for instance) who had no intention of doing a lot  of fighting -- all they intended was a blitzkrieg, without  balking at casualties, and then utter peace and prosperity for  the German people. Admittedly things did turn out differently.    Most Russian citizens voted against Gaydar's scenario for  reforms on 12 December. But what did they vote for? It is  indeed necessary to realistically assess the serious  miscalculations and to rectify the mistakes of the first phase  of reform in Russia, but nonetheless not to recoil from but to  stick to the market course (mindful of world experience and  Russian conditions and traditions). And not to trust political  magicians who promise "easy" routes to prosperity that may cause  a great deal of bloodshed.</p>

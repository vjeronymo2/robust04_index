			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / A long and winding road: Democratic niceties will have to wait in S Africa South African politicians were quick to tell their followers that Tuesday's decision to establish a limited multiracial interim government was a significant step on the road to democracy. They forgot to mention a fact that has become increasingly clear in recent weeks: that the two leading negotiating parties, the African National Congress and the National party, foresee no straight path to democracy. Leading figures in both parties envisage a wide detour into illiberal territory almost immediately after the first multiracial elections next year. They seem likely to impose a tough security crackdown as one of the first acts of a power-sharing government of national unity: and in a society obsessed by fear of widespread violence, most voters would probably thank them for doing so. Indeed, Wednesday's massacre of about 30 blacks at taxi ranks near Johannesburg - which came barely 24 hours after Tuesday's deal - can only strengthen the hand of those who favour tough measures. At least in the short term, South Africans are likely to be voting on April 27 next year to swap one form of authoritarian government for another: more broadly based, more legitimate, certainly more effective - but no more saintly than the current incumbents. The democratic niceties will have to wait upon the overwhelming need to restore stability. Baffled by the complexities of the constitutional negotiations, and confused by the intricate deals aimed at cementing the power sharing, most South Africans spend their time worrying about personal security - not democracy. Little can be done before the elections to stem the violence that has left 10,000 blacks (and scores of white farmers, diners and churchgoers) dead in political violence since Mr Nelson Mandela left prison in 1990. Indeed, as political competition intensifies ahead of the elections - which the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and ultra-right Conservative party plan to boycott - the death toll can only rise. The consensus emerging among the ANC and the NP is to forge ahead to elections, however unfree and unfair, on the principle that no delay will make them freer or fairer. Neither side dares risk a postponement, unless relatively minor. So South Africa hurtles headlong towards elections, less than eight months away, without a constitution under which to hold the poll. There is no agreement on any of the crucial issues: of how power is to be shared between the centre and the regions, or between the ANC and the National party; of how the increasingly obstructive Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom party can be satisfied; or of how the threat of Afrikaner nationalism can be defused. Even the Transitional Executive Council - that tentative first step to democracy - cannot be set up until a constitution is agreed. And agreement on the TEC itself was only reached after delegates de-cided to move out of their hotel rooms and cancel subsequent negotiating sessions, to leave no alternative but agreement before bedtime. Multi-party talks will now focus on the first post-apartheid constitution, which has already gone through many permutations. Delegates believe it will be agreed by the end of October, but there is a significant chance of delay, dangerously jeopardising the election date. Two significant issues will determine when agreement is reached, and whether the constitution has broad enough legitimacy to prevent civil war: the distribution of power between central government and regions, and the role of the National party in cabinet. The current constitutional draft offers little in the way of devolution of power to regions: regional governments would have exclusive powers over only relatively minor areas such as gambling, traffic, language, culture and markets. Chief Buthelezi and other homeland (or regional) leaders contemptuously dismiss what they see as an offer to issue their own dog licences, and demand exclusive control over regional policing and other controversial areas. Government officials hope that both Chief Buthelezi and the Afrikaner Volksfront (an umbrella right-wing group which has gained strong white support in recent weeks) can be accommodated by giving some regions more powers than others. But it is anybody's guess whether Chief Buthelezi will settle for autonomous local policing and perhaps a home guard for his regional base Natal - or even whether the ANC will offer it. The latter pays lip service to the need to accommodate the Zulu chief; but his increasingly aggressive behaviour raises questions over whether he is genuinely seeking a deal. Pretoria and foreign governments alike are exasperated with his threats of civil war, and his refusal to compromise. Over the next few weeks, the government must negotiate with the ANC to make an offer Chief Buthelezi cannot refuse - and hope that he sees fit to accept it. Equally difficult will be the task of persuading the Afrikaner Volksfront of retired General Constand Viljoen that Afrikaner autonomy can be gained without violence. So long as Gen Viljoen insists that blacks cannot be full citizens in an Afrikaner region, there will be no deal; but if he leaves the current round of talks without a deal on autonomy, his constituency may look to more militant leaders. If neither Inkatha nor the white right can be brought on board, even the toughest crackdown could be insufficient to restore law and order - especially if the Zulus and the Afrikaners strengthen their current tactical alliance, and opt for violent resistance. That leaves the question of the National party's role in the first post-apartheid government. The ANC has already agreed that it will share power with its former oppressors; but debate continues over how to ensure that whites (through the National party) have what amounts to a veto over important cabinet decisions. This could be done by making Mr FW de Klerk the vice-president under Mr Mandela, and giving him veto powers over, for example, the budget and national security. Government sources appear willing to accept such a veto might be necessary only for the first two years of the five-year government of national unity; after that, a three-quarters or even two-thirds vote in cabinet might suffice. And, significantly, it seems unlikely that there will be any constitutional provision for power-sharing after the initial five-year period: the National party will hope to make itself indispensable to the ANC in that period - but not to force it to share power beyond 1999. Somehow, the ANC and government must make a deal on this issue; for they must work together if South Africa is to have any hope of stability - not to mention the chance to give true democracy a try.</p>

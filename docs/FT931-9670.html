			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Lottery could generate jobs THE PLANNED National Lottery will generate many jobs, according to a report for the National Heritage Department. About 1,000 jobs will be created in the lottery organisation and hundreds more in the marketing, printing, computing and security industries, according to the report by GAH Consultants, a media consultancy. Projects funded by lottery revenue will also create thousands more jobs, particularly in the construction industry, the report says. Lottery revenue will pay for capital projects in the arts, heritage, and sports sectors and projects for the millenium celebrations in 2000. Overall the report, based on a survey of more than 30 national and state lotteries, concludes that there is potential for a national lottery and the football pools to co-exist. However, it says that the pools sector could lose 17.5 per cent of its revenue over three years and 1,100 jobs if it does not make changes in management and marketing to meet the competition from the national lottery. It says pools companies in other countries went out of business when faced with a national lottery, but others had made changes and survived. A summary of the findings has been made available to the Commons committee looking into the national lottery by the National Heritage Department, but the whole report has been kept confidential because it contains commercial information. The research shows that a national lottery would appeal throughout the UK, to both sexes and to all socio-economic groups.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ANDERSON STAYS SUMMERTIME HOT AS PALOS VERDES ROMPS TO 9-3 WIN  </P> <P> Blake Anderson, Palos Verdes High School's man for all seasons, was at it again  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Anderson, quarterback for the Bay League co-champion football team and a  defender on the Southern Section 4-A champion soccer team, made the big plays  to help the Sea Kings defeat Leuzinger, 9-3, in a Bay League baseball game at  Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Anderson hit a solo home run to center field in the third inning to tie the  score, 3-3, and stole home in the fifth when Palos Verdes scored twice to take  a 5-3 lead. He finished with two hits and two runs batted in.  </P> <P> The senior catcher collected two hits Monday in a 16-11 non-league victory over  Redondo.  </P> <P> "He is swinging the bat really well," said Coach Gil Eberhard, whose team  improved to 11-6 overall and 5-2 in league play, good for a second-place tie  with Rolling Hills and Torrance. Beverly Hills is in first place at 6-1.  </P> <P> Right-hander Steve Hoye went the distance to even his league record at 2-2. He  allowed seven hits and one earned run, and helped himself offensively with two  hits and two runs scored.  </P> <P> Pat O'Hara also had two hits, and Jason Goldberg keyed a four-run sixth for the  Sea Kings with a two-run single.  </P> <P> Leuzinger fell to 2-5 in league play.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills 10, Hawthorne 2 -- Ryan Buxton's pinch-hit, bases-loaded double  highlighted a six-run fourth inning, and right-hander Kirt Kishita hurled his  fifth consecutive complete-game victory to lead the Titans at Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Buxton, a sophomore, drove in three runs with his double, as Rolling Hills  battled back from a 2-1 deficit. Stefan Wahlstron and Ben Schneider each added  two RBIs for the Titans, who evened their overall mark at 8-8 and maintained a  second-place mark of 5-2 in the Bay League.  </P> <P> Wahlstron was four-for-four, including two doubles, while Schneider batted  two-for-two.  </P> <P> Kishita (5-3), a junior who has gone the distance in all eight of his  decisions, allowed eight hits, struck out eight and walked five.  </P> <P> Hawthorne slipped to 8-13 overall and 0-7 in league play.  </P> <P> Culver City 4, West Torrance 2 -- Left-hander Mauricio Estavil, who pitched a  no-hitter against West last season, struck out 17 to pace the first-place  Centaurs to an Ocean League victory at Culver City.  </P> <P> "He had us totally off-balance," said West Coach Dick McGrath, whose team fell  to 6-9 overall and 4-3 in league play. "My guys were missing the ball by six  inches. It wasn't even close. He was very impressive."  </P> <P> Estavil, who gave up five hits, won his fourth league game without a loss, as  Culver City improved to 6-1 in the Ocean League standings.  </P> <P> Estavil walked home both of West's runs.  </P> <P> North Torrance 5, South Torrance 4 -- The Saxons jumped to a 5-0 lead and held  off the Spartans for an Ocean League win at South.  </P> <P> The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for South (6-9 overall and 3-4 in  league play). North, which allowed four hits, improved to 8-9 and 2-4.  </P> <P> Banning 14, Crenshaw 1 -- Julian Pardo and Sal Areyan each had three RBIs, and  right-hander Mike Busby allowed five hits and struck out 10 to pace the Pilots  to an easy Southern-Pacific Conference victory at Banning.  </P> <P> Pardo was two for three with a home run and a double, while Areyan went three  for four with a triple and double as Banning improved to 11-7 overall and 7-3  in conference play.  </P> <P> Busby (6-3), the South Bay leader with 91 strikeouts in 62 innings, turned a  triple play in the third inning. With the bases loaded, the junior struck out  the batter. The ball got past the catcher, but bounced off the backstop toward  Busby, who tagged out the runner breaking for home. Busby then threw out the  runner at first, who had run halfway to second before discovering the runner at  second was still on the base.  </P> <P> Carson 6, Dorsey 1 -- Junior left-hander Marco Martinez pitched a three-hitter  at Rancho Cienega Playground to help the Colts extend their unbeaten streak to  nine games.  </P> <P> Sophomore David Mauney belted a two-run homer in the third to highlight an  eight-hit attack for Carson, which improved to 10-3-2 overall and 7-1-2 in the  Southern-Pacific Conference, good for a 1 1/2-game lead.  </P> <P> Washington 5, San Pedro 3 -- The upset at Washington knocked the Pirates out of  second place in the Southern-Pacific Conference. San Pedro is 9-7-2 overall and  5-4-1 in conference play, 2 1/2 games behind first-place Carson.  </P></p>

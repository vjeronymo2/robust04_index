			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Probe into FFr1.2bn bid to take control of Fnac THE FUTURE of Fnac, one of France's largest retail groups and the leading force in the music and books market, has been flung into doubt with the announcement of an official investigation into a bid for control of the group. The Commission des Operations des Bourse (COB), the Paris stock market watchdog, has ordered a formal inquiry into the price of the FFr1.2bn (Dollars 198m) bid for a controlling 54.78 per cent stake in Fnac tabled last month by Altus Finances, a subsidiary of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, and Phenix, the property company owned by the Generale des Eaux industrial concern. Altus and Phenix agreed a deal under which they have an option, until October 11, to buy the stake from Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires (GMF), the financial group that owns 80 per cent of Fnac. At FFr2,928 a share the deal values Fnac at FFr2.4bn. The option means that GMF, which needs to raise cash to compensate for losses in other businesses, has until October to find alternative capital, should it decide to retain control of Fnac. Fnac, which owns 40 shops in Europe, made net profits of FFr156m on sales of FFr8.2bn in its last financial year. It dominates the music and books market in France, where it has been embroiled in a high-profile battle against Virgin, the UK leisure group which is making inroads into French retailing. GMF's financial problems were well-publicised and a number of other retail groups, including Pinault-Printemps in France and Bertelsmann of Germany, had expressed interest in Fnac before the announcement of the Altus/Phenix deal. Mr Francois Pinault, founder of Pinault-Printemps, has since confirmed that he would still be interested in investing in Fnac. The Altus/Phenix bid has been put on ice until the COB investigation is completed. A provisional completion date has been set for early September. In the meantime, Fnac's shares will remain suspended.</p>

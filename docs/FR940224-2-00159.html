There will be two separate exchange programs, and American organizations are invited to submit proposals for one or both. One program will be for 10 to 12 educators from the Middle East and North Africa; the other program will be for 10 to 12 educators from South Asia. The journalism educators will come to the United States for an intensive, six-week study program in American journalism education, with emphasis on curriculum development, the relationship of education to the practice of journalism, the development of professionalism in journalism, and an introduction to American print media, from student publications at the university and secondary school levels to substantive contact with newspapers. During the second phase of each exchange program, two teams of two American journalism educators will travel to selected countries for consultations with phase one participants and their colleagues. Each team will visit two or three countries and will focus on curriculum development and the establishment of student publications as an educational device. These target countries will be selected through consultations among USIA, USIS posts and the program organizer after completion of the first program component. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested applicants are urged to read the complete  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals.

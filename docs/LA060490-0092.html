			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: FEAR, LOATHING AND CONFUSION IN POLITICAL TV AD BLITZ  </P> <P> My wife is running for president of our homeowners' association. So we put  together a little ad campaign.  </P> <P>  We're all friends and neighbors here, God-fearing folks and good Americans  living decent lives in Norman Rockwell country. We like and respect each other.  We chat across the back fences, have cozy block parties, borrow eggs and sugar  from the family next door and car pool together. So the ad campaign is nice and  clean. It's not much, really. Strictly small time. Hardly worth mentioning. A  modest flier under every door. It begins like this:  </P> <P>  MY OPPONENT IS A MURDERER!!!  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's a bad dream, another nightmare from which I awaken in a sweat!  </P> <P> I'm having them regularly, the result of overexposure to the orgy of political  ads threading TV in advance of Tuesday's statewide election.  </P> <P> Take the Democratic gubernatorial chase, for example. Pretty please!  </P> <P> The other night, I watched Dianne Feinstein's ad showing deputies carrying a  covered body up a hillside, you know, the tasteful spot that stops just short  of charging that Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp is personal friends with mass  murderers. Then I watched Van de Kamp's ad with Ralph Nader accusing Feinstein  of being a "Republican in Democratic clothing."  </P> <P> The ads produce back-to-back nightmares.  </P> <P> Dream 1: Not only was Van de Kamp soft on the Hillside Strangler case while  district attorney of Los Angeles County in 1981, he and Nader are Hillside  Stranglers.  </P> <P> Dream 2: The candidate on the screen attacking Van de Kamp is Bart Simpson in  Feinstein's clothing.  </P> <P> The weekend turns out to be especially painful, as candidates blitz the  airwaves in a bold last-minute attempt to fuzz the issues and confuse voters.  </P> <P> As James Garner says in an ad opposing Props 118 and 119: "You've heard the  campaign rhetoric." Right, again and again.  </P> <P> After sorting through the weekend's crush of commercials, I now have a clear  idea of what Tuesday's election is about:  </P> <P> For the third consecutive year, not only has Acura "outranked every other  automobile in America," but "since Elton Gallegly went to Washington, not a  single federal dollar has trickled back for home-town projects" that support  Calvin Klein's political cronies who are "spending a million dollars of trial  lawyer money on unfair negative advertising."  </P> <P> What's more, state Treasurer Tom Hayes has "the experience to do the job"  because Ira Reiner and Charlton Heston wrote Prop 103 and Bill Press has  totally mishandled the McMartin Case while Jack Lemmon was "busting our butts  trying to get the insurance companies to obey the law" during which  "politicians have taken millions in cash gifts, fancy meals and free trips"  that are available in limited quantities as long as Arlo Smith is the "Democrat  for attorney general."  </P> <P> And, by the way, if you make a wrong choice Tuesday, don't worry. Every  candidate and proposition on the ballot comes with a 14-day guarantee.  </P> <P> Let's get serious here! It's time for heavy analysis.  </P> <P> "Think of your tax dollars as a stream of water," says a spot for Republican  congressional candidate Sang Korman showing water gushing from a hose -- for 20  seconds! HASN'T THIS MAN HEARD ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S WATER SHORTAGE???  </P> <P> Then, too, why don't other candidates look as divinely touched as Ira Reiner  does in his commercials. Grab your hankies and just look at that angelic mug,  the eyes gazing upward ever so subtly, as if in contact with some greater  authority.  </P> <P> What about the weekend's juxtaposition of ads?  </P> <P> * A Smith spot accuses Reiner of one heinous act after another, including  personally "losing the battle against crime." Zap! Suddenly it's James Garner:  "Can you believe this?" Although Garner's spot addresses Props 118 and 119 and  not the Democratic race for attorney general, his question applies to all of  the weekend's political spots, including his own.  </P> <P> * A Harvey Rosenfield spot supporting Conway Collis for insurance commissioner  features a curiously small picture of candidate Collis followed by a shot of  Rosenfield that brings him so close to the camera that I can almost see up his  nose. Zap! The next voice I hear is a woman's in a commercial for Calvin  Klein's well-known scent: "Between love and madness, lies Obsession." Seconds  later, she adds: "Ah, the smell of it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Feinstein's campaign to impale Van de Kamp on his past gets  inadvertent help from NBC, which repeatedly runs promos for its Sunday movie  about a "sex killer" who "terrorizes the women of Hawaii," and a beautiful  female D.A. who becomes a decoy to capture him. The movie's title? "Revealing  Evidence: Stalking the Honolulu Strangler."  </P> <P> In effect, the oft-aired promo becomes an echo, giving shrill resonance to  Feinstein's own spot blasting Van de Kamp: "Do you know he tried to drop murder  charges against the Hillside Stranger?"  </P> <P> Politics in California. Ah, the smell of it.  </P></p>

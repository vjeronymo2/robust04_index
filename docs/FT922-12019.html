			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Shake-up of leases urged by CBI THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for urgent reform of the law governing commercial property leases to prevent companies being forced out of business, Charles Batchelor writes. The CBI wants a change in the law which allows landlords to require tenants who sell or assign leases to make good unpaid rent owed by a subsequent occupier. Mr John Pollard, CBI company affairs policy adviser, said: 'Some tenants who have assigned leases have been sued for sums running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, covering rent, service charges and repairs after they assigned the tenancy with the landlord's consent. They can be put out of business by this liability.' An existing tenant can run up substantial arrears before the landlord notifies the previous tenant that anything is wrong. The landlord is not obliged to notify promptly and does not even have to sue the non-paying tenant or evict him. Former tenants can also face demands for rents that are higher than those which applied when they moved out. Letters, Page 19</p>

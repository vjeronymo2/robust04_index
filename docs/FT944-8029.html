			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / People: NJR Research Nigel Russell has given up leadership of James Capel's Scottish investment trust operation to set up business alone as NJR Research. James Capel says that Russell, 36, who is described as an entrepreneurial character, wanted to branch out into research for fund management companies. Capel says it will be NJR Research's first and largest client. 'I don't feel I have lost him,' says Bob Benton, managing director. 'I'll probably see him more than I used to.' Russell worked as an analyst at Commercial Union before joining Capel in London. He later moved to Edinburgh to build a successful operation sponsoring investment trust flotations. His departure has prompted Capel to bring its investment trust operation to London. Michael Cuthbert will move with it to London but three more junior staff will remain in Edinburgh. James Capel made the move to London to bring its investment trust business closer to sales and market-making of the products.</p>

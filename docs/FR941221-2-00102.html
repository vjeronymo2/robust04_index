NPF&hyph;39 and NPF&hyph;85, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation of the Limerick Generating Station (LGS), Units 1 and 2, located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action would grant an exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, ``Primary Reactor Containment Leakage Testing for Water-Cooled Power Reactors,'' Sections III.D.2(a) and III.D.3, which require that Type B and C containment penetration leak rate tests be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case greater than 2 years. The licensee requests that, this one-time exemption would allow the two-year interval to be exceeded by no more than 26 days and not to surpass February 19, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated July 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The affected containment penetrations must be leak rate tested (either Type B or C test) during shutdown reactor conditions because testing of the penetrations requires access to the drywell or requires isolation of safety systems. The required leak rate test intervals for the affected penetrations listed on the licensee's exemption request will exceed the 2-year maximum test interval, if not tested between January 24, 1995 and February 18, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee's upcoming refueling outage is scheduled to begin on January 28, 1995. The licensee has proposed the exemption to extend the leak test interval for the affected penetrations by no more than 26 days. This will allow the licensee to avoid shutting down 4 days earlier for the sole purpose of conducting Appendix J Type B and C tests. The proposed action will permit the licensee to have flexibility to schedule the leak rate tests within the upcoming outage time period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The licensee has presented information in support of their request for a 26-day extension of the Type B and C test intervals. The Unit 2, as-left minimum pathway leak rate (i.e., maximum allowable leakage rate for maintaining primary containment), following the second Unit 2 refueling outage, was .13 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (maximum allowable pathway leakage) or 20,625 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), including contributions from the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV); with a maximum pathway leak rate of .27 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or 42,502 sccm, excluding MSIV leakage, in accordance with LGS's current Appendix J exemption. These as-left leak rates represent a significant margin to the maximum allowable pathway leakage of 158,273 sccm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

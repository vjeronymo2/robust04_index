			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Filip Svarm: "In the House of the Three Milans"] </F>   [Text] Mile Martic, the newly elected president of Krajina,  has appealed to the Constitution and legal powers and removed  Maj. Gen. Mile Novakovic, heretofore the commander of the  general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina (SVK). Martic  appointed to that post Milan Celetkovic, whom he previously  promoted to the rank of general. Few people know the background  of this decision. It is worth mentioning that a few days earlier  diplomatic circles in Belgrade showed a sudden growth of  interest in Gen. Novakovic. Specifically, who were all those who  took note and passed on his statement, routine to say the least,  that "an attack on the RS [Srpska republic] signifies at the  same time an attack on the RSK [Serbian republic Krajina]," and  what could it mean?  <H5>  Two Unknowns </H5>   Although he has been at the center of Krajina military and  political life for quite some time now, Gen. Novakovic is not  particularly well-known to the general public. As an officer in  the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], he served in Zagreb, then he  waged war in Banija. With the rank of colonel he commanded  "Tactical Group 2" in Operation Corridor, and he distinguished  himself with the breach at Debar-Kula. After the Maslenica  action of the Croatian Army [HV] on 22 January 1993, Gen.  Novakovic began to wage war in the second half of the  Serbo-Croat conflict. However, things have not really been going  well for him, especially not with the Croatian offensives in  Medak pocket. Although the army that he commanded displayed  maximum readiness for reprisal (shelling Karlovac, Zadar, Sisak,  and even the suburbs of Zagreb -- Lucko), this was a political  decision, not a military one. Especially since all of that had  no direct consequences regarding the Croatian thrust into the  villages under Velebit, nor regarding the fact that many small  towns in Krajina were also shelled in return. Because of all  that the Krajina Radicals like David Rastovic have called for  Novakovic to be brought to account. The thesis that Krajina is  actually governed by a military junta accountable to no one was  in the same context. Gen. Novakovic evaded specific answers and  political explanations as well as he could. But since this was  the time of a fierce showdown between Martic and Goran Hadzic,  his refusal to appear in the RSK Assembly in Plitvice, where  debate of the defeat in the villages under Velebit was  inevitable, was interpreted as siding with Hadzic. It is  difficult to judge the extent to which the general staff  commander at that time actually came into conflict with the head  of the Krajina police at that time. It is evident that both  signed the cathartic letter of support to Slobodan Milosevic  when the concubinate of Socialists and Radicals collapsed.    If little is known about Gen. Novakovic, still less is known  about his successor, Gen. Celetkovic. Born in the village of  Mokrin, near Kikinda (in a family of colonists, it is assumed),  he was also an active officer in the JNA. The information  service of the SVK reports that he took part in all the  significant battles in western Slavonia and in operations in the  Sava Valley section of Bosnia (Derventa and Bosanski Brod).  Before his appointment to commander of the SVK general staff, he  held the post of commander of the 18th Corps of that same army.  What little unofficial information could be obtained about Gen.  Celetkovic indicates the following: He is an operative, an  officer who gets around (he has held posts in the JNA and the  army of the Srpska republic), and he has been in the SVK only  since 1993.  <H5>  The Bridge on the Sava </H5>   Martic's decree to make the change in the top military  leadership of his self-proclaimed state has echoed like thunder.  Since there was no substantiation except the call for a  discretionary assessment of the chief of state on the basis of  the constitution, only speculations remain.    Gen. Novakovic and his team have gained a reputation as  negotiators. That is, following the failure of the secret  Krajina-Croat negotiations in Norway, there were a number of  separate truces at the level of military delegations between  various parts of Krajina and Croatia. On those occasions it was  impossible to avoid granting certain guarantees to the other  side and accepting certain obligations to the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces], which was the intermediary. The inspiration  for this expedient came from Belgrade, since the time had come  for a process of normalization of relations between the Croatian  and Serbian regimes. The Krajina people, however, frightened  even earlier that they would be "sold out," (this is illustrated  by the success of the Krajina SDS, Milan Babic and the SRS  [Serbian Radical Party] in the election there), showed that they  had a mind of their own. Especially since even the subsequent  visit of Zeljko Simic to Zagreb had no calming effect at all. As  Milosevic's handpicked man, Martic was given the task of  refuting the doubts and avoiding unfavorable agitation. He thus  visited Dr. Karadzic in Pale, and showed as a guest much greater  belligerence on behalf of Serbian unity than his host concerning  the NATO ultimatum; it was even so great that the leader of the  Bosnian Serbs had to relativize it. However, the ultimatum also  weakened Belgrade's negotiating position with Zagreb to a fair  extent. There was, then, a need to show Dr. Tudjman (and  incidentally the UN as well) that the Serbian president is still  making the rules of the game himself, at least in Croatia. The  choice fell on the bridge over the Sava at Nova Gradiska. Two  objectives were achieved by taking control of that border  crossing (when the RSK ministry of internal affairs chased away  members of the Nepal battalion of the UNPROFOR): entirely  unlimited communications between the Srpska republic and Krajina  in that region (intimidation of the UN with the threat of  reprisals) and demonstration of `sovereignty' vis-a-vis Croatia  (a demonstration that Martic must also be taken into account as  Serb-Croat relations are normalized).    It seems that Gen. Novakovic was not inclined toward that  operation. That is, he probably knew better than anyone how much  stronger the Croatian Army has become in the meantime and how  large a role the UNPROFOR has played in the fragile truces which  he concluded, although it is possible that he was denied clear  instructions. It is no wonder, then, that Serb-Croat hostilities  in the northern Dalmatian theater escalated once again with the  crisis over the bridge on the Sava, nor indeed that there should  have been threats from the "insulted and surprised" peacekeeping  forces that they would take back control of the bridge even if  it takes force. It is assumed, moreover, that regardless of his  belligerent statements concerning the NATO ultimatum, in the  light of all that Novakovic was not prepared to aggravate  relations on domestic terrain. When there is big trouble, he is  not particularly charismatic at all. That is why he was removed,  and his place has been taken by a man who carries out orders  without question, but who knows quite well what is going on. One  thing is certain: Novakovic, involved in negotiations up to his  neck, did play his role. Just like Veljko Dzakula at one time,  he was unable to avoid becoming entangled in the resolution of  specific problems, forgetting that in these parts this is a  matter for top-level policy and shrewd combinations. After all,  it may be an accident, and then again maybe not, that  "assumption" of control of the bridge at Nova Gradiska, just  like Dzakula's first arrest in Japaga, near Pakrac, was  entrusted to a man in whom Martic has confidence -- Krsto  Zarkovic.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Jobs: We have ways of turning you off - If managers can't accentuate the positive, they could at least try eliminating the negative ALTHOUGH doubtless still full of zest, you readers will mostly be old enough to have forgotten how it felt to leave your teenage years behind. So you are unlikely to remember the anxiety about impending adulthood, which - mingled with pride, of course - the Jobs column feels on passing its 20th birthday. Fortunately my confidence received a boost during a visit to Ivan Robertson, Professor of Occupational Psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. He reported that, while watching his young son playing football, he'd been approached by another spectating dad who'd handed him a strip of pink paper and urged him to read it there and then. 'It turned out to be one of your articles,' the professor intoned, as though he were recounting some inexplicable dream. Even so, a column surely can't be all that bad if it gets bandied about at football matches. And if the clearly most intelligent but alas un-named dad in question is ever in the FT's vicinity, I owe him several drinks. My reason for calling on Ivan Robertson was that among the things on which he's an authority is a subject that has proved of keen interest to readers down the years: people's motivation to work. Indeed, he is the leading author of the book* on the topic published by Britain's Institute of Personnel Management. As the book makes clear, expert views on motivation have changed since this column's babyhood. Two decades back, there was an optimistic belief abroad that all human beings will become well motivated if their jobs are properly designed. So provided that organisations set up the jobs appropriately - by 'enriching' them with suitable challenges, for example - everyone who came to work for them would have high motivation. That pleasant notion has now given way to a more pessimistic view. It is that far from being alike in capacity, some people are intrinsically and perhaps even genetically more motivated than others, and so put greater effort into anything they are called upon to do. Hence there is no 'universal motivator' in the sense of a formula for galvanising the whole of a workforce. On hearing of the changed view, however, the Jobs column recalled the logician's gag about the converse not necessarily applying, enshrined by Lewis Carroll's immortal dormouse's dictum that although he breathes when he sleeps, it's not true that he sleeps when he breathes. By the same token, the fact that companies have no way to turn everyone on, needn't mean they have no ways of turning everyone off. So I asked Professor Robertson whether there might be any universal de-motivators. On reflection, he replied he could think of several. For a start, since research had shown that people need to know their efforts are paying off in terms of expected results, one good off-turner would be to give them no feedback. Even better might be to provide feedback, but scramble it so the links between effort and rewards appear entirely random. The same end would be served by work-goals that are vague, if not downright contradictory, especially if imposed from on high without explanation, let alone consultation. Still further potential lay in arbitrary controls, he went on, as exemplified by management reacting to an obviously isolated incident by clapping a permanent straitjacket on everybody. I rejoined that a case in point had happened at an army training camp miles from anywhere in the days of national service. When a 48-hour leave came up, one recruit who lived too far away to get home was left all alone with nothing to do. So he scraped the black enamel off his iron bedstead and polished the metal until it shone like silver. It so impressed the commanding officer that he ordered the whole camp to do likewise. Thereafter, the pioneer polisher spent all his free time climbing out of the emergency water supply tank only to be thrown back in by the next set of waiting squaddies. Ivan Robertson felt that the commandant had missed a trick. A truly skilled demotivator would have promoted the pioneer to sergeant-major. 'But seriously,' he added, 'once you think about ways of turning everyone off, you suddenly realise what an awful lot of managers use them.' NOW to the table below which sheds some light on a query often posed by people considering going to work overseas - 'if I went abroad, how much would it cost to keep up the same living standard for the family?' The figures are provided by the Employment Conditions Abroad consultancy which keeps check on pay-rates and cost-levels in more than 150 countries. Since I have room for only nine of them, however, anyone wanting information on the others will need to contact Barry Rodin of ECA at 15 Britten St, London SW3 3TY; telephone (0)71-351 7151, fax (0)71-351 9396. The pattern for the exercise is a middle management job, such as the head of marketing in a medium sized company. Taking managers of that kind from each of the nine countries covered, the table shows their typical gross salary and outlays at home, and the cost of keeping up the same buying habits in the other eight lands. The cost figures relate solely to spending on consumer-type goods and services, no account being taken of housing. Other currencies have been converted to sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the close of London markets last Friday night. The ranking of the countries is determined by how much their native executive spends when based at home. By that yardstick, the Swiss with Pounds 19,721 worth of purchases make the Brits with Pounds 11,232 look relatively cheese-paring, although the Dutch and Australians are thriftier still. *Motivation: strategies, theory and practice. Pounds 11.95.</p>

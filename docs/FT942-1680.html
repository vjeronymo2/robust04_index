			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Immediate rate rise unlikely: Treasury minutes show 'broad agreement' between Clarke and George The 'bias towards easing' in monetary policy appears to be over, but an immediate increase in interest rates is unlikely, the Treasury disclosed yesterday. Minutes of the monthly monetary meeting held on May 4 show that Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, agreed that 'it was not appropriate to change interest rates at the moment'. When the first set of minutes was published in April, it was revealed that the chancellor and governor had adopted a 'bias towards easing' in monetary policy, indicating that further rate cuts might be made. But at the May meeting the two men seemed to move towards a more neutral policy. The minutes show Mr George saying that 'it now seemed less likely (although still not impossible) that interest rates would need to be cut further in order to prevent an increase in spare capacity. There was no longer a clear bias towards easing policy, but also no case (at least for the present) for a tightening either'. The chancellor is then described as being 'in broad agreement'. The governor has since indicated, in his Mansion House speech, that a pre-emptive rise in interest rates, designed to prevent inflationary pressures from building, might be necessary at some point. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, said: 'The conditions are not yet in place for a rate rise. To get one in the next three to four months, we need something fundamental to change in the economy.' The May minutes, however, show the governor and chancellor as still having different views on inflation. Mr George said that 'while inflation was likely to remain subdued in the near term, there were some risks surrounding the prospect further ahead'. He pointed to strong monetary growth, inflationary expectations and the rise in average earnings. But the chancellor said 'the rise in earnings growth in recent months had been anticipated'. They concluded that there was little evidence that tax rises had derailed the recovery. Indeed, it was possible that the level of output was being under-recorded in official estimates. 'The strength of M0 and the continuing falls in unemployment could be consistent with stronger activity.' Mr Clarke said: 'It would not be surprising if there was some short-term reaction to the tax changes. But at this stage there were no signs of a sharp fall in consumption.'</p>

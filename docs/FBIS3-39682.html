It is now possible  "that the terrible murders will come to an end. First in this  place and then in the others," Kohl said at the Hamburg  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Congress on Monday [21  February].    In the next few weeks, all one's power must be used to  achieve an overall plan. Kohl advocated an international  conference with "high-ranking" participants.    The Germans must not hide in a corner "when storms are  blowing. Nobody will buy that," Kohl said. Such an attitude is  a "shame for our country."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnians Want Their Arms!"] </F>   [Text] Bosnians want their arms! This was confirmed by  Bosnian Deputy Prime Minister Edip Bukvic and Minister of  Finance Sead Kresa when they arrived in Ljubljana on 8 February.  The finance minister was received by Mitja Gaspari [Slovene  finance minister], Franc Arhar [Central Bank director], and the  director of the firm Cetis in Celje, which had printed the  Bosnian currency. However, Deputy Prime Minister Bukvic was  unable to talk to his counterpart, although he came to Ljubljana  to resolve the problem of a Bosnian helicopter and the arms  discovered at the Maribor airport, which are still in Slovene  possession. Although the Bosnian Embassy tried to contact Prime  Minister Janez Drnovsek, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze  Peterle, and Davorin Kracun [minister of economic relations and  development] a week in advance, the Slovene prime minister and  deputy prime minister could not find the time to talk to the  Bosnian officials. We have learned that the Bosnians did not  despair and will continue to seek a consensus with the Slovene  Government to reach an agreement on the arms waiting at the  Maribor airport to be transported to Bosnia. The Bosnians  suspect that, despite their claim to these weapons, the more  expensive and sophisticated pieces are already missing. Because  of the arms embargo, the Slovene Government will not be able  legally to deliver the arms to Bosnia. The Bosnian Government  would like to work out some kind of a compensation deal with the  Slovene Government, e.g., in a form of aid to refugees or of  putting up a satellite for Sarajevo television; after all, the  arms discovered "accidentally" by the Slovene defense minister  are valued at about $20 million.</p>

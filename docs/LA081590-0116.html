			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT OKS PARTY ROLE IN NONPARTISAN RACES  </P> <P> In a precedent-setting decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on  Tuesday struck down a state ban on political party endorsements in elections  for judgeships and other nonpartisan offices, a ruling that could have a  significant impact on California politics.  </P> <P> The decision allows the Democratic, Republican and other political parties to  make endorsements in races to elect county supervisors, city mayors, city  councils, school boards and superior and municipal court judges, am ong others.  </P> <P> "The role of political parties has been dramatically enhanced," said Edmund G.  Brown Jr., chairman of the California Democratic Party. "This decision  constitutes a charter of freedom for political parties within California."  </P> <P> Since the days of reform Gov. Hiram Johnson 80 years ago, California has  avoided injecting formal party endorsements into these races in the belief that  this decreases the opportunity for corruption of the judiciary and local  officials.  </P> <P> But the 9th Circuit Court rejected that argument. The ban on partisan  endorsements by political parties "illegally restricts political speech" and  thereby violates the First and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, said the  majority opinion written by Judge Alfred T. Goodwin.  </P> <P> In the past, there have been some party endorsements in nonpartisan races.  However, a state constitutional amendment approved as Proposition 49 by  California voters in 1986 barred the practice. A series of suits led to  Tuesday's decision.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, U.S. District Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli in San Francisco,  responding to a 1987 suit filed by 10 individuals and an organization called  Election Action, issued an injunction prohibiting San Francisco from keeping  party endorsements off the ballot in some nonpartisan races.  </P> <P> In July, 1989, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit overruled Zirpoli,  holding that California's compelling interest in preserving its nonpartisan  system of government for local and judicial offices justified the ban on party  endorsements. The plaintiffs asked for a review by a larger panel of 9th  Circuit judges and secured a hearing from 11 judges.  </P> <P> Those judges voted 8 to 3 to permit party endorsements, despite pleas that it  would corrupt the political process in California.  </P> <P> To support his majority decision, Goodwin cited language from a recent Supreme  Court decision: "Advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates . . . is no  less entitled to protection under the First Amendment than the discussion of  political policy generally or advocacy or defeat of legislation."  </P> <P> The 9th Circuit majority rejected the argument that political endorsements in  nonpartisan races "create the same risks of corruption or appearance of  corruption" that the Supreme Court has previously determined justify  governmental regulation of election spending.  </P> <P> "The rationale underlying 'the long history of regulation of corporate  political activity' . . . simply is not available as a justification for the  complete suppression of speech by political parties, regardless of whether the  elections in question are partisan or nonpartisan in nature," Goodwin wrote.  </P> <P> Judge Pamela A. Rymer's dissent acknowledged that the ban impinges on First  Amendment rights, but asserted that it should be upheld because California has  a compelling interest in maintaining the structure of its nonpartisan  government for judicial, school and municipal offices.  </P> <P> She said that the case was clearly distinguishable from a 9th Circuit decision  which gave political parties the right to make endorsements in primaries for  partisan offices. "The partisan primary election is designed to ensure that  party nominations are within party lines, thus preserving the integrity of the  party," Rymer wrote.  </P> <P> "The purpose of an election within the nonpartisan structure has nothing to do  with settling the internal divisions within a political party," she said.  "Nonpartisanship envisions 'direct representation of citizens rather than  indirect representation through parties as intermediaries,' " Rymer added.  </P> <P> A particularly sharp debate over the impact of endorsements in judicial races  emerged in separate opinions written by Judge Arthur Alarcon, who dissented,  and Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who voted with the majority.  </P> <P> Alarcon quoted philosopher George Santayana, playwright William Shakespeare and  President Theodore Roosevelt in asserting that the process of electing judges  in California would be seriously corrupted by partisan endorsements. His  lengthy opinion referred to railroad and land barons who corrupted municipal  politics in California in the early 20th Century until reforms were imposed by  Hiram Johnson in 1910.  </P> <P> Reinhardt said that the reforms had left open the possibility of other means of  corruption. He stressed that since California already elects judges, the  process is inherently political. Reinhardt said that allowing partisan  endorsements would be better and more democratic than simply allowing judges to  "buy" their way on to slate mailers, one of the common means used to campaign  in judicial races now.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs' attorney, Arlo Hale Smith, who is the son of the Democratic  Party candidate for attorney general in November's election, said he was  delighted by the result. "It's a great victory for the First Amendment," said  the San Francisco lawyer.  </P> <P> He said he thought the decision would result in more party endorsements being  made in local school and judicial races, "but frankly that's happening  indirectly already because there are loads of people who put out slate mailers.  It's only been the official parties not taking a stand."  </P> <P> San Francisco City Atty. Louise Renne said she was disappointed by the outcome  and would decide within the near future whether to appeal the decision to the  U.S. Supreme Court. Like Alarcon, she expressed particular concern about a  potential negative impact on judges.  </P> <P> "To a certain extent, it has been the tradition to remove judges from a  political setting in California," she said. "This is a step back. If you have  to go and get the endorsement of a political party, that is a setback to a  judge's independence."  </P> <P> Despite the ruling, top officials of the Republican Party in Orange County said  they would keep their longstanding practice of not formally endorsing  candidates in nonpartisan local races.  </P> <P> "We stay out of nonpartisan elections. We don't have a set of standards to  choose which candidates should receive an endorsement," said Greg Haskin,  executive director of the Orange County GOP.  </P> <P> Haskin said that the Republican parties in other counties are eager to make  endorsements.  </P> <P> "Oftentimes, here in Orange County, we may have several good Republicans  running against each other. Getting involved in nonpartisan elections here begs  for trouble," he said.  </P> <P> However, Orange County's Democratic Party will begin endorsing nonpartisan  candidates.  </P> <P> "It will probably be in the more prominent races, such as city councils and  mayoral races and the Board of Supervisors and others," said Mike Balmages,  chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party.  </P> <P> "I welcome the (court) decision because parties shouldn't be restricted by law  from voicing an opinion," he said.  </P> <P> Nelson Polsby, a political science professor at UC Berkeley and director of the  university's Institute of Governmental Studies, hailed the decision, contending  that it would boost the fortunes of political parties and curb the power of  other special interests. "Part of having a free democratic society is the right  of people to back people whom they support," Polsby said.  </P> <P> "The issue comes down to whether political parties are uniquely situated in  such a fashion as to be barred from this normal right of association and  endorsement."  </P> <P> Polsby said arguments that party endorsements would lead to corruption of  judges and municipal officials are unrealistic. In fact, he said special  interests, such as big business, "have learned to play very effectively under  Hiram Johnson's rules."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Marla Cone contributed to this story.  </P></p>

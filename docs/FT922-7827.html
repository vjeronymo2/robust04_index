			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guyana hands over reins of export industries - How the republic is preparing for bauxite and sugar privatisations In an attempt to cut losses and lift productivity and production, Guyana is restructuring the administration of the two commodity sectors that form the foundation of its economy. The bauxite and sugar industries, owned by the government of the English-speaking republic on the north eastern shoulder of South America, are to be sold off in the next two years. To prepare for this, the management of both industries has been taken over by foreign companies. An Australian company took over the administration of the bauxite (aluminium ore) industry this month, coinciding with a move by the government to assume some of the industry's heavy debts. Government officials appear optimistic that the fortunes of the industry, which is one of the world's main producers of calcined bauxite, will be similar to those of the sugar sector. The divestment of the management of sugar has been followed by increased production. The management of the bauxite industry is now in the hands of Minproc Engineering of Sydney, Australia, while the government tries to clear the industry's debts of USDollars 85m, making it a viable proposition for privatisation. In addition to managing the industry for at least 18 months, the Australians will be marketing the country's metallic and calcined grades of bauxite. The call on foreign management and the planned divestment has come two decades after the government nationalised the local operations of Reynolds of the US and Alcan of Canada. But the industry's fortunes have waned with a deterioration in the country's economy. A shortage of hard currency prevented expansion and maintenance of equipment. Once accounting for 70 per cent of the world's calcined bauxite output, Guyana's share has fallen to 40 per cent. The involvement of the Australians in Guyana's bauxite industry follows earlier attempts by the government to find managers and buyers. Alcan of Canada and Billiton, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell company, had indicated some interest but did not pursue negotiations. The restructuring of the industry is being funded by loans that the government has negotiated from the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Community. The Guyana government has written off the Dollars 10m that it was owed by the bauxite industry. The government is also to assume the debt of more than Dollars 22m that the industry owes to commercial banks. The change in the industry's management, and the plan for privatisation, follow renewed interest by foreign investors in the country's bauxite industry. The government's recent liberalisation of the conditions for foreign investment has resulted in new projects that promise a significant increase in output. CA Dayco de Construcciones of Venezuela is involved in a venture to mine 1.4m tonnes over three years for the Guyana Mining Enterprise, to be sold to Interalumina of Venezuela, and a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals of the US is in a joint venture that is expected to yield about 2.5m tonnes of ore per year. Guyanese government officials appear optimistic about the prospects of the bauxite industry, and the prospects for economic viability. They are hoping that Minproc Engineers will be able to emulate the changes have taken place in the sugar industry, the sale of which the government is hoping to conclude later this year. According to Mr Desmond Hoyte, Guyana's president: 'The process of divesting the sugar industry is under way and will not stop and cannot be stopped.' Booker Tate of the UK, whose parent company's Guyanese sugar holdings were nationalised by the government two decades ago, took over the management of the industry in 1990 from a state-owned company. The industry was in trouble and unable to meet its supply quotas to the European Community and the US while supplying the domestic market. In each of the previous three years Guyana had to plead force majeure on its export commitment to the European Community. According to government officials, the decision to put the industry in the hands of Booker Tate is already paying dividends. Shipments are being made to the US and the EC, and production is rising. Guyana has found the 182,000 tonnes to meet its EC and US quotas. Under Booker Tate's management sugar production rose from 130,000 tonnes in 1990 to 160,000 tonnes last year. Nearly 90,000 tonnes have already been milled for the first crop this year, doubling the 44,000 produced over the corresponding period last year. 'Unless we had done this, the industry would not have turned around,' said Mr Hoyte. 'In every industry we have divested the workers have benefited enormously from improved conditions of pay and service. In every industry we have divested, that industry has so far done better than when it was under state control. . . and those are facts that cannot be gainsaid.' Government officials have not named the parties interested in buying the sugar industry, although there are reports that Booker Tate, already with a foot in the door, is likely to be at the top of the list. The world supply/demand balance for sugar is likely to be tighter next year, following a projected stocks rise of 1.24m tonnes in 1991-92, according to the latest Sugar Review published by London trader C. Czarnikow. 'More than 1m tonnes of production may be lost next season by countries in Southern Africa (because of the present drought),' while 'overall offtake is likely to rise, if only modestly,' Czarnikow says. Jamaica's bauxite ore production in the first quarter of this year was 2.82m tonnes, 5.2 per cent more than the corresponding period of 1991, writes Canute James in Kingston. The Jamaica Bauxite Institute reported that production of alumina (aluminium oxide) in the quarter fell 3 per cent to 735,000 tonnes. Exports of crude ore of 949,000 tonnes were 5.1 per cent less than the first quarter of last year, but government officials say the industry is still projecting overall ore production for this year at 12m tonnes, compared with actual output of 11.5m tonnes last year.</p>

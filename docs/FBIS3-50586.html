			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 4 Jan (EFE) --  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said today, Tuesday, that the  presence of approximately 170 U.S. soldiers in the country is  following a "civic objective," because they will perform a  "humanitarian" task.    This was the first time Gaviria has commented on the arrival  of the U.S. Engineers Battalion on 27 December and 2 January.  According to the government, the U.S. soldiers will build a  school, a clinic, and a road in an area on the Colombian Pacific  coast.    Since the U.S. Embassy announced the soldiers' arrival at  the  beginning of December in Santa Fe de Bogota, the presence of  U.S. soldiers in Colombia has caused a big uproar in the country.    Referring to the presence of the U.S. soldiers in the  Colombian Pacific area, President Gaviria said: "It is  absolutely clear to the government that the soldiers' arrival  has an explicit civic objective." The Colombian president made  those statements to a group of journalists in the town of San  Basilio de Palenque, near Cartagena de Indians, on the country's  northern Caribbean coast. Gaviria added that the government has  no reservations or problem with any type of "citizen control"  observing that the "Marines'" work is totally "humanitarian."    "While their presence is of a humanitarian nature, I do not  understand why it would cause concern," the Colombian president  said, after denying any possibility that the soldiers are  attempting to build a military base in national territory. "Such  a project cannot be carried out behind the people's backs," the  Colombian head of state said.    The U.S. Embassy has reported that the U.S. military  engineers would participate in an exercise program with the  Colombian Armed Forces in an area of the Pacific Ocean, in the  southwestern Department of Valle del Cauca. According to  diplomatic representation, the program is called "Strong Roads  Colombia 94," and the "Marines," who belong to the U.S. Southern  Command stationed in Panama, will remain in the country until  the end of February.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister today accused the IRA of using  its "self-serving and cynical" three-day ceasefire to deceive  the gullible into believing it was a road to peace. Mr Major,  on a lightning tour of Northern Ireland, said: "The fact is the  gullible ought not to be deceived."    He was speaking at the start of a hectic day in which he  will  make a whirlwind tour of the province. He did not answer  questions about the Tory leadership crisis and the row in London  over the Euro votes "climb down." But he used the opportunity  at Hillsborough Castle to underline his stark denunciation of  last night's ceasefire announcement, due to take effect from  Tuesday.    He rejected suggestions that he and Dublin Premier Albert  Reynolds were no longer in step on this issue. "I think the  Taoiseach's [Prime Minister Reynolds] view and my view over the  course that the IRA need to take is quite clear. They need to  stop the violence and they need to stop violence for good," he  said. "We committed ourselves to that in the Joint Declaration.  I have repeatedly said that since and so has the Taoiseach."    Mr Major was also critical of those -- including Sinn Fein  president Gerry Adams -- who said that people should build on  this three-day ceasefire. "The ceaefire is a very cynical  exercise.... What effectively the IRA are saying is that on  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday they will decide not to attack  people and not to kill people," he said. "On Friday, Saturday  and Sunday they will then go back to killing people. I do not  think that is satisfactory."    But Mr Adams asked: "What is the alternative? Are we going  to continue to be locked into armed conflict in perpetuity? Is  this what is opening up for us, is it going to continue forever?  I would hope that Mr Major -- who made a kneejerk reaction last  night -- would reflect on his position, will send the right  signals, will make it easier, rather than more difficult for  Republicans to engage in the peace process."    Senior Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness said: "We are  still very much interested in the establishment of a meaningful  peace process. What we're trying to do is lay down the  foundation stones on which the bricks of peace can be built."    In Washington where President Clinton came under a barrage  of  criticism for allowing Mr Adams a visa earlier this year, the  White House said it hoped the ceasefire -- the first in 19  years, apart from the traditional Christmas truces -- would be a  step towards an IRA renunciation of violence. It also urged the  IRA and Sinn Fein to accept the Joint Declaration.    Meanwhile, Mr Major said: "The only message we want to hear  from them is that they have decided to give up violence for  good. I am sure everybody would wish to see that. I would like  to see them entering the democratic process. The Joint  Declaration opens the door for them to do precisely that. They  know what needs to be done. If they genuinely wish to play a  democratic part in the future of politics in Northern Ireland  there is a route they can take, there is a road for them to go  down. They have thus far failed to do so."    Referring to the Joint Declaration, he said: "As far as  clarification is concerned the document stands on its own  merits. It is perfectly clear to everyone else what it means.  It is perfectly clear to Sinn Fein as well. What they are  trying to do is to encourage the Government to believe that  there is some extra step to draw the Government into  negotiations. The fact is the gullible ought not to be  deceived."    Mr Major added: "At the moment the IRA and Sinn Fein are  under pressure. I intend to stand by the Joint Declaration. I  hope everyone else will keep up the pressure. A three-day  ceasefire is not going to change the future of Northern Ireland.  They must stop the violence permanently and then in due course  enter the constitutional talks. They should stop killing people  permanently. They should stop wrecking people's lives  permanently."</p>

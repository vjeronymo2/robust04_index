			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JETS COLLIDE ON DETROIT RUNWAY; 8 DIE, 22 HURT  </P> <P> Two Northwest Airlines jets collided on a fog-shrouded runway at Detroit  Metropolitan Airport Monday as one accelerated for takeoff, igniting a cabin  fire in one plane that killed eight passengers and injured 22 others.  </P> <P> All of the casualties were aboard a Pittsburgh-bound DC-9, which burst into  flames after it was clipped by a Boeing 727 accelerating for liftoff on its  flight to Memphis, Tenn., authorities said.  </P> <P> Passengers from the DC-9 used emergency chutes or jumped from the wing and took  refuge on a slush-covered runway infield as flames quickly ravaged the cabin,  stripping off its roof and blackening the entire upper length of the plane.  </P> <P> The collision, which came just two weeks before the airline industry's peak  holiday travel season, occured near the site of the second-worst air crash in  U.S. history. On Aug. 16, 1987, a Northwest MD-80 crashed on takeoff, killing  154 people on board and two on the ground. A 4-year-old girl was the only  survivor of that crash.  </P> <P> A Northwest spokesman said that the collision occurred shortly after 1:45 p.m.  near Concourse A of the airport, in suburban Romulus, about 10 miles west of  Detroit. The DC-9 was carrying 39 passengers and four crew members, while the  727 had 146 passengers and a 10-member crew aboard.  </P> <P> Both Northwest officials and federal aviation authorities indicated that pilot  confusion and thick fog and slush-slickened runways may have played roles in  the collision.  </P> <P> Northwest officials said that the right wing of the 727, almost airborne as it  roared down one runway, struck the right fuselage of the DC-9, which had  clearance to fly to Pittsburgh and was taxiing toward another runway.  </P> <P> The 727's wing sliced through the DC-9 just below cabin level and severed at  least one of its engines, igniting the fire, Northwest officials said.  </P> <P> "The fog made visibility difficult," said Northwest spokesman Robert Gibbons.  The spokesman said that the collision "appeared to have been head-on -- based  on the right wing striking the right fuselage."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. said that early  reports from the scene indicated that "the DC-9 pilot became lost on the  runways."  </P> <P> The controllers' spokesman, Tom Dresden, said that "the (DC-9) pilot gave the  ground controller erroneous information about his position and turned right  onto the runway where the 727 was taxiing. The DC-9 pilot discovered at the  very last moment where he was, and so the ground controller told him to  immediately get off that runway, but it was too late."  </P> <P> Northwest officials acknowledged that visibility was hampered by the fog --  preventing pilots from seeing more than a quarter-mile in front of them,  according to National Weather Service accounts. A snowstorm had passed through  the Detroit area earlier in the day, but by midday, precipitation had stopped  and temperatures rose above the freezing point, leaving the airport draped in  fog.  </P> <P> Wayne County Executive Edward McNamara said that the weather was "a very  serious factor" in the collision.  </P> <P> Passengers aboard both planes said they heard a thunderous noise as the two  planes collided. Joe Izzo, 41, an engineer who was dozing aboard the DC-9 on  route from South Bend, Ind., to Pittsburgh, thought that the engine had blown  up.  </P> <P> "I felt a thud and I heard a blast," said Izzo, who had been sitting in the  sixth row of the plane. "I felt shrapnel fly past my head. I looked to my right  and saw flames and heard people screaming. People panicked and were running for  the front of the plane."  </P> <P> On his way to the front of the cabin, Izzo said, he saw at least two passengers  fatally burned by the fast-spreading fire. "I saw people whose fingertips were  melted off," he said.  </P> <P> Izzo said he and several other passengers kicked out the emergency door above  the left wing. The passengers then began tumbling out onto the pavement. Izzo  managed the fall without injury. He said he turned back to the plane to help  others who had injured themselves and were sprawled in the slush.  </P> <P> Fearing further explosions, Izzo and an off-duty stewardess, Kay Bolin, helped  injured DC-9 passengers get away from the burning wreckage. "We kept hearing  hissing sounds, so we kept pulling them back farther from the plane," Izzo  said.  </P> <P> On the 727, filled to capacity with passengers, Robert Karp, 60, a marketing  professor at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss., heard a noise that  sounded "like we had a tire blown out." Several seconds later, over the plane's  loudpeaker, the pilot advised "everybody to stay in their seats. Everything is  OK."  </P> <P> But a private pilot sitting across the aisle from him, Karp said, looked out  the window and shouted: "Geez, we hit another plane. Half our left wing is  gone! Jet fuel is just pouring out!"  </P> <P> Rod Nacker of Sterling Heights, Mich., another passenger aboard the 727, said  that it appeared that the 727's pilot "didn't even see the other plane. The  other plane was in a lot worse condition than ours. We were losing a lot of  aviation fuel. They foamed both planes. We couldn't see out the windows."  </P> <P> Despite their anxiety, passengers waited in the cabin another 15 to 20 minutes,  Karp said, while emergency vehicles sprayed foam on the fuel. They then exited  from the rear of the plane, descending on portable steps.  </P> <P> He complimented the crew for keeping the plane under control. "It was very  calm," Karp said. "I don't think we realized how lucky we were until we got off  the plane and saw the other aircraft. We saw smoke billowing up and we saw the  midsection with the top blown off," he said.  </P> <P> For nearly an hour after the accident, smoke continued to pour from the DC-9's  fuselage and from a jagged slit where the roof of the cabin had been. By dusk,  as the already overcast sky grew dark, emergency workers wheeled in a mammoth  bank of portable lights to provide illumination for firefighters,  investigators, paramedics and medical examiners.  </P> <P> The airport was closed for about two hours after the accident. The airport had  already been closed to inbound traffic when the crash occurred, aviation  officials said.  </P> <P> Driving in heavy rain squalls, ambulances ferried at least 22 passengers to  three hospitals in Detroit and Ann Arbor. Two passengers with severe burns were  taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center's burn unit at Ann Arbor.  </P> <P> Most of the deaths and injuries appeared to have been caused by fire and toxic  fumes, authorities said. At least 15 people were taken to Annapolis Hospital in  Wayne. Three were discharged, one was admitted in critical condition with a  crushed lung and three others were being treated in the emergency room for  burns, broken bones, lacerations and bruises, according to hospital officials.  </P> <P> Four other crash victims were taken to Heritage Hospital in neighboring Taylor.  One patient had lower back pain, another had an ankle injury and a third  required a partial finger amputation. The condition of the fourth was not  released. All four were in stable condition, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> National Transportation Safety Board investigators, en route from Washington to  Detroit, said they will analyze tape recordings of cockpit conversations as  well as all communications between federal air traffic controllers in the tower  and planes on the ground and in the air around the airport.  </P> <P> "Planes are not supposed to move on the ground unless air traffic controllers  say they can," said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. "The tower has direct  control."  </P> <P> Investigators were arriving already well-apprised about the danger of  ground-based collisions.  </P> <P> Last October, the board placed the issue high on its list of "most wanted"  safety improvements, urging quick steps to prevent such collisions. Aviation's  worst disaster was just such an accident. Two Boeing 747s, one operated by Pan  Am and the other by the Dutch airline KLM, collided in fog on a runway at  Tenerife in the Canary Islands in 1977, killing 581 people.  </P> <P> Flights to Detroit from Los Angeles International Airport were halted briefly  Monday afternoon until aviation officials determined that they could again  proceed safely. All Detroit-bound planes were kept on the ground until 12:31  p.m.  </P></p>

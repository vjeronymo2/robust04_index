His excellency the  president attended and chaired the meeting.    The Council of Ministers devoted its extraordinary meeting  to  the attack against state security, which took the form of an  explosion at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il this  morning. At the beginning of the meeting, his excellency the  president briefed the ministers on his contacts with Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad, who denounced the attack and placed  Syria's resources at the disposal of Lebanese authorities to  discover the perpetrators. He also briefed the ministers on his  contact with his majesty the king of Jordan for the same  purpose. His excellency the president also briefed the Council  of Ministers on all his contacts from within the country and  abroad denouncing the attack.    The Council of Ministers then examined the implications of  the crime and its intention to weaken confidence in the security  situation and the economic and social stability in Lebanon, fan  sectarian fanaticism in the country, and divert the attention of  world public opinion from the massacre committed by Israel in  the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied Palestinian  territory. The Council of Ministers praised the overwhelming  reaction through which the Lebanese expressed comprehensive  national unity in the face of this attack that was directed  against the country's security and unity.    The Council of Ministers decided to refer the attack against  the state security in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq  Mikha'il to the Judicial Council. Following the statement  issued by his excellency the president, the speaker of the  Chamber of Deputies, and the prime minister this morning calling  for public mourning tomorrow, the Council of Ministers also  decided to call for a general strike tomorrow. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] There are measures that are being adopted by the  security commands in all the areas at the instructions of the  Council of Ministers and the ministers concerned.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] the crime  that took place, have you specified the [words indistinct]?    [Samahah] All that was said by the officials today refers to  whoever we think, and we can confirm, is behind this attack,  crime, massacre this morning against the worshipers in Sayyidat  al-Najat Church.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] referred to  those who opposed the pope's visit to Lebanon. You hoped that  they had no hand in the church explosion. Did you mean Minister  Walid Junblatt?    [Samahah] Not at all. Minister Walid Junblatt is one of  those who has welcomed the visit of his holiness the pope and  has cooperated with the Lebanese authorities. He has adopted  declared positions with regard to domestic unity and receiving  the pope in Lebanon. The ones I meant know who they are. They  issued statements on this matter last week.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]?    [Samahah] Perhaps. Let us leave it to the investigation to  determine that. We hope it will end soon and that the  perpetrators will be discovered soon so that everyone will be  reassured and we can know the aim and background of this attack.  [passage omitted]</p>

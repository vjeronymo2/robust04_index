			<p>BFN     [Text] The third meeting of the sixth standing committee of  the provincial youth federation concluded on 31 March. Governor  Yue Qifeng attended the meeting and delivered a speech in which  he urged the youth organizations throughout the province to lead  the broad masses of youths to display their talent in markets  and to be a vanguard in the course of turning the planned  economy into a market one. He said: Youths are the least  conservative and accept new things rapidly. In the current  period, a large number of youths across the province have scored  a large number of typical and good deeds in developing the  market economy and played an important role in the province's  economic development. We should attach importance on the role  played by middle-aged and young scientific and technological  personnel, including some technical workers. They constitute a  very important force for restoring the province's prestige.    During the meeting, the participating members elected the  supplementary vice chairmen of the provincial youth federation  and elected (Yao Zhiping), deputy secretary of the provincial  Communist Youth League committee, chairman of the provincial  youth federation.</p>

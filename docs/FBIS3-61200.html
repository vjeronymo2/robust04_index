			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelbay Saghym: "Relations With China."] </F>   [Text] Only one idea is now in the mind of Kazakhstan,  which has achieved its independence and has quickly entered into  relations with the countries of the world: "we must still become  known to foreign countries." However, the question: "which kind  of countries should we choose," has still not been taken up so  far. Leaving aside the question of a country or a people, is not  each person a world unto himself? From that point of view, just  as the establishment of relations with each person is in terms  of the scope of knowledge, humanity, moral qualities, and  nationality, similarly we establish relations with separate  families composed of individuals and even with a nation. For  that reason the question of the degree of relations with a given  country, the need to become known to that country and in what  way are leading questions of diplomacy. To answer these  questions we must, first of all, before we become known to a  country, strive to know that country as much as possible. This  is because becoming known, in other words, means "disclosing  one's secrets." When secrets have been disclosed, just like the  proverb: "the Wolf keeps secret his leanness; do not expose a  dog's fur to the dog," one's leanness cannot but be exposed to  the light of the day, along with twisted things from a thousand  places. But if secrets are not disclosed, we say "stay off a  horse which you do not know about [know the secrets of]" and go  over to polite [but distant] relations.    What a country will do after it has obtained one's secrets,  or even a country which has not obtained one's secrets, depends  upon the aims and culture of the country in question. In  particular, more than distant countries, it is necessary to have  a deep understanding of neighboring countries which "come to  your village and help you herd your sheep," share your breath,  and watch how you lay your pipes.    We Kazakhs, who have passed the time taking the view: "a  neighbor's pay, the pay of Heaven," with regard to individual  families and neighboring auyl, would seem to think of other  nations in the same terms. The complicated history of our people  over many centuries are clear proof of our words. Nothing more  need be said. Has the lack of concern of we Kazakhs during our  first relations with the Zhonghar [Dzungar] Khanate not left  behind any regrets!? Moreover, you might ask how the Zhonghar  Khanate in the east, so many times smaller than the Kazakh  Khanate, was able to inflict upon the Kazakh people the disaster  of "vagrancy with white heals [in the snow], the deviation [from  the trek] out of great suffering." The Zhonghars, through  frequent contacts, caught sight of the wide and beautiful Kazakh  steppe and laid their plans. In such a time of struggle, the  Kazakhs, with their internal "hostility," being separated into  hordes and into clans, found out how to carefully exploit their  "merits" by becoming 40 knives. Later the Russian colonialists  were able to seize the entire Kazakh steppe. They even took  special advantage of we Kazakhs' lack of connections with one  another, our carefreeness. Thus, as a result of our honored  properties, we could not get free of Russia for three hundred  years...    Leaving other things aside, forgetting that a nation is an  independent state, we [should] investigate the peoples and  regions within that country. After we have carried on our  research, we form many special organizations of various kinds  and go on researching, wasting a lot of money. For example,  there appear to be tens of organizations in the Chinese People's  Republic researching Central Asia (Kazakhstan in particular, as  its foundation). Kazakhstan has not formed such organization  since its independence. On the other hand, they were formed  during the time that the USSR was strong and in its prime. Not  long after the Republic of Kazakhstan declared its independence,  a book entitled "General Condition of the Republic of  Kazakhstan" suddenly appeared in China. When the book was  published, it represented, to be sure, no general effort. The  Central Asia Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences of the  Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region wrote and published the book.  At present, young students who go to study at institutions of  higher education must take examinations based upon that book.  You can understand if intelligent people do not say what is  really behind the "good will..." It is enough to remember only  the need to take examinations based upon the book in China.    As for Kazakhstan, whether it is research institutions, or  educational institutions, we are only concerned about ourselves.  At the most, we learn or research foreign languages. But there  is no a single organization carrying out special research about  our near neighbors, or about other countries in the world  connected with us. On the contrary, there are some unneeded  organizations now functioning, for example, the Uighur Research  Institute under the National Academy of sciences. This  organization is now superfluous. In our view, this institute  should be reorganized as a Turkology institute. This is because  it is hard to understand what possible need Kazakhstan should  have for making special efforts to research our Uighur kinsmen  among the Turkic peoples. In fact, if state finances improve, it  would be all the more wonderful if we should create research  institutes for every one of our Turkic-speaking kinsmen.  However, everyone understands that just now our young republic  is utterly without resources. For that reason, if there is not  an Uighur Research Institute but a Turkology Institute under the  Republic of Kazakhstan National Academy of Sciences, this would  make it convenient for us to study the languages, history,  cultures, literatures, art, national political economies, and  education of Turkey, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan,  Azerbaijan, Karakalpakistan, the Uighurs, Bashqurt, Tartars, and  the Turkic- speaking countries and fraternal peoples. One thing  which we cannot forget to mention in this context is one  "quality" remaining in Kazakhstan, especially among the Kazakh  people, from our former irresolution and obsequiousness. And  what is this: "unreasonable trustfulness." For example, when the  Uighur Research Institute was formed, Uighurs were hired there  as a matter of course. If a Korean or German research division  was established, it was filled up with Koreans and Germans  gathered from here or there. Does not the question arise of  exactly whom one wants to study when one establishes Uighur  research and nationality research departments? One should not  say, when establishing an institute or opening a division ,  "know yourself;" the Uighur people knows itself very well and  likewise the Korean and the German people. In this connection we  must know a people, that is, the Uighurs, the Koreans, the  Germans, or the Kazakh people. For that purpose the research  workers of that institute must be Kazakhs. Only then will they  view the people, who are their subjects, from a Kazakh point of  view and be able to solve urgent questions in the interests of  Kazakhs. What this means is research in ideological areas  serving Kazakhstan.    However, it is altogether unfortunate that there is no  research organization specially intended to study our great  neighbor to the East, the Chinese People's Republic. The  establishment as soon as possible of a Chinese research  division, if need be within the Oriental Research Institute of  the Republic of Kazakhstan National Academy of Sciences, is  urgently needed for our young republic. This is because China is  a country with an age- old culture. Today it has many people and  a great history. It is a powerful country. Study of its history,  and knowing the composition of its peoples, understanding the  secret of the quick prosperity of what was only recently a poor  country, would doubtless teach Kazakhstan many lessons. For our  republic to have China as a neighbor is certainly no easy thing.  This widely known nation caresses the feet of Singapore. This  unsparing country wears the shroud of Vietnam. For that reason,  it is proper to follow the path of Japan, Korea, and India in  maintaining neighborly relations with China. These countries are  like the greatest friends of China, but do not allow a single  Chinese to live on their soil. As for us? China, which is  covered by a billion and a half people without discord, is a  master of rich economic experience. The whole world market is  heating up, and, today, when the market simply consumes any  disorganized nation, we see ourselves quietly passing the time  as a nation combining few people, a lot of land, and such  riches. But we have no reason to be complacent. Under such  circumstances, there is not a little we can learn from China  where the peoples economy is developing rapidly year by year in  addition to guaranteeing a billion and a half people work and  food. Is the Chinese People's Republic at present saying that  "there are no disputes over land with Kazakhstan, no border  questions?" No it is not. The idea is that the Zhetisu  [Semiryechye] and Balqash regions of today's Kazakhstan is our  land. It was stolen from our country at one time by an unequal  czarist Russian treaty, which is described in school and higher  education textbooks, and which continues to be instilled into  the minds of the younger generation. God only knows what cunning  things the present younger generation, who have been tempered  with the understanding that "failing to speak of evil is not  good thing," and who will inherit the nation in the future, will  do. For that reason, if our leaders do not deal with these kinds  of gnawing questions now, it is difficult to say that  Kazakhstan's future will be quiet. Thus we must carry on a  thorough research about Chinese history, China's historical  territories, and the historical circumstances whereby the Kazakh  steppe was divided up by the bayonet. There are in the Chinese  People's Republic also, in addition to close Kazakh, Uighyr,  Kyrgyz, Uzbek, and Tatar relatives, our [other] Turkic-speaking  kinsmen. To advance a more or less open view about the fate of  Turkistan, where these peoples live, or to take any sudden  action, could have a negative influence upon the friendship of  the two countries. From this point of view, it is proper that  our Uighur kinsmen do nothing extremely disorganized and that  the Kazakhs keep their mouths shut. This is because China is a  "dragon" that one should not come in conflict with. For that  reason, every citizen of Kazakhstan must offer carefully  considered thought and views or, as it is written, "measure ten  times, cut once." It is proper that government delegations,  trade and cultural organizations, tourists, etc. from Kazakhstan  be completely prudent and alert. We, Kazakhs, must absolutely  not joke about this or be negligent, and must always be careful  about what we say. This is because, as a "consequence" of many  centuries of close interaction with Russia, Uzbekistan, and  Kyrgyzstan, and, in particular, as a result of 70 years of  internationalism, we have come to completely understand these  peoples. And, whatever the connection, the inhabitants of our  republic know the characteristics, personalities, cultural,  feelings, and other sides of these peoples like the five fingers  on their hands. However, our ancestors (from Uisin to  Abylaykhan) have had no contact with China. We have no  experience with such relationships. That is to say, our  relations with China are starting only now. For that reason we  cannot enter into relations until we know completely the  national character, qualities, and personal feelings of the  Chinese people. Only when this is the case, can Kazakhstan and  China live together as friendly neighbors in peace. However, if  we do not understand, and if we do not do our research, if we  close our eyes in Kazakh foolhardiness, if we say "it really  does not matter," and sign any kind of agreement or decision,  and are not careful, it will weigh heavy upon the fate of the  people. This is the problem. Our contemporaries today, thinking  about the future of the nation, loving their country, are saying  and writing that "China is on the move." The concerned  organizations must make a great effort to take preventive  measures against this sort of thing. However, there is no once  concerned with the question "in what ways and how is China on  the march?" Do we remember the friendship visit of Republic  Premier S. Tereshchenko to the Chinese Peoples Republic during  the early spring of 1992 and all the "hoopla?" During that trip  Tereshchenko signed some 10 treaties. To be sure, such great  comings and goings in the international arena by Kazakhstan,  friendly relations with such major countries, are something to  be proud of. However, it is a well-known fact that every other  step of an inexperienced young country will not be an entirely  lucky one. Leaving aside the others, we will discuss one of the  10 treaties. "Economic, trade, and cultural comings and goings  between the Chinese People's Republic and Kazakhstan will not  require visas. Visits by individuals for personal reasons will,  as before, require visas." That is to say, Chinese "delegations"  coming for trade, for kin, for an excursion, and for other  reasons do not have to appear one by one before our chief  ambassador in Beijing, Murat Awyezov. We were shocked to hear  from one of our Chinese friends on "trade:" The Chinese People's  Republic is going to send hundreds and thousands of delegations  to Kazakhstan... Thus, if the Chinese are not on the march in  Kazakhstan, who is? Why should the Chinese, who even without  this are overflowing China's boundaries, not appear in  multitudes taking advantage of favorable "decisions." Is it not  a matter of "a stray arrow also hits some sad soul." On the  other hand, our kinsmen in China never get to the Kazakhstan  Embassy in Beijing. They have difficulty getting a visa to  travel on personal business to Kazakhstan. One of our kinsmen  from China said that, when village people come with bribes to go  to Beijing, their wish is not granted. See how we have harmed  out kinsmen through that "agreement" draw up to give unlimited  rights to China! "If leather rains from the skies, the slave  will still have no shoes," as the old saying goes. To make the  matter short, Chinese are flooding into Kazakhstan and the  Kazakhs cannot come. This is something we "did" to ourselves.  Since the premier has gone and signed a treaty which "created no  barriers to those coming for trade, tourism, or excursions," if  we now say "get out!" to Chinese citizens coming on such  "business," the Chinese government will come and say to us: "Oh  Kazakhs, if you are going to be a country you have to keep your  word. If you are not, be ready to fight." Who can blame them?  This is because, as we have said above, a billion and a half  people are pressed for space and having a difficult time. For  that reason, the primary policy of that government carried out  by Chinese citizens is: "inside China, or without, be it as it  may, look out for yourself." For that reason, there seems to be  no limitation placed on China's citizens wishing to go abroad.  For China knows well that it cannot find, even if it looks  everywhere in this world, a[nother] country like Kazakhstan  which is very rich, which has abundant land, few people, and  little understanding about itself, and which is furthermore a  neighbor and a careless, trusting young nation. This is because  several countries where the Chinese had the possibility of entry  have had other thoughts after the "Singapore Tragedy." For  example, Germany once and for all halted the coming of Chinese  three years ago. Leaving aside other things, the nationality of  Taiwan and Hong Kong is Chinese, but these countries have begun  to set limits on those coming from the Chinese People's  Republic. It has been two or three years since America itself,  the great country on the other side of the world, enacted a  resolution preventing Chinese from coming. Judging from this,  only Kazakhstan opens its arms widely to Chinese and creates  special opportunities for them. If something is not done about  our China policy, there is no use saying: "we will clean up the  Chinese problem." The reason is that if one throws out a  thousand Chinese for a couple of months, a few thousand more  arrive in a few weeks. Some thoughtful people are grumbling at  home, but, as long as the "Beijing Treaty" signed by Li Tan and  Tereshchenko stands, it will simply not be possible to do  anything about the Chinese stream flooding in. This is the  result of the treaty, along with the "love" inside Kazakhs for  the Chinese. Thus, when the market has us by the throat, in a  difficult time when the high cost of things tugs at our  garments, can one take into careful consideration the Kazakh who  bends down when he sees a dollar in the road. It is no secret  that the Chinese, who are flooding into Kazakhstan as their  future home, are buying interesting Kazakh things and Kazakh  women. When you give your daughter in marriage, it is for love.  That is what it is. This is because, if we are really Kazakhs,  from where would we get the idea of "feasting sons-in-law who  are not Muslims?" Now it is impossible to send back the  Chinese...however one decides to do it. The only way is to  review the treaty in question. When it has been reviewed, all  comings and goings between Kazakhstan and China will be by visa.  If the treaty in question is annulled, licenses will be sold to  firms exporting to China and this will be made a source of  income. Thereby the likes of Kazakhstan business people,  affected by the entry of thousands of Chinese, will be able to  get on their feet.    That is the sum total of it. We have said a great deal, and  we have said very little. All of this springs from our not  knowing the Chinese properly. This is because the Chinese are  not the Russians you know, who say "thanks brother" in their  happiness at a five kopek profit. These are not our Uzbek elder  brothers who set out with their right hands in the robes. They  are also not our Kirghiz kinsmen who come wandering about and  who come when we want them and return, saying "Oh Kazakhs, may  it be so!" The Chinese are a people who do not let others know  their secrets easily, who are particularly cunning, falsely  polite, completely vindictive, sullen in character, and who are  venturesome, carefully fulfilling plans set for the centuries.  China is a great country to our east. It is not easy to be a  true neighbor to China. To achieve that, first of all, we need  to form a special China research institute and have it take part  in official research in order to obtain correct knowledge and a  clear view about China. Even if we call it a "China" research  institute in the old way, we must make a special effort to  prevent Chinese from filling up the ranks of that organization.    In conclusion, today everything is needed for an independent  Kazakhstan. Among these things, we particularly need knowledge  about other countries in the world. For this reason, it would be  good to form organizations to research the countries very much  connected with the interests and fate of Kazakhstan. If such  research organizations prepared information and materials for  the branches of the government, we would avoid the type of  hastiness described above. For that reason, my brothers, we must  love our hard-won independence with the sincere love of our  hearts and learn how to defend it to the utmost of our abilities.</p>

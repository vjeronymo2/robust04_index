			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Two commentaries in the Portuguese press  dealt with the issues of national sovereignty and whether to  increase the authority of the European Union (EU).  <H5>  "Antifederalists" Make EU Domestic Issue </H5>   Writing in the 23 May Lisbon daily PUBLICO, Alvaro  Vasconcelos, president of the Institute for Strategic and  International Studies, credited "antifederalists" -- opponents  of a more federated EU -- with bringing the EU issue to the  center of the political debate in Portugal. This has ensured  that the question will not be the sole purview of governments,  Vasconcelos continued, and will contribute to the  democratization of the European process and the increased  ability of the Portuguese people to influence both governmental  and EU decisions. To this end, however, the difficult questions  linked to the goal of achieving a politically united Europe must  be discussed and the debate must no longer be defined by the  anti-Europeanists, Vasconcelos warned. Europeanists have  avoided a debate on a federal EU because they believe that  "Europe does not produce votes." It is difficult to understand  this conviction, Vasconcelos wrote, given that polls show  popular support for "deepening" the EU. The debate on the EU, he  continued, is of "poor" quality because it has not focused on  essential issues such as the EU's "democratic deficit"  (shortcomings in providing democratic institutions) and the  substantial powers to be granted to the European Parliament, the  lack of transparency in making decisions, the participation of  citizens, and the consequences of enlargement. In addition,  Vasconcelos maintained, the economic debate should not be  restricted to how to spend EU funds. It should include a  discussion on the necessary measures to overcome the economic  crisis and on the utility of the EU Commission's white book on  unemployment. The security problems now confronting Europe,  especially the resurgence of nationalism, should also be an  important part of the debate. The question of lost sovereignty  is endlessly debated at a time when "the danger is not `more  Europe' but indeed `less Europe,'" Vasconcelos wrote.  "Antifederalists" may well contribute to the reinforcement of an  EU discussion on federalism by making Europe the center of  Portugal's political debate, Vasconcelos concluded.  <H5>  Sovereignty Issue Discussed </H5>   To shed light on the European issue it is necessary to  clarify the confusion surrounding the debate on national  sovereignty, wrote Teresa de Sousa in the 23 May PUBLICO. While  Portugal lost sovereignty when it joined the European Community,  it also gained more power on the international scene and is now  better able to defend its economic, diplomatic, and security  interests, de Sousa maintained. The need to compete with Japan  and the United States justified the transformation to a single  European currency, De Sousa wrote. Given the globalization of  the economy and the liberalization of the financial markets,  countries as small as Portugal or as large as France will be  unable to control the stability of their currencies. Thus  monetary union between the various EU states, which demands a  narrowing of the levels of economic development and a high  degree of financial stability, would help the economic and  social cohesion policy aimed at helping economically weaker  countries such as Portugal.    Portugal does not lose autonomy with the Common Foreign and  Security Policy (CFSP), de Sousa continued, because each country  is free to pursue its own foreign policy correponding to its  specific national interests. On the other hand, Lisbon's  negotiating capabilities with third countries will increase  significantly because of its EU membership.    With the abolition of the EU's internal borders, one of the  arguments of EU foes has been that Portugal must receive East  European immigrants while rejecting African or Brazilian  immigrants, therefore limiting its autonomy in granting entry  permits. In de Sousa's opinion, however, the restrictions  applied to the entry of immigrants and refugees from former  Portuguese colonies are fully Lisbon's area of competence.</p>

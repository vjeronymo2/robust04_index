			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Is Japan Qualified?" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- A ranking official of  the Japanese Foreign Ministry said some time ago that Japan  should express its desire to be a permanent member of the United  Nations Security Council [UNSC] "more explicitly than before" to  the international community.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that, in  seeking  permanent membership of the Security Council, Japan intends to  gratify its dominationist desire through military intervention  in the disputes of the world and have its past crimes hushed up  at any cost.    The news analyst says:    A high-placed authority of the Japanese Government has gone  the length of making Japan appear a permanent member of the  Security Council, insolently claiming that "Japan has so far  played a role equal to a permanent member of the U.N. Security  Council."    Such behaviour of Japan is a mockery of the international  community, which shows its brazenness.    Japan is not qualified to be a permanent member of the  Security Council.    By unleashing World War II, Japan destroyed world peace and  security and imposed big disasters on the peoples of many  countries. For these crimes, it is specified as a "hostile  state" in the U.N. charter.    Still more grave is that Japan has set it as its state  strategy to revive its policy of aggression of the past.    The policy of aggression of Japan which is hastening its  conversion into a military power and its nuclear armament after  paving the way for troops' dispatch overseas, poses a big threat  to the peace in Asia and the world.    Japan is racing headlong toward aggression, not breaking  with  its imperialist past. How can it be a permanent member of the  U.N. Security Council whose mission it is to ensure peace and  security of the world?    If Japan is made a permanent member, it will mean  overlooking  Japan's failure to liquidate its past and encouraging it to  commit past crimes again.    Before coveting permanent membership, Japan must  conscientiously repent of its mistake, honestly discharge its  responsibility for apology and compensation and stop pursuing  aggression and war.</p>

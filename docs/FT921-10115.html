			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Brokers criticised for breach of code THE TAKEOVER Panel yesterday criticised Smith New Court, Henry Cooke and NM Rothschild for breaching the takeover code ahead of Monday's bid by Petrocon, the engineering and surveying group, for James Wilkes, the Sheffield-based specialist engineer. There was a 26 per cent increase in James Wilkes's share price before the announcement on January 20 that it had received an approach that could led to a full offer. Henry Cooke and Smith New Court, Petrocon's advisers, were criticised for not consulting with the Panel before approaching 'a significant number' of Petrocon and Wilkes institutional shareholders to establish attitudes to an offer. More than 10 people are understood to have been approached - in breach of the Panel guideline that the 'circle' of those with knowledge of a possible bid should not exceed six. The Panel also criticised the two houses for not consulting it on January 15, after Wilkes shares had risen by more than 10 per cent above the price at which Petrocon bought a 2.8 per cent stake three days earlier. It also said Rothschild had breached the code by not making a prompt announcement of the possible offer on behalf of Wilkes after the shares rose 11 per cent by 11am on February 20. Neither Rothschild nor Robert Fleming, which has since been appointed adviser to Petrocon, believes the Panel's criticism will have any impact on the bid. Petrocon's 13-for-3 share-exchange offer valued Wilkes at Pounds 35.8m yesterday. Fleming said Petrocon had non-binding legally written confirmation from holders of 29.1 per cent of Wilkes' shares that they plan to accept the offer.</p>

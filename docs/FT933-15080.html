			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Wallenbergs sell stake in Christies INVESTOR, the Wallenberg family's main holding company, has sold its 7.5 per cent stake in Christies International, the UK auction house, in a further consolidation of its shareholding portfolio. Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but at Wednesday's closing price of 191p, the disposal of 11.9m shares is worth Pounds 22.7m (Dollars 34.9m). The shares were bought by Goldman Sachs which has placed most of them with institutional investors. Investor said the move had been made to cut debt and concentrate activities on Saab-Scania, the aerospace and automotive group, and other core shareholdings. Last month, the group raised SKr3bn (Dollars 416.7m) through the sale of its shareholding in Asea, the joint owner of the Asea Brown Boveri combine, as part of this strategy. Investor built up its stake in Christies during 1989 and 1990 at a time when the UK group's share price was much higher than it is today. The stake formed part of Investor's trading portfolio and never ranked alongside its holdings in many of Sweden's blue chip companies as a strategic investment.</p>

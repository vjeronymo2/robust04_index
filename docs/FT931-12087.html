			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: Murky world of the secret service - Security during the war, considered MI5's finest hour IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE ODIOUS: DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL IN WARTIME BRITAIN by A W Brian Simpson Oxford Pounds 35, 453 pages BRITAIN's security services have always existed in a dangerous constitutional vacuum, their wide-ranging powers untrammelled by too much concern for public accountability. Their principal claim on our affections has been the spawning of some good fictional thrillers. This impressive book delves into the murky muddle which suffused the activities of the secret services during the Second World War. In many ways it was MI5's finest hour: government gave it its head to imprison, without trial and often without stated accusation, thousands of British and foreign citizens. The most famous case, that of Sir Oswald Mosley, head of the British Union of Fascists, is still remembered; but Brian Simpson's meticulous study examines the blundering paranoia which led to the far worse treatment - including physical and psychological brutality - meted out to many other, forgotten names. There are some grimly risible moments. In the House of Commons one MP critical of the round-ups, Richard Stokes, drew attention to the arrest and five month detention of a woman who had two children. When MI5 had searched her house 'a diary was found for 1938 with the entry 'M49 Destroy British Queen. Instal Italian Queen.' It took MI5 six weeks to find out that 'this lady kept bees, and that this entry referred to a method of improving the breed of bees.'' No matter; they still kept her inside for another 14 weeks. Brian Simpson's book indicates that at times of high stress neither the British constitution nor its legal system are sufficient to safeguard abuses of power by secretive elements of the executive. On May 22 1940 parliament, which had been lied to by both government and the executive as to the full scope of the legislation, passed the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 'which formally conferred on the executive the powers appropriate to a totalitarian state at war.' That night the privy council passed regulation 18B (1A), which was to be used to detain without trial not just members and former members of the British Union but also those who had never been associated with it. Mosley was arrested on May 23. Regulation 18B came into existence precisely because MI5 could discover no proof of Mosley's organisation being funded or controlled by Nazi Germany; one of its clauses provided that it was sufficient for an organisation to be subject to foreign 'influence', and on that basis the BU was rounded up. At the same time, the certainly foreign-influenced and controlled Communist Party of Great Britain, which, unlike the BU, had considerable scope for causing industrial unrest, was left unhindered. Mosley was a relatively easy target; his patriotic fascism had no real toe-hold amongst the general public. But in the process of bypassing laws to stifle an anti-democratic organisation, the furtive branch of the executive chipped off another protective layer of British civil liberties. Britain's security services, backed by government, have long maintained that it would be an absurdity for their activities to be open to public scrutiny. That stance has become increasingly untenable in the light of recent events, not least the Matrix Churchill affair. Since 1974 Britain has operated the Prevention of Terrorism Act, giving the Home Secretary the right to sentence British citizens to internal exile to Ulster without the right of a trial. We have, in essence, not moved very far from Regulation 18B. Thus the importance of this book, beyond its historical record, is its timeliness. Simpson, summarising just one element of his investigation, says: 'the independent and secret character of MI5 enabled it to withold information and evidence from the Home Office's committee, and to pressure the Home Office into decisions whose merits the Home Office was unable to check, and for which the Home Office was nevertheless politically responsible.' Contemporary Britain is glued to the 1940s in quite unpleasant ways.</p>

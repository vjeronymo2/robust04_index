			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Russian premier backs sale of state farms Russia's prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, yesterday spoke out strongly in favour of private ownership of farms, backing a programme to auction state farms across the country. His comments dramatically re-establish the prospects for reform in Russia, which appeared to have stagnated since last December's parliamentary elections strengthened anti-reform groups. The prime minister spoke immediately after attending the auction of the land and property of a state farm in the Nizhny Novgorod region. The region has become a much-promoted symbol of practical market reform in Russia. Speaking after the auction to governors and senior officials from other regions and republics within Russia, who had come to observe the land sale, Mr Chernomyrdin said with some passion there was 'no more criticising, no more talking. We now have a model, you must just go and do it'. He said the government would adopt the Nizhny approach as a federal programme - though to accommodate local objections he said the programme would be adopted 'as a basis', leaving room for local changes. Mr Boris Nemtsov, the young, pro-reform governor of Nizhny, who was surprised and delighted by Mr Chernomyrdin's emphatic support, said before the prime minister announced his decision that 'if Chernomyrdin wishes to write himself a place in history, this is his chance'. Laws and decrees already exist to provide a legislative base for land privatisation - but the crucial government report guidelines have so far been lacking. More surprisingly, the deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, Mr Alexander Zaveryukha - the most conservative of the senior cabinet members - also called for the land sale programme to be adopted at a federal level, and even supported the creation of a centre for training in land privatisation, to be established in Nizhny Novgorod. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for privatisation, and one of the few radicals left in the government, found himself on the same side as his more conservative colleague - but warned the conference of governors that unless privatisation is pushed through energetically by the regional leadership, 'all our support, all our subsidies will be of no use because the peasants will not feel themselves masters on their own land'. The Nizhny programme, developed over the past year with the assistance of teams from the International Finance Corporation, gives each member of state and collective farms the entitlement to a plot of land and part of the farm property - but encourages them to band together in groups to create viable-sized holdings. The auction yesterday of the Sixty Years of October Collective Farm was the third in the region, in a process which has been slow, painstaking and is still regarded with doubt by many in the countryside accustomed to the slothful but secure rhythm of state farm life. Mr Anthony Doran, the IFC's manager for Russia, said the programme had been designed to apply to the federal as well as the regional level - as long as key elements like transparency, simplicity and speed of sale were observed.</p>

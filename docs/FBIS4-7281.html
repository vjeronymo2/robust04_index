			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Shinseito-Komeito Cabinet Distancing Itself </F> From Reform"; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 29 April Morning Edition]    [Text] The Hata government has finally set sail. The  political chaos wrought over a government to succeed Hosokawa  will now come to an end, but the Hata government is a minority  party government since the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition, which means the government's  base is weak. There is already talk it will be a "short-lived  government." Once the 1994 budget is passed, the political scene  will most likely change, and the House of Representatives will  be dissolved for a general election.    As regards major policy matters, it would be absurd to have  many expectations of the Hata government which became a minority  government with the departure of the SDPJ. Most political  parties including the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] are showing  a positive attitude on deliberating and passing the budget, but,  as for the situation after that, there is no telling what will  happen. There will be major turbulence on the political scene.    The Hata government, which has started with a different  coalition framework, is made up of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] members in its axis plus Komeito members and defectors  from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. It looks almost like  "the former Tanaka faction plus Komeito."    As far as political reform is concerned, all that happened  was the change of the election system to single-seat election  districts; the major problems of preventing political corruption  and tearing down the collusion of politicians, bureaucrats, and  businessmen has not been dealt with at all. Moreover, looking  at the faces of the Hata cabinet, we can see there is a major  change from the Hosokawa government which had reform as its  banner. Indeed, the new cabinet is one which is far from a  reform government. The fact it no longer has a minister in  charge of political reform symbolizes this well.    Various polls show that what the public wants most of Prime  Minister Hata is to eradicate the dual power structure created  by the remote control of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa behind the scenes. The exercise of absolute influence on  government operations by an individual from behind the curtains  makes the whereabouts of political responsibilities ambiguous,  and entails the risk of government power being abused. From the  fact that assigning of posts in the Hata cabinet leaned  favorably toward Shinseito and Komeito, we can say that the  so-called Ozawa-Ichikawa (the latter being general secretary of  Komeito) duo has gained more power.    Defectors from the LDP were also picked in the cabinet.  Their selection is believed to be window-dressing aimed at  further inciting rifts within the LDP and at agitating the SDPJ.  The late Kakuei Tanaka who was called the shadow general [yami  shogun] put efforts into building the Tanaka faction to gain the  power of influence over political circles. To do so, he picked  people from other factions as members of his cabinet, thus  publicizing the merits of joining the Tanaka faction. The  recent cabinet appointments smell strongly of a Kakuei-style  political scheme. One face of the new government can be said to  have been revealed by this.    A feature of the Hata government without the SDPJ is that  this is not just simply a coalition government of minority  parties, but a minority coalition government which was formed  without the participation of the largest party (LDP) and the  second-largest party (SDPJ). It is a group of splinter parties  of third and lesser ranking parties, plus groups of those who  defected from the LDP without waiting for the public to pass  judgment on them through elections. The government may be legal  in that the prime minister received Diet approval, but there is  a question as to whether it is a politically legitimate  government with power entrusted to it by the majority of the  people.    Many people who had expectations of the new government which  replaced the LDP and who had been so pleased with the advent of  the Hosokawa government could be embarrassed and disappointed by  this big change in the basic nature of the coalition government.  The political situation now is one which necessitates the  dissolution of the House of Representatives for a new general  election once the budget is passed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the order of the three criteria for designating FHs in paragraph (d)(1) should be revised to add greater emphasis to the serving of access needs of the NFS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This comment was accepted. The order of the three items was revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 660.107&blank;Allocations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter noted the restrictiveness of the NPRM in that it limits the funding of the allocated portion of the Public Lands Highway Program exclusively to FHs. The commenter further pointed out that the 1991 ISTEA amended 23 U.S.C. 202 by striking the subsection that dealt with FHs as a part of the Public Lands Highway Program with the result that, according to the commenter, one-third of the allocated program may be spent on highways other than FHs. Under this broader definition of Public Lands Highways, the States would have the flexibility to spend the allocated portion of PLH funds on all kinds of highways such as the Bureau of Land Management roads and even Indian Reservation Roads. The ``equal consideration'' language of the ISTEA, in the commenter's view, would allow for at least half of the allocated funds to be spent on such roads while the NPRM language restricts the allocated portion to FHs only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The conference report on ISTEA states that ``Sixty-six percent of the public lands highway account shall be allocated to the Forest Service regional offices for use in 41 States based on the FH criteria. The remaining 34 percent shall be allocated by the Secretary based on national competition for other forest or public lands highways.'' (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 404, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 331 (1991).) Therefore, the interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 202(b) is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Thirty-four percent of the public lands highway funds shall be allocated in a discretionary manner, giving preference to States that contain at least 3 percent of the total public lands in the nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sixty-six percent of the public lands highway funds are to be allocated to the FS Regions in accordance with section 134 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, 101 Stat. 132, 173). Section 134 pertained to the allocation of FH funds, which is part of the Public Lands Highway category. Therefore, the language of this section was not changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two of the SHAs took exception to the fact that this section requires the allocation of Public Lands Highway Funds by FS Region, citing an apparent inconsistency with section 134 of the STURAA which allocates ``for expenditure in each State.'' It was suggested that, for some States which have more than one FS Region, allocation by FS Region potentially creates difficulties, such as competition or conflicts between States, and that FH funds should continue to be allocated as outlined in the STURAA. Also, because the ISTEA requires that all FS projects be included in each State's ``Statewide Transportation Improvement Program'' (STIP), allocation of funds by State would make it easier for each State to project available funding and projects for inclusion in its STIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM may have given the appearance that the allocation method is being changed. Actually, the NPRM proposed to continue with the same FH allocation method which has been in existence since FY 85. If FH funds were to be allocated to the States, 34 States would have their ``hold harmless'' funds reduced by an aggregate total of approximately $90 million per year (based on FY 94 allocation amounts). This represents nearly 85 percent of the total FY 94 FH funds allocation. The regulation will continue with the allocation in its present form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the word ``elements,'' used in the NPRM to state that the allocation of funds for FHs uses values based on relative transportation needs of the various elements of the NFS, should be replaced with the word ``resources.'' The commenter pointed out that the word ``element'' is used in the definition of renewable resources and could be construed to limit allocations based on renewable resources only. The commenter also believes the term ``resources'' was defined to include both renewable and nonrenewable resources and is more appropriate to use in defining the allocation process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This wording was carried forward from the previous wording of the existing regulation. However, the sentence was clarified by deleting the entire phrase ``the various elements of,'' thereby eliminating the need for referring to either ``resources'' or ``elements.'' It now refers only to ``using values based on relative transportation needs of the NFS.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

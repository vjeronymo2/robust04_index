PRI supporters who gathered in front of party headquarters  in  this capital a few minutes before the report that Colosio had  died on the operating table at Tijuana General Hospital have  repeatedly called for justice and unity.    Throughout the night, however, calls for unity were  intermingled with shouts of "Colosio, yes; Camacho, no" from PRI  militants who could not hold back their tears. Colosio's  rivalry with Manuel Camacho Solis, the commissioner of peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas, to succeed Carlos Salinas de Gortari  as Mexico's president had continued even after Colosio was  designated as the party's official candidate. Last night, many  PRI militants warned the party leadership that they would not  tolerate the former foreign minister's becoming president.    A group of women who had gathered outside PRI headquarters  proclaimed: "We want justice." The tense and emotional  situation that pervaded the site exploded the moment officials  and militants heard on television that the candidate had died.  While some people cried in offices, other militants tried to  organize public meetings by party leaders while unsuccessfully  trying to keep back thousands of people who had gathered outside  the building.    A woman near a table covered with candles said, "There are  many traitors, and it is not good to divide the country." The  people nearby applauded her, apparently understanding the  meaning of her statement.    The people shouted party slogans and expressions of support  for Colosio, but they did not heed a suggestion to sing a  "corrido [a traditional folk genre in which a person's life or  accomplishments are praised in song] for Colosio" in honor of  the candidate.    Colosio's followers remain gathered around the PRI building,  where they will hold a vigil today when Colosio's body is  brought to a chapel to be installed at the PRI headquarters.</p>

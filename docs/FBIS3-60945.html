			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Fathallah] </F>   [Excerpt] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has  affirmed that there can be no dialogue with terrorists because  they are a group of schemers funded from abroad, similar to the  German gangs. Their objective is to strike at political  stability in Egypt and try to weaken its economy. They hide  behind Islam although they are a misguided group. The majority  of the Egyptian people are Muslim and do not need guardians or  someone to teach them about Islam.    He said that the issue of terrorism in Egypt is different  from the issue of terrorism in Algeria, where the terrorist  groups succeeded in getting into parliament. But in Egypt the  terrorists have failed to get into the People's Assembly or  Consultative Council. They have also failed to infiltrate the  ranks of the Army, security forces, and large institutions.    In addition, the terrorist phenomenon in Egypt is different  from that in the United Kingdom, for example, due to the  presence of the shadow government and some form of Irish  independence from the United Kingdom.

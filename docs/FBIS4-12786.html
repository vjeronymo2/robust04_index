			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 12 (AFP) -- Lebanon is to ask for the  extradition of Christian opposition leader Michel 'Awn living in  political asylum in France, Labour Minister 'Abdallah al-Amin  said on Tuesday [13 April].    Al-Amin, a pro-Syrian, warned ties between the two countries  could worsen if the request was turned down and blamed "certain  French cabinet ministers for being responsible for the death of  Lebanese people because of their support for 'Awn."    He did not name the ministers but told the London-based  AL-HAYAH newspaper received in Beirut "they are trying to  destroy what is left of French-Lebanese relations."    Al-Amin, who last year headed the Lebanese branch of the  Syrian ruling Ba'th Party, said the ministers' stance did not  reflect official French policy.    General 'Awn headed a military government in the late 1980s  until he was driven out of the presidential palace in 1990 in a  joint Syrian-Lebanese offensive.    He was given refuge at the French embassy in Lebanon and was  banished the following year to France, where he was given  political asylum on condition he avoided any political activity,  including political statements.    But in a recent interview with AL-HAYAH, 'Awn blasted the  Beirut government and voiced support for a federation in Lebanon.</p>

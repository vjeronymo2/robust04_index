			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Brussels crackdown on Italian state aid THE European Commission has told Italy to explain why it has prolonged an Ecu292m (Pounds 200m) aid scheme for the consumer electronics industry, approved by Brussels in 1984-85 for only five years. The move is part of a widening crackdown by the EC on illegal state aid. The action is intended as much to forestall further aid it believes Rome is planning, as to hold Italy to the agreement. This put strict time limits on the aid, channelled through the state's Ristrutturazione Elettronica SpA (REL), set up by the Italian industry ministry in 1982 to restructure the sector by taking minority stakes in, and providing soft loans for, consumer electronics manufacturers and components suppliers. The stakes were supposed to be sold to the private sector after five years; the Commission says state holdings in six companies have not been. Furthermore, Brussels says, three companies in receipt of the subsidised loans have missed their repayments schedule. This 'illegal application' of the agreed aid regime constitutes a distortion of competition, the Commission says, and it has asked Rome for a reply within one month. Yesterday's decision follows the announcement of four state aid inquiries this month. These are into French plans to pump more than Dollars 1bn into Bull, the computer maker, and Thomson, the defence and electronics group; into France's use of its main state enterprises to funnel money into smaller companies in industrially declining areas; into a Dollars 230m Italian plan to restructure the road haulage sector; and into Belgium's plans to recapitalise Sabena, its ailing flag airline, to the tune of Dollars 1bn. The Commission also intends to investigate France's plans to inject around Dollars 400m into Air France. By contrast, the Commission yesterday approved eight separate state aid schemes allowed by EC law: for research and development and for backward regions in Italy and Spain; for small to medium-sized industry in Italy and for Dutch shipbuilders; and a UK undertaking on future industrial aid to assisted areas.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Norway raises DnB stake to 70% THE Norwegian government has extended its grip on the commercial banks, raising its stake in Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest, to 70 per cent from 55 per cent. The move follows overwhelming agreement at the bank's annual meeting to write down the value of its ordinary share capital to zero as part of a deal agreed last November to prop up the bank. Acceptance of the proposal means the bank can receive NKr1.5bn (Dollars 217m) in fresh preference capital. The Bank Insurance Fund and Bank Investment Fund became owners of Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, respectively Norway's second and third-biggest banks, in 1991 in similar rescue operations. DnB said the decision applied to writedowns to zero of NKr1.25bn in preference capital obtained from the Bank Insurance Fund, and NKr938.8m in preference capital from the Guarantee Fund of the Commercial Banks. Following the write-downs, the bank's share capital amounts to NKr2.375bn.</p>

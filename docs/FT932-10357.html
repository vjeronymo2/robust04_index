			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / As They Say in Europe: Washington Post and water buffalogate IT WAS a great relief to get back to the European papers after a week of the Washington Post. On the east side of the Atlantic one finds awful drivel, lowest-common-denominator lubricity; bitter, partisan distortions, cheap abuse and fanatical commitment to pointless causes. US columnists try to scale some of these heights but end up merely driving hobby horses into the ground. Where Europe scores is in the lack of the mealy-mouthed high-mindedness that characterises the better sort of US newspaper and which makes even The Independent seem vulgar. That became especially obvious to anybody who landed in Washington in the middle of the Gay Rights March a couple of weeks ago. It was hard to find anywhere to stay: one wondered if those who were able to occupy nearly all the rooms in Dollars 220-a-night hotels wholly deserved the large additions to federal spending they demanded. This point could not have been made in The Washington Post which devoted two sympathetic pages to the march on the day of the event, and even more before and after. Now the paper employs an 'Ombudsman' to keep the journalists in line. This year's examiner of the paper's conscience is one Joann Byrd. A week after the March she wrote that the Post had done an inadequate job in covering it. Not all was bad: the paper had at least fully reported the views of those involved - 'A story that has needed telling since the beginning of newspapers.' I believe this to be a reference to the failure of the first Italian Gazzetta in 1560 to publish an account of 'Michelangelo at home' in its 'Lifestyle' section. What the Washington Post's ombudsperson had in mind then emerged in a fascinating assembly of grammatical novelties and syntactical traffic jams. The paper had dealt with two aspects of the problem of being gay in America today, but - 'there was a third story and uncharacteristically The Post did little with it: Gay rights is also a political and public policy story, a sociology story, a hard-news story of disagreement and discrimination, their sources and remedy . . . what we did not get was a straightforward status report on gays, nor the usual measures of the hurdles and the political environment in which this issue is being argued.' It just goes to show, even in a two-page overkill you may still not reach boredom's last frontier. Another item in the Post last week recounted how the University of Pennsylvania has been shaken by a crisis which erupted when a student, Eden Jacobowitz, shouted 'Shut up you water buffalo' at five black female students who were taking part in a sorority celebration one night on the sidewalk below his window. He was therefore caught in the university's Speech Code which is designed to ensure nobody is ever offended again. 'Experts' were brought in to decide whether 'water buffalo' had a history as a racial epithet, one faculty member arguing that the creature was a large black animal living in Africa. It is in fact an Asian brown animal. Jacobowitz explained that he had translated it from the Yiddish behema which has no racial content. The importance of the matter lies partly in the fact that the President of Penn State, Sheldon Hackney, is President Clinton's choice to head the National Endowment of the Humanities. He is, needless to say, a supporter of the Speech Code. To its credit the Post did head a subsequent editorial, 'Speech code silliness.' It published a section of the code which showed what Americans are up against if they want to express themselves - a listener has only to infer that a direct injury is intended for the speaker to be judged guilty. In Europe it is unlikely that one would be caught up in a semi-judicial enquiry as a result of shouting the names of Asian oxen at one's colleagues. But then a European would have been in trouble had he opted for the proper American alternative available to Jacobowitz - merely threatening the alleged water buffaloes with an AK47. The obsessive concern of the US is not, as is sometimes believed, with the rights of individuals, but with the rights of individuals as members of a class. In the US anyone can buy a rifle because there is thought to be a general right to own guns. Those who do not own guns have, as such, no rights, however terrified they may be of their neighbours. This is because there is no recognised class of non-gun owners. In most of Europe the individual is by and large protected from gunmen because gun-owning is an exceptional right. This gulf in attitudes accounts for the difference that exists between newspapers in Europe and the US. The latter are devoted to what one might call regulatory matters, to the arbitration of absurd conflicts, to the definition of an absolute right to free speech in a society which demands absolute protection from verbal injury, and to the endless insistence on 'the rights of us.' No wonder people on Dollars 250,000 a year see themselves as victims. No wonder people like David Koresh become significant figures.

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: SNP angered by remarks on Scots THE SCOTTISH National Party yesterday called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to disown comments it said were made by his press secretary, Mr Gus O'Donnell, after Tuesday's Budget. Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said: 'Downing Street's message to the Scots can best be summarised as 'let them drink whisky'.' The SNP says Mr O'Donnell said Scotland should be grateful, especially for the measures on whisky, training and petroleum revenue tax.</p>

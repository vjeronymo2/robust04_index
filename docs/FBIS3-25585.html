			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There has been strong reaction to statements this  weekend by the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] that all land will  be confiscated for redistribution. A spokesman for the National  Party, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said in a statement that  this ignores economic realities. Mr. Errol Moorcroft of the  Democratic Party described the statements as utterly  irresponsible and said it is proof that the PAC is out of touch  with reality. He said such a policy would destroy the economy  and permanently damage South Africa's ability to feed its people.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Andries van Zyl] In  Bloemfontein, the Orange Free State Agricultural Union [OFSAU]  attacked the PAC over its land policy. The union said PAC  President Clarence Makwetu's statement on the possible  resumption of the armed struggle to ensure land redistribution  is looking for trouble.    [OFSAU President Dr. Piet Gouws, in English] I think it is  about time that somebody says to Mr. Makwetu: Listen, the PAC  and no other force in South Africa will force the farmers off  their land. [as heard]    [Van Zyl] Referring to voter recruitement among farm  laborers, Dr. Gouws said he is aware of some Free State farmers  who allow only a certain political party on their farms, while  the African National Congress is prohibited.    [Gouws, in Afrikaans] As far as I am concerned, it is  totally  immoral. One either allows every one to campaign or no one at  all, for security reasons or whatever. But this is something  we cannot condone at all. [end recording]</p>

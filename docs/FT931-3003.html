			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): One form for PEP investors THE CHANCELLOR proposes to make some changes to Personal Equity Plans (PEPs). The main points are that, from 6 April 1993: Investors who wish to make regular subscriptions to a PEP for a number of years will need to complete only one initial application form; A number of minor (mostly administrative) changes will be made to the PEP rules in response to representations, in particular those arising from the Inland Revenue's consultation document last year; 'Non-qualifying' unit and investment trusts will have to hold at least 50 per cent of their investments in ordinary shares to qualify for PEP subscription up to Pounds 1,500. The chancellor's intentions are to simplify administrative procedures for PEP managers and investors; to make minor improvements in the legislation; to improve the quality of statistical information; and to maintain the emphasis on investment in shares.</p>

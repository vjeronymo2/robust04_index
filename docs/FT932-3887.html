			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Austrian sells chip maker stake AUSTRIAN Industries, the troubled state-owned industrial holding company, is selling 74 per cent of the equity of its subsidiary, Austria Mikro Systeme International, a maker of specialised integrated circuits. The issue marks Austria's first true privatisation. Previous flotations of state-owned companies have always left majority control in the hands of the government. Final pricing has not been fixed, but the issue is expected to value the company, which makes chips for mobile telephones, factory robots and car components, at about Sch860m (Dollars 75m). AMS had net income of Sch50.7m on sales of Sch724.6m last year and is not raising any money for itself from the flotation. Of the 1.85m shares in the issue, 43 per cent will be offered to international investors and 57 per cent to private and institutional investors in Austria. Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, global co-ordinator of the issue, and Kleinwort Benson of London, international lead manager, will be hoping to avoid repeating the embarrassing aftermath to the last Austrian flotation. Last November, 49 per cent of the shares of Voest Alpine Eisenbahnsysteme, a maker of high technology railway equipment, were floated. Even though VAE exceeded its profit forecast and still has excellent prospects, the share price slumped from Sch980 on issue to a low of Sch715 in mid-January. At Sch830 this week, it is still well below the issue price. Brokers say the problem, apart from the general weakness of the Austrian equity market, was that many Austrian subscribers sold their shares shortly after receiving them, catching the market managers unawares. This time a slightly larger portion of the issue has been reserved for international investors. Austria is issuing Sch8bn of 6.5 per cent five-year bonds due in 1998 and priced at 99.85 to give a top yield to tender bidders of 6.8 per cent, according to lead manager Oesterreichischen Kontrollbank. A total of 50.88 per cent of bids were accepted in the tender and the issue has an average yield of 6.536 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 18 (AFP) -- The Medecins sans  Frontieres [MSF--Doctors Without Borders] relief group Monday  [18 April] called for the resignation of UN special envoy to the  former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, saying the UN had  "systematically lied" about the situation in Bosnia.    The president of the organisation, Rony Brauman, also  accused  the UN of "shamelessly capitulating" in the face of the Bosnian  Serb offensive against Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in  eastern Bosnia which has now all but fallen.    "While Gorazde was drowning under a barrage of fire, we were  being told that a ceasefire was agreed on the ground, that we  were headed for a peaceful settlement, and that all was well,"  Brauman said.    "What is at stake is the fate of other so-called safe  havens," he said. What was to stop Serb forces from attacking  other UN-declared safe havens in the wake of their success at  Gorazde, he asked.    Meanwhile some 200 wounded were awaiting evacuation from  Gorazde and two Medecins sans Frontieres doctors still operating  in the town's hospital were working in horrendous conditions,  Brauman said.    Two International Committee of the Red Cross representatives  and four from the office of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees also remained in the town where 65,000 residents and  refugees underwent renewed shelling Monday morning.    "At the hospital, it's chaos. Bullets are whizzing through  the windows into patients' rooms, shells are exploding in the  hospital garden sending deadly shrapnel into the rooms of this  so-called neutral area," Brauman said. The emergency room is  full of dead and wounded, civilians and soldiers," according to  the MSF doctors on the spot.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nike posts strong advance in third period NIKE, the US sport shoes group, yesterday reported strong international sales growth and an advance in profits for the third quarter, Reuter reports from Seattle. The company said worldwide orders for its athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery between March and July 1992 was about Dollars 1.4bn, up 15 per cent over the same period a year earlier. In the third quarter, the group lifted net earnings to Dollars 82.5m from Dollars 70.7m the previous year which took earnings per share for the period to Dollars 1.08, against 93 cents. Revenues advanced to Dollars 867m from Dollars 802.2m. Nike said it expected to achieve higher earnings in its fourth fiscal quarter ending May 31. In the same period of 1991, the group earned 76 cents a share, down from 89 cents. Mr Philip Knight, chairman, said the company's strong international growth was highlighted in Germany, where it posted a 59 per cent rise in sales. He added that the boost in sales in Germany had moved it to the number two sales spot in that country for the first time, ahead of Puma, and gaining ground on its rival, Adidas. 'In the US, where we have maintained our 31 per cent market share, future orders indicate renewed domestic growth will occur in the next quarter,' he added.</p>

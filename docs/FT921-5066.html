			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Hillsdown seeks to cure jitters in the City / A report on whether investors' gloom over the UK food-to-property group is justified There can be few more striking examples of the change in City attitudes since the late 1980s than the roller-coaster stock market fortunes of Hillsdown Holdings, the food, furniture and property conglomerate. Little known before it went public in early 1985, Hillsdown shot to favour on the strength of its voracious appetite for takeovers. In 1986, it made acquisitions at the rate of one a week, and by 1989 it was Britain's fourth biggest food company. Hillsdown insisted its dealmaking was guided by a clear strategy of turning around troubled companies in mature businesses and consolidating them into sector leaders. Coupled with decentralised operational management and firm financial controls, the formula sent the company's profits and share price soaring. However, City enthusiasm cooled after the 1987 stock market crash. Sobered investors took fright at Hillsdown's high debt levels, while its forays into areas such as house-building fuelled suspicions that it had sacrificed industrial logic for compulsive bargain-hunting. Hillsdown, which publishes its full-year results on Wednesday, has responded by making disposals, cutting borrowings and concentrating on food as its core activity. Yet investor jitters have persisted. Early last year, a bear raid sent the company's shares tumbling 30 per cent in two days. Just as market confidence was recovering, Hillsdown saw the disastrous reception in October of its surprise Pounds 281m rights issue. Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said he wanted the cash partly to make acquisitions. But his failure to name targets alarmed shareholders that he was wearying of 'back-to-basics' and itching to splash out on an opportunistic shopping spree. Today, Hillsdown's share price is 166p, well below the 210p level of the rights issue, and its price-earnings ratio of 7.0 is among the lowest in the UK food industry. The knowledge that maturing stock option and earn-out schemes are set to boost the supply of Hillsdown paper in the next few years has kept investors cautious. But is the gloom overdone? The company's rights issue did give it a strong balance sheet, while its recent acquisition of JP Wood, its main competitor in poultry production, should allow Hillsdown to rationalise a sector bedevilled by excess capacity and cut-throat pricing. Even critics speak well of Hillsdown's skills as a cost-cutter and of the calibre of senior operating executives. They also commend it for some financially astute disposals and for continuing to make profits from its house-building business, which is to be floated off once market conditions improve. Still, doubts linger. Apart from Hillsdown's reputation for wrong-footing the stock market, the question remains whether it has the right recipe for sustained profits growth in foods in the 1990s. With Pounds 3.5bn of its total 1990 sales of Pounds 4.2bn in food, Hillsdown ranks fourth in Europe after Nestle, Unilever, Philip Morris and BSN. It is Britain's biggest producer of meat and poultry, canned fruit and vegetables, jams and chocolate biscuits, and is second in tea after Brooke Bond. Most of Hillsdown's UK products are unbranded because of the high cost of acquiring companies with top brands and of supporting them with hefty advertising budgets. Instead, it has sought to combine dominance over supply in its sectors with efficient, low-cost production. Hillsdown is Britain's biggest producer of own-label supermarket products, and Sir Harry says this has led to close relations with leading retailers: 'It's very much a partnership. They spend a lot of time with us in our plants, and we spend a lot of time with them.' Sceptics argue that such relationships are far from a marriage of equals, and that the multiples have no qualms about turning their backs on Hillsdown when it suits their short-term interests - for example, their willingness last year to import large volumes of chickens from France at prices UK producers could not match. Such incidents also serve as a reminder that a large proportion of Hillsdown's sales and profits is tied to cyclical businesses exposed to price competition. Sir Harry replies that the company is withdrawing from commodity activities and is steadily moving upmarket by emphasising higher added-value products and improved customer service. He also points out that food manufacturing accounts for more than half the company's food sales and has driven much recent profits growth. Manufacturing operations include Premier Brands, maker of Typhoo tea, Cadbury biscuits, Chivers and Hartley preserves and Maple Leaf Foods in Canada. Much may depend on how rapidly Hillsdown can shift its business further into areas where it can establish a defensible competitive advantage. 'It is now up to us to demonstrate that we are going to pursue our strategy successfully,' Sir Harry says. The City may take some convincing. Today's fashion favours food manufacturers who combine clarity of strategic purpose, predictability and a proven record of steady growth. Companies such as Cadbury Schweppes and Tate &amp; Lyle are perceived as models of those qualities while Hillsdown is still widely viewed, as one analyst says, as 'awfully good at buying and selling, but not a food company born and bred'. Though the company says that image does not do justice to its strengths, it concedes that it has to live with it for the moment. As Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, says: 'The fact is that, unlike Cadbury, we haven't been around for a 100 years. We are a creature of the 1980s.'</p>

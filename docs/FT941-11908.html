			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / BR memos reveal concern over contractor training British Rail managers have serious concerns about gaps in the training of staff of private railway contractors, it emerged in BR documents leaked yesterday. The letters, obtained by Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, reveal what he called 'an alarming level of concern about safety in the run-up to privatisation'. In one memo to British Rail managers, MrChris Dickinson, BR's head of safety audit, warns: 'Many contractors undertaking safety training of would-be on-track staff have no knowledge of the standardsinvolved and have no mechanism to obtain them officially. 'The onus should be on the contractor to prove he understands what standards are required andhow he has trained his staff as part of the contractor appraisal system.' Mr Wilson said: 'The clear message is that people with no previous railway experience are being let loose without adequate checks or training. This is part of the privatisation process. It must be stopped.' British Rail confirmed that the documents were genuine but said they merely showed that the organisation was concerned that contractors' staff must be properly trained. In a second document obtained by Mr Wilson, Mr Robert Bartlett, training manager for InterCity, wrote: 'My concern is the safety of all staff, be it contractor or BR, who are working on or near the line on the railway. If these persons receive inaccurate or inadequate training then this could lead to unnecessary and unacceptable accidents.' Mr Wilson said the disclosure of these concerns by BRmanagers came shortly after an incident near Derby, when a privately owned maintenance train travelled 30 miles in the wrong direction. He added: 'A fragmented railway is a less safe railway. If private companies employ staff who are inexperienced and under-trained, then there are going to be incidents and accidents.' Railtrack, the company formed to own and manage BR's track, signalling and stations, will today announce details of a campaign to sign up contractors and suppliers to the privatised network.</p>

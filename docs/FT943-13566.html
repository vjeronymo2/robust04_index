			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Personal View: Exports must drive UK recovery Today's new evidence that consumer spending is continuing to grow, in the June Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey, will be welcomed as a further sign that the recovery remains on course. But in front of every silver lining sits a cloud. How long can a consumer-led recovery proceed, before the authorities take fright at the inflationary risk and seek to dampen it down with an interest rate rise? The latest official sales figures show volumes up by 4 per cent on a year ago. And the survey published today shows that sales grew more strongly in the year to June, after a slight slowdown in the annual rate of increase in the early part of this year. Retailers report that sales growth is back on the improving trend seen in the second half of last year. And they are optimistic about the future, expecting the pace of recovery to be maintained. Of course there are some sectoral differences. The strongest improvements in trade are reported by off-licences, shoe shops and furniture stores. Booksellers and stationers are doing well, too, though hardware and do-it-yourself retailers report falling volumes compared with a year ago. On these hot summer weekends we are sitting at home in a new chair with a can of beer and a good book, leaving the decorating to itself: the prime minister's image of a nation at ease with itself, perhaps. The housing market remains in an uncertain condition, perhaps partly because there remain well in excess of 1m households with negative equity. The withdrawal of attractive fixed-rate mortgage offers has also set things back. But even there we see some signs of a slightly improving trend, and of associated increases in sales of household durables and carpets. The overall tone then, remains strong, stronger than many had predicted in advance of the large personal tax increases which began to take effect in April. Why have those increases had so little effect so far? Partly, we think, because not all of the effect has yet been felt. The increases in National Insurance contributions, and the reduction in the value of mortgage interest relief, have clearly hit pay packets already. But the impact of 8 per cent VAT on fuel bills will not be fully appreciated until later in the year when fuel bills begin to rise in the cold weather and the full 17.5 per cent rate follows next April. Reductions in unemployment may also be helping to offset the tax rises. Unemployment has now declined by more than 270,000 over the past year, giving a larger than expected boost to personal disposal income. Downward movements in the savings ratio, as interest rates fell, have also continued to boost consumption. And although consumer credit expansion has slowed a little in recent months the trend is a growth rate still higher than it was last year. It is clear from all this evidence that consumer spending has been the main engine of recovery for the last two years. Given the poor international, especially European, background that was perhaps inevitable. But if the recovery is to be sustained, we need to be looking over the next 12 months for a greater contribution from investment, and from net trade. So far, private sector investment has barely begun to pick up. Even now, the CBI's Industrial Trends Survey shows only slightly more manufacturers expect to increase investment in plant and machinery next year than to cut it. This is a somewhat disappointing picture after nine quarters of expansion. Public sector investment has not taken up the slack. And, on the trade front, while the figures for transactions with the rest of the European Union are more than usually suspect, there are still no strong indications of a significant improvement in our trade balance. Anecdotally, there are signs that improved business confidence may soon bring a boost in investment. That is what companies tell me as I travel the country. And the improving tone of the UK's leading markets in Europe is producing a more favourable trading environment than for some time. But we need to see some more tangible results soon, or the authorities will surely take further action to dampen consumer spending and boost saving. Our hope - and expectation - is that the balance of recovery will shift towards investment and exports later this year, and that the Bank of England will not need to tighten policy sharply to stop consumer spending growth accelerating. But the next three months will be a crucial period, in which the shape of the recovery will be determined. The author is director-general of the Confederation of British Industry</p>

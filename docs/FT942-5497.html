			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / MoD defends the Chinook The Ministry of Defence yesterday replied to criticism that the crashed Chinook helicopter had no 'black box' flight recorder or all-weather radar to assist navigation in poor conditions. The MoD said all-weather radar, useful for large commercial jets flying at height to avoid large storms, would be 'more or less useless' for military low-level helicopter operations. Any weather signals would be confused by reflected ground noise. It said Chinooks had pressure altimeters and downward radar sensors to estimate their height above ground, which should allow them to fly in poor visibility. The MoD said that few military aircraft carried flight recorders - other accident investigation techniques were considered sufficient to determine the cause of any crash. But Mr William O'Brien, a lawyer who specialises in air accident claims for solicitors Russell, Jones and Walker, said the lack of a flight recorder would slow the investigation. He said: 'It can be important, particularly in crashes such as this where the wreckage is widely spread and the airframe badly broken up.' Mr O'Brien, who acted for the captain of the worst Chinook accident in the UK - when 45 oil-rig workers were killed off Shetland in 1986 - said a longer investigation would also slow the victims' families claims for compensation. Apart from yesterday's crash there have been three bad accidents in UK-owned Chinooks. The Shetland accident was caused by a mechanical problem which has been rectified. Poor weather was a factor when three servicemen were killed in a Chinook crash in the Falkland Islands in 1986. In that accident, 'white-out' conditions made it impossible for the pilots to get their bearings. Another Chinook was lost in the Falklands a year later, with seven killed, thanks to a different mechanical failure from the one that caused the Shetland crash. The MoD is happy with the helicopter and is considering ordering more for Royal Air Force transport needs. A mixed order, probably for Chinooks and EH-101 helicopters, manufactured by Westland, is expected to be placed next year.</p>

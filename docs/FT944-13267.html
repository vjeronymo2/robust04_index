			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Criticism prompts watchdog to probe tax laws The Institute for Fiscal Studies has set up an independent watchdog to scrutinise Britain's tax system in response to growing public concern about the efficiency and complexity of recent tax legislation. The Tax Law Review Committee - financed by the Bank of England, clearing banks, leading public companies and City law and accountancy firms - will examine existing and prospective tax laws to see whether the system is working as intended. Lord Howe, the former Conservative foreign secretary and chancellor, will be president of the committee. Mr Graham Aaronson QC, a leading tax barrister, will be its chairman. The institute said that the form and incomprehensibility of recent finance acts had produced a barrage of criticism. It said that the volume of tax legislation had grown dramatically. The 1993 and 1994 finance acts contained more legislation than that produced in the whole of Baroness (then Mrs) Thatcher's first government. Yet parliament had limited time, resources and ability to consider it. Although the government consulted extensively about tax changes, there was still a perception that the tax system did not get any better. The institute said: 'The system is regarded as being in a mess. Mistakes abound. The burden on taxpayers and businesses gets ever greater.' Mr Aaronson said yesterday that the committee had received encouragement and support from the Bank, Treasury ministers and revenue departments and he was confident they would take note of its recommendations. The committee has members from the main political parties. and the judiciary. The remaining members are drawn from commerce and industry, government service, the professions or are academics. It holds its inaugural meeting today and will be funded for an initial three years.</p>

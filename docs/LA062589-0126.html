			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW DOWNTOWN APARTMENTS AIMED AT AFFLUENT;  </P> <P> BUT SOME BELIEVE SUBSIDY SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING.  </P> <P> When Phil Allenbaugh moves into his luxury apartment next Sunday on the  southern edge of downtown Los Angeles, he'll be just the type of upscale  resident that developers and many city leaders have been hoping to attract to  the area for years.  </P> <P> A 24-year-old salesman of business forms, Allenbaugh will wake up in the  morning and take a short walk to call on his clients in the nearby office  towers.  </P> <P> At night, he'll be able to pop into one of the growing number of trendy  nightspots in the area before walking back home to The Metropolitan -- a  14-story high-rise that, come Tuesday, will be the first upscale rental complex  to open in downtown's fledgling South Park area.  </P> <P> "I'm going to have an extra 3 1/2 hours a day for myself because I won't have  to commute from Santa Ana any more," Allenbaugh said. "I'm going to park my car  in the garage on Sunday night, and not even see it again until the following  weekend.  </P> <P> "I'm going to love living in downtown Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Clearly, this week's opening of The Metropolitan will mark a milestone in the  efforts of Mayor Tom Bradley, the City Council and the Community Redevelopment  Agency to turn South Park into a bustling neighborhood of both homes and  commerce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CRA Subsidized Developer  </P> <P> But it will also be a milestone of another sort: A tribute to the frustration  of some activists for low- and moderate-income families, who say city leaders  are spending too much time and too much money trying to woo young professionals  to one of the last bastions of affordable housing in the downtown area.  </P> <P> As with several other new or proposed residential and commercial projects in  South Park, the CRA has provided millions of dollars in subsidies to the  developer of The Metropolitan. About $10 million of the money that Forest City  Properties Corp. needed to build the $45-million Metropolitan came from the  CRA.  </P> <P> "It's just unbelievable that the city is subsidizing developers with millions  of dollars to lure yuppies downtown," complained Michael Bodaken, a senior  attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. "This city is the  homeless capital of the nation. The money ought to be earmarked for homeless  shelters and low-income housing."  </P> <P> Added David Lara, a community activist at Jobs with Peace: "The big question is  whether the CRA should be helping to build good apartments for the  (lower-income) people who already live in the area, or whether they should be  building upscale housing to attract new residents from other parts of town. The  Metropolitan won't do anything for the people who already live in South Park,  because they can't afford the rents."  </P> <P> South Park is roughly bounded by 8th Street on the north, Broadway on the east,  Santa Monica Freeway on the south and Harbor Freeway on the west. The  revitalization project has been a source of controversy between city leaders  and activists such as Bodaken and Lara almost since planning for the area began  in 1970.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spur Private Development  </P> <P> Bradley, city planners and developers hope redevelopment of South Park will  eventually generate thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenue, and an  abundance of sorely needed park space and downtown housing. To do that, they  have committed more than $500 million in taxpayer money to redevelop the area  and spur more private-sector involvement.  </P> <P> But many activists worry that South Park will become merely a Manhattan-like  playground where young urban professionals and $1,500-a-month rents will force  out all but the handful of poor people lucky enough to land one of the few  subsidized condominiums or apartments slated for the area.  </P> <P> So far, the only other new housing that has been created in South Park is The  Skyline, an upscale condominium complex that opened about five years ago. It,  too, was built by Forest City with financial help from the CRA.  </P> <P> "Projects like the Metropolitan are going to gentrify South Park, and the CRA  is encouraging it," said Bodaken at Legal Aid. "We should be spending the money  to build affordable housing, not subsidizing apartments for yuppies."  </P> <P> But city officials and developers say skyrocketing land prices in South Park  virtually mandate public subsidies to build housing downtown, and that  attracting upscale renters will lure more businesses and builders to the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creation of Jobs  </P> <P> "I think the money we got (from the CRA) was money well spent," said Steven P.  Albert, president of Forest City Properties. "The city and the CRA want to  create the type of urban environment downtown that you find in New York, London  and Paris. You do that by building good housing for the people who work there  and by creating more jobs in the area.  </P> <P> "Sure, the city could have spent the money on building all low-income housing  in South Park. But if they did that, you wouldn't attract more commerce to the  area and you wouldn't attract upscale housing. If you want to create a real  community downtown, you have to start with this kind of housing first."  </P> <P> Albert also noted that at least 15% of the 270 apartment units in The  Metropolitan will be reserved for low- and moderate-income tenants who will pay  far less than the $690 to $1,435 a month charged for the market-rate units.  </P> <P> "These people are going to live in a much better home than they would if the  city spent all the money to build a (low-income) housing project in the area,"  Albert said.  </P> <P> Indeed, Albert's new apartment complex -- already nicknamed "The Met" -- is  drawing rave reviews from several local architects and city leaders, who say it  lends some beauty to an area best known for its neglected industrial buildings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Views of Skyline  </P> <P> Designed by Los Angeles-based Dworsky Associates, the building's white  stucco-and-glass exterior is accented by the green railings that surround each  apartment's balcony. Mature palms and other huge trees surround the tower, at  950 S. Flower St., in an effort to create a park-like atmosphere.  </P> <P> Inside, a two-story atrium sitting area offers views of the city's fast-growing  skyline. Restaurants and retailers occupy the ground floor of the 14-story  structure, as well as the street level of an adjacent three-story building that  is also part of the Metropolitan project.  </P> <P> About 30% of the Metropolitan's 270 apartment units have already been leased,  and there are more than 200 people on the waiting list to view the remaining  units, Albert said.  </P></p>

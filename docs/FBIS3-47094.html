Gen. Maung Thint, minister  of development of border areas and national races; Brigadier  General Myo Thant, minister of information; Colonel Pe Thein,  minister of education; U Khin Maung Thein, minister of energy;  construction minister, director generals and managing directors  from the respective departments and enterprises, and responsible  personnel left Yangon [Rangoon] on a defense services plane this  morning. They arrived at Loikaw Airport in Kayah State at 0900  in the morning. [passage omitted]    In his address Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that a delegation  led  by him visited Loikaw last September [month as heard], and  during the meeting with town residents, native village leaders,  and departmental personnel, the SLORC invited the jungle-based  armed organizations to return to the legal fold so as to meet,  coordinate, and to hold discussions for the reunification of  national brethren. [passage omitted]    He added that Myanmar [Burma] is a union which comprises  various indigenous nationals who reside together. Moreover, in  Myanmar the indigenous nationals have been residing unitedly in  the union through weal and woe for more than 1,000 years, and it  is a country with its own culture. The colonialist-imperialists  coveted the country's prosperity, and the abundant natural  resources, staging three wars of aggression and enslaving  Myanmar. [Passage omitted]. Although it has been over 40 years  since independence, regions with the rule of law and tranquility  have been developed to a certain extent, while regions infested  with insurgency are still lagging behind.    He added that The SLORC's objectives are: the brethren who  are indigenous nationals in the union must develop evenly, and  all indigenous nationals must have a right to enjoy the taste of  independence, which is achieved by all indigenous nationals  joining hands and working unitedly. It is realized that  national reconciliation is crucial in the implementation of  these objectives. That is why, jungle-based armed organizations  are invited to return to the legal fold. The state government  has been extending this invitation with genuine goodwill and is  intent on working for the consistent development of all states,  including the border areas; allowing all the indigenous  nationals to enjoy the taste of independence; and seeking the  rapid development of the whole union.    He said that due to the invitation, the SLORC will meet and  coordinate with some jungle-based armed organizations in the  near future. The light of hope for peace is emerging. Every  one has to continue to work for the full-fledged emergence of  this light of hope for peace. In the upcoming meeting, the  SLORC will participate with complete sincerity, and honesty. He  added that, while people are needed to support this meeting  actively and unitedly, the jungle-based armed organizations are  also required to hold discussions with genuine goodwill and an  honest attitude. These objectives will be accomplished for sure  if both parties base their discussions on honesty, and loyalty.  He also said that the cabinet ministers are accompanying him to  accelerate development activities in Kayah State if it becomes  peaceful and tranquil.    He said the light of peace is beginning to emerge in Kayah  State and the SLORC is ready to implement rapid regional  development in Kayah State once the region becomes stable and  tranquil. The SLORC is simply explaining and presenting the  state government's genuine attitude and intention to all the  indigenous nationals. That is why all people, regardless of  their race and religion, and all indigenous nationals who are  residing in the Kayah State are needed to work together for the  success of SLORC's objectives and aims.

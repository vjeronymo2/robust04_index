			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR PEACE GLIMMER  </P> <P> The rebels who are at war with the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador have  drawn up a serious peace proposal that could end the fighting. But it can  succeed only if President Alfredo Cristiani, El Salvador's military leaders and  the United States are just as serious.  </P> <P> The peace plan was made public last week by officials of the Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front (FMLN) who met in Mexico City with delegates sent by  Cristiani, the right-wing politician elected to head El Salvador's government  in June. The mere fact that representatives of the two most extreme political  factions in El Salvador would even sit down and talk was a hopeful sign. So it  is more encouraging that three days of meetings in the Mexican capital resulted  in an agreement to begin peace negotiations next month in Costa Rica. The joint  communique issued by the two sides said the peace talks would aim to end the  10-year-old civil war "by political means in the shortest possible time."  </P> <P> That optimistic tone was possible only because the FMLN delegation, which  included two of the rebel coalition's top guerrilla commanders, made a specific  offer to stop the fighting by early next year if the government agrees to a  series of specific reforms in El Salvador. The rebels said they would agree to  a cease fire on Nov. 15, and to demobilization of their fighting units by Jan.  31, 1990, if the government agrees to a sweeping overhaul of the country's  justice system and military. Rebel spokesmen also offered to transform their  movement into a political party and try to achieve power peacefully, if the  government agreed to advance the date of elections now scheduled for 1991.  </P> <P> But despite the FMLN's peace offer, it would be naive to expect a quick or easy  end to 10 years of bloodshed in El Salvador. Once the peace talks begin, it is  likely they will be long and difficult. Even as the government delegates were  leaving Mexico City on an upbeat note, spokesmen for two groups back in El  Salvador that could easily sabotage the talks were criticizing the FMLN peace  plan.  </P> <P> An official of Cristiani's Arena party dismissed the request for early  elections as "beyond consideration." So the first test of the new president's  political clout, a power that many analysts feel is quite limited, will turn on  whether he can persuade his political allies to give peace a chance.  </P> <P> Even more worrisome, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the nation's 60,000-man  army would not be reduced as long as Marxism remains a threat to "the nation  and the Central American region." In some extreme cases, El Salvador's military  caste equates Jesuit priests with Marxist subversion. That rather paranoid  notion of national security is grounds for wondering whether the Salvadoran  high command will ever agree to demobilize the manpower and firepower it has  amassed with more than $1 billion worth of U.S. aid. The military was the  single most powerful, and corrupt, institution in El Salvador when the civil  war began in 1979. While it has become somewhat more professional under U.S.  tutelage, it is also more powerful than ever before. No peace plan will work in  El Salvador unless the generals and colonels support it. And they are unlikely  to cooperate unless their North American paymasters insist on it.  </P> <P> The rebels know that. That is why their peace plan -- and the public-relations  offensive that accompanied it -- was aimed as much at the Bush Administration  and Congress as at public opinion in El Salvador. This became even clearer  after the Mexico City talks, when the rebels' leading field commander, Joaquin  Villalobos, granted a rare interview to the New York Times in an effort to  present a reasonable, moderate face to the United States. Described by some as  a rigid Marxist, Villalobos said he favors political and economic pluralism in  El Salvador and peaceful coexistence with the United States. He also admitted  that the rebels have made mistakes in their effort to defeat the government,  including assassinating political rivals and using terrorism and sabotage as  routine tactics.  </P> <P> There are undoubtedly many people in Washington, and certainly in San Salvador,  who don't believe Villalobos. But there is no way to be sure he and other FMLN  leaders are not sincere without putting them to the test. And that will happen  only if the Cristiani government comes to the peace talks with specific  counterproposals to the rebel peace plan.  </P></p>

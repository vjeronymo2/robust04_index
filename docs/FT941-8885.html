			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: TDG quits Australia and plans expansion of core activities Transport Development Group has agreed to sell Transic and its Australian subsidiary companies to Jamison Equity for Pounds 21.5m cash. The proceeds will be used to expand TDG's European activities operating in the core business areas of distribution, storage, transport and hire. The withdrawal from Australia marked a further step in the group's stated objective of being a first choice European logistics group. The Australian companies are principally engaged in providing storage, distribution and transport services on Australia's eastern and southern seaboards. Jamison, an Australian company with interests in manufacturing, retailing, private medical services and stevedoring, intends to manage the companies under their present names. The Australian companies made pre-tax profits of Pounds 900,000 before group finance charges in 1992, and had net assets of Pounds 20.9m. Harris Distribution, a division of TDG, has lost out in its bid for the contract to build and operate a distribution centre for Mars Confectionery. The new facility, which will not be fully operational until late 1995 or early 1996, will replace two Harris warehouses currently dedicated to Mars business, at Elmdon, near Birmingham, and Heywood, near Manchester. The group said contractual arrangements with Mars include compensation for the possible closure of the two warehouses, which have combined annual revenues of about Pounds 5.4m.</p>

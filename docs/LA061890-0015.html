			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION SECRETARY CAVAZOS' CRITICISM OF LATINO PARENTS  </P> <P> The criticism of Latino parents by Cavazos was inaccurate, simplistic, crude  and irresponsible.  </P> <P> Students, teachers and parents are equally accountable for attaining  educational goals.  </P> <P> To single out the parental role as a primary cause of the 40% dropout rate  among Latino students unfairly cast a perception of negligence upon the people  most deserving of respect.  </P> <P> The value of learning is a central theme to us. Assimilation requires a daily  assessment of this value. The Hispanic-American family is not anti-education.  We are striving to assert our presence within an educational system that is  culturally biased toward Anglo-American values; individualism, rationalism,  empiricism.  </P> <P> Adopting English as a second language causes students to make decisions  regarding attachment and loyalty. English speakers are the public role models  in the classroom. Spanish-speaking parents are a private resource outside the  cultural mainstream. Latino students are asked to bridge the language and  cultural gaps between home and school. The high number of dropouts indicates  the schools are losing this battle.  </P> <P> Cavazos is alerting Latinos to a future of limited opportunity due to low  educational advancement. To avert this plight parents are calling for  courageous leadership and not petty backbiting from the nation's top education  official.  </P> <P> EDDY POLANCO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

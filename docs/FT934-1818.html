			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Workers win control of United Airlines for Dollars 5bn pay cuts United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, has reached a deal with its labour unions that would give employees a controlling stake in the company in return for Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) worth of wage cuts and productivity improvements over the next six years. The deal will send a shock-wave through the US airline industry. Other big carriers will be forced to reach similar agreements with their unions or risk going out of business because of their uncompetitive costs. United has been negotiating with its unions for nearly six months in an attempt to bring labour costs down. Like other big US carriers, it has suffered severe competition on domestic routes from smaller, low-cost carriers. The company had threatened to cut losses by contracting out all its servicing and maintenance activities and divesting its short-haul operations to newly-formed non-union subsidiaries if no agreement was reached. That plan will now be abandoned. Instead, 60,000 of United's 82,000 employees will accept wage cuts, reductions in benefits and changes in working practices that will produce savings over the next six years with a net present value of Dollars 5bn. In return, they will receive new ordinary shares worth Dollars 173 each in a recapitalised United, which will be held in employee stock ownership plans, known as Esops. The size of their stake will be between 53 per cent and 63 per cent, depending on the value of United's existing shares at the time the transaction takes place. United will compensate its present shareholders for the dilution of their equity by giving them one new share plus Dollars 88 worth of cash, preferred stock and interest-bearing loan notes for every existing share they hold. The existing shares fell Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 144 yesterday amid uncertainty over the value of the deal. The employee ownership scheme is the third, but by far the biggest, in the US airline industry. Earlier this year Trans World Airlines traded 45 per cent of its equity for Dollars 660m worth of labour concessions and Northwest Airlines agreed to swap up to 37.5 per cent of its shares for Dollars 886m worth of concessions. The deal was between United's management and two unions: the Air Line Pilots Association and the International Union of Machinists. US stocks, Page 37</p>

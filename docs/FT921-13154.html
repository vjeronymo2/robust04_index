			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Loss of 1,105 mine jobs is confirmed BRITISH COAL yesterday confirmed it will cut 1,105 jobs at four pits in its Selby group of mines in West Yorkshire including its flagship Selby complex, a costly development the size of the Isle of Wight. More than 200 jobs are to go at Whitemoor, one of seven pits in the Selby complex itself. Another 150 will be eliminated at Sharlston, near Wakefield while 410 and 350 redundancies, respectively, are earmarked at Kellingley and Prince of Wales, both near Pontefract. Confirmation of the cuts came as British Coal announced a further 30 to 40 job losses at Kiveton Colliery in its South Yorkshire group. The announcement fuelled speculation that the company is attempting to reduce manpower and improve productivity in readiness for privatisation if the Conservatives win the next election. British Coal said the cuts were necessary if the mines were to bring down costs sufficiently to sell to the newly privatised electricity industry at competitive prices after March 1993, when government-backed contracts run out. The company may also be trying to cut the volume of output, according to the newsletter Coal UK, published today. In spite of 12 pit closures this year the company still has more coal than it can sell to the generators, the newsletter says, not the least as a result of improvements in productivity. But Mr Alan Houghton, Selby group director, said the job losses would not result in output reductions. He said they were aimed at ensuring that the pits were 'physically and financially strong'. There is no sign so far that the four Selby pits affected by the job cuts face closure. Kellingley is one of the 14 mines picked by NM Rothschild, the government advisers on coal privatisation in their controversial report leaked last year, as profitable enough for a sell-off. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, said yesterday: 'It makes phenomenal profits.' The other three mines, which were not chosen by Rothschild, are believed by industry observers to be either loss-making or close to breaking even. Three of the pits in the Selby group - Riccall, Wistow, and Stillingfleet - have frequently broken productivity records, but both Whitemoor and North Selby, the most recent mine to open, have suffered geological problems which have sometimes halted or seriously slowed down production. Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the National Union of Mineworkers in Yorkshire, said that he believed any problems the pits had were surmountable and blamed the cuts on the government's decision that British Coal must compete in the international market. British Coal said all redundancies would be voluntary but Mr Dobson said the company was able to achieve thisonly by offering miners a top-up payment of up to Pounds 10,000 if they took redundancy before the end of March.</p>

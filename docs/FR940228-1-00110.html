Only significant revisions are discussed. The definition of ``drop out date'' found in the current &sect;668.22 would be incorporated into this definition. Currently, the FFEL program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who has not returned to an institution after the expiration of an approved leave of absence as the first day of the leave of absence. The Secretary proposes to use, instead, the last recorded date of class attendance by a student, as documented by the institution. The negotiators reached consensus that it is fair to define the withdrawal date for a student who failed to return from an approved leave of absence in the same way as the withdrawal date is defined for a student who drops out, because the student's period of attendance was only extended on the understanding that he or she would be returning by a specified date. Further, the Secretary proposes to clarify that a student who returns to an institution after the expiration of a leave of absence during an award year or, for the FFEL programs, during a period of enrollment in which the student was granted the leave of absence, the student may not receive additional Title IV, HEA program assistance for coursework that he or she has not completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the FFEL program regulations define the withdrawal date for a student who is enrolled in an educational program that consists predominantly of correspondence courses as 60 days after the due date of a required lesson that the student failed to submit in accordance with the established schedule for lessons. The Secretary believes it is more reasonable to define the withdrawal date in this case as the date of the last submission of a lesson by the student if the student failed to submit the subsequent lesson in accordance with the established schedule for lessons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add the requirement that a leave of absence may not exceed the length of time between the beginning of the leave of absence and the institution's next period of enrollment, if the institution's next period of enrollment after the start of the leave of absence begins more than thirty days after the beginning of the leave of absence due to a period of nonenrollment (i.e., summer break) that prevents a student from enrolling in any coursework. The Secretary proposes to add this provision to address graduate programs that do not have summer school sessions, thereby preventing students from re-enrolling during this time. As the determination of a student's withdrawal date is necessary to determine when a refund must be paid to a student, the Secretary believes it would be unfair to penalize an institution for failure to pay timely refunds to a student who is deemed to have ``withdrawn'' only because he or she cannot return to the institution from a leave of absence because classes are not in session. This provision would not additionally limit the length of a student's leave of absence which could be up to sixty days or six months under the specified conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that this proposed definition of a leave of absence is a departure from current Federal Pell Grant Program policy. Currently, for purposes of the Federal Pell Grant Program, a student who is granted a leave of absence is considered to be no longer enrolled in the institution. The Secretary specifically request comments on the effects of this proposed change on institutional procedures in relation to the Federal Pell Grant Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require an institution to pay a refund to a student within a specified period of time. The Secretary believes that 30 days is a sufficient period of time for an institution to complete the administrative procedures necessary for payment of a refund to a student. This requirement would be in addition to other requirements, which would not change, for timely payment of refunds to a lender under the FFEL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

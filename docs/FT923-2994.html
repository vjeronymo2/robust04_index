			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Alton may quit in abortion vote row MR DAVID Alton, the party's MP for Mossley Hill said yesterday he would be unable to stand again as a Liberal Democrat in any future election because of yesterday's conference decision to develop a policy on abortion. Mr Alton, who has been an MP since 1979, said: 'While this party policy remains intact, I will not be able to fight for or recommend people to vote for the Liberal Democrats.' 'It is sad that he feels he cannot stand again,' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said, 'but he has played no part in either the building of the party or campaigning for it for four years now. His departure, though sad, will not in any way alter the effectiveness of our party or our capacity to put our message across.' The conference overwhelmingly passed a motion - proposed by the Women's Liberal Democrats - acknowledging that the area was one for the conscience of the individual but regretting that the issue had been excluded from discussion in the party's white paper on health. The motion called for the National Health Service to give all women access to an abortion within 14 days of one being sought. NHS staff would still be able to refuse on ethical grounds to participate directly, but would have to refer patients to colleagues who were willing to participate. Abortion has conventionally been an issue of conscience in political parties, but both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have come under some pressure to establish a party line in favour of more liberal abortion laws.</p>

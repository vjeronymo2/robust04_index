			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (13): Fresh Rbs3,000bn attack on crime - Law and Order Two bomb attacks on businessmen in Moscow on the same day this month provided a brutal impulse for Russian President Boris Yeltsin to declare all-out war on organised crime. In broad daylight, right outside Paveletsky railway station, the driver of the chief of Logovaz, a big car-dealing company, had his head blown off although his boss, Mr Boris Berezovsky, escaped unscathed. The other intended victim, the manager of a smaller company, was less fortunate: a car-bomb earlier in the day cost him his leg. A few days later, on June 10, President Yeltsin announced he had ordered the security services to 'cleanse Russia of criminal filth'. The interior minister, prosecutor-general, and head of the domestic intelligence service promptly unveiled a new Rbs3,000bn programme to fight crime. Mr Yeltsin said they would be held personally responsible for its success in beating back criminal forces who were trying to 'seize control of the economy and push their way into politics'. He followed this up in mid-June with a presidential decree giving security forces unprecedented powers to fight organised crime, including the right to detain suspects without charge for 30 days and the right to search the premises and bank accounts of any company suspected of illegal dealings. The measures were promptly denounced as unconstitutional by parliament and the liberal media, which warned of a possible return to to Russia's more repressive past. Given an overwhelming public longing for law and order, a successful crackdown could prove the greatest vote-spinner for a government unlikely to deliver quick results on economic reform. But criminals' close links to corrupt police and officials provide the strongest reason to doubt the likelihood of a successful campaign against Russia's so-called 'mafia'. The word 'mafia' is widely used in Russia to mean anything from organised crime to extortion by officials seeking bribes. The crime problem is unique because of its intimate connections to an inherently corrupt economy and bureaucracy inherited from the Communist era. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a renowned Russian economist and presidential hopeful, argues that the old state-run Soviet economy was designed for lawlessness. He says its vestiges - such as a reliance on personal patronage, excessive discretionary powers for bureaucrats, and a very high degree of monopoly in the economy - need to be dismantled if there is any chance of making inroads against crime and racketeering. How dangerous is Russia today? In term of statistics for ordinary crime, a big city such as St Petersburg is no more dangerous than the more crime-ridden cities of Europe, and is safer than New York or Washington. Major-General Arkady Kramariev, the St Petersburg police chief, says that the higher levels of crime in Russia's second city - 845 murders last year compared to 150 a decade ago - correspond more closely to a free market economy than previous low levels prevailing under the old police state. The difference between Russia and the west is that police who are underpaid, uninsured and demoralised are unlikely to do much to solve crimes. Much of the violence can be blamed on an antiquated legal system's inability to meet the requirements of a market economy. Because the courts take so long to solve commercial disputes, Maj-Gen Kramariev says that 'Judge Kalashnikov' remains the most reliable way to recover debts. This is true of any sphere of activity in Russia. But banking, as one of the most profitable businesses in an ailing economy, provides a useful starting-point for exploring organised crime's involvement in the economy. More than a dozen bankers have been gunned down in contract killings over the past couple of years but not one of these crimes has been solved. The victims were believed to have rejected extortion attempts or to have become too deeply involved with unsavoury customers. Given that Russia has no guidelines on money laundering, it is not surprising that Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, admits that 'any banks may have customers related to illegal, underworld activities'. Mr Tulin, in charge of banking supervision and restructuring, categorically rejects, together with other Russian officials and bankers, some of the more far-fetched western speculation that the entire banking sector is run by the mafia. But while top bankers usually have the means to protect themselves - Mr Vladimir Gussinsky, chairman of Most-Bank, says his construction and banking group has a security force of 650 men - many smaller businesses have no choice but to pay up and shut up. The same differences apply to foreign companies. Big multinationals which are beginning to invest in Russia and do not operate small cash-based businesses are unlikely to do deals with the mafia. But smaller outfits, such as new foreign restaurants in Moscow, or retail outfits, are asked to pay protection money, and often do. Fears are often expressed that organised crime and extortion are stifling economic reforms and growth. While these problems do discourage many newcomers, the hardier entrepreneurs have simply adjusted to a business climate in which most participants find they have to break the law in one way or another in order to prosper. In this context, many businessmen complain that the mafia is less of a problem than the corrupt bureaucracy or over-burdensome taxation. Mr Sergei Klementiev, a private farmer with a small farm and entrepreneur in the province of Nizhny-Novgorod, is doing exactly what bold agricultural reforms in the province are designed to achieve. He is challenging the state trading and food-processing monopolies by taking milk directly to town to sell it more cheaply to consumers. But he says he also has to pay protection money to 'small-time crooks' who otherwise threaten to damage his retail stall. However, he says paying protection money to the same people on a regular basis is the least of his problems, in so far as 'nobody else comes and asks for money'. Without even bothering to go to the police, he is far more concerned that the government should lessen taxation on his businesses. Perhaps the main victim of organised crime is public opinion, which widely perceives market reforms as giving greater freedom to the 'mafia' while impoverishing the quality of their lives. It is for this reason, if only to fend off the coming-to-power of more ruthless extremists who promise summary executions and plan dictatorship, that Russia must hope President Yeltsin can toe a fine line between restoring order and returning to the arbitrary rule of the communist past.</p>

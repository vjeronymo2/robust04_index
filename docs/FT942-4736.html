			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Boost for National Grid flotation National Grid, operator of the high voltage power transmission system in England and Wales, yesterday fuelled expectations of a flotation next year when it increased dividends by 15.3 per cent against expectations of 10 per cent. The company, which is owned by the regional electricity companies, announced pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 in line with forecast at Pounds 579.5m, against Pounds 533.2m. However a lower than expected tax charge enabled the company to pay a final dividend of Pounds 2,062 making a total for the year of Pounds 2,982. It said the dividend rise was in line with the improvement in after tax earnings. The profits growth was aided by a 9.5 per cent drop in staff numbers which stood at 4,682 at the year end, excluding those employed by the Energis telecommunications subsidiary. That compares with 6,537 in March 1991. Energis accounted for Pounds 90m of the company's capital expenditure of Pounds 351m (Pounds 389m). The main transmission business accounted for Pounds 243m. Some 1,500km of fibre optic cable has already been installed for Energis which is due to start services later this year. Total group turnover increased marginally from Pounds 1.39bn to Pounds 1.43bn, reflecting income from increased new connections and higher sales in the ancillary services business. At the end of the year under-recovery of revenues against the regulated maximum amount was about Pounds 14m. The company is allowed to recover the shortfall through adjustments to charges in future years. Net debt decreased by Pounds 116.4m to Pounds 323m, leading to a fall in the net debt to equity ratio from 31 per cent to 19 per cent. The company's performance will reinforce the City's belief that the regulatory regime on prices, in place until 1997, is relatively benign. Nonetheless it provides a strong platform for the recs to stage a flotation. A disposal of at least 25 per cent of the company is likely next year, possibly in the spring. Analysts believe the company is worth between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn.</p>

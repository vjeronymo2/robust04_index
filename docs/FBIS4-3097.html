			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Market Can Oil Wheels of Rusty Railways"] </F>   [Text] To meet the demand for more and better railway  cars, the country will rely on manufacturers to act as the  locomotive pulling the highly-centralized rail system into  market-oriented reforms, according to a senior government  official.    Only the rigors of a market economy can help the industry  out  of its plight, Fu Zhihuan, Vice-Minister of Railways, said in  Beijing recently.    Most railway manufacturing plants are still managed by the  dictates of a planned economic system, under which the  government sets production quotas, buys products at prices it  sets, and controls investment.    So while the massive rail expansion now under way in China  cries out for fast heavy-haul rolling stock, production plants  are hamstrung by lack of capital and outdated techniques.    To raise both the capacity and quality of rail cars, a  modern  enterprise system must be phased in by the China National  Railway Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Corp (Loric),  which runs 35 plants and four research institutes and employs  270,000 people.    By 1995, Loric intends to update its operation contract  system with the ministry to expand production. Later it will be  authorized to become a share holding company and manage State  property.    This in effect will make the 35 manufacturing and repair  plants independent and responsible for State assets.    Simultaneously, profound reforms will take place in the  railway planning, pricing, investment, financing and wage  systems.    The ministry will continue cutting production quotas for  vehicles so that in the near future all manufacturing orders  will be through contracts.    The industry now is far from being independent. Indeed,  mandatory orders still account for 85 percent of its production  value.    The State will also relax its tight hold over prices of  rolling stock so that in three to four years market forces will  be the primary determinants of pricing. Prices for vehicle  parts are expected to be freed this year, for passenger and  freight cars, in 1995; and, for locomotives, 1997.    There remains a big gap between prices paid by the State and  prices set by the market. For example, the market price for a  Dongfeng-4 diesel locomotive is 4.8 million yuan ($552.000) but  the ministry will pay only 3.1 million yuan ($356,000).    The system for deciding investments will also depart from  arbitrary allocation by the State and rely more on market  financing and self financing by enterprises.    Fu cautioned that the industry must prepare for domestic and  foreign challenges as it advances into the highly-competitive  market place.    Loric's decades-old monopoly over freight car production has  become feeble, allowing a legion of competitors to squeeze into  the manufacturing and repair businesses.    The ministry plans to spend $10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion)  this year for new rail vehicles.    In 1994 Loric will arrange the production of about 800  locomotives, 2,000 passenger cars and 32,500 freight cars.    About 80 per cent of the new locomotives will be for  large-haul service on trunk lines, primarily the Dongfeng-4  diesel and Shaoshan-4 electric models.    For passenger cars the focus will be on the Model 25, which  accommodates more travellers at higher speed and with more  comfort than the obsolete Model 22, still the backbone of  passenger service. Production of the Model 22 will be phased out  by next year.    Despite the shortage of capital and raw material, Loric last  year built 670 diesel locomotives, 19 per cent more than in  1992; 220 electric locomotives, 10 per cent more; 1,850  passenger cars, 12 per cent more; and 29,000 freight cars, 34  per cent more.</p>

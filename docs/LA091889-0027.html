			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: THIS CAT'S JUST A KITTY  </P> <P> More Josie and the Pussycats than Cat Scratch Fever, the L.A.-based Faster  Pussycat -- which played at the Palace on Thursday -- is the sort of band your  9-year-old daughter might like: a mop-headed, neo-hard-rock quintet of dudes  who move as if they'd learned to perform by watching Saturday-morning cartoons.  (If Guns N' Roses had ever made an animated show like KISS, it would have been  like this, even if Faster Pussycat is cuter.)  </P> <P> The band sounds a little like a trashed-out Sweet, or a heavy-metal version of  the 1910 Fruit Gum Company. Give 'em points for goofiness, though at one point  during the sold-out show, unambiguously named lead singer Taime Down said,  "This has to be one of our best shows ever; we're great up here," which makes  ironic intent somewhat harder to infer.  </P> <P> The stage set looked like an art director's vision of an arty teen-ager's messy  room. The chops aren't exactly awe-inspiring -- the dudes spent most of their  long set staring down at their guitar necks, trying to figure out whether they  were playing the right chord or not -- not an unattainable goal for pre-teens  to aspire to. The anti-craftsmanship is kind of punk-rock, which is kind of  cool. And the winking double-entendres are of the sort a little girl won't pick  up until junior high, so all the references to cat houses may only be making  them nostalgic for Hello Kitty.

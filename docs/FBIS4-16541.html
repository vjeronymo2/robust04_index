			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Aleksandr </F> Kondrashov]    [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr -- This day should become a  reference point for moving in the opposite direction from war,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said before flying out  of Belgrade for Moscow.    During the course of talks with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic, he said in an interview with Russian journalists, I  discussed the initiative plan on a settlement put forward by  President Yeltsin and passed on our urgent recommendations to  follow precisely this path. I should say that the Serbian  president was ready for this conversation and our ideas on ways  of settling the Bosnian question virtually tallied. This comes  down to two to three specific steps: The lifting of the siege  of Gorazde, which would mean quite a modest Serbian troop  withdrawal; an end to the bombardment; and the dispatch of a  contingent of UN forces to that town, which would guarantee  objectivity and a complete cessation of fire by all sides. This  would make any aerial actions on the part of NATO or the United  Nations completely unnecessary.    Furthermore, the minister continued, the way would  immediately be cleared for a cessation of hostile actions along  the whole front line. Then favorable conditions would be  created for holding full-scale negotiations on a comprehensive  settlement. Everything now depends on whether the Serb side  carries out the accords that were achieved at the meeting with  President Milosevic.    In short, there is a very great chance for peace.  Accordingly, these steps by the Serb side -- each one of them  -- would make it possible for Russia with even greater  persistence and realism to raise the issue of the lifting of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia.    Moreover, this plan was approved in Belgrade. Belgrade would  therefore have clearly shown that an impetus toward peace is  coming precisely from there. Consequently, the grounds for the  sanctions are disappearing and conditions are being created for  Yugoslavia's return into the family of European and world  peoples, Kozyrev emphasized in conclusion.</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Burmah weathers German trough - Other companies Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, is expected to report 1993 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 186m today, up from Pounds 179.6m. Trading has been tough in Germany, which accounts for about 20 per cent of group business, but recession in Europe should have been counterbalanced by more favourable conditions elsewhere. Following an enhanced scrip dividend at the interim stage, analysts think the final dividend could rise by more than 10 per cent.</p>

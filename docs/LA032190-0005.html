			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH PLAN  </P> <P> Don't you just love it when the American Medical Assn. jumps into the parade  with its own desperately fabricated float after all the genuine floats put  together by the real contributors have gone by ("AMA Urges Care for All  Workers," Part A, March 8).  </P> <P> Here they are with a "sweeping package" for health care which they "decline" to  put a price on.  </P> <P> Tucked in at the end of this altruistic stuff is the stinging tail of the AMA  scorpion. The AMA also "would revise medical malpractice laws to reduce  liability insurance cost for physicians."  </P> <P> AMA, you have been so remiss in governing yourself -- you are, after all a  "doctors' club" not a consumer protective agency -- that you have come in with  too little too late.  </P> <P> JAN KNOWLTON  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

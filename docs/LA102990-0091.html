			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE OF THE DEAD MAN'S PARTY ON MEADOWS LAWN;  </P> <P> FANS: FOR MANY, A NIGHT OF SLAM-DANCING AND PUMPKIN HURLING IS AS ENTERTAINING  AS THE CONCERT.  </P> <P> It was indeed a Dead Man's Party on the lawn at Irvine Meadows Amphitheater on  Saturday night.  </P> <P> Without the restriction of seats, the hordes of almost-fanatical Oingo Boingo  fans acted out their darker impulses, slam-dancing to "Only a Lad," spraying  each other with florescent paint throughout the night and screaming wildly each  time the spotlights panned across the lawn.  </P> <P> "This is the place to be. It's crazy," said Nick Strickland, 20, a.k.a. the Bum  From Hell, of Canyon Lake.  </P> <P> Like many others who packed the lawn Saturday for the second night of Oingo  Boingo's three-day pre-Halloween stand, Strickland and his buddies from Cal  State Fullerton have made the trek to Irvine a not-to-be-missed  Halloween-season ritual. This was Strickland's fourth annual pilgrimage.  </P> <P> Although the concert date was four days shy of Oct. 31, many dedicated Boingo  fans remained true to the 5-year-old tradition and dressed up in costumes that  ranged from the wacky to the weird.  </P> <P> "I had my costume ready (for Halloween) and thought it would be fun," said  Brenda Stewart, 21, of Lake Elsinore, who dressed up as a red-caped devil.  </P> <P> Interspersed with witches, ghouls and skeletons were chickens, caped crime  fighters, cave men and yes, even Homer and Marge Simpson.  </P> <P> One unlucky tennis player with bloodied tennis balls embedded in his face and  chest and a broken racket hanging from his neck wished everyone a happy  Halloween as they filed in.  </P> <P> The slanted lawn at Irvine Meadows is much like the bleachers at Boston's  Fenway Park, where the seating area itself is as much a happening as the event.  </P> <P> Before the music started, one couple wearing florescent skeleton masks passed  out lollipops to fellow concert-goers who were smacking beach balls around and  tossing glowing Frisbees that sported bats and otherworldly images.  </P> <P> "We love Oingo Boingo," said Cliff (who declined to give his last name) of  Canoga Park as he weaved his way through the growing crowd and pulled candies  from his trick-or-treat bag. His wife, Jaylene, chimed in, "We are trying to  make this a family tradition."  </P> <P> The party started long before the concert did.  </P> <P> Drawn by a weeklong promotion by KROQ-FM morning disc jockeys Kevin Ryder and  Gene (Bean) Baxter, hundreds of concert-goers arrived early at the parking lot  to watch a 480-pound pumpkin be hurled from a 100-foot platform.  </P> <P> "It was awesome," said Thomas Harper, 27, of Orange. "It just went splat."  </P> <P> Harper explained the band's draw.  </P> <P> "They are a Southern California band and they've been around for so long. And  (lead singer) Danny Elfman is a genius."  </P> <P> Scott Yenzer, a Cal Poly engineering student, agreed. Dressed as a crash dummy,  Yenzer, 23, arrived at Irvine Meadows in a large tour bus with 25 friends from  Riverside County.  </P> <P> "I love it," said Yenzer, a three-time Halloween Bash veteran. "You get to come  out, drink beer, dress up and go crazy."  </P></p>

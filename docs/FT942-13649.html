			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: 10 per cent bonus missed by C&amp;G savers Bethan Hutton writes: C&amp;G savers whose money was part of the huge outflow from building societies last month - to pre-pay fuel bills, or invest in Peps or Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bonds - may now be kicking themselves as they will miss the 10 per cent bonus on the amount withdrawn. If they closed their accounts, they will lose another Pounds 500. But the situation is unclear. The bonuses will not be paid for more than a year, and they may be taxable for some people. Depending on the precise circumstances, in many cases pre-paying fuel bills will still have been more cost-effective. The long-term tax benefits of Peps are difficult to quantify, but could outweigh the lost bonus in the long run. Sadly, investors in PGIBs have certainly come off badly.</p>

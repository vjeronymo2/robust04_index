			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Cloudy view from San Francisco Travelling in the US brings home the vastness of the country. While on the west coast last week, I went to see Mr Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Mr Parry is one of a dozen regional Fed presidents, yet runs an empire that is larger than that of most European central bank governors. It includes California (which has a larger gross domestic product than all but seven nations), the western states of Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, and Hawaii and assorted islands in the Pacific. In Europe a comparable empire might include Britain, Ireland, northern France, Belgium and the Canary Islands - as a quid pro quo for Hawaii. How, from this western perch, does Mr Parry see the US economy evolving? His own district has yet to show definite signs of recovery mainly because of the drag from California, which is floundering in its worst recession since the 1930s. Hit especially hard by defence cuts and sagging commercial real estate markets, the state has lost more than 600,000 jobs (about 4 per cent of the total). Mr Parry believes California hit bottom at the end of last year, is now moving sideways and will probably recover later in the year. Others are more pessimistic, expecting recovery to be postponed to next year or even 1994. Nationally, economic statistics are again raising doubts about the recovery's momentum. I talked with Mr Parry after the release of the May employment report, which showed unemployment rising sharply to 7.5 per cent (8.7 per cent in California) but before Thursday's unexpectedly poor retail sales figures. Optimistic by nature, Mr Parry happily refers to the national recession in the past tense. 'It lasted two quarters and was over more than a year ago,' he declares. He believes the economy is poised to break out of its lengthy slowdown and forecasts growth of close to 3 per cent in the coming year. Weak figures for sales, jobs, housing and the money supply, however, are prompting renewed speculation on Wall Street that the Fed may nudge interest rates lower again, in spite of its reported shift to a neutral monetary stance. Can Mr Parry shed any light on the debate? Choosing his words with care, he says the effects of recent interest rate cuts are still working their way through the economy. He is 'comfortable' with the current policy stance because he believes it to be consistent with moderate economic growth and further progress in reducing inflation. Reluctant to specify the conditions that would warrant another easing of policy, he suggests that the Fed's decision last autumn to resume interest rate cuts set a clear precedent. The implication is that rates could fall again, but only if a consistent run of weak figures indicates the economy is sagging into a 'triple dip.' The silver lining in the long slowdown is a steady decline in inflation. Friday's consumer prices report confirmed that the underlying rate is now much closer to 3 per cent than the 5 per cent that seemed entrenched during the 1980s. Why then are long bond yields still so high? Mr Parry, an economist by training, blames the Fed's own past failures to restrain inflation in economic upturns. 'Financial markets don't believe the Fed will be successful in orchestrating the long-term decline in inflation I'm predicting. Otherwise the current real rates of interest wouldn't be needed.' Onerous long-term rates are thus partly an unavoidable price for past policy mistakes. Economists at the San Francisco Fed suggest two reasons for macroeconomic caution in coming months. The first is that the growth slowdown of the past three years is partly attributable to demographic changes that have caused the labour force to grow more slowly than in the 1980s. Adjusting for this supply-side change, the recession has been milder than most previous downturns. People should not be surprised, therefore, if the recovery is also weak by past standards. Perhaps more important, the very diversity of the San Francisco district makes the bank's economists aware of the limitations of national monetary policy. In employment terms, California is experiencing a more severe recession than that of any region except New England and the mid-Atlantic states. But California is a huge state: Los Angeles and surrounding counties account for 80 per cent of its job losses; most of northern California is faring no worse than the nation as a whole. All the other eight states in Mr Parry's district have enjoyed net job growth since the beginning of the US recession in July 1990. Star performers such as Utah and Idaho have seen employment surge by 5 per cent or more. Mr Parry may sometimes wish he had the power of a European central bank governor. But if he had his own discount rate, it would still be impossible to meet the needs of both Los Angeles and the mountain states. Indeed, it would be wrong to interfere with a rational economic adjustment under way: a transfer of investment and jobs from overpriced, overpopulated coastal regions to the cheap, empty interior.</p>

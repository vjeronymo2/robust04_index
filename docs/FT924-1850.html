			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Free counselling for defaulting customers BANKS, building societies and credit lenders will today be asked to back a free counselling service for customers who default on loans. Counselling centres would be funded by lenders' contributions of 15 per cent of money recovered. The service has already received financial backing from Barclays Bank and GE Capital. If lenders back the plan, a pilot centre will be set up in Leeds from April, with eight debt counsellors helping individuals draw up plans to repay creditors over a set period. The National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux believes that counselling funded by creditors faces the danger of not being independent.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Two writs secured on post union leaders THE Post Office has secured two High Court writs in the past fortnight calling on leaders of the UCW communications union to repudiate unofficial action at sorting offices in London and Manchester under the threat of heavy financial damages, Robert Taylor writes. The first writ concerned disruption at London's Mount Pleasant sorting office in a row over overtime working. It was issued on October 8 and withdrawn five days later after intensive negotiations led to a settlement. This week the Post Office secured a writ over unofficial disruption being taken at sorting offices in Manchester. A further High Court hearing is planned for today.</p>

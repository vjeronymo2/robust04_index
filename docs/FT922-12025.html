			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Insurers win ruling on Gulf payout UNDERWRITERS AT Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, could recover part of one of the biggest insurance payouts of the Gulf war following a judgment in the Commercial Court, Richard Lapper writes. Lloyd's syndicates led reinsurance on a war-risks policy which paid out Dollars 300m (Pounds 168m) to Kuwait Airways following the seizure of 15 aircraft by the invading Iraqi forces in August 1990. In February last year an order was made that Iraqi Airways should pay the underwriters and Kuwait Airlines Dollars 489m. The order was made without Iraqi Airways entering an appearance and Iraq applied for it to be set aside. Last week Mr Justice Evans reaffirmed the order. Kuwait Airways, whose total losses amounted to nearly Dollars 1bn, is pursuing both Iraqi Airways and the state of Iraq for further compensation. There is also an outstanding dispute between the Kuwaitis and the underwriters. Faced with a claim for Dollars 690m (the value of the insured aircraft) the underwriters argue that cover was subject to a Dollars 300m aggregate limit.</p>

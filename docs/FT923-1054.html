			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro in lawsuit funding controversy SUN Microsystems, the US workstations group, is alleged to have been 'covertly funding' an anti-trust lawsuit against the Open Software Foundation, an industry group whose members include International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. The lawsuit, filed in April 1991 by Addamax, a small Illinois software company, alleges the industry group acted as an 'illegal cartel'. OSF had previously rejected Addamax's submission of security software for inclusion as a component of its OSF/1 computer operating system. This system is designed to establish an 'industry standard' version of Unix, the widely used AT&amp;T operating system. Sun Microsystems confirmed it had 'provided financial assistance to Addamax in the form of a loan guarantee to help fund expenses associated with the lawsuit'. According to OSF, Sun provided Addamax with a Dollars 7.5m loan guarantee. OSF said: 'This lawsuit was not the simple effort of a small, independent software vendor. Rather, Sun has been involved from the outset, and only by recent court order, which was opposed by Addamax, was Sun's financial backing of the suit revealed.' But Sun said it agreed to help Addamax because the company was a Sun supplier and 'appears to be raising serious issues of importance to the industry'. The disclosure of Sun's involvement in the anti-trust suit revives tensions between OSF and its rival, Unix International, in the open systems software arena. Sun is a founding member of Unix International, as is AT&amp;T. OSF was formed out of concern that Sun and AT&amp;T, who agreed to work together on a standard version of the Unix system, might design the software to give Sun a competitive advantage.</p>

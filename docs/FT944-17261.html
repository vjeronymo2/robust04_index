			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Claims on Thatcher arms link upset Tory leaders The Conservative party last night sought to distance itself from embarrassing allegations on the eve of its annual conference that Lady Thatcher's son Mark made Pounds 12m in commissions from a Saudi Arabian arms deal while she was prime minister. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, called for an independent public inquiry 'to get to the bottom of the allegations'. As the Conservative party tried to reassert its own agenda in the face of Labour attacks over the 'sleaze factor', one minister conceded the allegations were 'most unhelpful' coming just before Lady Thatcher is due to attend the conference in Bournemouth tomorrow. Conservative Central Office sought to distance the government from Lady Thatcher's administration of the 1980s. 'Allegations surrounding the son of a former prime minister who has been out of office for four years are of historical interest,' said a senior spokesman. Ministers, however, were irritated by yesterday's report in The Sunday Times which alleged that Mr Mark Thatcher was among a team of middlemen who earned between them Pounds 240m in commission payments from the Al-Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia. Mr Cook said: 'The Scott inquiry into arms sales to Iraq provides a good model for what is now needed. We need an independent investigation to get to the bottom of these serious allegations. 'There are two main questions that must be answered: what influence did Mark Thatcher sell in return for these millions and how much did Mrs Thatcher use her public office to promote her son to make a private fortune?' Mr Cook said Mr Michael Heseltine should set up the inquiry since he was now trade and industry secretary and had been the defence secretary who signed the deal 10 years ago. The Sunday Times also alleged that Lady Thatcher had been warned by civil servants about the potential damaging consequences of her son's involvement in the Saudi Arabian arms deal. Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, called yesterday for wider powers to track public money across departments. 'The committee needs wider powers to follow public money wherever it goes,' he said. 'I have argued for this very strongly and will continue to do so in light of the recent allegations surrounding the Al-Yamamah deal.' Mr Sheldon was instrumental in deciding that a report into the deal by the National Audit Office, a government watchdog committee, was not published on the grounds of national security. He said yesterday there had been no evidence the Ministry of Defence had done anything wrong in sanctioning the deal. But he stressed that his committee could only investigate individual government departments. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's spokesman for open government, demanded that the report be published in full. Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP who raised Mr Thatcher's involvement in the deal two years ago, said: 'I shall return to the subject when the House reassembles as I believe that this whole case should be pursued in Parliament.'

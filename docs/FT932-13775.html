			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Supermarket queue times 'could be cut' CUSTOMER QUEUEING times at some supermarket checkouts could be cut by up to a third if checkout counters were redesigned, according to research carried out by the University of Birmingham. At the same time, many of the illnesses and injuries suffered by operators could be avoided if checkouts were designed according to simple ergonomic principles, the research found. Supermarket customers interviewed by the researchers reported irritation if they were delayed by more than a couple of minutes. This was particularly the case when the operator was unable to serve because a previous customer was still packing shopping. Many shoppers suggested longer counters so they could unpack all their items while the previous customer's shopping was being scanned and paid for. Two thirds of customers wanted their shopping to be packed for them, with some saying it ought to be part of the service. Elderly people and shoppers with small children particularly wanted help. Few supermarkets in the UK offer packing, in contrast to the US where it is normal for customers to have their goods packed and carried to the car by staff. About one third of operators questioned experienced work-related aches or pains even before they started their shift; by the end of the shift, two thirds reported discomfort. The main problems were found to be work surfaces and equipment positioned so high that operators had to work with raised shoulders; inadequate leg clearance beneath counters; and inappropriate seating. Reaching and lifting items for scanning and packing, and bending and reaching under the counter for bags were the two tasks that caused the most problems. Developments in technology in recent years mean that operators can typically deal with 800 or more items of shopping an hour. However, the researchers found that some poorly-sited scanning equipment meant that operators experienced greater discomfort and had to slow down. Mr Terry Fielding, managing director of Potrafke, the checkout manufacturer which commissioned the research, said it was estimated that productivity gains of 15 per cent to 30 per cent could be achieved without much difficulty if the ergonomic principles highlighted by the report were applied.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wei (6392 4850)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Jun (XINHUA) -- At the glorious  starting point of China's antinarcotics campaign -- the Humen  Town Opium War Memorial Hall in Dongguan City, Guangdong  Province -- over 1,430 kg of heroin, opium, and marijuana were  reduced to ashes by four pyres of raging flames this morning. A  large-scale antinarcotics campaign was launched by Guangdong  this year to mark the International Antinarcotics Day had  unfolded.    The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court recently  circulated a notice on efforts made by people's courts at all  levels in the province to focus on pronouncing judgments and  carrying out sentences on narcotics-related criminal cases. On  25 June, 12 cities in the province, including Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Zhongshan, simultaneously pronounced  judgements on and carried out sentences given to 180 criminal  elements involved in narcotics cases -- including death  sentences given to 46 of these criminal elements, death  penalties with a suspension of execution given to 13 of them,  life imprisonment given to 12 of them, and fixed-term  imprisonment of more than five years given to 83 of them.    According to relevant responsible person of the Guangdong  Provincial Public Security Bureau, right now Guangdong Province  still faces a very grim situation in narcotics crimes. In view  of that, the Guangdong Provincial Narcotics Control Commission  urged vigorous efforts to intensify propaganda and efforts to  wage an antinarcotics people's war. The Guangdong Provincial  party committee and government made arrangements to launch  provincewide, a mammoth, unified antinarcotics campaign in the  latter half of this year so as to effectively check the rising  trend in the province's narcotics crimes.</p>

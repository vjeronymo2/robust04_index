			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Watchdog - Buzz words Cave canem: beware of the dog. Watchdogs are roaming all around us. Last week Clare Spottiswoode, the British gas industry watchdog, got in a spot of trouble with MPs over an outspoken attack upon her predecessor. Another House of Commons committee called for the sacking of Joe Palmer, chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, 'the planned watchdog to protect private investors' (Financial Times). The watchdog pack is growing the whole time, with everything from Oflot, for lotteries, and a railway regulator, to the Independent Television Commission, which bared its teeth last week, and the Securities and Investment Board for financial services. The original watchdog was Cerberus, the three-headed dog which kept the shades in Hades. Now watchdogs are people who keep watch over sectors of industry, finance or government. The word developed from the Oxford English Dictionary first usage in Shakespeare's play The Tempest ('the watch-Dogges barke, bawgh-wawgh'), through its first modern usage in 1845 in Encyclopedia Metropolitana ('now we feel the necessity for a set of guardians or watchdogs of the state') to a fixed meaning in 1910: 'the Chancellor acted as watch-dog in front of the Treasury'. Americans dropped the hyphen to stop the tail wagging the rest of the word, although it was new enough to continue to wear inverted commas into the 1950s. British watchdogs have specific tasks, such as Ofgas and Ofwat for utilities, the Securities and Investment Board for financial services and National Audit Office for the public sector. Some are bred from government stock, others are mongrels from consumers and sectors of industry. Strangely, the less dogginess the more watchfulness. The problem with the word centres on who is being guarded from what; this is rarely clear, since a watchdog both prevents intruders and escapees. But are all watchdogs necessarily impartial or independent? This from the Economist (April 30): 'The Mollen commission's key point is likely to be the establishment of an independent watchdog to monitor New York's police department.' Away from the familiar language of barking and biting, a watchdog can 'come under fire' (Telegraph, April 30) or find itself 'launched to stamp out abuses' (Daily Mail, April 22). The watchdog metaphor only has a limited linguistic life: loyal dogs are not put down, but 'de-recognised'. 'Lautro is due to be de-recognised as a regulator some time after the PIA is to become operational in July this year' (Financial Times, April 28).</p>

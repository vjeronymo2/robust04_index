			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / City warned of big increase in staff turnover City institutions have been warned of a big increase in staff turnover this year. It is expected to rise to 75,000 - or one in four of all employees. Staff shake-outs and a shift in culture from paternalistic to performance-based has often been badly handled and left staff morale at 'an all-time low', a group of City personnel directors adds in a report. Their comments are coupled with a warning that failures in managing change could endanger London's position as Europe's premier financial centre during the next five years. It could decline to being merely the 'first among equals'. The report from the London Human Resource Group warns that the City has lost 50,000 jobs in the past three years - the same number that it put on during the Big Bang period of the mid 1980s. But job numbers are expected to rise again by 21,000 to 328,000 by 1998, it adds. The report says that rationalisation is necessary but not sufficient and that financial services could face the same decline as large parts of manufacturing. 'This report's recommendations deserve to be studied at the highest level in every institution,' says Lord Alexander, the chairman of National Westminster Bank, in the report's foreword. Staff costs account for between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of company expenditure and three out of five employees are relatively high-cost 'knowledge workers', characterised by high levels of education, identification with their craft, and strong individualism. The proportion of knowledge workers will continue to rise as the number and 'customisation' of financial products increases. The report, based on a survey involving 358 City institutions, says the number of financial products has increased to more than 700 from 70 in 1970. The new performance culture for such knowledge workers, which has produced a large increase in productivity, includes the buying out of perks and the end of 'job-for-life' assumptions. But Mr Geoff Tucker, personnel director of Legal &amp; General, the insurance group, said many job interviews were still based on the assumption of permanent employment and most pensions were still based on final salary. 'In some companies we are just getting to the point of basing interviews on the explicit assumption that people will only be with us for three to five years,' he said. The report says City institutions will have to offer training for future employability to such people in exchange for job security. The report also recommends that companies spell out their core values, something which only 2 per cent of those surveyed now do. The main dilemma, says the report, is that City institutions will need to continue to 're-engineer' themselves and make themselves more flexible while requiring skills and values which are difficult to develop in a low-trust climate.

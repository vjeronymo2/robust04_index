			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given: "I Would  Accept the Position of Prime Minister...."]    [Text] Regardless of the expected results, the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP] is thinking in terms of a coalition  government, MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn told MAGYAR HIRLAP. Gyula  Horn pointed out that the Socialists will agree to govern alone  if their partners get scared. Personally, Gyula Horn regards  the position of prime minister as a great challenge; reacting to  the reservations of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Horn  said that the victorious party chairman is also usually given  the prime minister's post according to West European practice.    [Szombathy] Leading SZDSZ politicians have recently  indicated that the SZDSZ would not form a coalition with the  MSZP if the party nominates you as prime minister. Will such  messages affect your intentions?    [Horn] I find it strange that one of the opposition parties  is dealing with such personnel combinations two weeks before the  second round of elections. Let us wait for the election  results, and then the distribution of posts can be part of the  coalition talks. SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto visited me over the  weekend and kindly expressed his sympathy regarding this...  should I say?... accident of mine. Both Peto and other SZDSZ  leaders expressed the view that, starting from the experience of  the past four years, it would not be a good thing to have the  party chairman also as prime minister. This was the basic  objection of the Free Democrats. I answered that we constantly  mention Western examples and a party chairman-prime minister set  up prevails almost everywhere in the West, in the case of both  social democratic and conservative governments. The head of the  party that won the elections is generally the one who forms a  government. Besides, this is an issue that we will have time to  deal with after 29 May.    [Szombathy] Would you accept a possible nomination as prime  minister? Do you have such ambitions?    [Horn] I have never asked for any position in my life; nor  will I do so this time. If the MSZP decides to make me the  candidate for prime minister, I will naturally accept this.  This is a great challenge for anyone, and I have always liked  challenges. One can only meet such a challenge with very tough  and consistent work. Together with my party, I put my entire  life at stake to see this country somehow prosper at long last.  Hungary also suffers because there are few who care about  others' problems. The past four years has shown the  superabundance and harmful consequences of individual and  personal ambitions. If I can live for the interest of this  country, and we can do this, and if we can see to it that the  overwhelming majority of our population live better, it would be  a pity to reject such a task.    [Szombathy] Have you considered the possibility of forming a  government of experts by obtaining an adequate majority,  including experts of parties outside parliament?    [Horn] We have not thought of this, but essentially I  support the idea of having two or three members in the next  government who do not belong to any political party. This does  not necessarily mean a government of experts; it only means the  inclusion of figures that are professionals. One should not  distribute the positions by mathematically counting the  proportion of victors. I have an open mind on this issue.    [Szombathy] Could it happen that you become the Socialists'  candidate for prime minister, but someone else becomes prime  minister?    [Horn] We will not allow any of our partners to blackmail  us. If the MSZP gets an absolute majority in parliament, the  president will obviously ask us to form a government. I am  almost certain that there will be no shortage of coalition  partners. Regardless of the expected results, the MSZP thinks  in terms of a coalition government. However, this does not mean  a condition to which we stick by all means. If we get an  absolute majority and there are no parties that, fearing a  socialist imbalance, agree to form a coalition, the MSZP will  accept governing responsibility alone. This is its duty because  this is what it has worked for for four years! We have been  struggling for the use of a better policy all the time. We  would be deceiving the voters if we made a retreat with an  absolute majority in Parliament. But the MSZP is a force that  is acting responsibly.    [Szombathy] You said that there would be no shortage of  partners. Why? What other party can you count on, except the  SZDSZ?    [Horn] We are open toward every democratic force. At the  same time, we do not want to cooperate in the next government  with parties that are responsible for the current situation in  Hungary, forces that lost the elections, and the current  government coalition is such a force. I also said earlier that  we are open to a Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] that  gets rid of its extremists, although the KDNP is also  responsible for the current situation. I continue to say that.  As for the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], they should  decide whether to continue the very extremist line of recent  months or to do what they have done in Parliament very well for  the past three years, namely followed a pragmatic policy based  on a rational ability to evaluate things. If such debates take  place in the Fidesz, we will naturally also be open to them.    [Szombathy] Would you accept a minority MSZP government if  you fail to find a partner and you fail to obtain a majority?    [Horn] I do not think that we should accept forming a  minority government, because I am convinced that we will have a  partner even if we do not obtain an absolute majority. If the  trend of 8 May continues, the MSZP needs very little to achieve  very serious results.</p>

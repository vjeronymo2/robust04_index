			<p>BFN     [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Jorge Eliecer  Avendano, alias "El Loco," an alleged member of the Medellin  Cartel, surrendered voluntarily to justice in this northeastern  Colombian city on Tuesday, it has been officially reported.    The alleged criminal is the brother of Jorge Eduardo "Tato"  Avendano, a lieutenant of the late Pablo Escobar, who after  escaping with the "capo" and eight other collaborators in July  1992 from Envigado Prison surrendered to justice two months  later.    According to Fernando Mancilla, Antioquia Department  regional  prosecutor, "Loco" Avendano's surrender "was carried out  normally," and after giving his first deposition to authorities,  he was confined to the prison of the neighboring locality of  Itagui, where there are other Escobar henchmen.    The judicial official has refrained from commenting on  whether this surrender means the resumption of cartel members  surrendering to justice to take advantage of the legislation  contemplating reduced jail sentences and other benefits for drug  traffickers who turn themselves in and confess at least one of  their offenses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA)--Justin Mugenzi, Rwanda's  minister of trade and industry and president of the Liberal  Party, has said that his visit to Egypt is part of the  consultations held by the government of Rwanda to stop the  current massacres in the country.    At a news conference in Cairo today, he said he discussed  the  situation in Rwanda with President Husni Mubarak during their  meeting today. He said he appealed to the president to use his  influence and relations to end the war.    He also urged the international community to intervene to  stop the fighting and persuade all sides to abandon arms so that  the people of Rwanda can be convinced to halt the war. [passage  omitted]    Mugenzi said his country has been in a state of war for four  years, during which the number of refugees and displaced inside  the country rose from 400,000 people to 1 million. With a  population of 7 million people, there is one refugee for every  seven people in Rwanda, he said. [passage omitted]    On the security situation in Rwanda, Mugenzi explained that  the government is doing all it can to restore stability and calm  to a country where people are dominated by a spirit of revenge.  The government expresses regret for the victims of violence and  is doing everything in its power to stop this bloody human  tragedy, he said.    He said the conflict has gone beyond all rational  boundaries,  and the war has turned into a tribal and ethnic one. It is  difficult to control a people willing to apply their own law of  revenge and ones who are confident that their primary enemy is  the Patriotic Front and its Tutsi tribes, he said. This is the  reason for the violence in the country, he added.    He regretted and condemned the killings in his country and  called on the people to demonstrate patience and leave the  government to do its job.    On reports that the Belgian forces operating within the UN  peace- keeping force are involved in Rwanda's incidents,  Minister Mugenzi expressed his country's "anxiety" [ta'azzum]  over the conduct of the Belgian forces. He said: Our relations  with Belgium have until recently been extremely good. We do not  blame the Belgian Government for the acts of some personnel, and  we believe those are individual acts.    He said Rwanda is concerned about the conduct of the Belgian  forces. Since they set foot in the capital Kigali, he said,  they have been engaged in suspect acts with support from the  Patriotic Front. We warned those forces against this conduct,  and officials apologized for some incidents, he said.    He added: We clearly say that many members of these Belgian  forces cooperate with the Patriotic Front. They were placed in  strategic positions and several armed battles have taken place  between them and the government forces in Rwanda, resulting in  many victims.    He said his country demanded withdrawal of those forces, and  the necessary measures for this withdrawal have already been  taken. The forces reached the border and this is satisfactory,  he said.

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Australian trade deficit worsens: September current account shortfall of ADollars 1.8bn exceeds forecast Australia clocked up a ADollars 1.809bn (Pounds 830m) current account deficit in September, the second successive month in which it has produced worse-than-expected trade data, although the latest figure did represent some improvement on the ADollars 2.11bn August deficit which so badly unnerved financial markets. The latest deficit, calculated on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with market forecasts of around ADollars 1.7bn. It means that, over the first quarter of the current 1994-95 financial year, Australia's current account deficit has reached ADollars 6.96bn, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year. As analysts at Bankers Trust pointed out yesterday, extrapolating this growth for the entire financial year would give a deficit of ADollars 22.2bn. In its May budget, the government of Prime Minister Paul Keating estimated a current account deficit for 1994-95 of ADollars 18bn, or 4 per cent of gross domestic product. On the export front, the unadjusted figure was unchanged from August at ADollars 5.29bn, with falls in gold exports and mineral fuels being offset by higher sales of metal ores and minerals and wool. Imports eased back from the abnormally high figure of ADollars 6.69bn in August, to ADollars 6.06bn. The Australian bond and share markets weakened on the balance of payments news - in spite of the distraction of yesterday's Melbourne Cup horse race - with sentiment also discouraged by stronger-than-expected building approvals figures. Pessimists believe that if Australia fails to improve its trade balance soon, it could be headed for further interest rate rises and a repeat of the 'boom and bust' episodes which have plagued it in the past. Yesterday, however, Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, said that growth in imports during the first quarter overall reflected the economy's move out of recession, and the increasingly willingness by business to invest. 'While imports fell in September, strong import growth in the September quarter is consistent with ongoing strength in domestic economic activity,' he commented.</p>

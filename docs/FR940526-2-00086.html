The closed portion of the meeting involves discussion, examination, reference to, and oral review of staff and consultant critiques of research protocols, and similar documents. During this portion of the meeting, discussion and recommendations will deal with qualifications of personnel conducting the studies, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, as well as research information, the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action regarding such research projects.

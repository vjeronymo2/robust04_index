			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOOD OF TROOPS TURNS GRIM IN GULF WAR TALK  </P> <P> A grim new mood swept across this kingdom's eastern desert Saturday as echoes  of resurgent war talk reached U.S. encampments and soldiers came to grips with  the realization that their fates are now tied firmly to the outcome of the  Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> With massive American reinforcements on the way and planned troop rotations  postponed indefinitely, top commanders cast ambiguity aside and, on the 215th  birthday of the Marine Corps, spoke bluntly about a possible U.S.-led attack  against Iraq.  </P> <P> The sobering words about new offensive options and warnings of an uncertain  future had the sound of a call to arms in the starkly martial celebrations held  at dusty desert compounds where thousands of Marines are encamped.  </P> <P> "More than ever before," warned Maj. Gen. Robert M. Johnston, chief of staff  for the U.S. Central Command, as assembled troops stood at rapt attention, "the  prospect of offensive combat is going to be the greatest challenge that Marines  have seen in many decades."  </P> <P> "Strong signals are being sent," said Brig. Gen. Thomas B. Draude, assistant  commander of Marine ground forces here, adding, in obvious understatement:  "Things are a little different than they were a week or so ago."  </P> <P> The two commanders addressed the troops as word began to circulate that  President Bush had authorized the deployment of more than 200,000 U.S. military  personnel over the next two months or so to join the 238,000 already assigned  to the Persian Gulf area.  </P> <P> Among the Marines here, scattered disclosures of the new developments generated  less outright complaining than stoic reflection about the implications of being  deployed for the duration when the prospect of war seems to be increasing.  </P> <P> Shown a copy of a newspaper story about the canceled rotations, 19-year-old  Lance Cpl. Brad Olmstead of Spokane, Wash., sat purse-lipped for a moment in  the back of a bouncing, five-ton truck.  </P> <P> Then, he slung his arm around the shoulder of 23-year-old Lance Cpl. Richard  Dobbs, a fellow sentry from the headquarters of the Camp Pendleton-based 1st  Marine Division. "Buddy," he said, "we're here to stay."  </P> <P> Members of a congressional delegation who met with troops in Saudi Arabia on  Saturday told reporters afterward that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait would no  longer be considered sufficient to end the gulf standoff.  </P> <P> Reps. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) and Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) said many members  of Congress are now convinced that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's arsenal of  chemical weapons and potential capability to produce nuclear arms must be  eliminated as part of any resolution.  </P> <P> "If he moves out of Kuwait unilaterally, we are also going to insist, the  Congress will insist, that he not have this ability and that we be able to  verify it," said Murtha, chairman of the House Defense Committee.  </P> <P> The expanded U.S. deployment, which includes hundreds of tanks and three  aircraft carrier groups, will provide the additional force that commanders have  said they would need to launch a possible military offensive to drive Hussein's  forces out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> As part of the massive buildup, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said that  previous plans to begin rotating troops out of the gulf will be put off  indefinitely so that the U.S. force can be increased to peak levels.  </P> <P> In helicopter shuttles to half a dozen Marine units Saturday, it was evident  that few troops had more than sketchy information about either the magnitude of  the planned reinforcements or the cancellation of troop rotations.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that such details were bound to have an even further "sobering  effect," Brig. Gen. Mike Myatt, commander of Marine ground forces, said he  planned to brief field commanders today on the news that their troops will be  kept in place indefinitely.  </P> <P> "It'll be tough on the Marines," predicted Col. John. H. Admire, the commanding  officer of the 3rd Marine Regiment, who said his troops had been counting on  rotation after six to eight months of service.  </P> <P> Some Marines, told of the no-rotation policy, responded with stares of  disbelief, reflecting the degree to which many had begun to look forward to  some springtime relief.  </P> <P> Others, who gathered in small clusters to learn more news from reporters after  the ceremonial cutting of Marine Corps cake, complained of more children's  birthdays missed, anniversaries celebrated by long-distance, even discharges  delayed.  </P> <P> But from combat troops who for months have urged that they be permitted to "get  it over with and get out," the news also prompted hope that the abandonment of  rotations means that the United States is not prepared to wait forever.  </P> <P> "If they say we're going to be here till it's over, that means something's  going to be happening pretty soon," said Sgt. Perry Cooke, of Brooklyn, N.Y.,  whose enlistment was due to run out next month.  </P> <P> Even largely cut off from the news, however, Marines said that in recent days  they had begun to sense, as one lance corporal put it, "that things were  beginning to go down."  </P> <P> At the same time, some officers said, the extraordinary bluntness of the  remarks from Johnston, the top deputy to Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the  theater commander in chief, appear to leave little doubt that something  significant has changed.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Gary Luck, commander of the Army's 18th Airborne Corps, used similarly  strong language in a separate appearance, scorning Iraq's refusal to back down  in the face of superior U.S. force.  </P> <P> "(Saddam) Hussein is the one who should be uncomfortable," Luck said. "Either  his ego is too big or he's dumber than a stump not to understand his  situation."  </P> <P> Until last week, military officials stuck closely to ground rules permitting  discussion only of defensive scenarios, noting that the declared mission of the  United States remained the defense of Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> But now that the President himself has lifted the barrier to discussion of  offensive operations, Johnston said in an interview that ground training for  U.S. forces could receive new emphasis on attack-oriented tasks.  </P> <P> And in contrast to the ambiguities in which top American generals tended in the  past to talk about a U.S. offensive, the two-star general painted a vivid  picture of a war that could lie ahead.  </P> <P> "We may indeed have to concern ourselves with an offensive option," Johnston  said. "We've got to make sure that if that decision is made and we go into  combat, that once again we are able to measure up to the great expectations  that people have for the Corps."  </P> <P> Johnston said he and other Marines who fought in Vietnam "can say with  confidence that we know how we'll respond under fire." But, he added, "I can  tell you that this is going to be a completely different battlefield.  </P> <P> "In Vietnam, we didn't exactly face 5,000 tanks," the general said, observing  also that Iraq has access to advanced technologies. "It's going to be a new  ballgame. . . . It's going to require boldness and daring and initiative and  speed."  </P> <P> The celebration of the Marine birthday included the presentation of cakes  adorned with reminders of past Marine battles, notably the World War II clashes  in the Pacific at Wake Island, Tarawa and Iwo Jima.  </P> <P> In their remarks, the generals urged Marines to remember the standard that  their predecessors had set and to regard themselves as privileged to open a new  chapter in a record that the division chaplain described as "from the halls of  Montezuma to the sands of Saudi Arabia."  </P> <P> "Like tens of thousands of other Marines," said Lt. Gen. Walter E. Boomer,  commander of all Marine forces here, in a further evocation of the  tough-talking new message, "you celebrate your birthday preparing for battle."  </P></p>

Interviewed by  reporters in Manila, Secretary Romulo said the trade war between  Japan and the United States will likely push Washington to  reconsider its focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Romulo  believes that because of its trade rift with Japan, America  might favor the other regions, like Europe. Last week  Washington reinstated one of its toughest trade laws, the law  Super 301 allows U.S. President Bill Clinton to impose punitive  tariffs of up to 100 percent on a country that obstructs import  of U.S. products, but Secretary Romulo said he does not believe  Super 301 will be slapped against the Philippines. The  Philippines had been placed under the priority watch list of  trade violators in the past but was delisted after addressing  U.S. concern.</p>

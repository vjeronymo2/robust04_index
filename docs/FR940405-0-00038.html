			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. There were seven comments regarding quality improvement. Five of the comments dealt with the concern that quality improvement could not be ``ensured'' as was required by Criterion 3 of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees and has modified paragraph (c)(1)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Two comments suggested that the term ``significant'' be introduced into Criterion 3 when referring to the types of problems that require corrective action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It is the Department's position that the causes of all problems (not just those considered significant or generic) should be identified and corrected. In doing this, the rigor with which a problem is investigated and corrective action taken should be commensurate with the importance of the problem and the work affected (graded approach).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Documents and Records (Criterion 4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. There was one comment regarding paragraph (c)(1)(iv). The comment stated that the rule ``makes no provision for the identification, retrieval, or retention of records as required by 10 CFR part 50, appendix B.'' The comment maintained that the rule would ``appear to be a step backward in the protection of records, yet the draft safety guide invokes DOE 1324.2A and mandates National Archives and Records Administration rules as applicable to nuclear facilities. This contradicts the purpose of the rulemaking process which would replace Orders with rules.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As written, the rule requires that records be specified, prepared, reviewed, approved, and maintained. While this terminology is different than that used in 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, it does encompass the concepts of record ``identification, retrieval, [and] retention'' as stated in appendix B. Secondly, safety guides do not invoke or mandate requirements. DOE safety guides provide DOE contractors with acceptable methods for implementing specific parts of the Department's rules. Safety guides are not substitutes for rules, and while they must be considered by contractors, methods and solutions different from those set out in the guides are acceptable if the requirements of the rule are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Work Processes (Criterion 5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16. A comment stated that Criterion 5 did not clearly distinguish between the relative importance of the items and processes to which it applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees and has modified paragraph (b)(1) to require application of a graded approach to all criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. A second comment questioned the relationship between the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of &sect;830.120, ``Quality Assurance Requirements,'' and Section 830.310, ``Conduct of Operations,'' relating to procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Criterion 5 addresses ``Work Processes.'' The Department considers operations to be a work process. Criterion 5 goes further to require that work (like the operations process) be performed using approved instructions, procedures, or other appropriate means. Operations procedures, the term used in &sect;830.310, describe how work is to be accomplished during the operation of DOE facilities. Operations procedures are one type_a subset_of procedures required by Criterion 5 (maintenance procedures are another).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

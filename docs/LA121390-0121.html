			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEREOTYPES HINDER MINORITIES' ATTEMPTS TO REACH MANAGERIAL RANKS  </P> <P> Almost 60% of Latino journalists surveyed in California this year said they  plan to leave their jobs within 10 years. About 36% of Asian-American  journalists said they are likely to leave journalism altogether within five  years.  </P> <P> Unlike whites who leave -- in much smaller numbers, generally citing boredom  and poor pay -- minorities mostly cite their lack of advancement opportunities.  </P> <P> More minorities than whites say they want to go into management -- some because  of personal and professional ambition, some because they see journalism as a  vehicle for exposing and even correcting longstanding inequities in U.S.  society. Frustrated by their inability to attain positions of authority on  their newspapers, a growing number of minority journalists are deciding to look  outside journalism to achieve their objectives.  </P> <P> Some Asian-American journalists feel their prospects for advancement may be  particularly bleak because of stereotypical perceptions about them by white  managers.  </P> <P> The stereotyping begins at the reportorial level, where Asian-Americans are far  more likely to be made education and business writers than, say, film critics  or sportswriters. When it comes time for promotions, Asians say, they are often  erroneously seen as "techno-coolies" -- hard workers, meticulous, conscientious  but not especially creative or imaginative; they're also regarded as too  passive, not assertive or aggressive enough to be editors.  </P> <P> That means that Asian-Americans are far more likely to be made copy editors  than city editors or managing editors.  </P> <P> But as K. Connie Kang, an assistant metropolitan editor at the San Francisco  Examiner, points out, in "Confucian-steeped cultures, talking about your  virtues is a shameful thing . . . speaking up is not a polite thing. You're  supposed to expect people in positions of authority to recognize your abilities  and appreciate you, rather than you having to go to them and . . . ask for a  raise, ask for a promotion."  </P> <P> Simon Li, deputy foreign editor at the Los Angeles Times, says the emphasis on  education in most Asian families leads many Asians to believe that their  achievements are measurable and that rewards will come accordingly, without  being specifically sought. Because of these factors of cultural conditioning,  many Asians not only think it inappropriate to ask for promotions, they may  refuse to apply when openings are available.  </P> <P> But some white editors, unaware of this cultural difference, may think the  talented Asian-Americans who don't apply for a given job don't really want it  or would be insufficiently aggressive to do it properly if they got it. Editors  also argue that if Asian-Americans want to succeed in a Western world still  dominated by white attitudes and practices, they'll have to adapt -- to push  themselves for promotion the way many whites do.  </P> <P> Craig Matsuda, an assistant editor in the View section of the Los Angeles  Times, argues, however, that if he has to make such a fundamental change in  himself to get promoted, then what he's won is, at best, "a Pyrrhic victory."  </P> <P> Ironically, Asians who do not fit the stereotype, who speak out and push  themselves just like many whites, are often regarded as troublemakers precisely  because they don't behave as expected. So they may not get promoted either.  </P></p>

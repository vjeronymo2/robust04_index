			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following today's [25 March] meeting of the Cabinet  members nominated by the Party of the Democratic Left with  journalists, we interviewed Brigita Snegnerova, the deputy prime  minister responsible for the economy, who has returned from a  study trip to the United States of America.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Deputy Prime  Minister, which problems in Slovakia's economy do you regard as  being a priority at the present time?    [Snegnerova] There are very many of them, and listing them  would probably take some time. We would like to focus to a  considerable extent on an accelerated continuation of the  process in the privatization sphere.    We would like to aim in particular at generating, through  privatization, private companies capable of creating job  opportunities for people and producing goods that could compete  abroad. Thus, they would help us solve the situation in our  foreign trade and in improving the foreign trade balance. This  is linked to another objective of the government's economic  policy, which is that much stronger emphasis will be placed on  trade policies, in particular on export-promoting policies.    [Correspondent] Recently, you had a meeting with the World  Bank executive director and IMF representatives, and you visited  the United States Department of the Treasury and other important  institutions. Have these meetings yielded anything positive for  Slovakia?    [Snegnerova] I would like to sum up very briefly the  conclusions of these meetings. Support for the new Slovak  Government was voiced at all of the meetings. They voiced  confidence that the new Slovak Government would speed up the  transformation of Slovak society, the democratization of Slovak  society, and that it would speed up the economic transformation.    We agreed with the IMF that, as early as before the final  drafting of the economic and political section of the government  statement, we would hold several rounds of talks with Mr.  Zervudakis, a member of the staff responsible for Slovakia.  These talks should make sure that the policy the government  will submit to the parliament is acceptable to both sides. This  step is significant because the IMF's positive approach to the  government economic policy could mean the speeding up of the  talks on the standby loan. As you know, the significance of  this loan does not lie only in boosting our currency funds; it  amounts, above all, to the expression of support for the  economic policy of the government, and, at the same time, is an  expression of support for the Slovak economy. It will be an  important signal for foreign investors, be they institutions or  strategic investors. Our efforts will be aimed at attracting  these investors. Along with the approval of a standby loan or,  rather, when we start drawing this loan, we will get the second  (?part of the stand-by) loan. This has already been approved,  but there is a condition attached to the drawing of the second  stage.    [Correspondent] When, in your view, could Slovakia get the  standby loan?    [Snegnerova] Provided that talks proceed well, it could be  within the next few months. [end recording]</p>

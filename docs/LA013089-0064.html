			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Swiss authorities ordered bank records linked to the unfolding insider trading  scandal in France to be turned over to U.S. investigators who uncovered the  affair. The SEC had asked the Swiss Federal Office of Police Affairs to help in  the Pechiney-Triangle probe by ordering a suspension of strict banking secrecy  rules on accounts at five Swiss banks and two financial services companies. The  affair involves allegations that people with confidential, advance information  made huge illegal stock market profits when the French state-owned aluminum  company Pechiney bought out U.S.-based Triangle Industries last November.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WALL CRUMBLES;  </P> <P> E. GERMAN THRONGS GO WEST, RETURN;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: EGON KRENZ'S DRAMATIC GAMBLE OF OPENING THE BORDER AND RISKING AN  EXODUS SEEMS TO BE WORKING. MOST EAST GERMANS FLOCKING TO VISIT THE WEST ARE  SIGHTSEEING.  </P> <P> An estimated three quarters of a million EastGermans swarmed into the West on  Saturday on the second day of their new-found freedom, but to the growing  relief of both East and West German authorities, the majority were on their way  home by the end of the day.  </P> <P> East German officials issued the startling news Saturday that fully 1.6 million  East Germans -- one-tenth of the entire population -- had been issued travel  visas since the border opening announcement Thursday.  </P> <P> Further, the officials claimed that 2.7 million visas had been issued since  late Thursday -- with 1.1 million issued within five hours.  </P> <P> Only 8,160 people had applied to emigrate during that same period, according to  the figures.  </P> <P> During repeated discussions in Duderstadt and nearby border communities with  East German visitors, it appeared that new East German leader Egon Krenz's  dramatic gamble to open the border at the risk of a wholesale exodus had won  the beleaguered Communist regime at least a brief breathing space.  </P> <P> Most of those interviewed say they believe the borders will remain open and  that Krenz has little choice but to follow through with his promise to hold  free elections.  </P> <P> Although not always expressed as such, it was clear the majority of East German  visitors now believe a fundamental shift of power has taken place in their  homeland, a shift away from the Communist Party to a population bubbling with  discontent.  </P> <P> "Things are changing," declared Ursula Weschka, a 26-year-old office worker  from the East German border village of Kettenborn. "There will be free  elections, I'm convinced of that."  </P> <P> If the Communist leadership either reneged on its promise of free elections or  attempted to close the border, there would be more and far-larger public  demonstrations, several predicted. Many said they planned to return to  demonstrate peacefully until elections take place.  </P> <P> Others indicated that only a new crackdown would make them consider leaving for  good.  </P> <P> Indeed, it seemed that only those who declared themselves refugees -- about 5%  of the total crossing over during the first two days -- believe that the  present easing of conditions is temporary.  </P> <P> "It was the (Communists) who lied to us for 40 years; how can you be expected  to believe what those same people promise now?" asked Frank Schmidt, 43, a  foundry worker from Thale.  </P> <P> In addition to the skeptics, newly arrived refugees housed in a sports center  near here also included families who said they had been actively harassed for  opposing the Communist authorities.  </P> <P> One man said he had lost his job and had faced weekly police interrogations  during the past year.  </P> <P> But in Duderstadt and elsewhere, it was the day trippers who dominated.  </P> <P> Along Germany's 860-mile internal frontier, a vast, impromptu carnival  blossomed as East and West Germans celebrated the shredding of the Iron Curtain  that had kept them apart.  </P> <P> They came by car and by special trains and buses in such volume that many West  German border communities blocked off traffic and turned themselves into giant  pedestrian zones.  </P> <P> The number of those who crossed Saturday was triple the figure registered for  Friday.  </P> <P> Traffic jams as long as 20 miles built up at many border points.  </P> <P> Telegram and telephone services between the two Germanys reached a breaking  point, with East German authorities saying it would take up to four days to  clear the backlog of telegrams, mainly from West Germans extending invitations  to relatives in the East.  </P> <P> In most areas, the atmosphere was light and carefree.  </P> <P> The knowledge that they had not had to give up their homes to enjoy a day in  the West left Germans from both sides of the border exhilarated.  </P> <P> In the main square of this quaint, thousand-year-old market town, 150 miles  southwest of Berlin, and in countless other communities along the border, they  danced, cheered and gradually began to take in the prospect that a new and  better life had arrived.  </P> <P> Near the north German port city of Luebek, a band greeted those crossing from  the East.  </P> <P> At the busiest inner-German border crossing near Helmstedt, East Germans stuck  flowers in the jacket pockets of West Germany border guards and waved to crowds  applauding along the road.  </P> <P> In Duderstadt, the staff of the local newspaper sponsored a spontaneous street  fair with blaring rock music and beer for the equivalent of a nickel a glass.  </P> <P> Throughout the border region, the notoriously iron-clad regulations that  dictate that all retail selling end by 2 p.m. on Saturday were officially  suspended. Many shops stayed open past 11 p.m.  </P> <P> Visitors said so many families crossed the border that East German schools,  which normally operate Saturday, closed for the day.  </P> <P> Many parents used their $60 "welcome money" from the West German government to  buy fruit and toys for their children.  </P> <P> Duderstadt's largest children's store was packed with customers.  </P> <P> "This isn't like Christmastime, it's more than that," commented the store's  owner, Herbert Schamstieg.  </P> <P> Outside, an East German girl quietly stroked the hair of her newly purchased  Barbie Doll.  </P> <P> The look of awe on her face as she gazed at her new toy confirmed the store  owner's remark.  </P></p>

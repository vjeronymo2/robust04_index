			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / China hits at Hong Kong company CHINA yesterday stepped up its campaign against Governor Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong with a fierce attack on Jardine Matheson, one of the colony's oldest trading companies. The denunciation appeared to be intended to hit Jardine's share price, and led to a steep fall in Hong Kong share overall. It prompted a rare statement from John Swire, another leading trading company of British origin, which sought to play down the attack. The attack heightened anxiety among the colony's business leaders about the rapid deterioration in Anglo-Chinese relations and the consequences this would have for Hong Kong's long-term future. The Hang Seng index ended 136.8 points, or 2.57 per cent, lower at 5,192.66. Jardine's share price ended HKDollars 2.75 lower at HKDollars 42.75. A despatch carried by the Xinhua news agency described an old British conglomerate which once sold opium to China as 'a bad element in Hong Kong's business community, a 'looter'.' Jardine was not referred to by name, but the reference to opium - the early 19th-century trade which was the foundation of the company's fortunes - made it the unmistakable subject of the article. It was also accused of actively promoting Mr Patten's democracy proposals in Hong Kong and London. But Xinhua's comments concerned other British companies in Hong Kong. 'It is asking for it,' Xinhua said, forecasting further falls in its share price if Jardine continued its political activities. Jardine said yesterday it had no comment on the Xinhua dispatch, accounts of which dominated the news media in Hong Kong yesterday. In contrast, Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Swire in Hong Kong, said: 'We see no reason why what has been said has any significance for the Swire group or any other company in Hong Kong.' Although some analysts said they thought the Xinhua article boded ill for British companies, most felt it was a warning directed solely at Jardine. Nevertheless it heightened concern in the colony's financial community. Mr John Mulcahy, director of research at Peregrine, a local brokerage, said: 'I think this is really going to worry people overseas. Jardine is seen as a symbol of Hong Kong and the notion of it being under attack will not sit easily with investors.' Jardine has had an uneasy relationship with China since it was founded in Macao in 1832. It lobbied Lord Palmerston for the annexation of Hong Kong; this occurred in 1841 and was made legal by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. But it has been Jardine's more recent activities which have angered the Chinese. It agitated in London for the removal of Lord Wilson, Mr Patten's predecessor, and it has been conspicuous in its support for Mr Patten's political proposals. Mr Henry Keswick, Jardine's chairman, is head of the Hong Kong Foundation, a London-based organisation, which has given unequivocal support to Mr Patten's plans for more democracy in the colony.

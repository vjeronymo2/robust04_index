			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plantation reforms expected soon SRI LANKA. the world's largest exporter of tea, is expected soon to announce substantial changes in the contracts awarded last year for the private management of 450 government-owned tea, rubber and coconut estates. The changes are likely to include a decision to extend the contract period from five years to around 30 years, which will amount to an effective privatisation, though the land will still technically be owned by the government. 'In Sri Lanka land is a sensitive issue and there is no way we could sell it to the private sector. But before the end of the year I fully expect to be in a position to grant a new contract, possibly a usufruct contract, of 40 years,' says Mr Rupasena Karunatilleke, Sri Lanka's minister of plantation industries. The package, which has yet to be finally approved by the Sri Lankan cabinet, comes after a clamour of complaints from the country's 22 privately owned management companies. They argued that with only a five-year contract it was to raise the money needed for large-scale investment to boost productivity and stem heavy losses. When the companies took over last year the two government plantation boards that ran the industry had accumulated losses of around SLRs13bn (Pounds 178m) and had put the viability of the nation's two main banks in jeopardy. Investment of several hundred million dollars is required to modernise Sri Lanka's ageing plantations and factories. The tea bushes on many estates are more than 50 years old and of the wrong type. A massive replanting scheme is required to double output per hectare. Sri Lanka's output of tea is about 1,000kg a hectare, half that of Indian plantations and even further below those of Kenya. With less than 10 per cent of Sri Lankan tea output converted to CTC form (curt, tear and curl, as used in tea bags), the country also needs substantial investment in new factories. The government is talking to The Asian Development Bank in the hope of obtaining loans of around Dollars 60m, which would be re-lent to those management companies willing to put in investment of their own. The ADB is insisting that the 'lease or management' contract between the government and the companies be put on a more long-term and commercially viable basis.</p>

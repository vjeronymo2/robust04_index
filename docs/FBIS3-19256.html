			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erik Haendeler: "Germany Has Missed the Boat; </F> Thoughts on Kondratieff's Theory of Long Economic Cycles"]    [Text] Munich, 20 Feb--Anyone who believes we merely need  to wait for the next upswing in order to deal with the economic  crisis will have a long wait. Germany will not be able to cope  with recession and mass underemployment for some time because it  has reacted to new challenges with old recipes and is continuing  to do so. It has been resting on the laurels of the economic  miracle and has failed to adapt to the rules of the new growth  industries even as the its old industries are getting rid of  more and more workers while production figures remain virtually  the same.    These are the views of Leo Nefiodow of the Society for  Mathematics and Data Processing in Bonn who traces the recession  to the theory of long economic cycles, the so-called Kondratieff  cycles, named after Nicolai Kondratieff who stated his concept  in a 1926 article in the ARCHIV FUER SOZIALWISSENSCHAFT AND  SOZIALPOLITIK [Archives of Social Science and Social Policy].  <H5>  The Dynamics of Growth </H5>   According to this theory the economy is not only governed by  short or medium-term cycles but also by growth cycles lasting  some 50 years. They are the result of basic innovations such as  the steam engine, electrical engineering, the automobile, or  information technology which penetrate all areas of society.  They sustain economic growth for decades and alter the ways in  which societies organize themselves. Economies which were best  at adapting to new rules and formulas for success and at making  use of these fundamental innovations were able to offer good  social services because of their leading technological position  and to support large armies--such as 19th century England with  the help of the steam engine, cotton, and steel. But because  Great Britain held on to the coal and steel success formulas  after 1890 and failed to adapt to the new challenges of the  third Kondratieff cycle (electrical engineering and chemistry)  and the fourth cycle as of 1950 (automobiles and petrochemicals)  it was overtaken by the United States and Germany, Nefiodow says.  <H5>  Doubling Every Six Years </H5>   Now it is the Japanese who are technologically and thus  economically ahead and will probably be forging ahead  politically as well because they have made the best use of the  causes of the reorganization process which the industrial  nations have been going through since the seventies, i.e.  information technology and its applications which is having an  increasingly rapid and widespread impact on all sectors of  society. In a world which doubles its knowledge every six years  it is no longer a question of more information but one of  administering information properly to quickly get at the  information one needs, Nefiodow says.    In Japan, this led to economic growth independent of energy  use while the largest German industries--automobiles, mechanical  engineering, and chemistry--are part of the now-exhausted growth  industries of the bygone, i.e. fourth Kondratieff cycle.  Siemens-Nixdorf alone is holding its own on the world growth  market of information technology in which the Japanese occupy a  good to very good position with 20 companies.  <H5>  Why We Are Behind </H5>   Why has Germany missed the connection to the fifth  Kondratieff cycle? Nefiodow thinks that an aversion to  technology is to blame and above all the social, cultural, and  societal customs and mannerisms which keep us from listening to  and motivating each other and to work together--which are the  major preconditions for an information society. Thus, the  Japanese with their group ethic oriented toward the common good  (for the company and its individual departments) were better  able to adapt to the success formulas of the fifth Kondratieff  cycle than the Europeans with their secularized, individualistic  ethic.    This means that German enterprises must restructure their  hierarchies and their hierarchical thinking and create teams  which work together to solve complicated problems; teams in  which information flows and can be applied quickly, in which  small-time despots do not lord it over their colleagues and do  not permit disputes to turn into power struggles which keep on  festering until retirement. Everyone, regardless of rank, should  be able to make a contribution in accordance with his/her  knowledge and aptitude. The fifth Kondratieff cycle no longer  calls for obedient, exchangeable workers but well-informed,  loyal, and creative team players capable of interacting openly  and cooperating with his colleagues.  <H5>  Sixth Cycle Is Coming </H5>   Nefiodow thinks Germany does not stand a chance of catching  up with Japan during the fifth Kondratieff cycle. The  government, he says, should stop subsidizing shipyards and coal  mines--the growth industries of the initial Kondratieff  cycles--out of the national debt and put money into the  development of future growth markets instead. If and when the  sixth Kondratieff cycle comes in the next millenium, it, too,  will be sustained by basic innovations independent of energy  use. Nefiodow believes that Germany should bet on this new  long-term cycle whose outlines are already becoming apparent.  The candidates of the sixth cycle are information, the  environment, and health.  <H5>  Well Prepared This Time Around </H5>   Germany is extremely well prepared for the development and  exploitation of these huge markets because of the high level of  expertise in metal processing, metrology, control engineering,  chemistry, software, and systems technology and above all  because of the high degree of acceptance by the population of  environmental, health amd information issues.</p>

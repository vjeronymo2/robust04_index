			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / How To Spend It: To make that party go, just leave it to Chance - A host with the most ANDREW Chance has given more parties than anybody else I know. If you have ever been to any of the grand corporate events in London, then you will probably have been to one organised by him, for he is the man behind Chance Entertainment. Among his accomplishments, he turned part of the Dorchester hotel in Park Lane into an English country garden for a Saudi Arabian wedding; converted a Kensington street into an old-fashioned walkway filled with stalls, jugglers and street cries for the Royal College of Art's 25th birthday celebrations; painted a dance floor to resemble the Yellow Brick Road for Elton John; and staged a state banquet for the sultan of Brunei. But if all you want is a juggler or fortune-teller to liven up a family dinner, a magician for a children's party, a Madonna lookalike to liven up the guest list or a butler to help hand round the drinks, he will provide those, too. Chance started out playing in a five-piece band that became a top attraction on the society ball and posh private party circuit. From there, he was placed perfectly to see what made a party go and what made it bomb. If you can afford him (a smallish private party - say, 80 for dinner with a disco afterwards - could be done for about Pounds 75 a head although that would include everything from flowers to tablecloths, food and wine), then you can rest assured that you are in the hands of a professional. If, however, that sort of budget is beyond your means, then here are some of his tips on how to add dash to your own celebrations. Getting the venue right is most important of all. It should be neither too big nor too small. 'Nothing,' he says, 'kills an atmosphere more than being screened off into one portion of a huge ballroom.' Low-voltage spotlighting is not expensive and can make all the difference to the atmosphere. At home, there is nothing to beat candlelight - everywhere. Service, he thinks, is much more important than the food. 'If people feel very well looked-after, then they feel they have had a good time. Food does not need to cost a fortune and a lot of fun can be had by, for instance, colour-matching food to your table. 'For instance,' he recalls, 'we once served a very successful all-pink meal: pink grapefruit and palma ham, followed by pink tagliatelle with salmon and tomato, radicchio salad, tomato bread, strawberry mousse, pink champagne, rose wines and port.' Those with big gardens or drives might like to line them with flaming torches which produce a lovely, flickering light. Giant flaming torches can be placed on either side of the doors for an even more dramatic effect. Start things off well by greeting guests with something like bellinis (champagne with fresh, crushed peaches), margheritas or champagne with Eau de Vie Framboise. Take trouble over the table settings. One of Chance's favourite colour combination at the moment is red tartan and dark moss green, but he finds clients also like burgundy and pink, acid lemon and white. He ties hand-rolled napkins with generous bows or sailors' knots using strips of silk, ribbon, taffeta, raffia or twine. Flower heads or tiny posies can also be tucked into them. At Christmas, he uses sticks of cinnamon for their spicy aroma (as well as holly and ivy, of course). He likes to fill the centre of the table with a mass of differently-sized candles, tall and thin, fat and short. Grouped close together and lit, the effect is magical. Fresh flower petals and pot pourri can be scattered around the arrangement. An edible table centre always looks wonderful. Try a mound of delicious fruits, possibly frosted with egg white and dusted with icing sugar or sprayed gold. Alternatively, you could pile up mixed nuts, almond, vanilla and nutty macaroons. Strawberries and grapes can be dipped in melted chocolate. Fun can be had with placement cards. Instead of writing out guests names, you could cut out from magazines or papers (or hire a caricaturist) to illustrate some aspect of them. The literary-minded can try writing appropriate limericks. If you can afford it, hiring a professional butler and/or serving staff helps to make guests feel they are being looked after beautifully. Again, if you can afford it and you are having a real celebration, think about hiring an entertainer: close-up magicians who go from table to table, a fortune-teller, caricaturist, graphologist or (for the more adventurous) a belly dancer, snake handler, sword swallower or contortionist. Some people prefer music and anything can be hired, from a classical pianist, guitarist or harpist to a duo, string or jazz trio. The music colleges often can be a good source of performers; many students are keen to get experience. Andrew Chance tel:071-376-5995</p>

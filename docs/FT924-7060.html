			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese watchmakers hit by sluggish demand JAPAN'S two leading watch-makers, Seiko and Casio, yesterday reported sharp falls in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year, mainly reflecting sluggish demand in Japan. Seiko's pre-tax profits fell by 26.4 per cent to Y1.6bn (Dollars 12.8m) in the six months to the end of September, compared with the first half of last year. Turnover was 9.8 per cent down at Y137.41bn and operating profits fell by 53.5 per cent to Y2.89bn. Seiko is maintaining its interim dividend at Y5, despite a 27 per cent decline in net income to Y678m. Seiko blamed the fall on a sharp decline in demand for expensive and even medium-priced watches as consumers switched to cheaper models. Sales of cheaper styles such as sports watches remained robust, the company said. Jewellery sales were depressed, apart from cheaper wedding and engagement rings. Export sales were hit by the appreciation of the yen and the slowdown in the US and European economies. The company warned that the economic outlook for the second half of the year remained uncertain as the stimulus from the government's emergency economic package might be offset by the weakness of the stock market and slower growth in export markets. Seiko said it expected to make pre-tax profits of about Y3.2bn for the year as a whole, down from Y3.6bn last year, on turnover of Y280bn, against Y298.74bn in 1991. Casio reported a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y8.58bn in the first half of the year, despite a 3.5 per cent increase in turnover to Y171.03bn, mainly due to a surge in sales of its small liquid crystal display TV sets. Casio also suffered a valuation loss of Y860m on its securities holdings. The company said exports to Europe, its main overseas market, had been badly hit both by the appreciation of the yen and markedly slower economic growth.</p>

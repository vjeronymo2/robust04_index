			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Retailers' global shopping spree: With domestic growth opportunities in decline, stores groups are expanding abroad Before the decade is out, the biggest company in the world by turnover may not be a carmaker, an oil company or a computer manufacturer; it could be a retailer. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest stores group, is forecast to increase sales from Dollars 67bn last year to Dollars 84bn (Pounds 53bn) this year and more than Dollars 100bn next year. This would put it among the world's top 10 companies - and if this growth rate continued, Wal-Mart could overtake industrial giants such as General Motors and Exxon to become the world's biggest company by the millennium. Much of this growth will come outside Wal-Mart's US base. In the past year, the company has acquired 100 stores in Canada, begun building 40 stores in Mexico and formed a joint venture in Hong Kong from which it will expand into China. It has also announced plans to move into Argentina and Brazil, and is thought to be planning to enter Singapore, Chile and Europe. Other retailers are following Wal-Mart in expanding internationally - evidence of the growing globalisation of the retail industry. Until recently, many stores groups were discouraged from expanding abroad by the potential pitfalls of appealing to different cultures and tastes. In a world of global manufacturers, there were few global retailers. Some retailers have had well-publicised problems with their international ventures. They include Dixons, the UK electrical stores group, with its acquisition of the US Silo chain; Marks and Spencer, which made a costly entry into the Canadian market; and France's Printemps, whose joint venture in Japan almost went bankrupt. The picture is changing, however. Retailers are showing a new appetite for international ventures, and the ability to carry them off. This opens up the prospect of rapid growth for those that succeed and harder times for weaker chains used to competing only against familiar, national rivals. 'If you were to list half a dozen key retailing issues for the 1990s, internationalisation would be near the top,' says Mr George Wallace, chief executive of the UK-based retail consultancy, Management Horizons. He adds that the publicity that has surrounded the problem cases has obscured the extent to which some retailers have successfully made their business more international since the 1980s. France's Promodes and Carrefour, Germany's Aldi and Tengelmann, Belgium's Delhaize, and Ahold of the Netherlands have increased the proportion of their turnover that comes from outside domestic markets through acquisitions and growth - to 70 per cent in the case of Delhaize. Last week, J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, made its second foray into the US, buying 50 per cent of voting shares in Giant Food, the Washington DC-based supermarket group. Sainsbury's latest acquisition, combined with its purchase in 1987 of Shaw's, the New England chain, makes the UK group the 11th largest grocer in the US. Other retailers have operations spread over so many countries that they can already be considered global. These include clothes retailer Benetton of Italy, Sweden's home furniture chain Ikea, Toys R Us of the US, UK clothes and food retailer Marks and Spencer, and fast food group McDonald's. Moreover, the pace of internationalisation by retailers is quickening. In a recently published report, retail research group Corporate Intelligence says European retailers made 610 cross-border moves in the first four years of the 1990s - compared with 611 cross-border deals in the whole of the 1980s. US retailers are also on the move, the group says. The number of US stores groups operating in Europe is 45 today, up from 15 in 1991. Retailers with international ambitions are also emerging from east Asia. Japanese groups such as Sogo, Takashimaya and Yaohan, which have spread across Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand, are now coming to the west. This wave of internationalisation has been prompted by a combination of 'push' and 'pull' factors, according to Mr Giles Elliott, a director of Schroders merchant bank, and Mr Michael Poynor, of strategic consultancy Coba, who have advised retailers on international expansion. The biggest 'push' factor, they say, is saturation of domestic markets. While there is room for expansion at home, retailers have no need to look abroad, but that option is fast disappearing. In the UK, for example, retail chains' share of the food retailing market jumped from 49 per cent in 1973 to 80 per cent by 1992, according to market research group AGB. A similar pattern can be seen in countries such as France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. With such levels of dominance at home, companies are moving into countries with less developed retail markets, or buying existing chains in developed markets. The so-called 'pull' factors include the falling barriers to entry into markets worldwide. The creation of a single European market of 320m consumers in 1992 allowed goods to be moved freely across pan-European distribution networks. It has made Europe a much more attractive destination for US - and Asian - retailers. Another 'pull' factor is that retailers' suppliers are becoming more international themselves. Manufacturers of consumer goods such as Unilever are restructuring manufacturing operations on a pan-European basis, and adopting international marketing campaigns. A symbol of this is the growing importance of internationally recognised brand names in consumer goods, electricals and consumer durables. These 'push' and 'pull' factors, combined with increased foreign travel by consumers and the spread of cross-border mass media such as satellite television, are creating what Mr Wallace of retail consultancy Management Horizons calls 'common denominators' in consumer tastes. Mr Alan Lambert, Marks and Spencer's divisional director for continental Europe, says that not only is there now a 'Euro-consumer' but also an 'international consumer' for its wares. 'Our best-selling products are the same in London, Madrid or Hong Kong.' However, local differences remain which retailers cannot neglect in international moves. Says Mr Wallace: '15 years ago, companies plonked a few shops down and hoped they would work. Now they take great care to analyse the local situation and local markets.' Some have found partnerships and joint ventures with local retailers the best way to expand abroad. For example, M&amp;S formed a joint venture with local retailer Cortefiel in Spain, which helped it to find sites, get to know the market, and deal with local authorities. Others such as Benetton, Body Shop and McDonald's have taken the franchising path. The retailer supplies the product, the name, a tried-and-tested store format and support systems, leaving local business people to run the stores. In saturated markets such as the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia, there is limited scope for winning market share through growth. The only retailers that can expect to do so are those that are highly innovative in at least one aspect of their business: store format, shopping environment, product quality or choice, customer service, or systems and distribution methods. For others, acquisition of existing groups is likely to be a better route. In emerging markets, acquisition targets are limited, but organic growth presents an exciting - if risky - opportunity. Accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand identifies 10 target markets for retailers, divided into the 'tough three', the 'torrid three' and the 'formidable four'. The 'tough three' - Italy, South Korea and Japan - are strong economies with large middle classes, but where local restrictions have limited the degree of concentration of retailing, and entry by foreign groups. With at least some of the entry barriers expected to ease over the next few years, these markets provide significant opportunities. The 'torrid three' - experiencing rapid if volatile economic growth but with an underdeveloped retail sector - are Mexico, Turkey and Argentina. These offer even more exciting growth prospects than the 'tough three', but with a moderate degree of economic risk. The greatest political and economic risks are presented by the 'formidable four' - Brazil, China, Russia and India - according to Coopers &amp; Lybrand. They have a poor retail infrastructure, but offer retailers the most exciting prospects, with rapidly growing middle classes hungry for consumer goods. Wal-Mart in Volgograd or Sainsbury in Shanghai may still be years away. But one of the world's biggest but most localised industries is at last coming to terms with the global marketplace.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill recovers to Pounds 3.8m surplus Steel Burrill Jones Group, the insurance and reinsurance group, yesterday returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.79m for the first half of 1994 compared with losses of Pounds 3.92m. Mr Christopher Burrill, finance director, said the turnround had been achieved through a restructuring of the business during the last year. He added that the group's trading profit of Pounds 4.39m, before loss on disposal of the group's north American subsidiary, was 25 per cent higher than the Pounds 3.52m last time. However, he admitted that 'the overall trading environment remains tough.' Turnover slipped 2 per cent to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 23.4m). In the London marine market, turnover dropped 13 per cent to Pounds 4.95m (Pounds 5.69m), while the non-marine business slid 7 per cent to Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 8.57m). However, there was an improvement in the retail broking and consultancy business where turnover rose by 2 per cent from Pounds 9.91m to Pounds 10.2m. Investment income declined by 34 per cent to Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 2.9m), with the company blaming lower interest rates 'which continued to work through on the group's liquid assets.' The interim dividend is maintained at 3p, payable from earnings per share of 4.66p (7.62p losses). As a result of the company's restructuring and reorganisation, which involved a charge of Pounds 4.39m last time, total expenses fell by 32 per cent to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 30.2m). Mr Burrill said that the benefits of the cost cutting were now being bolstered by the stability in the group's general business, with the non-marine business in particular encouraging. However, Mr Clive Richards, the chairman, struck a cautious note. 'It would be unwise in present market conditions to expect any early underlying increase in brokerage and fee income,' he said.</p>

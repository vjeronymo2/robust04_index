			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> COMMERCEBANCORP TO BUY BACK STOCKS WITH $1-MILLION FUND  </P> <P> Directors of CommerceBancorp, the holding company for CommerceBank in Newport  Beach, think their company's stock is undervalued. So they approved a plan to  spend up to $1 million to buy back the firm's common stock at $10.25 a share  and, thus, bolster the stock price.  </P> <P> If the company spends the whole amount, it would buy and retire 4.6% of the  company's common stock outstanding.  </P> <P> At the end of June, the company's book value -- a major indication of the  company's worth -- was $11.82 a share, and that amount is likely to go up once  profits are announced for the third quarter, ending Sept. 30.  </P> <P> But the stock was trading at only $10.25 a share Sept. 14 on the National  Market System of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation  stock exchange.  </P> <P> CommerceBank is the county's largest independent bank, with $322 million in  assets at the end of June.  </P></p>

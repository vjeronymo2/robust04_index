			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 7 (AFP) -- Hong Kong may lose  between 133 to 187 billion Hong Kong dollars (17 to 24 billion  US) in trade if the United States withdraws China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, the government warned  Monday. Hong Kong, China's main gateway for international  trade, would also lose between 19 to 26 billion Hong Kong  dollars (2.4 to 3.3 billion US) in income, while 54,000 to  75,000 people would lose their jobs, the trade department said  in its latest assessment. "A reduction of up to 77 billion Hong  Kong dollars (9.87 billion US) worth of re-export is double the  impact that we estimated in 1990," Christopher Jackson, deputy  director-general of trade, said. "This is largely the result of  the very rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of China-made  goods to the United States over the past few years," he said.    US President Bill Clinton has demanded improvements in  China's record on human rights, trade and arms sales, before  renewing its MFN status for another year. Renewal falls due in  June. Since Friday, China has detained eight dissidents in  defiance of US warnings that improvements in its human rights  record are a precondition to MFN renewal. The issue is likely  to top the agenda when US Secretary of State Warren Christopher  visits Beijing on Friday.    The withdrawal of China's MFN status would also have a  significant adverse effect on manufacturing investment ventures  and other production projects by Hong Kong and foreign companies  in China, Jackson said. "We have to step up our lobbying  activities in Washington," said Jackson in order to impress upon  members of the US administration and Congress the damage which  MFN withdrawal would do to Hong Kong and to American interests  in the region.</p>

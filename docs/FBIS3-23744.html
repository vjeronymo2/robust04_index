			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov under the rubric "Elections": "What </F> Jupiter May, the Bull May Not?"]    [Text] The process of elections to the bodies of  representative power of Russian Federation components has been  put in motion by presidential edicts since December of last  year. But the peak of the elections will occur in March. The  main political forces are actively preparing for them: Some  count on reinforcing the success achieved at the federal level,  others--on retribution for the loss.    Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov already anticipates  victory at the local level: "I have no doubt that leftist forces  will come into power if the elections are honest." The PRES  [Russian Party of Unity and Accord] emphasizes in yet another  statement: "The party's next step is to form bodies of authority  in Federation components." Russia's Choice will time the  creation of its new party to the March election campaign.    According to the Constitution, definition of the basic  principles of forming bodies of authority in Russian Federation  components is the subject of joint jurisdiction of the Russian  Federation and its components. But until a federal law is  adopted, the president has entrusted this business to  administration heads. The list of violations of voters' rights  that are taking place in the process is not limited to the  example of St. Petersburg, where by decision of the city's  mayor, 100,000 residents have been deprived of the right to  vote. It also includes liberties in "mapping" electoral  districts, and candidates' unequal access to the mass media;  requiring permission for a candidate to register instead of a  mere declaration of intent; the imposition of  one--majority-based--electoral system; and so on.    Mostly importantly, the prospect of turning the system of  representative organs from an intended counterbalance to the  executive branch into an appendix of it is coming through  increasingly clearly. There are countless instances of infusion  of various level staff members of administrations into kray,  oblast, and other assemblies. In Stavropol Kray, the head of  administration repealed the decision of the kray's inner council  on the 42-member composition of the duma; now the duma will have  only 25 members, of which 15 are heads of local administrations.  The Saratov Oblast Assembly promises to have the same  qualitative composition. In Tula, of 24 duma members, six may be  "appointed" by the head of the administration.    Last week the Russian State Duma took this issue to heart.  But the Duma attempt to interfere in the process that is well  underway became complicated by internal struggle in the chamber  itself. Sometimes it resembled an entertaining game of  intercepting the ball from the adversary, occasionally reaching  the point of pushing him outside the "playing field."    The question of local elections was put on the Duma agenda  at  the initiative of Oleg Mironov, a deputy from the Communist  Party and member of the Legislation Committee, which is headed  by the "Agrarian" Vladimir Isakov. The Communists and the  Agrarian Party factions prepared a draft Duma decree "On General  Principles of Organizing the System of Bodies of State Authority  and Local Self-Government." However, the Committees for  Federation Affairs and Local Self-Government Issues, headed by  PRES members Sergey Shapovalov and Anatoliy Sliva, immediately  countered it with their own joint draft. Isakov's committee  attempted to have itself included among the coauthors of this  second draft, but PRES-ites refused to accept him into their  company. On 8 February they organized a separate meeting and  invited to it representatives of the Central Electoral  Commission [CEC] and of the president's and government's sides.  The position of both the Duma politicians and representatives of  the executive branch revolved around the dilemma of whether to  treat the situation regarding local elections as a gross, fatal  violation (elections do not reveal the true expression of the  citizens' will) or as a deviation that can still be fixed? And,  accordingly, should elections be postponed until a federal law  is adopted, thus throwing doubt on the president's edicts, or  give the president and the Central Electoral Commission an  opportunity to make some corrections?    Yuriy Yakovlev, deputy from the Democratic Party of Russia  [DPR], expressing the extreme point of view, characterized the  processes at the local level as across-the-board "prohibition of  political activities" and urged not only that the elections be  postponed but also that those that have already taken place be  recognized as invalid. The initial draft of the Communists and  Agrarians, by the way, also assumed the suspension of elections  and a declaration that the president's edicts are "no longer in  force." The leaders of the DPR and LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia], Nikolay Travkin and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  also urged postponing the elections until the fall. The joint  draft of two committees--Shapovalov's and Sliva's--on the  contrary, recommended that the president take steps toward  eliminating violations of citizens' rights, and that the CEC,  the general procurator, and Russian Federation component  executive branches bring the components' legislation into accord  with the Constitution.    On Wednesday this issue was discussed at a plenary session  of  the Duma. Three documents had been put forward by then, and were  put to a vote; none passed.    It would probably be a simplification to see in the Duma's  clashes only a manifestation of the chronic confrontation  between democrats and conservatives. The same Yuriy Yakovlev  believes that in the question of local elections "all parties  have huddled together; the struggle is not between the  parties--it is a struggle of all parties against the  arbitrariness of the administration." This is close to the  truth. At a time when the "Communist-Agrarian" Speaker Ivan  Rybkin prefers not to aggravate the relationship with the  president and to follow the "planned course," Democrat Shakhray,  for instance, calls for moving the elections to June.    On the part of the executive structures, it was delicately  suggested that the Duma "not stick its head out." CEC Deputy  Chairman Aleksandr Ivanchenko promised the deputies that his  agency "will keep the electoral process under control." Not too  many in the Duma were elated over this, since Mr. Ryabov's  agency is treated here with great suspicion. Viktor Sheynis  believes that the CEC de facto acts as a "ministry of electoral  affairs," whose directives are accepted on the local level as a  guidance for action.    An original interpretation of the situation with the  elections and the Duma's approaches to it came from Nikolay  Medvedev, chief of the presidential administration's department  for work with the territories. First, he said frankly: "We  currently have to do everything we can to make at least one  branch of authority stable--namely, the executive." Second,  having characterized the Duma's interest in local elections as a  "contradiction between the bodies of state power of the Russian  Federation components and the State Duma," he seriously alarmed  Duma members.    It is obvious that the presidential side now has a chance to  pitch the Duma against the regions by interpreting its actions  on the issue of local elections as aimed simultaneously against  both the Kremlin and the "provincial generals." In this instance  the Duma is also being "squeezed from above" by the Federation  Council, which to a considerable extent consists of precisely  these "generals" and may veto a decision on suspension of  elections.    One can understand the provincial bosses, by the way. If it  was possible to fill half of one chamber with heads and  officials of various administrations, and elect deputy prime  ministers and ministers into the other, why should oblast and  kray "parliaments" not do the same? After all, the provinces  learn democracy and parliamentarism from Moscow--there is no  other source.</p>

According to Yeltsin his conversation with Ivan Rybkin  carried on the four-hour discussion the president had with  industrialists and entrepreneurs on Thursday concerning a  package of presidential decrees on economic reform which are  being prepared now.    Yeltsin stressed that the press misrepresented his statement  on the possible collapse of the economy on Thursday. "The  collapse may occur if we do not take steps to overcome the  crisis.

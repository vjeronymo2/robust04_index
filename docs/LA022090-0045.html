REPORTS PROFIT FOR 4TH QUARTER  </P> <P> Tandon Corp. said it earned $5.32 million in the fourth quarter of 1989,  rebounding from a year-earlier loss of $21.1 million.  </P> <P> The Moorpark maker of personal computers, most of which are sold in Europe,  said the improved results came on a 15% gain in sales, to $103.7 million from  $90.3 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Tandon said the latest earnings partly reflected increased sales of its more  expensive personal computers, which carried higher profit margins.  </P> <P> For all of 1989, however, Tandon lost $4.33 million compared with a loss of  $19.9 million the previous year. Its annual sales rose 22% to $377.9 million  from $309.4 million.  </P></p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fares pledge fails to dispel Tory unease A GOVERNMENT assurance that rail fares will not rise faster under its new proposals than under the present nationalised regime failed to dispel Tory backbench unease in the Commons yesterday. A succession of Conservative MPs expressed misgivings about the government's plans, as the Railways Bill received its second Commons reading with a majority of 33 (302 votes to 269). At least three Tories abstained after two of them - Sir John Stanley, MP for Tonbridge and Malling, and Mr Robert Adley, chairman of the cross-party transport committee and MP for Christchurch, - said publicly they would not support the government. Sir John said the withholding of a 'key' government document on fare control policy meant he was 'effectively asked to sign a blank cheque on my constituents' chequebooks'. The 'underlying pressure on fares for this privatisation are very firmly in the upward category,' he added. Mr Adley charged the government with 'breaking up a national railway system and creating a vacuum'. Expressions of Tory concern started during the opening speech by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. He repeatedly gave way to his backbench colleagues, including three former ministers. Mr Nigel Forman, MP for Carshalton &amp; Wallington, said his rail-travelling constituents would apply three tests to the bill: would it make the trains more reliable; would it improve the railway infrastructure; and would it deal with the problem of non-availability of drivers and guards. Mr David Howell, the former cabinet minister, and Mr Timothy Renton, former arts minister, similarly highlighted concerns felt by commuters in their constituencies of Guildford and Mid Sussex. Mr George Walden, Tory MP for Buckingham, said there was 'a particular scepticism' towards the government's plans for the railways among people 'not normally opposed to privatisation'. He added: 'They are saying: 'Anyone can run a line; what we need is someone to run the railway'.' Mr MacGregor said he did not see why privatisation should lead to reduced rail services and suggested the new regime would have 'less bureaucratic elements' than the present system. He pledged controls on railway operators' freedom to increase fares in some areas 'for example on London commuter services'. But he declined a Labour invitation to guarantee that national network rail cards for the elderly and for young people would continue. There was no statutory obligation on British Rail to do so, he said. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said it was 'not proven' that the changes proposed by the government were for the better. He added: 'A publicly owned system can provide a better rail service than a privately owned one.' Mr Prescott called for immediate implementation of government proposals to encourage a shift among freight users from road to rail.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THREE-POINTER FAILS, CHAPMAN FALLS  </P> <P> For the time it took a basketball to travel about 40 feet, Kevin Stafford  looked like a Chapman College hero Friday night.  </P> <P> Stafford was sure his three-point attempt with a second remaining was going in  and the game with UC Riverside was going into overtime.  </P> <P> "I knew that was going in," Stafford said. "When I let it go, I just felt it  was going."  </P> <P> But the shot hit the back of the rim and UC Riverside held on to win, 67-64, a  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game in front of a 1,600-fan homecoming  crowd at the Hutton Center.  </P> <P> With the victory, Riverside (19-7 and 9-4 in the CCAA) remained alone in second  place. Chapman, already eliminated from the four-team postseason tournament,  dropped to 11-15 and 3-10.  </P> <P> The Panthers, who trailed by 15 at halftime, put together a strong rally in the  second half and came as close as two missed three-point shots in the final six  seconds of sending the game into overtime.  </P> <P> Riverside's Mike Ritter, the conference's second-leading free-throw shooter at  85% entering the game, missed two front ends of one-and-ones in the final 30  seconds. The first miss set up a three-point basket by Chris Martin to cut  Riverside's lead to three; the second set up Stafford's near miss.  </P> <P> Chapman made two runs at the Highlanders. Rog Middleton, who scored 31 in his  conference high of the season, scored three consecutive baskets and Martin made  a three-point shot to cut the lead to three, 53-50, with 10 minutes, 23 seconds  remaining.  </P> <P> But Riverside quickly upped its lead to eight when Kevin Krause put in a  rebound and Ritter made a three-pointer.  </P> <P> Riverside led by six with 1:15 remaining when Chapman made its final run.  Middleton made two free throws, Andre Hill made a steal and a layup and Martin  hit a three-pointer after Ritter missed a free throw. Leading by one with 14  seconds remaining, Reggie Howard made two free throws to give Riverside the  final three-point lead.  </P> <P> Riverside took a 37-22 lead at the half on the strength of its three-point  shooting. The Highlanders made five of eight three-point attempts in the first  half and made 10 of 23 in the game.  </P> <P> Chris Ceballos, who opened the game with a three-pointer, scored 13 points to  lead the Highlanders at the half. He and Howard each finished with 16 points to  lead Riverside.  </P> <P> Frantz Reyes added 11 points and 14 rebounds for Chapman.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Chapman guard Von Shuler was suspended from the team for the final two games  "due to an attitude problem unacceptable to the basketball staff."  </P></p>

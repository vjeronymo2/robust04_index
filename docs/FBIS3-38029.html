One wishes that the president  would utter these words before the chiefs of his own press  service. The work of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA [NG] correspondents  has been constantly impeded throughout the recent year at all  events participated in by the president. In plain terms, they  are simply denied accreditation at these events; this was also  the case when the president addressed parliament. The  boilerplate explanation is -- no room. In the meantime, room is  always there for the press service's pet editions.    While Kostikov's and Krasikov's business is to choose their  own pets, NG is not pushing to be among them. But that this  policy is discriminatory toward NG is obvious to us. Many of  our journalists had been told without mincing words -- quit  NEZAVISIMAYA, and you'll get your accreditation. Kostikov, as  everybody could hear during the president's recent press  conference in the Kremlin, was not too fastidious in advising  the NG correspondent loud and clear and in public to leave the  newspaper. One would have thought he had specially prepared this  ad lib in advance for the presidential press conference, putting  aside all other affairs.    For us, these are usual difficulties we could and would be  able to overcome. In particular, NG was the only Russian  newspaper to have given in its 22 February issue a precise  account of the main points of the presidential message. The  behavior of the president's press service has not only  transcended the bounds of human decency, but also seriously  violates the professional rights of NG journalists granted us,  not by Kostikov and Krasikov, but by the law for which NG was  fighting when neither were at the president's side. We are  going to uphold these rights. For the time being, by making  public the facts we know. Further on, perhaps, also in the  Arbitration Information Court instituted by the Russian  Federation president.    But it hardly pays once again to play, via publications  close  to the court, the NG-small-circulation card. Or else we are  going to make public the real circulations of all favorite  dailies and weeklies of the press service.</p>

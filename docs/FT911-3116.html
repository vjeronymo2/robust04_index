			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Management: A Japanese view of competition - Last night's Stockton lecture at the LBS The quest for the secret of Japan's economic success has brought forth an avalanche of scholarly, and not so scholarly, books and articles over the past decade. As a genre it has been dominated by foreigners. It is salutary, therefore, to hear a Japanese academic of the stature of Professor Hajime Yamashina - until recently chairman of the department of precision engineering at Kyoto University and a man associated with two of Japan's leading business awards, the Production and Maintenance Award and the Deming Prize - putting so little emphasis on Japan's industrial success in terms of its financial system or industrial structure. Instead, Yamashina, in delivering his Stockton lecture at the London Business School last night, located Japan's industrial strength in companies' continuous redefinition of what it means to be a competitive manufacturer in the context of producing 'attractive products with attractive costs'; and, by seeing orginality in the ability to develop and make products as well as invent them. This orientation has had important consequences for the deployment of people throughout a manufacturing company, and the skills of those employed. As the charts below indicate, the deployment of engineers in Japan is greater in the design and developmental phases of manufacture than in the west, and is comparatively weaker at the stage of origination. Significantly, the stylised Japanese company employs fewer (but more qualified) operators than does its western counterpart. Yamashina said that, in the pursuit of competitive manufacturing, Japanese engineers in categories (d) and (e) have been concentrating in three areas: better quality control; higher value-added per person; and, shorter lead times. All are important, especially the latter. Product variety is now a given condition of competitive life and, 'there has been a growing need for products matching individual persons' circumstances, personality and tastes which eventually leads to customer orientation production, meaning a separate model for every customer'. The Japanese are great namers of trends and epochs. The current one is called 'constantly launching new product period', and it plays to their strengths by emphasising time-based competition and customer-oriented production.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> ON-JOB DRUG USE HIGH IN FLA.  </P> <P> Illicit drug use by workers apparently is more common in Florida than it is  nationwide, a survey released today by the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace  in Washington suggests.  </P> <P> One-third of the 501 full-time employees in Florida interviewed by the Gallup  Organization said they knew of drug use by co-workers on the job, compared with  only 24% of workers nationwide, the institute said.  </P> <P> "The magnitude of the workplace drug problem in Florida, as identified by the  workers themselves, is extremely troublesome," said the institute's executive  director, Mark A. de Bernardo.  </P> <P> Similarly, 45% of the Florida workers surveyed said they had seen or heard of  illicit drug use by fellow workers before or after work, compared with 31%  nationwide, the institute said.  </P></p>

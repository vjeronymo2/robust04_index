			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, today received Hamid Yusuf  Hammadi, Iraqi minister of culture and information and envoy of  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn.    Hammadi conveyed to the brother Presidential Council  chairman  a message from his brother President Saddam Husayn dealing with  the fraternal bilateral relations and issues of interest to our  Arab nation. The message also dealt with the suffering of the  sisterly Iraqi people as a result of the economic blockade  imposed on Iraq, which requires a pan-Arab position to mitigate  this hard human suffering of the Iraqi children, youths, and old  people due to the continued blockade, especially since Iraq has  stressed its commitment to all UN resolutions, led by Resolution  687.    The brother chairman expressed our Yemeni people's  solidarity  with the fraternal Iraqi people's suffering as a result of the  blockade. He asked the Iraqi culture and information ministers  to convey his greetings to his brother President Saddam Husayn  and his wishes of further progress and prosperity for the Iraqi  people.    The meeting was attended by Information Minister brother  Hasan Ahmad al-Lawzi and Dr. Muhsin Khalil, Iraqi ambassador to  our country.</p>

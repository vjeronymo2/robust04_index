			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farmers 'misled over set-aside' THE EUROPEAN Commission has misled member states and their farmers over the timing of new rules governing land to be taken out of production under the reformed common agricultural policy, UK farmers said yesterday. Commission proposals on fixed areas of land that can be left fallow for five years were due by the end of this month but failed to appear as expected on the agenda at yesterday's meeting of EC commissioners, said Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union. 'We are bitterly disappointed and frustrated at the lack of co-operation the UK has received from the commission,' he said in a letter of protest to Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister. Farmers urgently needed to know details of the new scheme so that they could plan their autumn crop planting, said Mr Naish, who accused the commission of having little or no interest in providing the legislation. 'The delays in sorting out this issue also make nonsense of any attempt on the part of farmers to manage the countryside and the land generally in an environmentally beneficial way,' he said. Farmers who left land fallow in the past five-year set-aside scheme, which is just ending, were also anxious to know whether they will continue to be paid to keep it all unplanted, he said. About 1,100 English farmers put 33,000 hectares into set-aside under the old programme. Last year's CAP reforms introduced direct payments to arable farmers as compensation for cuts in EC support prices, provided they set aside 15 per cent of their land on a rotating basis. But without the new rules, farmers may have to wait until the spring to sow, achieving lower yielding, less profitable crops, the NFU said. The union believes the proposals have become entangled in attempts by other member states to reduce the length of the six-year scheme for rotating set-aside. Meanwhile, Mrs Shephard yesterday announced a scheme to increase the environmental benefits of the land taken out of production. The minister said UK farmers would be able to apply for exemptions to the set-aside rules to spare wildlife. She also outlined a plan for offering farmers a series of options for managing non-rotational set-aside land in an environmentally friendly way.</p>

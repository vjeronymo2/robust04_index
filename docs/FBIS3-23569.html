Rudyuk of the SibVO </F> [Siberian Military District]: "The [Signal] Communications of an  Artillery Battalion"]    [Text] The specific nature of the combat tasks performed by  a battalion of towed artillery has a significant impact on  questions of organizing signal communications. I will consider  how they should be organized today in optimal fashion, in my  opinion, in order to provide for the reliable exchange of all  types of information for the command and control of fire  subunits in any situation.    The command and control of batteries and platoons in a  battalion, as a rule, is performed from tactical command posts  [KNPs] (forward, lateral and fire-control point) by means of the  issuance of oral combat orders, directives and commands. The  latter are transmitted by radio and wireline communications  channels, as well as with the aid of mobile and signals gear.    Combat command and control vehicles (MBU) are deployed at  all  PUs [command posts] of a subunit to perform the tasks of  communications: A 1V19 (battalion commander) at the adn  [artillery battalion] KNP, a 1V111 (chief of staff) at the PUOD  [battalion fire-control center], a 1V13 (battery commander) at  the abatr [artillery battery] KNP, and a 1V110 (senior battery  officer) at the abatr PUO [fire-control post]. An MBU has a  radio set, cable, telephone gear, switchboards,  data-transmission gear, devices for the automatic entry of data  into a communications channel, a computer and other gear. The  command and control squad of an adn also has a portable R-159  and several kilometers of P-274M, as well as more than ten  TA-57s.    Experience shows that reliable communications can be  organized with the higher commander and staff, as well as with  all elements of the order of battle of the battalion, using this  hardware.  <H5>  Wireline Communications </H5>   Wireline communications are widely employed in an artillery  battalion in defense, at a staging area, and at firing positions  occupied for the support of combined-arms subunits in an attack  by them on the enemy's forward line.    It should be kept in mind that wireline communications  cannot  be fully planned in the battalion and battery in the course of  an offensive battle. In certain cases when the pace of the  offensive is slowed and the firing positions (OP) are moved less  often (when penetrating deeply echeloned enemy defenses, at  lines of resistance, when repelling enemy counterstrikes and  counterattacks, when forcing water obstacles etc.). However,  this type of communications must also be established in the  course of battle. It is important to recall here that wireline  communications should be operating under any conditions between  the fire-control post of an adn and the firing positions of an  abatr.    We will investigate one variation for the organization of  such communications, proceeding from the assumption that the  battalion has been attached to a motorized-rifle battalion that  is operating in defense (see Fig. 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-21A> Fig. 1. Diagram of wireline </FIG>            Communications employing wireline methods are established  from the battalion KNP with the regimental KP [command post]  (PAG [regimental artillery group]), the PUOD (adn staff), the  KNPs of the batteries, the PNP [forward observation posts] (or  BNP [lateral observation posts]) of the adn, and with the  combined-arms subunit to which the battalion is attached or  which it is supporting with fire.    The communications with the commander and staff of the  motorized-rifle regiment [msp], in accordance with the  communications instructions of the msp staff, are planned and  executed by the manpower and equipment of the regiment on a  P-274M cable link. It runs from the US [communications center]  of the msp KP to the US of the adn KNP.    In certain cases, when the staff (PUOD) of the battalion is  at the firing positions and when time and means are available, a  separate link can be run from the US of the higher commander to  the US of the fire-control post of the adn. A cable line laid  from the US of the msp KP to the msb KNP is used as an  alternative link of wireline communications with the higher  commander or staff.    Wireline communications are organized with elements of the  battalion order of battle, with the heaquarters (PUOD) and PNP  (BNP) of the adn and the KNP of the abatr by directive of the  battalion staff, using the manpower and equipment of the command  and control platoon on links run from the adn KNP US to the  subunits by P-274M cable.    If the line running to one of the batteries is damaged, the  communications of the battalion commander with the subunit  commander may be supported on the link between the msb KNP and  the msr KNP that is maintained by the given abatr.    The fire-control point of the adn also maintains  communications with the firing positions of the batteries on  links deployed using P-274M cable. This provides an opportunity  for the battalion chief of staff [NSh] to have communications  with the senior commanders of the abatr that are at the firing  positions. The NSh can also maintain contact with the battery  commanders through the adn KNP US or the firing batteries. The  latter is accomplished using P-193M telephone switchboards in  the MBU of the abatr senior commanders.    The telephone gear of the adn commander must be linked  through the P-193M switchboard with the communications lines  running to the KNP of the batteries, which are in turn hooked up  to the cable running to the firing positions, for centralized  fire control.    The transmission of commands directly to the abatr OP  [firing  positions] is possible here as well, by P-274M running between  the KNP and the PUO of the battalion, and on lines going from  the fire-control post to the POP [forward defensive positions]  of the batteries. The circular connection of all operators  (senior commanders of the abatr) with the battalion commander at  the switchboard is executed for this purpose in the MBU of the  chief of staff.    The cable line from the KNP of a nearby battery with its  firing position can also be used as a supplementary  communications channel between the commander and the NSh of the  adn.    Wireline communications are established in a battery from  its  KNP with the firing positions, the fire-control post and the  forward (or lateral) observation posts along P-274M cable links  using the manpower and resources of the headquarters platoon of  the battery. The communications line with the main OP is best  laid with a back-up. P-274M must also be run to the parking  location of the abatr prime movers from the POP.    Wireline communications are provided by separate link using  the manpower and resources of the artillerymen with the  commanders of combined-arms subunits when their KNPs are placed  apart.  <H5>  Radio Communications </H5>   Recall that radio in the battalion remains the principal,  and  in some cases, the sole means of command and control of subunits  of the adn and their fire and maneuver. The radio net is the  most acceptable form of communications therein.    Radio communications are employed in all types of battle.  The  stations, however, usually operate for receiving, and are turned  on to transmit only when the wirelines are damaged. The  operation of the radio without restrictions is permitted only  with the start of preparation fire.    When a battalion moves from a staging area to an OP, as well  as when on the move in anticipation of battle, radio  communications may be used to transmit brief signals on the  passing of traffic-control lines or entry into a meeting  engagement.    One variation for the organization of a radio net in an adn  composed in a manner that would permit stable fire control in  the course of a battle without substantial changes in  configuration is presented in Fig. 2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-010C-23A>           Fig. 2. Diagram of radio </FIG>          The commander and staff of the battalion maintain  communications with the commander and staff of the msp by  shortwave radio net by periodically turning on their own sets in  the net. Since the PUs of combined-arms and artillery commanders  most often coincide, the radio net of the former may be used as  alternative links.    The communications of the adn commander with the regimental  artillery chief is organized by USW radio net. The sets of the  PUOD, commanders and senior commanders of the batteries, as well  as the commanders of the mortar batteries of the regimental  motorized-rifle battalions, can be included in it when there is  centralized fire control.    The adn commander, in a case where the battalion is part of  a  regimental artillery group, establishes communications with the  PAG commander by including the R-123M in the radio net of the  PAG commander. The adn NSh may also be tuned into it.    The adn commander controls the battery commanders on his own  USW radio net. It also includes the stations of the chief of  staff (PUOD), battalion PNP (BNP) and abatr POP. The adn  commander organizes communications with the chief of staff on a  SW radio link.    The chief of staff of an adn with an MBU provides for the  direct fire control of the batteries. A special radio net for  automatic data transmission using R-111 and R-123M sets is  created for the transmission of data being processed with the  aid of computer gear. Automatic receivers are established at the  battery positions, and which receive commands from the MBU of  the NSh, where there is a device for the automatic entry of  information into the communications line.    Communications with the artillery reconnaissance elements of  the motorized-rifle division are accomplished by including the  USW-band sets of the commander, NSh and PNP (BNP) of the  battalion and the battery commanders in the corresponding radio  net.    Data from division artillery reconnaissance may be received  right from a mobile command reconnaissance post or from a  helicopter. A portable R-159 must be mounted in an Mi-2kr in the  latter case.    The command and control of adn reconnaissance elements is  accomplished from the PRP-3 on the radio net of the battalion,  using USW sets that are placed at the adn PNP or the abatr PNP  (BNP).    The communications of the commander of the motorized-rifle  battalion and the artillery battalion are maintained by means of  personal interchange when they have a joint KNP, or by the entry  of the adn commander's R-123 into the radio net of the  motorized-rifle battalion commander, as well as through an  artillery officer who is at the motorized-rifle battalion KNP  with his own set.    The adn and tank subunits commanders interact using the  radio  net of the attached tanks. It may be composed of the sets of the  commanders of the motorized-rifle battalion, the combat tanks  and the battalion commander.    Data on the weather situation is received on the radio nets  of the senior commanders, by means of the inclusion in them of  an R-326 and R-123M receiver at the PUOD and an R-123M at the  battalion KNP.    A USW radio net of the abatr commander is organized to  control the fire of the battery and receive data from the PNP  (BNP) on the results of the firing and fire correction by order  of the adn staff. It is composed of the sets of the battery  commander and the senior battery officer and the PNP (BNP). The  radio net may in certain cases also include the gun commanders.    The senior battery officer maintains contact with the  commanders of the firing platoons on his USW radio net using  R-147 radios. The R-147P receivers of the gun commanders are  part of that as well.    The discussions of the abatr commander and the  motorized-rifle battalion are conducted, as a rule, through  personal interchange. When they are not located together, radio  communications between them are established through the  commander of the headquarters platoon, who is located with a  radio with the commander of the motorized-rifle company.    The interaction of the commanders of the batteries and the  tank subunit are best planned to be on the radio net of the  abatr commander, through the PNP that is with the tank battle  formations.    Radio communications for interaction between the adn battery  commanders are best accomplished on the radio net of the  battalion commander, with the permission of the net control  station or by mutual entry into the corresponding nets.    Warning signals of enemy use of weapons of mass destruction  are received on the radio net of the senior officer.  Notification of subordinate subunits is provided on all  operating radio nets and wireline communications lines, and is  above all precedence.    The command and control of the adn is performed by radio in  the course of battle. The battalion commander moves in the MBU,  the gear of which allows him to have solid communications with  the senior commander and the battery commanders. He maintains  communications with the higher headquarters, the commanders of  the adn and abatr, the PNP (BNP) of the adn and the commander of  the tank subunit attached to the motorized-rifle battalion.    The battery commander's MBU moves at some distance from the  motorized-rifle battalion commander's KNP in the dynamic of  battle, and is in constant contact with him. If a company  commander is moving in the foot formation, the abatr commander  or headquarters platoon commander follows close behind him with  the radio.    I would note in conclusion that this article shows  variations  for radio and wireline communications, the utilization of which  gives good results in practice in the command and control of an  artillery battalion and the maintenance of continuous  interaction with motorized-rifle and other subunits.</p>

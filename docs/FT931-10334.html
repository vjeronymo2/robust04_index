			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Labour MEP dons motorcycle leathers in protest at EC plans to limit motorcycle power A Labour MEP yesterday donned motorcycle leathers and climbed on to a British-built Triumph Daytona to protest at EC plans to limit motorcycle power. Today Mr Roger Barton, MEP for Sheffield, will wear his leathers when he addresses the European parliament in Strasbourg about the issue. The parliament is to debate the resumed first reading of a bill which would restrict motorcycles to no more than 100 brake horsepower. This would outlaw some of the more powerful motorcycles manufactured by Triumph in the UK and other makers elsewhere. Triumph said five of its eight models would be affected by the limits. The British Motorcyclists Federation deplored the proposed legislation.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / All is not yet lost: Russia's democrats can still prevail if their nerve does not fail 'It would be quite wrong,' said Mr Quentin Davies, MP for Stamford and Spalding, 'for me as a foreign observ-er to express a preference for one of your political parties over another. But of course we are all delighted that you have chosen the democratic path.' 'Yes,' said the lady who was counting ballot papers at the Palace of Culture in Serpukhov, about 100km south-east of Moscow, in the small hours of Monday morning. 'But I wonder for how long.' This is a question many people inside and outside Russia have been asking themselves, since Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian nationalist leader who has the nerve to call himself 'Liberal Democrat', emerged as the main winner of Sunday's election. His will be the largest single party in Russia's first freely elected parliament, and the combined forces of nationalism and communism will outnumber those firmly committed to democracy. The stakes are raised by President Boris Yeltsin's success in winning approval for a constitution that vests sweeping powers in the presidency. Those powers will be dangerous enough, some think, in Mr Yeltsin's hands. How much more so if Mr Zhirinovsky were to emerge as his successor. Ominously, perhaps, Mr Zhirinovsky was the one opposition leader who supported the new constitution. But all is not yet lost. Everything depends on how Mr Yeltsin uses his new powers. He modelled them deliberately on those of the French president, though in some respects they go further. Most notably, he now has the power to 'issue decrees and executive orders' which 'shall be binding throughout the territory of the Russian Federation'. The only limitation is that they may not contravene the constitution 'or federal laws'. The constitutional court - composed of 19 judges appointed by the upper house of parliament - has power to declare presidential decrees unconstitutional. But it is only if they have the effect of introducing martial law or a state of emergency that they require direct approval of the upper house. The constitution follows the French rather than the American model in that the government, though appointed by the president, must enjoy the confidence of the lower house of parliament, called the State Duma. The prime minister can only take office with the Duma's consent. The government, once formed, serves at the president's pleasure, but if the Duma expresses its lack of confidence in the government twice in three months, the president must either dismiss the government or dissolve the Duma. Mr Yeltsin has given himself the right to dissolve the Duma and call new elections if it rejects his candidate for prime minister three times. The right to dissolve after a no-confidence vote does not apply in the first year of a new parliament's life. In theory this gives the newly elected parliamentary majority the power to force Mr Yeltsin to 'cohabit' (a la francaise) for at least a year with a government that enjoys its support. In practice, this will not happen, because there will not be a parliamentary majority in that sense. Mr Zhirinovsky is far from being in a position comparable to that of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader who was able to impose his own choice of prime minister on President Francois Mitterrand after winning this year's parliamentary election in France. Even in the half of the Duma elected by proportional representation, using party lists, Mr Zhirinovsky's party will be far short of an overall majority. And things will be much less clear in the other half, elected by a single ballot in single-member constituencies. In Britain, there are long-established and highly organised parties with a firm base of public support, giving a strong advantage to the leading one or two parties and accentuating polarisation. But in Russia parties are new and hardly organised. In Sunday's election most constituencies had many candidates, very few of whom advertised a party affiliation on the ballot paper. Voters appear to have been either unaware of such affiliations or uninfluenced by them. So even if Mr Zhirinovsky forms a close alliance with the communists and agrarians (which is by no means guaranteed) he will still not command a majority unless he can win over a broad swathe of deputies who have no strong party affiliation, mandated mainly to defend local interests. It may be weeks before the balance of power within the Duma becomes clear, and even then it will be a shifting one. The skills required for analysing this phase of Russian democracy will be those of historians like Sir Lewis Namier, who analysed 18th-century British politics in terms of the local, family and business connections of individual MPs, or Sir Ronald Syme, who by collating a variety of sources laboriously identified the bit players in the turmoil of the late Roman republic. In a contest for the votes of independent or semi-independent members, a strong executive is at a great advantage, even without a strong party base of its own, as monarchs from George III to Bill Clinton could attest. Let us hope Mr Yeltsin makes good use of the powers he has given himself - or rather that the people have now given him. Let us hope he resists the temptation to try to co-opt Mr Zhirinovsky, or to compete with him in 'Great Russian' chauvinism. We should know, by now, that fascism only thrives on appeasement. Mr Zhirinovsky remains eminently beatable, if democratic Russians do not lose their nerve.</p>

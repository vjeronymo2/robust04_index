The polarizer performance is based on the earlier established  phenomenon of polarization anisotropy of optical characteristic  of the dielectric layer with corrugated edges. Unlike the  existing thin-film dielectric polarizers, the proposed optical  element is a relatively simple construction intended for  operation under a normal angle of incidence. For experimental  testing of the proposed device, samples of dielectric polarizer  were constructed and its function is described. The experiments  demonstrated a feasibility of developing thin-film polarization  element based on a dielectric layer with corrugated edges.  Compared to the polarization structures made of metal, the  technology of constructing corrugated structures on the surface  of a dielectric is more simple, while polarization efficiency of  the tested samples was sufficient for application with some  optoelectronic devices.

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the first part of a news conference by  Presidential Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu today, he  assessed Czech President Vaclav Havel's visit to Bucharest,  which he described as a special event in the development of  international relations between the two countries.    Ambassador Traian Chebeleu went on to read a statement on  the  so-called invitation to Romania's president from representatives  of certain political parties, in which the president is to be  summoned before Parliament.    After reasserting that the president will appear before  Parliament as often as necessary but solely according to  procedures stipulated by the Constitution, Chebeleu said that  President Ion Iliescu had initiated actions for new  consultations with the leaders of the parliamentary parties.  Currently, presidential advisers are engaged in negotiations  with the leaders of certain political parties to establish a  convenient time for the resumption of the head of state's talks  with the parties.    The spokesman also told the journalists that Romanian  Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu, who is currently on a visit to  Poland, conveyed a message from President Ion Iliescu to Polish  President Lech Walesa. In this the head of the Romanian state  accepts an invitation to visit Poland, noting that there is a  good chance that this visit will take place this year.    To a journalist's question, Chebeleu replied that the  parliamentary strike initiated by the Democratic Convention of  Romania represents the members of Parliament's abandonment of  their responsibilities toward the electorate and a  generalization of a method that has already been used by some  parliamentary groups, namely to leave the hall when certain laws  are being passed.    Referring to the events in Cluj-Napoca, generated by the  archaeological diggings in the area where the statue of Matthias  Corvinus is situated, the spokesman said that President Iliescu  had suggested to the Cluj mayor that he organize discussions  with all the local factors, thus avoiding any escalation of  tension in the region, which is viewed by Chebeleu as being  artificial. He also added that lately an excessive  politicization of certain gestures and actions could be observed  and expressed his belief that the situation in Cluj could be  solved calmly, after listening to all the sides involved in the  dispute, our correspondents informed us.</p>

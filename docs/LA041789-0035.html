			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : BAD COMPANY AGES WELL AT THE AMPHITHEATRE  </P> <P> Can it really be 15 years since Bad Company came on the scene as a pleasingly  straightforward alternative to the distended boogie and progressive rock of the  day?  </P> <P> A lot has changed in the meantime, but the newest version of the English band  -- which headlined the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday -- fills pretty much  the same function in today's bloated hard-rock world -- only there's lots more  competition now. While such "classics" as "Ready for Love" and "Can't Get  Enough" have aged well (as have guitarist Mick Ralphs and drummer Simon Kirke,  the sole holdovers from the original band), the new material is hardly a match  for, say, Metallica on the metal side or the Smithereens on the rock 'n' roll  side. And singer Brian Howe won't make anyone forget original frontman Paul  Rodgers.  </P> <P> Still, Friday's unadorned and unpretentious presentation deserves credit for  its lack of cliche and bombast, if nothing else.  </P> <P> Opening act Vixen, on the other hand, appeared ready and willing to embrace any  and every bombastic hard-rock cliche. But these four hair-extension poster  girls are not able, and their set was at best a cartoon imitation of bad rock.  Can it really be 13 years since the Runaways came on the scene . . . ?

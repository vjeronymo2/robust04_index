			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / CBI finds gloom across Europe LONDON is not the only European capital suffering from a recession, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday after carrying out the first pan-European business survey published since sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism on September 16. The CBI's survey covered 2,500 companies in five European capitals and found that confidence is low in London, Brussels, Paris and Rome, with gloom spread across sectors. Activity in retailing, hotels, tourism and construction has fallen, the CBI said. According to the CBI, business optimism among manufacturers in the four cities is also down. All are looking to reduce further their manufacturing labour forces over the next six months. Madrid is the only centre expecting a more encouraging outlook. The survey suggests that manufacturing output and investment levels in London may rise marginally, while production elsewhere is expected to decline. Optimism in the banking and finance sector was generally lower in the face of the continuing uncertainty surrounding the currency and equity markets. Construction appears to be the universal blackspot, with none of the cities suggesting that an improvement in activity is likely. Optimism and investment programmes remain at low levels. The retail sector appears universally gloomy, with cons-umer confidence low and staffing levels falling. London retailers say they are still affected by consumer preference for paying off debt, while the downturn in the French economy is now hitting retail spending in Paris.

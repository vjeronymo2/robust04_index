			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko under general heading: </F> "Resignation of `Father of Reforms' Could Cause Government  Crisis"]    [Excerpts] Ye. Gaydar's unexpected statement on the  impossibility of staying in the new cabinet is the first  manifestation of party affiliation in Russia's top organs of  power and not a manifestation of the individual participation of  particular politicians in them. [passage omitted]    Two options remain for the development of events around the  creation of a new government team. Since Ye. Gaydar intends to  demonstrate firmness in his decision (advisers close to him are  absolutely convinced of this and they rule out the possibility  of political bluffing in this case) a government crisis could  most likely arise, to overcome which the president will either  have to embark on the risky step of proposing something like the  outline for a coalition government or give the premier carte  blanche.    In the latter version it seems possible that a  pro-Chernomyrdin will be created in the government and in  parliament which, representatives of "Russia's Choice" believe,  could be formed by the factions of the Communists, Agrarian  Union members, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the  Democratic Party of Russia, and "Yabloko." The government team  thus constituted would inevitably pursue a pro-inflationist  policy and there would be no place in it for representatives of  "Russia's Choice." It is not out of the question that with this  development of events other Gaydar supporters would leave the  government (A. Chubays remains in his post only by virtue of a  party decision -- he cannot be responsible for the government's  economic policy).    After the president's meeting with the premier it became  known that the "Russia's Choice" bloc does not intend to declare  that it is in opposition to the government.</p>

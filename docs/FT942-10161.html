			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Israeli deal given to Bell team An investment consortium led by Bell South of the US yesterday won Israel's public tender to provide nationwide cellular phone services. It was in competition with Motorola-Bezek, the Israel state-owned telephone company, which had a monopoly till now. The entry of a second player in the cellular phone market is part of the Israeli government's ongoing liberalisation programme intended to encourage efficiency and competition. The communications ministry said the Bell South Consortium - which includes the Safra family of bankers, Discount Investments of Israel, and Israel Aircraft Industries - had won the tender because it had submitted the lowest price customers will pay for services. Israel expects the consortium to invest Dollars 85m (Pounds 57m) to Dollars 130m (Pounds 87m) in the expanding cellular phone market and to start operating within 15 months. The country has 60,000 cellular phone users and the communications ministry predicts that the national market will increase to 350,000 within 10 years. Motorola-Bezek's licence, which had been due to expire this year, was extended until 2010 after the state-owned group had agreed to lose its monopoly.</p>

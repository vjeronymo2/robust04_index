			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KCSN RADIO STRENGTHENS ROOTS PROGRAMMING WITH 'MOUNTAIN STAGE'  </P> <P> In a move that will bolster its standing as an outlet for seminal American  music, radio station KCSN-FM (88.5) has added the nationally syndicated show  "Mountain Stage" to its lineup.  </P> <P> The weekly program, produced by West Virginia Public Radio, made its local  debut Thursday night and will continue each Thursday from 9 to 11 p.m.  </P> <P> The name "Mountain Stage" is something of a misnomer. While Appalachian music  is offered occasionally, the fare is much more diverse. Next week's show, for  example, features New Orleans pianist and singer Dr. John and three performers  from the jazz world: guitarist Larry Coryell, pianist Bob Thompson and singer  Ann Baker.  </P> <P> The show records the performers before a live audience and has gained a sizable  following, airing on 135 stations nationwide.  </P> <P> "I don't like to call us eclectic because that doesn't tell you anything," said  host and music director Larry Groce. "We bring you the roots of the world's  music in live performance. We do things that are very primitive and things that  are very avant-garde."  </P> <P> Producer Andy Ridenour said "Mountain Stage" has been in national distribution  since July, 1986, and first aired in West Virginia in 1984. The show's $275,000  annual budget is funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, National Public  Radio, and corporate and private donations.  </P> <P> Guests in the coming weeks will include contemporary folk artist Jesse  Winchester, Los Angeles singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams, blues man Clarence  (Gatemouth) Brown and a Celtic band, Metamora.  </P> <P> "It's diverse. We'll have someone who's not well-known, or someone who hasn't  performed in 10 years, or someone who is well-known," said Groce, a singer  himself who had a hit with "Junk Food Junkie" in 1976. "If it's someone famous,  we don't insist on them doing their hits. When Maria Muldaur was on, we didn't  mention 'Midnight at the Oasis' and she thanked us."  </P> <P> Groce performs on each show, as does a house band and a two-woman group called  the Twister Sisters. The regulars accompany guests and do a few numbers of  their own.  </P> <P> "We're the one thread that runs through all the shows, but the show doesn't  depend on us the way that 'Prairie Home Companion' depended on Garrison  Keillor," Groce said.  </P> <P> The program is staged at a 76-year-old vaudeville hall in Charleston, W.Va.  Eight stations in the state present it live. Others, including KCSN, air a  digitally recorded version.  </P> <P> "It's the best of these kind of shows and we're glad to be carrying it," said  Mark Humphrey, KCSN music director. "What we're trying to do that's exciting is  to have performance shows on in the evening at 9 o'clock."  </P> <P> The lineup at the station, which originates at Cal State Northridge, includes:  Mondays, "Pot Luck," a folk music show produced by Seattle Public Radio;  Tuesdays, "Barn Dance," broadcast live by KCSN from the Palomino nightclub in  North Hollywood; Thursdays, "Mountain Stage," and Fridays, "Lonesome Pine  Special," produced by WPLN-FM in Nashville, Tenn.  </P> <P> The station is looking for a performance show to air Wednesday nights, Humphrey  said.  </P> <P> "Mountain Stage" may prove a valuable addition to KCSN. The station adopted a  "traditional country" format in June, 1987, prompting many on campus to say the  programming was too narrow. At the same time, financial problems forced the  station to drop its membership in National Public Radio and to lose the  prestigious news shows "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered."  </P> <P> "Mountain Stage" may help, as it presents a broad range of music while staying  within the notion of roots programming, and it has a national reputation.  </P> <P> The show is carried by six other stations in California, the closest of them in  San Bernardino. KCSN pays a nominal fee to air it: "just a few hundred dollars,  enough to pay for the legal paper work," Ridenour said.  </P></p>

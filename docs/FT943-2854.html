			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe concedes defeat in battle of German Bobl Liffe has conceded defeat in one of its battles with Germany's Deutsche Terminborse for dominance of the market in German interest rate products. The London-based exchange has delisted its future on medium-term German government bonds, known as the Bobl future, which was not traded in July and traded only 53 contracts in the whole of August. The exchange sent a notice to members on September 7. The DTB has a rival Bobl contract, which recorded an average daily volume of 16,800 contracts in August. However, Liffe still dominates trading in the two most important German interest rate futures, the bund (long-term bond) and Euromark (short-term interest rate) contracts. It currently trades around 115,000 bund contracts and 93,000 Euromark contracts daily, representing market shares of 70 per cent and 98 per cent respectively. According to a Liffe official, the Bobl contract appealed more to domestic than international investors. However, the DTB said its success in the Bobl contract was largely due to having launched the contract first, in October 1991. Liffe did not introduce its Bobl contract until January 1993, by which time the DTB contract was already established. Competition between the two exchanges is unlikely to abate, however, as the Deutsche Terminborse is seeking to attract more international participants through its linkage with France's Matif.</p>

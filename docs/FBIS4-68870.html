			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armen Baghdasaryan: "Armenia-Karabakh: Who Is </F> Helping Whom?"    [Text] As is known, the Armenian authorities have blamed  the grave socioeconomic conditions in the republic mainly on the  blockade and the Karabakh war. Indeed it is a known fact that  war is "an expensive habit" and that any country at war,  declared or undeclared, cannot seriously think about developing  its economy. Naturally, the opposition occasionally tries to  refute the government's explanations that the Karabakh war is  the cause of the disastrous state of the economy. Thus, during  the discussion of the republic's budget in the parliament,  deputy Garnik Isagulyan came forth with a sensational statement  that Karabakh sent to 2 and 1/2 more aid to Armenia during 1993  than the other way around. During a conversation with us, Mr  Isagulyan reaffirmed his charges and said that he can prove what  he has alleged point by point. According to Mr Isagulyan the  value of goods sent from Karabakh to Armenia totals 140 billion  rubles, while those that went from Armenia to Karabakh are  valued at 64 billion rubles.    In other words, war-weary Karabakh, one third of whose  territory is completely devastated and whose entire male  population is in military service, has a positive trade balance  with Armenia. No one doubts that in peacetime Karabakh's exports  can exceed its imports. It is also true that all of Karabakh's  industrial enterprises, without exception, are operating today  unlike those in Armenia. Even so, the charge that is being made  in today's war conditions is unusual, to say the least,  especially since Mr Isagulyan says that his figures include the  military assistance that Armenia provides to Karabakh. However,  as unusual as the charge may be, none of the government  representatives have denied the deputy's allegations, perhaps  because a full refutation of the charges would require the  discussion of undesirable topics, such as Armenia's  nonhumanitarian assistance or the goods that have been taken  from the so-called occupied territories.    Leonard Petrosyan, the head of Armenia's State  Administration  for Special Programs, described Mr Isagulyan's charges as  ludicrous and pointed out that Armenia pays for 90 percent of  Nagorno-Karabakh's budget deficit with interest-free loans. He  said: "Armenia sends nearly 9,200 tonnes of flour each year to  Karabakh, in addition to everything else. I cannot imagine what  Karabakh can send back in return. It is true that one can bring  from Karabakh, say, firewood, but that is so little that it may  constitute perhaps 1 percent of what we send them. As for the  alcoholic beverages that are brought from Karabakh, they cannot  be consumed in Armenia because of their low quality. Armenia  simply plays a transit role for those goods. Today, a minimum of  15 trucks depart for Karabakh each day without counting the  vehicles that carry specific cargoes. All these trucks return to  Armenia empty because there is nothing to bring back. It is true  that they may bring, for example, scrap metal, and work is under  way in that direction." According to Mr Petrosyan, Karabakh has  been exporting its surplus electricity to Armenia in recent  months, but that it is improper to talk about that even  qualitatively because 90 percent of the goods that are vitally  needed in Karabakh are imported in one way or another from  Armenia. He added: "Obviously, Karabakh would like to help  Armenia economically, but it is superfluous to talk about that  in the present conditions."    We were also able to contact Zhirayr Poghosyan, the deputy  prime minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, who, it turned  out, was aware of Mr Isagulyan's allegations. Mr Poghosyan said:  "The first point is that Mr Isagulyan is far removed from  economic structures and economics in general. It is true that  Nagorno-Karabakh has very significant means, and in peaceful  conditions we may be able to support ourselves and Armenia with  our own products alone. But today most of Karabakh's land is not  cultivated for known reasons. Karabakh imports from Armenia  virtually everything. It exports, basically, shoes, marble  slabs, electrical equipment, and so forth. In terms of numbers,  one can say that Karabakh imports four times as much as it  exports."    In general it is difficult to express any final opinion on  this subject, because after all it is a matter of approach. One  can take into account, for example, the fact that the equipment  taken by Karabakh forces from the enemy is worth millions of  dollars. One can take into account the fact that valuable  equipment is occasionally ferried into Armenia over the  Stepanakert-Goris road. After all, not everything in the  relationship between Armenia and Karabakh can be counted with  money. It is hard to think that a Karabakh at war can help  Armenia economically. On the other hand, it appears that  Karabakh's role in Armenia's economic difficulties is quite  exaggerated.</p>

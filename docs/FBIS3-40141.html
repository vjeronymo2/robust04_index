			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Zhongying (1728 0122 5391): Analysis and </F> Projection by Concerned Department on Labor Migration: Causes  Leading to "Labor Tide" Continue To Be of Concern"]    [Text] The concerned department, in a recent analysis and  projection of the labor migration, concluded that the momentum  of migrant laborers traveling during the Spring Festival period  will not slacken and that causes leading to the "labor tide"  still exist.    According to statistics of ten major labor exporting  provinces (prefectures) such as Sichuan and Henan, the number of  laborers emigrating under organized labor department sponsorship  reached some 6 million persons; but based on sampling studies  and statistical analyses, the number of laborers emigrating  individually or without organized labor department sponsorship  is estimated to be more than twice that number, i.e. some 12  million persons; thus combining both categories, the total  amounts to 18 million persons. When the number of laborers  migrating from other provinces (prefectures) were included, the  number of migrant laborers in China totals about 20 million.    In recent years, the direction of labor migration has  concentrated on those areas considered to be the economic "hot  spots." Based on preliminary analyses, the Zhujiang River Delta  area has taken in about 6.5 million laborers from other  provinces, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area approximately 1.2  million, the two municipalities of Beijing-Tianjin approximately  1.5 million and the Fujian coastal areas about 800,000 persons;  therefore, the number of migrant laborers from other provinces  who were drawn to the various economic hot-spot areas totalled  some 10 million persons, accounting for about one-half of total  migrant laborers.    The projection is that during the Spring Festival period,  the  momentum of labor migration will not slacken, and causes which  lead to the "labor tide" remain operative:    First, the several highly productive areas of the Zhujiang  River Delta, the Changjiang River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin  area are still China's economic "hot spots," and when the  economies in other areas are cooling down, the former's  attraction to laborers from other provinces not only has not  diminished but has become stronger.    Second, it will take some time before the effect of measures  taken to stabilize the rural areas and strengthen agriculture  will be felt, and the peasants, influenced by the signals and  relatively better economic benefits of the market, are therefore  turning toward the economically developed areas, and this is a  trend that cannot be reversed in the short term.    Third, in the interior area, some provinces have already  used  the exporting of surplus laborers as a "core enterprise" to  invigorate the rural economy and help realize the goal of  becoming "moderately well- off." That being the case, the number  of surplus laborers exported is likely to increase.    This situation is certainly going to create even greater  pressure on the already over-burdened railway transportation  system. At present, the Guangdong Province's Labor and Railway  Departments are making projections based on studies that in the  period before and after next year's Spring Festival, more than 2  million persons will be returning home in other provinces to  visit relatives, an increase of 70 percent over this year's. If  a 15 percent factor were added (to account for the new migrant  laborers who will follow the old-timers when they return to  Guangdong), then during the 30 days spanning the Spring  Festival, the rail system will have to handle an estimated 4.3  million travelers (2 million on the outbound and 2.3 million  inbound).    Besides, even if only 50 percent of seasonal laborers were  to  travel home from the Beijing-Tianjin, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou  and Fujian Province coastal areas, their total number will be  some 2 million persons, and their roundtrip travels will add  some 4 million travelers to the rail system.    Adding migrant laborers from other areas, it is estimated  that in the period before and after the 1994 Spring Festival, a  total of more than 10 million migrant laborers will be traveling  on the road.</p>

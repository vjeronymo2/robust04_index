			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: New York All eyes in the US fixed-income market will be on the Federal Reserve and the meeting of its Open Market Committee tomorrow, which is expected further to tighten monetary policy. Wall Street is expecting an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate, taking it from 3 to 3.5 per cent, and an increase of either 25 or 50 basis points in the Fed funds rate, taking it to 4 or 4.25 per cent. Positive inflation statistics late last week increased the possibility of a 25-point increase. The Labor Department reported on Friday that consumer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in April. This gave some support to the market, with the yield on the 30-year benchmark issue ending the day at 7.49 per cent, down from 7.56 on Thursday. However, the Fed will be looking for signs of inflation months down the road, and in weighing its decision will have the advantage of April's industrial production statistics, due this morning. Output has risen for 10 months in succession and March saw a strong 0.5 per cent increase. The median forecast for April is a rise of 0.3 per cent. Other figures which may affect the market include April housing starts, due on Tuesday and expected to show an annual rate of 1.45m; and the trade balance, out on Thursday, which is expected to narrow to Dollars 8.3bn in March from Dollars 9.7bn in February.</p>

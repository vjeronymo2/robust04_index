			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Knauf buys Danish plasterboard group KNAUF, the privately-owned German group, has strengthened its presence in the European plasterboard market with the acquisition of Danogips of Denmark, Europe's fourth biggest producer. The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, consolidates Knauf's position as the industry's second biggest player, behind BPB Industries of the UK and ahead of Lafarge Coppee of France. It also continues the rapid restructuring of the European plasterboard industry, which will now be dominated by these three companies. Danogips, which employs 600 people, has two plasterboard plants in Denmark and one in Sweden. It also makes specialist interior finishing products, and had total turnover last year of more than DKr600m (Dollars 97.9m). The deal gives Knauf its first manufacturing facilities in Scandinavia.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           NRI TOKYO BOND INDEX  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             PERFORMANCE INDEX                                        Average December 1983 = 100                     yield   Last   12 wks   26 wks                               2/1/92     (%)    week     ago      ago Overall                       168.91    5.69   168.22  163.40   155.82 Government Bonds              167.92    5.49   167.07  161.59   153.35 Municipal Bonds               170.63    6.04   170.00  165.76   157.65 Govt.- guaranteed Bonds        172.73    6.07   172.30  168.40   160.53 Bank Debentures               164.54    5.54   163.87  159.75   152.94 Corporate Bonds               170.91    6.48   170.69  164.45   159.31 Yen-denom.

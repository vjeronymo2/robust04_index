			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev: "Test of Strength for </F> Moscow-Washington Relations Seems To Have Been Conducted at  Kozyrev-Christopher Meeting, Which Did Not, However, Produce Any  Sensational News"]    [Text] Vladivostok and Moscow--Perhaps the most important  thing about the Vladivostok meeting of Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is  the very fact that meeting took place. For notwithstanding  Moscow's and Washington's assertions to the contrary, their  relations have recently begun to cool somewhat. The talks in the  Far East were intended above all to give the sides an  opportunity to explain their positions.    Andrey Kozyrev has compared the relationship between Russia  and the United States to a marriage: "The honeymoon is over."  And this is indeed the case. But problems that they didn't think  about before, not even believing they existed, remain and have  made themselves known. The first one is Russia's special opinion  on air strikes in Bosnia. The events that followed--Vitaliy  Churkin's successful talks, Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin's  appeal, the dispatch of Russian troops to Sarajevo, in short,  all the factors that proved the Russian policy's effectiveness  and consequently Russia's diplomatic success--were hardly  something the Americans liked very much. Then came the series of  mutual disclosures of Russian and Western intelligence agents  and ex-President Richard Nixon's conduct in Moscow, conduct that  offended Yeltsin. In this way, minor frictions accumulated into  an array of problems that simply had to be discussed.    Nevertheless, it is a good thing that the sides have a  marriage contract--the Moscow Declaration, which the Russian and  U.S. presidents signed at the conclusion of Bill Clinton's visit  to Russia. The Russian and American foreign ministers used that  declaration as the basis for their discussion of the entire  agenda of Russian-American and international problems. That  documents sets forth the principle that relations between Russia  and the United States are to be given the character of a mature  and equal partnership. And in Vladivostok Andrey Kozyrev  emphasized the equality of the sides, with no junior or senior  partners, leaders and led, superpowers and regional countries.    Of course, as major countries that in fact play a most  crucial role in the world arena, the U.S. and the Russian  Federation do have disagreements that the sides are trying to  solve in different ways. Nevertheless, as Warren Christopher  said, "we are bound by partnership." One condition of that  partnership is constant consultations between the sides, and an  agreement that such consultations will be held was reached in  Vladivostok.    As an example of that equal partnership, Andrey Kozyrev  cited  an agreement reached in Vladivostok that Russian experts will  take part in efforts to draw up a program on the problem of  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies and  on cooperation in the field of technologies, dubbing it a "new  COCOM." In the first stage, Russian specialists will begin  producing a draft in conjunction with the Americans, a draft  that will not be based on anyone's unilateral proposal.  Christopher, elaborating on that idea, stressed that "for the  most part we are working together," although "depending on the  issue, partnership can manifest itself in various forms."    True, Christopher gave a somewhat strange answer to a  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent's question at a press  conference at the conclusion of the Vladivostok meeting, saying  that the spy problem had not been discussed at all at the  meeting. It is strange because, for one thing, before leaving  for Vladivostok Kozyrev said that "spy passions" will be a focus  of the talks, along with other glitches, among which he included  the scandal-ridden Nixon visit. Second, both foreign ministers  said that Russian-American relations "had been subjected to  serious tests." One of those tests--at any rate, one visible to  the naked eye--is the series of disclosures that began with the  Aldrich Ames affair.    The cooling in relations between Moscow and Washington that  both are dismissing at the official level was manifested  primarily in the reciprocal disclosures of intelligence agents.  Christopher and Kozyrev say that resolving this situation lies  outside their competence. One can agree with this when the issue  is one of agents' working failures. But when the scandal is blow  up to all but international proportions, statements by the  foreign ministers could play a positive role. For the resolution  of military conflicts cannot be left to the sole competence of  defense ministers.    More serious issues that Kozyrev and Christopher discussed  had to do with international problems, not bilateral matters.  Kozyrev briefed his colleague on his recent trip to Tunis and  Tel-Aviv, telling him that both sides--the PLO and Israel--had  shown a readiness to continue talks. As for Bosnia, deputy  foreign ministers Vitaly Churkin and Chuck Redman will continue  to discuss that problem. Christopher reported that he had asked  Kozyrev to use his influence with the Serbs to persuade them to  join the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia as a possible way to  reach a peaceful resolution.    The Russian minister said he was fully satisfied with the  position taken by our American partners on transforming the G-7  into the G-8. Russia's joining the Seven could take place at the  next G-7 summit meeting in Naples in July of this year. In  addition, Kozyrev told Christopher about Russia's special role  in the ex-Soviet republics, and he said that the secretary of  state had understood that idea correctly. They also discussed  the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries,  human rights, the Partnership for Peace program, and a number of  other problems.    As had been expected, the meeting did not produce any  sensational news. But it had to be held. One gets the feeling  that the sides got up from the negotiating table breathing a  sigh of relief: No dispute arose, although that could have  easily happened, and the sides gave each other vitally needed,  frank explanations of their positions. In general, until the  next time disagreements arise--and this will happen at some  point, for not all of the current disagreements were  resolved--one can apparently take the view that the Russian-U.S.  partnership is withstanding its test of strength for now.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan] </F>   [Text] Inefficient state enterprises will be closed down or  declared bankrupt despite a 250 billion yuan (HK$223 billion)  fund earmarked for technological developments by the Chinese  Government, according to a senior government official. State  Economic and Trade Commission vice-director Xu Penghang recently  revealed that the Government had allocated 250 billion yuan this  year to help enterprises upgrade their production technology.    However, priority would be given to existing market leaders,  which would receive up to 70 per cent of the allocation. The  standard of the firms' present management and production would  be the prime indicators in selecting the enterprises, Mr Xu  said. Unlike previously, Mr Xu said some of the cash would be  made available to joint-venture and township enterprises.    Reviewing the developments between 1990 and 1993 -- the  first  three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan -- Mr Xu said the state  had spent 467.9 billion yuan on technological improvements.  About 60 per cent of this was used to increase variety and  improve product quality. But Mr Xu said much of the cash had  been wasted on fixed-asset investments, and the portion actually  used for technology improvements had declined over the years.    Some enterprises were preoccupied with expanding their  business and neglected the importance of product quality, the  vice-director said. He worried that if such a trend was not  reversed, the demand for Chinese products would decrease.    Mr Xu said the actual growth in productivity in China was  very slow, despite rapid industrial expansion. Although China  had overtaken both Japan and the United States in the production  of many industrial products, China lagged far behind in terms of  sales volumes when compared with Japan and the U.S. because of  the low value-addition of Chinese products, he said.    Beijing sources said the senior echelon hoped the allocation  of more money for technological improvements would help the  state industry narrow the gap with its Western counterparts.</p>

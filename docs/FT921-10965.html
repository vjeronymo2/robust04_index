			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / US 'double standards' under fire: George Graham weighs US asylum policy as Haitians are sent home A US COAST Guard cutter landed in Haiti yesterday bearing the first of thousands of Haitian refugees to be shipped back to their island home after failing in their bid for asylum. The repatriation began after the US government won court approval for its action, after a 10-week judicial struggle reached the Supreme Court in Washington. But the policy faced immediate criticism from human rights advocates as well as from Mrs Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Mrs Ogata said continuing reports of human rights abuses and violence committed by security organisations in Haiti were a cause for great concern, and pleaded with the US to delay the repatriation. For the time being, at least, the administration is repatriating only volunteers who have lost hope of winning entry to the US after being interned for weeks at the US naval base of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. But Brigadier-General George Walls, in command of the internment camp, said he was ready to use force if necessary to complete the operation. The US argues that the Haitian refugees - of whom more than 14,000 have been picked up by the Coast Guard as they attempted the sea crossing to Florida - are fleeing only poverty, not political repression. Officials claim that there is no evidence that refugees face persecution when they return to Haiti. 'The bulk of them are in fact economic refugees, and for that reason, can be returned to Haiti without fear of their lives,' said Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, this weekend. By keeping the refugees at Guantanamo, the administration has been able to deal with them more summarily than if they had set foot on US soil. However, since the Immigration and Naturalisation Service set up processing facilities at the naval base, 3,400 Haitians have been found likely to qualify for asylum, far more than had been expected. Human rights organisations, however, say there is substantial evidence of persecution by Haiti's police, and that the level of violence has increased in the four months since a military coup ousted the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have criticised US policy as racist, noting that lighter-skinned Cubans are routinely granted political refugee status. Politicians from Florida, which could be expected to bear the brunt of the wave of Haitian immigration, as well as some leaders of the Cuban exile community, have joined in the condemnation of US policy. While the US is certainly open to charges of applying a double standard, it may be more on the grounds of political hue than of skin colour. 'There is a double standard between communist and non-communist countries that lingers,' says Dr Charles Keely, Herzberg professor of international migration at Georgetown University. 'The second double standard is that the US sees things differently in its own hemisphere; it doesn't want to become the Thailand of the western hemisphere,' he adds. The US has, in fact, firmly condemned the Haitian coup leaders as a military dictatorship. Nevertheless, the US has for years been much more tolerant of abuses by right-wing dictators such as as Haiti's Papa Doc Duvalier than left-wing dictators such as Cuba's Fidel Castro. The difference in policy towards Haitian and Cuban refugees today conjures up shades of Franklin D. Roosevelt's dictum about Nicaragua's first Somoza dictator: 'He may be a son of a bitch, but at least he's our son of a bitch'. The US's greatest problem is that it does not, in fact, have any ready strategy for reversing the Haitian coup. The trade embargo which it has enforced, in concert with the Organisation of American States (OAS), has had its fiercest impact on the Haitian poor and may, if anything, have accelerated the outflow of refugees. Military action might work, but officials fear that it would inevitably resemble the 19-year occupation that followed President Woodrow Wilson's decision to send the Marines to the impoverished island in 1915, not the rapid in-and-out campaign that overthrew General Manuel Noriega in Panama in 1989. Underlying the US determination to turn back refugees is the fear that a more welcoming policy would only stimulate an unmanageable flood, like the Mariel boatlift from Cuba. 'The world works on a fiction that policy decisions are based on humanitarian grounds. In essence, refugee decisions are political decisions, and no amount of legislation will make that different,' concludes Professor Keely.</p>

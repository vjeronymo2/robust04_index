			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (2): First months are critical - Andrew Hill measures the progress of the EC's new VAT system THE EUROPEAN Community has a new barrier-free internal market, a new system for monitoring value added tax on cross-border transactions, and new minium rates of excise and VAT. So far, the EC does not have a whole new set of problems - but Brussels officials are ready for complaints and difficulties should they arise. The new VAT system, which came into force at midnight on New Year's Eve, allowed member states to lift internal border controls on goods and sweep away some 60m administrative documents filled in by companies every year under the old system. But proof that the new system works will not come until the spring, when data on cross-border transactions start to flow into national tax authorities via the EC's specially established computer system. The European Commission has accepted that there will be confusion in the early months of the new barrier-free internal market. Indeed, senior Brussels officials have urged national authorities to be lenient with companies which accidentally break the rules in the first half of 1993. But Mrs Christiane Scrivener, who retained her responsibility for fiscal matters in the December reshuffle of European commissioners, has already made it clear that there will be no quarter for governments which are sluggish about adopting the relevant legislation. Inevitably the new system has come in for criticism. Companies, some of which admit they left preparations for the single market to the last moment, have been irritated by what they consider an unnecessary new bureaucracy for handling VAT transactions. Some member states have been slow to issue VAT codes to businesses, and others have not moved quickly enough to bring rates into line with legally-binding guidelines agreed last year. In the specific area of excise duties, there are worries that a failure to reduce the gap between high-excise countries like Denmark and low-taxers like Spain will lead to 'bootlegging' of cheap cigarettes across the Community. Over the next two years - the limit of the current Commission's term in office if the Maastricht treaty is approved - Mrs Scrivener will be preoccupied by making these new systems work. Late last year she rushed through directives aimed at simplifying the new approach so it would not unduly penalise companies involved in 'triangular trade', and she is eager to maintain pressure on member states to bring their excise duties more into line. But Mrs Scrivener must also bear in mind the EC's broad commitment to introduce a 'definitive' VAT system by January 1, 1997. At the moment, only individuals benefit from the most logical indirect tax system - paying VAT on goods where they are bought, at the local rate. The introduction of this 'origin' system and the abolition of travellers' allowances for tax-paid items has encouraged a mini-boom in cross-border shopping. The revenue at stake in such small-scale cross-border business was very small, although consumer groups hope a small increase in intra-EC bargain-hunting will have a disproportionate effect on prices in domestic markets. Such is the sensitivity of national treasuries, however, that even for individuals there are exceptions to the 'origin' VAT rule for some items, such as cars and mail-order goods. More importantly, member states are not yet prepared to make the sacrifices needed to introduce the same system for cross-border commercial transactions. That is the aim for 1997, but it will involve a great deal of preparatory work. For example, some sort of central 'clearing house' would have to be set up for all EC cross-border transactions, to ensure that national treasuries do not lose out. Senior Commission tax officials reckon work will have to start on such a system before the end of 1993. For the time being, however, Mrs Scrivener's advisers are reluctant to add to companies' worries about the existing situation by beginning to talk about a 'definitive' system. They even reject the tag 'provisional' for the system which came into force on January 1. 'We will start our reflections (on a definitive system) next year, but we don't want to mix the two things,' says one. Advocates of a definitive system worry that even if companies decide they want to move on to the simpler system, governments will try to hang on to the transitional VAT regime, unless they are put under intense political pressure by Brussels. 'Certain governments will say that it isn't in their own interests (to move to a definitive system),' says one Commission official. In the meantime, Brussels officials are likely to work on the technical aspects of a definitive system so that when the time comes to make a political commitment, the groundwork will already have been laid. Mrs Scrivener's other priorities are in the even more sensitive area of direct taxation. Advisers suggest she will press for member states to approve outstanding directives aimed at eliminating double taxation for companies with subsidiaries in other member states, held up in the council at the end of last year. 'It's indispensable that these texts are adopted,' says one official. The Commission may also take another look at the vexed question of harmonising savings taxes, without putting EC savers at a disadvantage compared with those depositing their savings from outside the Community. A harmonisation proposal tabled in 1989 was resisted by member states. Finally, the Commission is keeping a sharp eye on member states' double taxation pacts with non-EC countries. Mrs Scrivener warned last year, when outlining the Commission's position on the Ruding report on corporate taxation, that Brussels was studying the effect of recent tax treaties - in particular between certain member states and the US. She warned that such treaties could discriminate against EC companies setting up in other EC states. Advisers confirm that they are now working out how to end such discrimination - either by introducing new EC-wide legislation, or possibly by taking a test case to the European Court of Justice.  ---------------------------------------------------       PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES IN THE EC (%)  --------------------------------------------------- Country             Threshold       Maximum  --------------------------------------------------- Belgium             25              55 Denmark             52.8            68 France              19              57 Germany             19.7            53 Greece              18              40 Ireland             29              48 Italy               10              50 Luxembourg          10              52 Netherlands         13              60 Portugal            15              40 Spain               25              56 United Kingdom      20              40  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

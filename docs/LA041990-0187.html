			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LOW POWER: Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network, which operates KTBN-TV  Channel 40, is one of the largest owners of low-power television stations in  the nation (A1). Last year, Trinity added nearly one new outlet a week to its  total of more than 100. But at least half a dozen attempts by various other  groups to build such "mini-stations" in Orange County have failed, including at  least one in Santa Ana by the National Black Media Coalition.

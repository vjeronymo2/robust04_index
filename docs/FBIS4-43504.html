			<p>BFN     [Text] The French Foreign Ministry has denied the report in  the 17 June issue of the Brussels daily LE SOIR, which hints  that two members of the French armed forces were involved in the  attack in which the president of Rwanda was killed. The French  Foreign Ministry describes this as a ridiculous allegation,  recalling that previous unfounded rumors have circulated  implicating foreign countries.    In Kigali the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], the rebel  movement of the minority Tutsi ethnic group, has just seized  control of the Sainte Famille Church. It was held by the  government forces and Hutu militias until now.</p>

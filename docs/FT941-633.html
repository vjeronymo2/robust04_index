			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Baronsmead venture capital trust flotation Baronsmead, the venture capital group, is launching a venture capital investment trust based on an existing Pounds 12.75m portfolio of cash and unquoted investments held by Baronsmead Development Capital Partners. The fund was started in 1988 as MIM Development Capital Partners. Baronsmead acquired control of the managers, Invesco Ventures, in May 1993. The new trust, Baronsmead Investment Trust, will continue to invest mainly in established UK unquoted companies involved in management buy-outs or buy-ins. The trust will have an initial life of 10 years. The assets are to be transferred from the partnership to the new trust in exchange for 12.75m ordinary shares at 100p, and 1.91m warrants, exercisable at 100p between 1997 and 2001. Dealings in both are expected to start on March 31.</p>

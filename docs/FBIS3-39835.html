			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Philippe Bernard: "More Foreign Workers in 1992"] </F> txt}[Text] An increase in the immigration of workers; a decrease  in family reunifications; and a less rapid increase in the  number of "mixed" marriages: These are the principal changes  noted by the Directorate of Populations and Migrations of the  Social Affairs Ministry [DPM] in its annual report for the years  1991 and 1992, which it made public on Monday 31 January.    Several indicators of the immigration of non-Europeans were  in decline even before the Pasqua laws of 1993 took effect,  according to the DPM's annual report. The report states that  135,372 foreign nationals became permanent residents of France  in 1992 compared to 123,413 who did so in 1991 (up 10.9  percent). Of this number, approximately 100,000 were natives of  countries outside the European Union (representing a decrease of  5 percent from the figure for 1992) while 35,000 were Europeans  (representing a very sharp increase of 100 percent, for  statistical reasons associated with the unrestricted movement of  Spaniards and Portuguese).    In similar fashion, the principal immigration flows--family  reunifications (down 8.3 percent) and the granting of political  refugee status (down 30 percent), both of which are subject to  the provisions of the Pasqua laws--decreased sharply in 1992.  Family reunifications--which peaked in 1990 with the arrival of  approximately 37,000 women and children--dropped to 32,665 in  1992. The spectacular decline in the number of new refugees is  explained by the fact that since 1990 the number of requests for  asylum has decreased and the requests are being processed more  rapidly. More foreign nationals, however, were acquiring the  status of wage earner between 1991 and 1992, with 18,487  non-Europeans being admitted compared to 17,056 the previous  year (up 8.4 percent, which rises to 65 percent if you count  only Europeans). This development is explained largely by  changed circumstances. In the case of the Spaniards and  Portuguese, it resulted from the registration of individual  cases not previously declared. The increase in the number of  non-EC nationals, on the other hand, reflects the regularization  of the status of applicants for asylum whose applications had  previously been rejected.  <H5>  Less Rapid Increase in the Number of "Mixed" Marriages </H5>   A complete analysis of the immigration flows should take  account not only of the arrivals but also of the departures. The  French statistical apparatus is deficient with respect to  departures, because it records only the forced  departures--expulsions, and escorted (or "assisted," i.e.,  subsidized) returns to the border--without providing the  slightest indication of the numerous spontaneous departures.  With respect to the forced departures--which the present  interior minister has promised to double--the DPM report points  out that the number of escorted returns actually carried out has  remained stable (8,638 in 1991 compared to 9,160 in 1987). The  program of "assisted" departures that was resumed in 1991 has  been only minimally effective, inasmuch as it aided only 1,212  foreign nationals in 1992.    The ultimate "way out" of foreign national status is the  acquisition of French nationality. A total of 95,300 foreign  nationals became French citizens in 1992 either by  naturalization (39,346), by marriage or declaration of one's  parents (32,249), or by informal acquisition of citizenship at  age 18 (23,700) (the latter two methods were abolished by the  Pasqua-Mehaignerie law of 22 July 1993). The DPM report confirms  the increasing proportion of Africans--and especially of emigres  from the Maghreb--among these new French citizens. It also  confirms the increase in the number of "mixed" marriages, which  accounted for approximately 12 percent of the total number of  marriages contracted in France in 1991. This increase--which is  one of the "thermometers" used to measure the integration of  foreign populations--is, however, slowing down after two years  of very strong growth.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>   1.

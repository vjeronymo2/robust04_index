			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320): "China </F> Maintains Good Order in Labor-Reform Centers, Improves Quality  of Reeducation Through Labor"]    [Text] During a recent interview, Justice Ministry  Spokesman Jia Jingping told this reporter that good order had  been kept in reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor  centers in China, with the escape rate of prisoners and  detainees undergoing re-education through labor remaining at the  lowest level.    Justice Ministry statistics show that last year 1,244,000  prisoners were kept in prisons or reform-through-labor camps in  the country. In the same year, 247,000 prisoners had their  sentences reduced, 33,000 prisoners were released on parole, and  34,000 were released on bail for medical treatment, all because  they had shown repentance or had done deeds of merit during  their terms of imprisonment. A total of 301,000 prisoners were  released on the completion of their terms of imprisonment last  year.    Jia Jingping said: Reform-through-labor organs throughout  the country have always adhered to the principle of integration  of penalty and reform, with reform as the primary goal, and they  have further strengthened surveillance, management, and reform  of prisoners; tried hard to improve the quality of their work to  reform prisoners; helped prisoners make a fresh start; and thus  made contributions to preserving social stability.    He revealed that last year was yet another to witness  stability in prisons and reform-through-labor camps across the  country, with the case occurrence rate lowered to the lowest  level since 1984. The prisoner escape rate is 1.4 per thousand,  still at a relatively low level, compared with past records.    Asked about conditions in re-education-through-labor  centers,  Jia Jingping said re-education-through-labor organizations in  the country have further stepped up their efforts to educate and  help personnel undergoing the re-education-through-labor  process. Stability has been retained in  re-education-through-labor camps, with the escape rate remaining  at the lowest level, as compared with past records.    By the end of 1993, detainees kept in  re-education-through-labor camps across the country totaled  153,000, an increase of 16.1 percent over 1992. These detainees  included 3,800 women detained for prostitution, accounting for  47.5 percent of the females detained in  reeducation-through-labor camps. A total of 11,800 people were  detained for drug addiction, making up 7.7 percent of all the  detainees. In the same year, a total of 75,900 were released  from re-education-through-labor camps following the completion  of their terms of detention, while 55,800 detainees had their  re-education-through-labor periods shortened because of good  behavior in camps.</p>

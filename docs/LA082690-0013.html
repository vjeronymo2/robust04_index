			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND, "SEVEN TURNS," EPIC.: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Two decades, two funerals and far more than seven twists and turns in the road  separate the Allman Brothers from their peak.  </P> <P> Yet two lingering qualities from the old days allow them to continue with  dignity intact and rehash avoided. Those are Gregg Allman's way with a soulful  blues vocal, and guitarist Dickey Betts' ability to shape an instrumental  excursion into a work of dramatic architecture. Not a brilliant album, but one  that's solid and welcome. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

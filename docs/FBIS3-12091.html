			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Ramon Vega, commander in chief of the  Chilean Air Force [FACh], has reaffirmed that the FACh is facing  space challenges and called upon politicians to clearly define  defense policies that will take these new objectives into  account.    Vega made these remarks during a speech he delivered on 21  March at El Bosque Air Base to mark the FACh's 64th anniversary.    The ceremony was presided over by President Eduardo Frei  Ruiz-Tagle and attended by Interior Minister German Correa,  Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, acting Senate President  Ricardo Nunez, Army Commander Augusto Pinochet Ugarte,  Carabineros Director Rodolfo Stange, and Vice Admiral Jorge  Patricio Arancibia, chief of the National Defense Staff.    Also attending the ceremony were four defense ministers from  friendly countries who had been invited by the FACh to attend  Fidae '94 [International Aerospace Fair]. They are: Oscar  Camilion (Argentina), Army General Victor Malca Villanueva  (Peru), Daniel Hugo Martinez (Uruguay), and Hugo Estigarribia  (Paraguay).    Those defense ministers met on 21 March with their Chilean  counterpart at the Diego Portales building.    Commanding officers from the air forces of Argentina,  Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,  China, France, Russia, and Venezuela also were present at El  Bosque Air Base. They are all attending Fidae '94 too.    In his 25-minute speech, Gen. Vega stated that the sphere of  action and influence of a modern air force must be in keeping  with national security commitments coherent with the country's  development and with space challenges facing the institution.  "From a multipurpose perspective, from the standpoint of FACh  capabilities regarding space sciences, it is obvious that FACh  tasks go far beyond the principles and limits of this concept."    The FACh chief said that to solve this problem it is  incumbent upon the highest political level to outline specific  objectives, scope, doctrines, and purposes.    Vega added that ties between the government leadership and  the FACh leadership must be strengthened to become "a symbiosis  between politicians and experts" that would be instrumental in  defining permanent guidelines aiming at higher objectives, "all  of which must be fully integrated into the nation's overall  aerospace system."    In his speech, Gen. Vega reaffirmed that the FACh is  committed to meeting the challenges posed by space, "a vital  resource for a nation that is seeking to go hand in hand with  modernity."    Vega noted that the FACh has worked for two years in this  endeavor and already has implemented a project to build an  experimental microsatellite to evaluate four basic experiments:  the evaluation of the ozone layer, the transfer of  meteorological data, communications, and search and rescue  operations.    Vega added that the Fasat-Alfa project is an essential first  step toward acquiring the basic scientific experience required  to move on to more difficult, complex stages.    After the speech, there was a ground parade and an air show.  For the first time in Chilean history, Peruvian and Argentine  military aircraft participated in this show.</p>

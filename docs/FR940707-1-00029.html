Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Right Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19) exempts ``housing for older persons'' from the prohibitions against discrimination because of familial status. The purpose of the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status and the ``housing for older persons'' exemption is to protect families with children from discrimination in housing without unfairly limiting housing choices for elderly persons (see 134 Cong. Rec. S 19722 (Aug. 1, 1988) statement of Senator Karnes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3232), HUD published a final rule implementing the Fair Housing Act. This rule included regulations governing housing for older persons. The ``housing for older persons'' regulations implement, among other things, section 807(b)(2)(C) of the Fair Housing Act, which exempts housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit that satisfies certain criteria. These regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 100, subpart E. In drafting the housing for older persons regulations, HUD took into consideration the public comments that addressed the issue of what constitutes ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress mandated that, in determining whether housing qualifies as housing for persons 55 years of age or older, the Secretary develop regulations which require at least the following factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older persons; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Overview of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (the 1992 Act)), requires the Secretary of HUD to issue rules further defining what are ``significant facilities and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons'' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term ``housing for older persons.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This proposed rule would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the 1992 Act. Specifically, this proposed rule would revise the ``55 or over'' housing regulation, codified at 24 CFR 100.304.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The language of section 919 contains the word ``especially'': ``*&blank;*&blank;* rules defining what are `significant facilities and services  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> expecially  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons' required under section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing for older person' in such section.'' (emphasis added) This proposed rule uses the word ``specifically'' rather than the word ``especially'' to comply with congressional intent and reflect the actual language of section 807(b)(2) of the Fair Housing Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

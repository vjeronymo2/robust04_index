			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> E. WASHINGTON HALTS USD  </P> <P> Hank Egan is stuck on 99.  </P> <P> With a 73-69 loss to Eastern Washington Saturday night on Reese Court, the  University of San Diego men's basketball team once again failed to earn Egan  his 100th career victory.  </P> <P> It was the Toreros' (5-4) fourth consecutive loss -- all on the road -- after  they opened the season 4-0, while Eastern Washington (4-5) broke a four-game  losing streak of its own.  </P> <P> "We got a good effort," said Egan, "the road is just starting to beat us down."  </P> <P> Although down 42-33 at the half, USD made a run in the end, cutting Eastern  Washington's lead to two twice.  </P> <P> Down 65-56 with 6:41 to go, USD ran off seven consecutive points to cut the  Eagles lead to 65-63 with 3:33 left. In that run, Wayman Strickland had a free  throw, Dondi Bell scored from the inside, Michael Brown made two free throws  and Kelvin Woods had a rebound layup.  </P> <P> USD committed 20 turnovers to Eastern Washington's nine, and shot 40% (22 of  55) from the field.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> 'STAR WARS' LASER TEST RATED A SUCCESS  </P> <P> A high-power chemical laser developed for the "Star Wars" program has been  successfully tested for the first time in a vacuum chamber simulating the  conditions of space, the Pentagon said. The test, described as "a major  milestone" by the Defense Department, was conducted Friday at a special  facility in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. While the so-called Alpha laser  generated a laser beam for only one-fifth of a second, the initial "first  light" test was sufficient to verify the theoretical calculations that were  made in designing the device, said Neil Griff, the program manager for chemical  lasers with the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Built by TRW of  Redondo Beach, the Alpha is a hydrogen fluoride chemical laser that produces  energy from chemical combustion. The device and program so far have cost about  $200 million, officials said.  </P></p>

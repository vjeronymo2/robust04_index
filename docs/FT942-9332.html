			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Markets firm as rate rise expected US financial markets were moderately firmer yesterday as dealers anticipated that today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market committee would end the uncertainty over interest rates. The Fed is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates for the fourth time this year, from 3 3/4 per cent, perhaps coinciding with an increase in the discount rate - the rate at which the Fed lends to banks - from the current 3 per cent. The markets also took heart from April's industrial production figures, showing a modest 0.3 per cent rise - the 11th consecutive monthly advance, but somewhat less than the 0.5 per cent rises in each of the previous three months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.82 higher at 3,671.50 and the 30-year government bond was up about half a point in late trading, yielding 7.45 per cent, while the dollar was little changed. But trading volumes were low as many dealers stood on the sidelines ahead of today's FOMC meeting. The improvement in industrial production was reduced by a little over 0.1 percentage points because of a 2.9 per cent decline in car assemblies, according to the Federal Reserve. This reflects an adjustment to the near capacity output reached in February which has proved unsustainable since. But most of the other component parts of the index remained steady, suggesting no incipient economic overheating. Industrial capacity stayed at 83.6 per cent, well below the inflationary threshold, and both the average work week and manufacturing employment were essentially unchanged. Technology was the strongest sector, with output up 1.2 per cent in April. The production returns and last week's minimal 0.1 per cent rise in consumer prices reinforce the impression of sustainable non-inflationary growth. Against this background, the logic of the Fed tightening monetary policy further would be to ensure economic growth remains steady and non-inflationary, and to reinforce the dollar on foreign exchange markets. The Clinton administration made no attempt to second-guess any Fed move yesterday. Mr Roger Altman, the deputy treasury secretary, told a conference: 'We don't have any quarrel with the Federal Reserve on monetary policy: our hope is that this recovery will be a durable one.'</p>

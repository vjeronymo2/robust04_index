			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Insider alarms THE CITY of London is deeply troubled by proposed new legislation on insider dealing, and it is easy to see why. The present law is discredited. Marked share price movements in front of important company announcements are commonplace; successful prosecutions are rare. The idea now is that the scope of legislation should be widened, in ways that will significantly increase the numbers of people who qualify as insiders. The law needs to pass two conflicting tests. It has to provide definitions of wrongdoing that can successfully be prosecuted. And it has to do this without damaging the interests of those who are trying to conduct legitimate business. The present law fails the first test, since proving that someone has knowingly been trading as an insider turns out to be extremely difficult. The new proposals could well fail the second test, by effectively defining as inside information almost anything that anyone could possibly want to know. There are real risks that this approach could check the flow of information between companies and investors in a way that would damage the interests of the capital markets. Company directors already have enough difficulty in briefing investors about changing business conditions. The new law could make this worse. It is unrealistic to legislate for a market in which all participants have equal access to information. Better instead to aim more modestly for an environment in which those who abuse positions of trust are punished, and companies are encouraged to be as open as possible about their affairs. The government needs to go carefully.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HAD CLUES TO ATTACK, BUT MISSED THE BIG PICTURE  </P> <P> If the Americans were reading Japan's Purple code, how come Pearl Harbor?  </P> <P> Barbara Wohlestetter, in her detailed book about events preceding the attack on  Dec. 7, 1941, gives perhaps the most succinct answer:  </P> <P> "The signals lay scattered in a number of different agencies. . . ."  </P> <P> Purple, the highest Japanese diplomatic code, warned that war was imminent but  did not disclose where it would begin.  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy determined, using radio direction finders, that Japanese ships  were heading toward Indochina and Malaya. Since there was no traffic to the  Japanese aircraft carriers, it was assumed that they were in home waters. It  was a deadly error.  </P> <P> A few Americans suggested that it could mean the carriers were steaming toward  Pearl Harbor or the West Coast under radio silence. One was Col. Rufus Bratton,  chief of the Far Eastern Section of the Army Military Intelligence Division.  </P> <P> His Navy counterpart, Cmdr. Arthur H. McCollum, spoke for himself and many  others when he told Bratton: "They (the Japanese) know as well as you and I  that the fleet would not just be sitting there (in Pearl Harbor) waiting to be  attacked."  </P> <P> Yet between Nov. 15 and Dec. 6, 1941, 49 espionage messages between Honolulu  and Tokyo had given the precise locations of ships at the naval base and  whether they were guarded by torpedo nets. Although 18 of those messages were  intercepted, only three had been processed by the time of the attack.  </P> <P> Navy code breakers assigned low priority to messages at the consulate, where  the Honolulu spies were based. Diplomats, it was assumed, were inferior spy  material.  </P> <P> Washington code breakers, for instance, did not relay to Honolulu a decoded  message from the consulate there that divided the harbor into a map-like grid.  That, said Rear Adm. Edwin T. Layton, Pacific Fleet intelligence officer at the  time, was "blind stupidity at least, gross neglect at best."  </P></p>

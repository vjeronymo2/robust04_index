			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / P&amp;O increase fails to impress market SLIGHTLY better than expected interim profits from Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company failed to lift the company's shares, which fell 9p to 340p after Lord Sterling, chairman, warned that second-half trading had deteriorated in some areas and a continuing strong dollar would hit profits. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 73.1m to Pounds 101.1m in the six months to June 30, helped by a lower interest charge - from Pounds 71.7m to Pounds 53.8m - following last year's Pounds 604m rights issue. Lord Sterling said economic confidence appeared to have waned again. 'In this climate . . . people are simply waiting,' he said. Bovis Homes, the company's housebuilding arm, had a 'disappointing' first half, although average selling prices were maintained. Sales levels in July and August were again lower than in the same period last year. Bovis Construction performed well, mainly due to overseas contracts, and the company's order book is unchanged from six months ago at about Pounds 3.7bn. P&amp;O European Ferries continued to perform well and carried record numbers of passengers. The ferry and cruise operations weathered recession because customers had higher disposable incomes, Lord Sterling said, although cruise operations were vulnerable to the weak dollar. Operating profits for P&amp;O's divisions were: service industries down 12 per cent to Pounds 46.2m, passenger shipping up 10 per cent to Pounds 48.1m, container and bulk shipping up 17.2 per cent to Pounds 36.2m, investment property up 19.4 per cent to Pounds 38.1m. Housebuilding, construction and development saw increased losses from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 13.7m. Most of the losses were incurred before P&amp;O and Chelsfield restructured their joint venture property company, Pall Mall, in April. The restructuring brought about Pounds 525m of debt on to P&amp;O's balance sheet, and lifted net borrowings from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1.6bn, to take gearing on stockholders' funds of Pounds 2.3bn to 70 per cent. Turnover and operating profits were barely changed at Pounds 2.46bn and Pounds 154.9m, respectively. There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds 51.6m, mainly from the sale of part of the company's stake in a Hong Kong container terminal. Earnings increased 17.3 per cent to 12.2p while the dividend is maintained at 13.5p. Lex, Page 18</p>

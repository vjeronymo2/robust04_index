			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher reiterated today his country's commitment to  NATO's expansion and welcomed Russia's intention to participate  in the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program without  preconditions.    Speaking at the North Atlantic Council (NAC) meeting held  here, Christopher quoted President Bill Clinton as saying that  "Now the question is no longer whether NATO will take on new  members, but when and how we will do so."    He stressed that Russia figures prominently when considering  NATO's relationship with nations to the East.    "Whatever course its internal evolution may take, Russia is  and will remain a vital actor in European security affairs,"  said Christopher, adding that "It is our interest -- and  Russia's -- to develop broad, constructive interaction between  NATO and Russia."    In addition to the PFP program, the U.S. also welcome other  cooperations with Russia, including the "16"1" formula, added  Christopher.    Although the U.S. recognizes Russia's legitimate concerns in  the states that emerged from the Soviet Empire, Christopher  warned that "No country has a right to assert a role that is  inconsistent with international norms."    He went on to say that Europe's stability and security is  also based on the treaty on conventional forces in Europe and  the U.S. is committed to maintaining the integrity of the treaty  over the long term.    Foreign ministers from 16 NATO member states attended the  NAC  spring meeting in Istanbul to participate in the tough task of  working out a common approach to NATO-Russian relationship.</p>

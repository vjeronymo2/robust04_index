			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Bosnian Serb leader plans move to end ethnic strife IN an attempt to stem growing international demands for military intervention against Serb forces in Bosnia, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday said he will propose to his parliament a unilateral end to the war. 'We will propose to the assembly of the Serbian Republic in a session on December 17 to adopt a declaration on ending of the war,' he said in reference to his self-proclaimed state covering some 70 per cent of Bosnian territory. 'But I don't accept that we are proposing to end the war from the position of winners, because we accept political solutions around the table,' he declared in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. 'In this way, we can end the war before the new year.' Despite Mr Karadzic's professed support to halt to the bloodshed, Sarajevo yesterday came under mortar fire and shelling. UN officials in the Bosnian capital said a ceasefire agreement, the nineteenth since the war began in April, would take a few days to come into effect. Mr Mik Magnusson, spokesman of the UN peacekeeping forces, said talks were under way for the creation of three safe corridors. 'They are part of a step-by-step approach to demilitarise the city, then lift the siege.' At least 17,000 people have been killed and 100,000 have gone missing in the nine-month war. Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday allowed evacuation under supervision by the International Red Cross of 1,008 Moslem and Croat prisoners from the Manjaca detention camp, northern Bosnia. Serb leaders say they will close the camp on Friday after freeing 2,000 more detainees. Ahead of Sunday's parliamentary and presidential elections in Yugoslavia, Mr Milan Panic vowed to rout Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, widely seen as responsible for the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Since he became federal prime minister in July, Mr Panic has tried to end the war and lift UN sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro. Mr Panic, who is Mr Milosevic's strongest challenger, defended himself against the campaign waged against him by state TV, which is in the grip of the Serbian president. The television has accused Mr Panic of betraying Serbia. He lashed out at Mr Milosevic saying: 'My efforts to build peace have been bombed. Serbian national interests are with Europe, not isolation.' The Belgrade-born California millionaire is ahead of Mr Milosevic, according to recent opinion polls. But their reliability is questionable because they are conducted by phone and 40 per cent of Serbs do not have phones. Mr Panic received backing yesterday from Yugoslavia's President Dobrica Cosic, a writer held in high esteem in Serbia. Mr Cosic said he wanted to end Yugoslavia's isolation. But he warned the west not to interfere by openly supporting one or other candidate.</p>

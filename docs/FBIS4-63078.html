			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Stanislaw Bahdankevich Criticizes </F> Monetary Merger Pact Between Belarus and Russia"]    [Text] Belarusian National Bank chairman, Stanislaw  Bahdankevich, held a news conference at which he sharply  criticized the monetary merger agreement between Belarus and  Russia signed on 12 April in Moscow. "The National Bank is  convinced that we should integrate with Russia and set up a  joint currency union, however, on equal terms," stated Stanislaw  Bahdankevich. Nevertheless, he believes that the signed  agreement contains specific provisions that cannot be accepted  by Belarus. First, this concerns the unification of their  budgets as early as 1995, reflected in clauses No. 5, 6, and 7  of the aforementioned agreement; second, the fact that Belarus  will have to receive loans not through the Central Bank of  Russia, but in the form of state loans through the Russian  Ministry of Finances contradicts the Belarusian Constitution.  In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, clause No. 5, which  stipulates the transfer of assets and liabilities from the  National Bank of Belarus to the Central Bank of Russia, causes  the greatest objections. It virtually means the liquidation of  the National Bank of Belarus. This was the reason why Stanislaw  Bahdankevich did not initial this clause when signing the 12  April agreement in Moscow. "As a result, we have virtually no  monetary merger agreement because, due to the lack of consent in  regard to this clause, two most important documents, which are  integral parts of this agreement, have not been adopted and  signed," stated the bank official. These documents are as  follows: "Intergovernmental Agreement on Single Mechanism of  Managing Belarusian and Russian Budgets Upon Unification of  Their Monetary Systems" and "Interbank Agreement on Unification  of the Belarusian and Russian Monetary Systems and Mechanism of  Functioning of a Single Monetary System."    Stanislaw Bahdankevich believes that the April 1994  agreement  is much more inadequate than the monetary merger agreement  signed on 8 September 1993. The earlier agreement was an equal  rights agreement, according to which Belarus could pursue an  independent economic policy. Stanislaw Bahdankevich declared  that the Belarusian side should insist on signing an agreement  on exactly the same conditions -- the establishment of a single  customs zone, the operation of a single legal tender (Russian  ruble), issued by two banks according to mutual agreements, the  denotation of limits of budget deficits, which were postulated  by the September agreement and were not ratified by the Russian  legislature.    In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, the expectations  that the deficit of the payment balance, stabilization of  inflation, and fulfillment of mutual accounts between  enterprises will be resolved are illusory. The National Bank  chairman also criticized that part of the signed agreement which  concerns the mutual lifting of customs duties. In his mind, the  gain from lifting customs duties, which will be enjoyed by  Belarus, cannot be compared with its gain, had it taken money  from Russia for maintaining the Russian Strategic Armed Forces  --deployed on the territory of Belarus -- and the transit of  Russian freight, oil, and gas through Belarusian territory.  Though Russia lifted customs duties for Belarus, it introduced  excise taxes on Belarusian goods and additional payments for  transport, thus leaving Belarusian traders virtually without  profits from lifting customs duties.    In the opinion of Stanislaw Bahdankevich, the unification of  Belarusian and Russian monetary systems within one to two months  is impossible, though Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw  Kebich talked about this recently. "I admit that I simply may  not know something he knows if he says that this monetary merger  could be introduced in the immediate future," he added. The  National Bank chairman explained his prolonged silence after the  signing of the agreement -- which is extremely unfavorable for  Belarus -- by the fact that some clauses of the agreement, which  contradict the Constitution, would be changed after a course of  negotiations.</p>

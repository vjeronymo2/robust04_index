			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Mexican needs create a job-making pact THE SEEDS of yesterday's Nafta agreement were sown at the end of 1989 as Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari travelled from Europe empty-handed after a disappointing tour aimed at raising foreign investment. He had won praise for economic reforms he had initiated, but won few pledges of investment. His first overtures to US President George Bush on a Nafta came just days after flying back to Mexico City. Nafta's origins are important to recall, as European and Asian trading partners wring their hands over whether the agreement will create a 'Fortress America' in a world increasingly divided by trade blocs. While there are worrying protectionist elements to the agreement - most conspicuously in cars, textiles and sugar - it would be wrong to conclude yet that it pushes the US down a slippery slope towards protectionism. President Salinas's aims could not have been further from those of protectionism. He aimed to use the agreement to lock in the Mexican economic reforms of the past seven years. More important, he wanted the agreement to act as a magnet for urgently-needed foreign investment - not just from the US, but also from Europe and Asia. Already, these aims have borne fruit. In the first half of 1992, foreign investors brought Dollars 5.52bn into Mexico - an increase of 3.8 per cent over the first half of 1991. For all of 1991, Dollars 10bn flowed into Mexico, double the 1990 level, according to the Mexican trade ministry. The US is the leading foreign investor, accounting for over 60 per cent. Britain ranks second, with a 6.5 per cent share, and Germany follows with 5.8 per cent. Canada ranks ninth. When Mr Salinas took office in December 1988, he set a goal of Dollars 24bn in foreign investment for his six-year administration. By late June, just over halfway through his term, Dollars 23.31bn or 97 per cent of the target had been met. President Bush's agenda has always been more complex. He sought security in Central and South America; he sought to enhance US business competitiveness in the face of increasing Japanese success in the US; he sought to boost US exports. Nafta could be seen as a first step to a wider trading region encompassing all the Americas. Business leaders in the US - particularly those in the politically important western and southern states, such as California and Texas, which border Mexico - have been enthusiastic supporters of a deal: 'The North American Free Trade Agreement is a match made in heaven,' said Arizona's Republican Congressman Jim Kolbe. But the northern car-making states of Michigan and Ohio, and the textile-producing states, have had strong reservations. Both fear jobs will be lost to Mexico as companies relocate south of the border. They fear Mexico will be used as a springboard for cheap Asian imports to the US. Mr Bush's advisers have told him the deal will generate more jobs than it will lose, and that there will be significant gains in exports to Mexico. A study by the Institute for International Economics in Washington predicted a net gain of 130,000 jobs for the US by 1995, and of more than 600,000 for Mexico. Exports would be boosted by Dollars 16.7bn. These figures, plus polls indicating the agreement will be a vote-winner in the US presidential election in November, underpinned the intensive spurt of negotiations during the past two weeks. They give Mrs Carla Hills, US Trade Representative, an important role in Mr Bush's re-election campaign. US domestic political forces have driven the timetable to a Nafta agreement, but it would be wrong to conclude that its aims are over-ridingly protectionist - even though it panders to powerful domestic industrial lobbies. Only 42 per cent of total US, Canadian and Mexican exports stay within the proposed Nafta, and only 28 per cent of US exports went to Mexico and Canada in 1991 - proportions likely to change only slowly once the agreement comes into force in 1994. US officials have argued consistently that successful completion of a Nafta could not be seen as a substitute for the wider objective that still eludes Mr Bush - successful completion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. Indeed, they have argued that a Uruguay Round agreement will underpin the Nafta.

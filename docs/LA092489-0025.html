			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SAVINGS POLICIES  </P> <P> James Flanigan's column ("Rise in Savings For Retirement Not A Fluke," Aug. 20)  quite rightly suggests that it is despite, not because of, our anti-savings tax  laws that our citizens are sacrificing more to save more for a more serene and  sooner retirement.  </P> <P> But everyone benefits from a higher savings rate, as proven by juggernaut  Japan. Their tax laws encourage, not discourage, individual savings. That's the  capital that is fueling their impressive growth.  </P> <P> Short-sighted beyond belief was the provision in the 1986 tax reform act that  cut back on the already minimal $2,000 IRA instead of increasing it two-,  three-, or four-fold. Why? The pursuit of short-term tax dollars, and never  mind the deleterious long-term effects on economic and individual entities.  </P> <P> Why not learn from the Japanese that capital (savings) is a capital idea -- in  progressive capitols?  </P> <P> JOHN CARL BROGDON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

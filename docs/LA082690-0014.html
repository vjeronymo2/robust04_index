			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> ** WINGER, "IN THE HEART OF THE YOUNG," ATLANTIC.: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE  OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> There's not enough of Winger's strength -- strong, basic, hard rock 'n' roll --  on this album. This pop-metal outfit goes wrong at every turn, whether lead  singer Kip Winger is venturing into romance ("Rainbow in the Rose"), rebellion  ("In the Heart of the Young") or rap ("Baptized by Fire"). The group's  million-selling 1988 debut album, "Winger," had more fire. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Low take-up for Aegis rights AEGIS, the media-buying company, announced yesterday that just 14.4 per cent of its Pounds 19.8m September rights issue had been taken up, and almost all of that by Warburg Pincus, the US investment bank which had fully underwritten it. 'We are not surprised that the take-up from institutions has been very low, given the current market conditions and the pricing of the issue; any issue priced at 55p against a stock price of 16p is not likely to go forward very well,' the group said. The shares traded at a peak of 215p in October 1991. In voting right terms there are now 200m shares in issue; 30 per cent are held by SFEC, a company controlled by Mr Gilbert Gross, honorary president of Aegis; 30 per cent by Warburg Pincus; 6 per cent by Eurocom; and the rest by various financial institutions including Fidelity and Philips and Drew. The two principal shareholders each have two representatives on the board.</p>

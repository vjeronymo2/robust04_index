			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / IMF lightens the gloom in Moldova: 'Impressive' economic reforms by the republic have raised hopes of loans THE street lights are few and the shops close early because of severe energy shortages, but prospects have brightened in Moldova, one of the smallest former Soviet republics. Following strong backing for its reform programme by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, this agricultural state, sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, could become one of the few ex-Soviet republics to conclude a stand-by arrangement with the IMF this year. If the government agrees to speed up privatisation, implement tighter monetary policy and liberalise foreign trade and prices, it could unlock Dollars 70m of badly needed external financing. This would be in addition to a Dollars 32m loan under the IMF's new systemic transformation facility  - designed to aid countries in transition to a market economy  - agreed in September, and a Dollars 60m rehabilitation loan from the World Bank agreed last month. The reform programme of Mr Andrei Sanagheli's government sets targets for 1994 which include: curbing inflation to 1 per cent a month by the end of the year, down from a monthly average of 31 per cent in the first nine months of this year; reducing the budget deficit from this year's 6 per cent of GDP target to 3.5 per cent; privatising one-third of state property. Hopes of a deal are high, with the IMF and World Bank describing Moldova's reforms as 'impressive' and pointing to a greater degree of consensus on reform among Moldova's leadership than in other parts of the former Soviet Union. The government has already taken some bold and politically difficult steps. In September, it raised bread and milk prices eightfold overnight, reducing subsidies from 80 to 40 per cent. World Bank officials say it has also stopped granting preferential credits to state companies, some of which were receiving loans at 15-20 per cent, well below the 170 per cent re-financing rate. It also launched a mass privatisation programme last month, with its first voucher-based auction. Under the scheme, Moldovans receive vouchers according to the number of years they have worked for the state. They can use the vouchers to buy their homes or to buy shares in the 1,580 state commercial companies due to be auctioned off by the end of 1994. A 50 per cent stake in companies in agro-processing  - an important sector given that agriculture contributes around 40 per cent of Moldova's gross national product  - is to be given to the farms that have supplied them for the past 10 years, while the remainder will be auctioned. The State Department for Privatisation hopes to interest foreign investors once companies have been transferred to private ownership. According to Mr Vissarion Cheshuev, the SDP's general director, foreign companies will have access to a stock exchange, due to be set up next year, which will trade shares in the privatised companies. They can also form joint ventures under existing regulations. By October, foreign investors from east and west Europe and the US, had invested Dollars 52m in some 170 joint ventures, many of them in agro-processing. But few expect foreign investment to accelerate until the country resolves the conflict in its eastern Trans-Dnestr region. Fearing that the country's ethnic Romanian majority would seek reunification with Romania, Russian speakers on the left bank of the Dnestr river three years ago declared themselves independent from the Moldovan government in Chisinau and set up their own state. A tense ceasefire has held since fighting claimed hundreds of lives last year, but the conflict and the splitting of the country in two has undermined the economy and complicated reform efforts. It has also soured Moldova's relations with Russia, which has supported the separatists both financially and through the former Soviet Union's 14th army stationed in Tiraspol, Trans-Dnestr's 'capital'. Russia's support of the Trans-Dnestrans is one reason why the Moldovan parliament, which includes a sizeable lobby demanding unification with Romania, voted against joining the Commonwealth of Independent States in August. However, President Mircea Snegur convinced the parliament and the country that this decision would lead to economic disaster for Moldova, which imports most of its raw materials and 90 per cent of its fuel from the CIS, and he signed the economic union agreement with Russia and other former Soviet republics in Moscow in September. 'We have to accept that our economy is nothing but part of a former huge country's economy,' he says. The president says the majority of Moldovans never favoured reunification with Romania and that the country will pursue a 'strong policy of co-operation with the east'. But the government's attempts at rapprochement with Moscow appear to have done little so far to resolve the situation in Trans-Dnestr. President Boris Yeltsin declined to receive President Snegur on an official visit to Moscow last month, in spite of Mr Snegur's strong support for Mr Yeltsin in his battle against parliament.</p>

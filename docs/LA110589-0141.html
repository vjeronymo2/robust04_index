			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> USC RUNS OREGON STATE OUT OF THE RACE, 48-6  </P> <P> Todd Marinovich threw for three first-half touchdowns as ninth-ranked USC  rolled to a 48-6 victory over Oregon State on Saturday and took clear command  of the Pacific 10 title race.  </P> <P> The win put the Trojans at 7-2 overall and 5-0 in the conference as they  contend for their third consecutive Rose Bowl berth.  </P> <P> No other Pac-10 team has fewer than two conference losses.  </P> <P> Oregon State, beaten by Southern Cal for the 18th consecutive time, came into  the game third with a 3-1-1 mark. Their second Pac-10 loss dropped them to  4-4-1 overall.  </P> <P> The Trojans, who have won 18 straight Pac-10 games and have Arizona and UCLA  remaining on their schedule, got more breathing room Saturday when Arizona,  second in the Pac-10 with a 4-1 record, was upset 29-28 by Cal.  </P> <P> Marinovich helped stake the Trojans to a 34-0 halftime lead against the  overmatched Beavers, then yielded to backup Shane Foley at 3:47 into the third  period with Southern Cal ahead 41-0.  </P> <P> Marinovich, a redshirt freshman who ranks ninth on the Trojans' all-time  completions list after just nine games, completed 14 of 18 for 226 yards in the  romp.  </P> <P> Southern Cal dominated the Beavers in virtually every department. Ricky Ervins  led the Trojan rushers with 110 yards on 20 carries and scored three times on  runs of 17 yards, 7 and 1.  </P> <P> On the 7-yard score, he picked up a Marinovich fumble on the first bounce and  bulled his way into the end zone.  </P> <P> Ervins also was perfect on one passing attempt. He took a pitch from  Marinovich, pulled up and completed a 33-yarder back to the quarterback to help  set up the second touchdown for the Trojans, who scored the first three times  they had the ball.  </P> <P> Marinovich's touchdowns came on throws of 57 yards to John Jackson, 31 to Gary  Wellman and 17 to Joel Scott.  </P> <P> The Trojans' defense completely overpowered the Beavers, with linebacker Junior  Seau leading the charge with 3 1/2 sacks, giving him 13 1/2 this season to  break the school record of 13 set by Jack Del Rio in 1983.  </P> <P> Oregon State's lone score came on a 14-yard pass from Matt Booher to Maurice  Wilson 47 seconds into the final quarter.  </P> <P> Booher was 24 of 32 for 216 yards with two interceptions.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification of Range of Economic Opportunities That May Be Generated by Section 3 Covered Public and Indian Housing Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters stated that the proposed rule placed a heavy emphasis on construction jobs, which may be appropriate in the context of housing and community development assistance (given the limited section 3 coverage), but is inappropriate in the context of section 3 covered public and Indian housing assistance. The commenters stated that, in public and Indian housing programs, the statute covers opportunities generated by development assistance, modernization, and operating assistance, and that all jobs generated from the expenditure of these major sources of funding for HAs should be covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters are correct that all jobs, whether administrative, clerical, managerial, or construction related, generated from the expenditure of operating assistance, development assistance or modernization assistance are subject to the section 3 preference requirements and the interim rule makes this clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification That Section 3 Applies to Section 8 Project-Based Assistance in Limited Circumstances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters stated that the Department erred in its broad exclusion of section 8 assistance from section 3 coverage. The commenters are correct with respect to section 8 project-based assistance. Although section 8 project-based assistance currently does not often finance rehabilitation and construction projects, where section 8 project-based assistance is expended for housing rehabilitation or construction, the assistance is covered by section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Retention of Proposed Rule's Interpretation of ``Section 3 Covered Contract''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thirteen commenters stated that the Department should interpret ``section 3 covered contracts'' to include contracts for the purchase of materials, supplies, or equipment, where no installation is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Exclusion of Contracts for the Purchase of Materials and Supplies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department declines to adopt this interpretation. The Department believes that the phrase ``for work'' which accompanies the term ``contract'' throughout the statute indicates that the requirements of section 3 were not intended to apply to contractors who only furnish materials or supplies, and do not undertake work, as in the installation of the material or equipment. The Department, however, encourages the purchase of materials and supplies from section 3 business concerns as a means of providing economic opportunities other than those connected with section 3 covered assistance (see &sect;135.40).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Coverage or Professional Service Contracts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``section 3 covered contract'' however does include professional service contracts provided that the work to be performed by the professionals is for work generated by the expenditure of section 3 covered public and Indian housing assistance, or for work arising in connection with a section 3 covered project (i.e., housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction project).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Clarification of Exclusion of HUD Procurement Contracts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule also clarifies that ``section 3 covered contracts'' do not include contracts awarded under HUD's procurement programs. These contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Continuation of Extension of Section 3 Coverage to Private, For-Profit Businesses Receiving HUD Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, the Department defined ``section 3 covered project'' to clarify that ``other public construction project'' included buildings or improvements, regardless of ownership, assisted with housing or community development assistance. The Department specifically requested comment from the public on this proposal to extend section 3 coverage though the definition of ``section 3 covered project'' to all private, for-profit entities that receive HUD housing or community development assistance for a section 3 covered project, including private, for-profit businesses receiving Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding for economic development projects. Fifteen commenters supported this proposal, stating that it was important that section 3 apply to private, for-profit entities receiving HUD financial assistance. Six commenters opposed the proposal, stating that the Economic Development portion of the CDBG program is already designed to hire low- and very low-income persons, and to extend section 3 coverage to economic development projects is redundant and confusing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department was not persuaded by the commenters in opposition to the proposal. Although the Economic Development portion of the CDBG program supports the employment of low- and very low-income persons, the employment of these persons is not triggered in the same manner as provided by section 3. For example, an economic development project may involve the building of a widget factory. When construction of the factory is complete, there is a commitment to employ a certain percentage of low- and very low-income persons as factory workers. However, there is no requirement for the developer or builder of the factory to employ low- or very low-income persons in the construction of the factory. Section 3 would cover the job opportunities created at this stage of the economic development project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Introduction of New Term_``Section 3 Residents''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Using ``Section 3 Residents'' to Refer Collectively to ``Low-Income and Very Low-Income Persons.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed their dissatisfaction with the proposed rule's use of ``low-income person'' to refer to both ``low- and very low-income persons.'' The commenters expressed concern that the use of ``low-income persons'' to refer to both low- and very low-income persons would result in oversight of the need to direct recruitment and solicitation efforts to very low-income persons. Instead of selecting one of the statutory terms to refer to both income groups, the interim rule uses the term ``section 3 residents'' to refer to both low- and very low-income residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

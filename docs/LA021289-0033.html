			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: NANCY VALE'S KNITWEAR;  </P> <P> BY NANCY VALE (BALLANTINE BOOKS; 1987)  </P> <P> NANCY VALE'S NAME may be unfamiliar to Americans, but her sweaters are sold all  over the country under Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and other labels. The  sweaters are gorgeous, from a thick Navajo-style cardigan to an Early American  sampler design on a pullover. Vale, an "English mum" who has become a design  tycoon in Britain, offers patterns that are full of complicated cables and  color changes, and most of them are knitted on small needles -- a lifetime  project for some of us. Still, anyone with modest talent and extravagant  patience could really make something out of this book. ($24.95) Judith Sims  </P></p>

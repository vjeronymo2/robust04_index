Mining Counselor [honorary title] Krister Ahlstroem, the  chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers,  told Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who visited the  Confederation, that the industry is especially hoping for  counterguarantees to be arranged. Ahlstroem also raised the  Finnish companies' 6 billion Finnish markkas of receivables from  Russia. According to Erik Forsman, the press director of the  Confederation, the Russian prime minister did not promise a  quick solution to the debt problems.    [Begin Forsman recording] Chernomyrdin's general assessment  was that the debt looks a lot bigger from the Finnish side than  from the point of view of Russia, when they are looking at  Finland -- your 6 billion is not such a big matter -- but when  you look at it from our point of view, it is a big matter. [end  recording]    Chernomyrdin, who this morning arrived as a guest of Prime  Minister Esko Aho, has in addition to meetings with  industrialists had lunch with President Ahtisaari. The official  talks of the prime ministers are now coming to an end at the  State Banqueting Hall.</p>

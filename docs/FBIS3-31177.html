RILINDJA comments that this proportion is three to one in  favour of the Serbians when the Albanian population makes up 90  percent of the whole population in Kosova.    At the end of the last year, the surgery clinics received a  financial aid at a level of 48 thousand USA dollars and an aid  in medicaments of 7 thousand DM [German marks], but the Albanian  patients mostly buy their medicaments and other necessary  materials for the surgeries.</p>

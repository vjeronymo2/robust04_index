			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Offshore bond funds OFFSHORE bond funds pay income gross which is an attraction for non-taxpayers. The table lists those sterling offshore bond funds recognised by the Securities and Investments Board - the chief regulator for the financial services industry in the UK - and which have a three-year performance record. Figures have been taken from Hardwick Stafford Wright and show the top 10 performing SIB-recognised funds in the sterling fixed-interest sector. They are quoted on an offer-to-offer basis because some funds have a single price but add an initial charge. If all funds were quoted on an offer-to-bid price, the single-priced funds would receive an unfair advantage. Investors seeking income should not base their choice entirely on the size of the yield, since a bond fund can achieve a high yield at the expense of capital. Some offshore funds, such as that of Barclays, charge their annual management fee to capital rather than income in order to maintain the relatively high yield. The standard practice onshore is to charge the fee against income otherwise the investor will suffer an erosion of his capital growth. However, last month Foster &amp; Braithwaite found a loophole in the regulations which allowed them to launch an onshore unit trust which deducts the charge from capital rather than income. The SIB is seeking to close the loophole. The Association of Unit Trusts says that investors should be given a choice. Those who prefer high yields to capital growth benefit from charges made against capital. The association has called for full disclosure of the way in which the charge is deducted.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  HIGHEST PERFORMING 10 OFFSHORE BOND FUNDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                             Size (Pounds m)   Yield (%)    Perf*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays Sterling Bond                313.1           8.4       68.7 Hill Samuel Fixed Intl                 34.1           7.0       66.7 Guinness Fl Acc Pounds Hi               3.0           7.1       64.6 TSB Off Inv Gilt &amp; FI                   2.0           5.3       64.0 CMI (Lux) UK Bond                      15.6           6.8       63.8 Sun Life Secure High I                  9.4           7.1       63.3 Govett GSI UK High Inc                 14.0           8.4       62.9 Lloyds Trust Gilt                     491.2           6.9       61.9 Guinness Fl Gilt &amp; Pounds Bd           32.0           7.3       60.9 Henderson Horizon Pounds Bd            10.0           7.2       60.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hardwick Stafford Wright  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Offer-to-offer with income reinvested over three years to November 1.

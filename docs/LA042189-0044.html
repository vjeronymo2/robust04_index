			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COOLING TREND, POSSIBLE RAIN THIS WEEKEND  </P> <P> Three cold fronts and a low-pressure system are expected to bring cooler  temperatures and possible showers to San Diego this weekend.  </P> <P> A low-pressure system that was stalled in Alaska has broken loose and is moving  down to the coast, bringing gradually declining temperatures, stronger winds  and maybe some showers to San Diego, the National Weather Service said.  </P> <P> "This will not be a Chamber of Commerce weekend," weather forecaster Wilber  Shigehara said. "It's not going to be the best weekend for picnics, either,  because of the clouds and cooler conditions.  </P> <P> "We've had a heat wave, so turning cool might be welcomed by some people," he  added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooling Trend  </P> <P> The first front, expected to arrive today, will cool things off. There may be  some morning drizzle today, with a partly cloudy afternoon.  </P> <P> The second front should hit Saturday, bringing some drizzle or heavy mist and  even brisker temperatures. Sunday's front will trigger a 30% chance of showers.  About one-quarter of an inch of rain is expected to fall through Monday.  </P> <P> Shigehara said he expects winds to pick up to 10 to 20 m.p.h. in San Diego,  possibly up to 25 m.p.h. by Sunday.  </P> <P> Mountain and desert areas will have winds from 15 to 30 m.p.h. this weekend,  with up to 40 m.p.h. by Sunday.  </P> <P> "It might be blustery and breezy," Shigehara said. "If you're planning on  boating this weekend, watch out for the rain and winds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temperature Ranges  </P> <P> Beaches will hit the mid-60s today, with temperatures of 62 to 65 degrees  Saturday and Sunday. The coastal strip will hit 68 to 73 degrees today,  dropping several degrees Saturday and Sunday. Nighttime lows will be 58 to 63  tonight, falling to 55 to 60 Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> The inland region should remain reasonably warm, ranging from 73 to 80 degrees  today, to 68 to 75 degrees Saturday and Sunday. Nighttime lows will be 52 to 58  degrees tonight, and 48 to 55 Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Mountain areas will be 75 to 80 degrees today, 65 to 70 Saturday, and 60 to 65  Sunday.

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Welsh Water Welsh Water's triumph of hope over experience shows just why investors are right to be cynical about diversification. Its foray into environmental services came to nothing, while the stake in South Wales Electricity yielded a profit but hardly a strategy. Hotels - a natural for a water company with the vertical integration of en-suite bathroom plumbing into the sewerage system - predictably ended in tears. Now there is the Acer engineering services business, which was acquired for Pounds 49m in February, and after further investigation apparently requires a Pounds 40.4m goodwill write-off. The board confidently expects Acer to be earnings-enhancing this year. After that kind of write-off, it would be surprising if it were anything else. It is all such a contrast to the serenity of the main water business. Welsh still has a strong balance sheet, though it may move into net debt this year. Its capital expenditure requirements are lower than most and, while that may lead Ofwat to impose a tough price cap, Welsh can easily absorb the pain. Dividend cover is still high and while earnings will be under pressure after the price review, there is no reason why Welsh cannot cut cover and increase gearing to pay for dividend increases for many years. Given its manifest destiny as a utility, one wonders why Welsh Water struggles so vainly to become anything else.</p>

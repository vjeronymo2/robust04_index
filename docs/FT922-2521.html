			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Electrolux seeking further acquisitions in eastern Europe ELECTROLUX, the largest European white goods maker, is finding it difficult to make acquisitions in eastern Europe because of the poor condition of potential target companies, according to Mr Lennart Ribohn, senior executive vice-president. The Swedish-based multinational is looking for further acquisitions in eastern Europe following its takeover last year of Lehel, Hungary's largest white goods producer. Although Electrolux has started talks with other companies, Mr Ribohn said it had not yet found one suitable. The big western white goods companies are keen to expand in eastern Europe because of the latent market potential in countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but also as a possible source for low-end products or components. In May, Whirlpool, the world's largest white goods group, finalised an important joint venture agreement with Tatramat, the Czechoslovakian washing machine manufacturer. Mr Ribohn said Electrolux had established holding companies in Poland, Russia and the Baltic states as channels for imported western white goods. However, economic conditions in some eastern countries since the collapse of communism restricted their ability to receive imports. He said that since the takeover of Lehel, with which Electrolux has had a long-standing relationship, exports from the Hungarian company had increased. He suggested that Electrolux could consider a green field expansion in eastern Europe if it could not find suitable acquisition targets and when market conditions improved. The Electrolux executive was speaking at Zanussi's new L250bn (Dollars 209.4m) washing machine factory at Porcia, near Venice. The factory is a key weapon in Electrolux and its Zanussi subsidiary's battle with Whirlpool for supremacy in the European white goods market. Mr Gian Mario Rossignolo, Zanussi chairman, said Zanussi lifted sales last year by 10.3 per cent to L2,424bn and claimed increased market share in Europe and in Italy. Zanussi's cash-flow grew 22.3 per cent to L187bn and investments rose 15.3 per cent to L122bn. Both Whirlpool and Electrolux have been spending heavily on marketing and advertising in Europe over the past year, despite flat market conditions overall.</p>

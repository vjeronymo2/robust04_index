			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Big Blue decides small is beautiful: Louise Kehoe explains a revolution in culture and operations at the world's biggest computer company If IBM is to recover its reputation as the world's best-run company, much hangs on the performance of one man: Mr Robert Corrigan. Mr Corrigan, 52, with 30 years at Big Blue under his belt, is president of the seven-week-old IBM Personal Computer Company (IBM PCC) and he must reverse the big drop in PC sales, a prime cause of IBM's poor third-quarter results; and pioneer the group's newly decentralised management style, as a 'federation of free-standing businesses'. 'What we've begun here is far more than a restructuring, we are changing the culture of IBM, and changing it very quickly,' Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, recently told employees. 'Performance has already replaced conformance; entrepreneurship is quickly overtaking decision-by-committee; and teamwork is supplanting hierarchy.' The PC business was an obvious place for IBM to start. Founded in 1981 by a handful of IBM mavericks who developed the prototype for IBM's first PC product in only three months, the PC operation has always retained some of its rebel style. Far from resisting change, employees of IBM PCC have welcomed the restructuring as an opportunity for the PC unit to 'return to its roots' and throw off the Big Blue blanket that many feel has reduced its competitiveness. The PC business also represented one of IBM's most pressing problems, as the dismal third-quarter results have confirmed. IBM has been losing market share to lower-priced PCs. IBM PCC 'is a slimmed-down company with a more efficient management system where decisions can be made and implemented more quickly', says Mr Corrigan. 'It is an organisation with control over all elements of cost and expense and, most importantly, a company that brings together in one organisation all the skills necessary to create and deliver products to our customers.' 'The (PC) industry is moving to shorter and shorter product development cycles,' explains Mr James Cannavino, IBM vice-president and general manager of personal systems. 'Today, with the average industry cycle at six to eight months the boundaries between development and manufacturing and distribution must disappear.' The restructured IBM PCC will have total worldwide responsibility for product development, manufacturing and merchandising, promotion and distribution. The new company's costs have been significantly reduced. It begins life with about 10,000 employees, down from the 15,000 who focused on IBM's PC products a year ago. It has also thrown off the yoke of corporate overhead charges for administration, research and development. 'Now, if we need some research activity we pay for what we need, and only what we need, at a fair market value,' says Mr Ed Rogers, chief financial officer of the new company. The same applies to components purchases. Mr Rogers can also set or change prices for IBM PCs. 'A year ago, if we wanted to change a price, marketing would first make a request to the manufacturing and development people, then it would go to the North America management level . . . The procedure once took weeks and sometimes months.' Now that decisions are made without reference to committees, 'it takes us just a day or two'. To inject entrepreneurial spirit into the new organisation, IBM PCC has formed 'brand teams', focused on different segments of the PC market, ranging from consumers to corporate buyers. 'Large is no longer fashionable at IBM,' says Mr Tony Santelli, who heads development of PS/1 products. 'The prowess of IBM executives used to be measured by the size of their organisations. Now the feeling is that anybody can get the job done with 1,000 people, but only the superstars can do it with 100.' It is a measure of the cultural changes underway within IBM that members of Mr Santelli's PS/1 group have become almost folk heroes. Three years ago they were given the task of developing a 'home computer'. They took a non-conformist approach and set up shop in a disused warehouse in Lexington, Kentucky. 'We recruited (IBM) people who had the zeal to enter a great adventure, but they had to be willing to take a big demotion, to work in a windowless warehouse with no guarantees of success. We picked up battle-scarred veterans and bushytails who didn't know any better. It was a totally crazy bunch,' Mr Santelli recalls. The 'blue-grass' team, as it became known, brought the PS/1 home computer to market in 18 months and although its first product flopped, the group set important precedents for the small-team approach and went on to develop the latest PS/1 which is a strong seller. 'You don't need the same communications processes or structures as you have in larger groups. There are no part-time players and rank has no privilege,' says Mr Santelli, in what amounts to an heretical statement from an IBM executive. Gone is IBM's preoccupation with ensuring that one of its products does not compete with another. Now 'the cannibals are king', says Mr Santelli. 'If we don't cannibalise our markets, our competitors will do it for us.' Yet for all of its enthusiasm, IBM PCC faces enormous challenges. The hard-driving entrepreneurial culture it is attempting to adopt is already native to many competitors. The 'small' brand teams it has formed still appear huge compared with the lean and mean companies whose prices they must match - and the bureaucracy it has thrown off is foreign to most PC makers. Competitors in the US say IBM PC has not affected their sales. None the less, IBM PCC's birth was well-timed. It comes as PC sales are booming. IBM PCC may also benefit from a strong trend away from the 'no-name clones' made by little-known manufacturers. With the launch of its Valuepoint product range, IBM PCC has laid all its cards on the table. Customer response to these products will be a key to fourth-quarter performance of the world's largest computer company - and a strong indicator of how successful IBM will be in restructuring its worldwide operations.

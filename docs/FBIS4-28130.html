			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Wholesale and retail sales in  Japan dropped an overall 4 percent in 1993 to 673.5 trillion  yen, registering the first consecutive yearly decline since  statistics of the kind began in 1953, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Tuesday [7 June].    Consumers have become more price-conscious amid uncertain  prospects for employment and income under the recession, MITI  said in a commerce survey.    Sales in the wholesale sector declined 4.1 percent and those  in the retail sector 3.8 percent, both suffering a drop for the  second year in a row, MITI said.    The annual survey report, called Japan's Commerce, is  compiled on the basis of various commerce-related indicators.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK-French relations sour A DIPLOMATIC row simmered between Britain and France yesterday following a sharp reply by Mr John Major to President Francois Mitterrand's criticism of the UK's new timetable for the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Answering Mr Mitterrand's attack on the slowness with which the British government intended to proceed with ratification, Mr Major issued a vigorous warning that the timing was a matter for the UK, and not for its EC partners. The prime minister told MPs he had written to Mr Mitterrand giving his views. He added: 'I am quite prepared to state publicly that the passage of the Maastricht bill is a matter for the British parliament and for the British government.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, also rejected the French criticism yesterday, at the launch of a government pamphlet which explains the treaty. 'A treaty delayed is better than a treaty destroyed or lost,' Mr Hurd said. The treaty would in Britain undergo more detailed scrutiny than in any other EC state. Britain had always made clear to its EC partners that this would take a long time, he said. It was natural enough that countries which had already ratified the treaty felt a certain amount of anxiety. But Mr Hurd said that, in spite of that anxiety, there was a feeling that the treaty would be ratified. Mr Major's linking of the French president's remarks on Maastricht with the need to prevent a trade war, was seen at Westminster as a veiled suggestion that Mr Mitterrand was trying to use ratification as a diversion from France's stubborn refusal to make further concessions to the US in the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Mr Mitterrand last night reiterated his frustration at the British intention to delay ratification until at least next May, allegedly until after the result of the second Danish referendum. Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, the French president said: 'Everyone should accept his responsibilities. We have all signed this treaty. It is now necessary to put it in place. 'One can well understand that the British government needs a bit of time to deal with its own problems, but one cannot hinder the process (of ratification) that is already under way.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is also likely to voice his concern at the consequences of Britain's delayed timetable when he meets Mr Major at a bilateral summit at Ditchley Park, near Oxford, today. A main worry for the German leader is the threat of a delay in talks with new applicants for European Community membership, strongly backed by Britain and Germany, and due to begin on January 1. They include Austria, Finland and Sweden, which have already applied, and Norway and Switzerland, which are expected to do so. Mr Kohl would like those talks to go ahead regardless of the delay in ratification, but other EC members seem likely to block them until ratification is completed, thus undermining one of the top priorities of the British EC presidency. However, Mr Kohl, anxious to preserve his good personal relations with the prime minister, is unlikely to attack Mr Major openly for his decision to postpone the Maastricht ratification process. German officials recognise it is a question for each individual member state to decide. Mr Kohl will also throw his weight behind any initiative Mr Major is ready to take to reach a settlement between the EC and the US in the trade talks. Mr Major also had talks in London yesterday with Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, who made it clear that he too had strong reservations about the British policy on ratification. The official British line was that Mr Lubbers had expressed 'no complaints or recriminations against the British position'. But outside 10 Downing Street, Mr Lubbers told Dutch television that he did not understand what Britain was doing and that he was disappointed with its position on the Maastricht treaty.

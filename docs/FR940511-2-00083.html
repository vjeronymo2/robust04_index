Program Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> President Clinton announced in February that he has formally called for a White House Conference on Aging to be convened in May 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous White House Conferences in 1961, 1971 and 1981 adopted recommendations that resulted in local, state and Federal initiatives which improved the security and well being of older Americans. The 1995 Conference will produce recommendations that will meet the needs of Older Americans in the twenty-first century. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A White House Conference on Aging in intended to produce policy recommendations to guide national aging policy over the next decade. In Public Law 102&hyph;375, the Older Americans Act amendments of 1992, Congress specifically identified six primary purposes for the Conference. They are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To increase public awareness of the interdependence of generations and the essential contributions of older individuals to society for the well-being of all generations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To identify the problems facing older individuals and the commonalities of the problems with problems of younger generations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To examine the well-being of older individuals including the impact the wellness of older individuals has on our aging society; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To develop such specific and comprehensive recommendations for executive and legislative action as may be appropriate for maintaining and improving the well-being of the aging; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To develop recommendations for the coordination of Federal policy with State and local needs and the implementation of such recommendations; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) To review the status and multigenerational value of recommendations adopted at previous White House Conferences on Aging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of major significance to the 1995 White House Conference on Aging in direct participation by individuals and organizations in the pre-conference stages. As part of this grass roots effort, the WHCoA has adopted a four pronged approach that includes local forums, mini-conferences as well as State and Regional conferences. The purpose of these events is to identify those issues of mutual concern to the aging population and to develop recommendations that warrant specific attention by the White House Conference of Aging. An integral part of this strategy is the conduct of mini-conferences which are topic or constituency specific. The recommendations from these conferences will play an integral role in the development of the agenda for the 1995 Conference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for a mini-conference to be considered for funding, the proposed event must: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Be a policy oriented event. The focus of the event must be either: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) On one of the following specific Federal policy issues: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

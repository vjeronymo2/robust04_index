			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- A difficult situation which  developed in the Russian economy was the major issue of the  meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chairman of  the Lower House of the Russian Parliament Ivan Rybkin.    Upon completion of the meeting Rybkin informed lawmakers of  the State Duma about its results. Rybkin pointed out that the  two discussed problems connected with insolvency in industry and  measures for the prevention of further production decline.    Rybkin said that they discussed measures to be taken by the  State Duma to give a legislative support to the Treaty of Civic  Accord.    Much attention was given to the budget-94 draft law which  will be discussed by the State Duma in the second reading and in  particular, to articles of the draft law concerning needs of the  Army, education, culture and science.    Rybkin said that he had informed the Russian president that  a  presidential decree and a resolution of the Russian Government,  under which a block of buildings in the Okhotny Ryad Street were  transferred to the State Duma, were not fulfilled by some  organisations which had not moved out from the building given to  the State Duma as its new residence. Rybkin voiced satisfaction  that after his conversation with the Russian president all  organisations ignoring the resolution were given a strict  warning to move out until May 26.</p>

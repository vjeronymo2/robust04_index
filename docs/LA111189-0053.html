			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC: MEMORIES OF HOROWITZ  </P> <P> Thank you, Martin Bernheimer and Charles Champlin, for the beautiful articles  about Vladimir Horowitz on Nov. 7.  </P> <P> After I graduated from high school in New York in 1945, my parents and I spent  the summer at a resort called Mt. Washington. Among the guests were Horowitz  and Wanda Toscanini, his wife.  </P> <P> Volodya, as we called him, was a cut-up. We teased him because of his many  fears. His eyes would pop in partly mock panic at the thought of a possible  encounter with a bobcat on the trails.  </P> <P> On Aug. 6, Volodya greeted us with a panic-stricken face, saying the radio news  had told of a "beeeg bomb" being dropped on Japan. We all laughed because he  had on the funny expression he did when talking of the bobcat. It took a while  for us to realize something of a very different nature had happened.  </P> <P> My memory of Horowitz is forever linked with that lovely summer, and that of  the A-bomb is forever linked to Horowitz.  </P> <P> RACHEL ROSENTHAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Rosenthal is a performance artist.  </P> <P> </P></p>

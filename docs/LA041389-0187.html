			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> LIGHT-RAIL ROUTE SELECTED  </P> <P> The Board of Directors has selected the Foothill (210) Freeway as the route for  an east-west light-rail line through Pasadena. In action this week, the board  directed its Light Rail Alignment Task Force to study safety and access  problems at stations along the line and to consider terminal sites in east  Pasadena.  </P> <P> The board action, in effect, discards two routes through downtown Pasadena that  had drawn strong opposition from property and business owners on Green Street.  One of the routes would have turned Green Street into a transit mall, and the  other would have put rail cars on both Green Street and Colorado Boulevard.  </P> <P> Director Rick Cole said the choice was dictated by the technology being used by  the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a  light-rail line from Long Beach to Los Angeles and plans to extend it through  Pasadena. The rail cars would be boarded from platforms three or four feet high  and 90 feet long. Cole said that putting such platforms on city streets is  impractical.  </P> <P> Cole said the light-rail system will serve commuters, but do little or nothing  to enhance the downtown area. He said the city's next step should be to push  forward with development of a local transit system, such as trolley cars on  rails or rubber tires.  </P> <P> The board instructed the Light Rail Alignment Task Force to give attention to  developing a local transit system and to resolving safety, access and parking  problems connected with the light-rail line.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by oel: "Impurity Doping Is To Make HT </F> Superconductors Capable of Carrying More Load"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Application of the new high temperature  superconductors (HTSL) still fails in many areas because the  superconductivity is lost under the influence of comparatively  weak magnetic fields. When ceramic materials under the influence  of magnetic fields get a little below a Tesla, they are only  superconducting at very low temperatures of a few Kelvin. For  important practical applications superconductivity under  magnetic fields can therefore only be used with metallic  superconductors and by cooling with expensive liquid helium.    But physicists of the University of Birmingham (School of  Physics, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom) have now succeeded  in making the movement of the magnetic field lines in high  temperature superconductors visible. Consequently, there is now  an opportunity directly to observe the effect of measures  against the drifting of the field lines.    With this discovery the developers of high-temperature  superconductors hope to be able to solve the problem in a way  similar to the comparable behavior for metallic superconductors:  By doping the material, the field lines are "frozen," which  makes the construction of high-performance magnets for computer  tomography possible, for example.    The observation and image recording of the magnetic field  lines in high temperature superconducting materials succeeded  with a neutron-scattering method in a bismuth, strontium,  calcium-copper oxide high-temperature superconductor. The  methods used so far in order to determine the collapse of the  magnetic field lines were based on indirect measurement  processes which did not give an image.    With the neutron scattering method both the crystalline  structure and the field line can be recorded. If the  high-temperature superconductors being studied are under the  influence of a magnetic field and the temperature is raised from  a few degrees Kelvin, after a certain point there will be such  large internal resistances that this causes the crystalline  structure to be lost.    This has the result that the superconducting state is also  abruptly halted. Because of this phenomenon the British  physicists speak of a "melting away" of the magnetic flux  structure (flux lattice melting). In the high temperature  superconductors available today this will already take place at  temperatures between four and ten Kelvin.    The continued development work by several research groups in  Europe, the United States and Japan is now aimed at finding ways  to prevent the "migration" of the magnetic field lines as far as  the area of critical temperatures between 90 and 100 Kelvin.  With the "old" metallic superconductors this could only be  achieved by adding certain compounds. Nevertheless, it took  almost 10 years before this doping technique had been mastered  from the aspect of production technology. Whether this will be  achieved for high-temperature superconductors in a similarly  long development process, is something no one dares predict.    Meanwhile, the development work continues in the United  States as well. With massive support from the U.S. Department of  Energy, the development of efficient current limiters for public  grids from high-temperature superconducting materials is to be  accelerated.    As reported by the authority, a consortium of three  enterprises and a government research laboratory headed by the  General Dynamics company (San Diego, California 92186, USA) has  been awarded almost 5 million dollars for these development  studies.    These funds are to help the company develop operational  current limiters in two to at most four years. The authority  expects that by using the new type of current limiters energy  losses on the order of 100 million dollars a year can be avoided.    Current limiters are relay-type switches which keep the  currents in high-voltage grids within certain ranges. They  reduce the network current if, for example, lightning strikes or  if there are short circuits. They protect the power consumers  against having their equipment damaged by excessively high  current.    By installing superconducting current limiters in  high-voltage networks, relatively simply constructed and cheap  power interrupters and simple fuses can be used. The investment  and operating costs of the supplying enterprises could thus be  reduced and the production of excess power be avoided.    This way the output of the supply networks can take place in  certain voltage ranges, which leads to considerable savings for  the power supply companies even at relatively modest cost.    The new high temperature superconductors which are being  used  for this are not under the influence of magnetic fields at the  limiter circuits. For that reason, even with the critical  currents of high temperature superconductors reached today they  can be used without any further difficulties.    Superconducting switching elements have the advantage over  conventional current limiters that they regulate the supply  currents with very short switching times, practically unnoticed  by the consumer, and in this manner provide largely uniform  currents.</p>

It was true, he said, that there were  good reasons for industry's share in research spending having  fallen from 62 to 58 percent, but in Japan, for example,  industry footed 80 percent of the research bill. "We must  devise new approaches," Krueger told DIE WELT. As soon as he  had taken office in May, he had appointed a strategy think tank  comprising renowned representatives from the worlds of science,  the economy, and politics.    A priority task was to amend the law -- he referred  specifically to the laws on genetic engineering, animal  protection, chemicals, and data protection -- so that  innovations would no longer be thwarted. A lasting improvement  had also to be achieved in the public's attitude to research.    Greater openmindedness with regard to research work had to  be  fostered, although the risks should not be swept under the  carpet. Another priority was to convert recent findings into  products: "We have outstanding basic research," but there were  problems when it came to converting findings into new products.    He did not intend to economize on space projects. Unmanned  space flight was increasingly approaching the commercial  viability stage. However, one country could not shoulder  larger-scale problems alone, and Krueger sets his sights on  collaboration with the Americans and Russians in this connection.    Krueger is satisfied "by and large" with his ministry's  budget appropriation. Although it had not been raised, he had  obtained an extra 150 million German marks [DM] for work in  eastern Germany in the budget debate. He hoped that this would  primarily enable him to accelerate industrial research, as only  1.9 percent of exported goods came from eastern Germany.    Nevertheless, a sword of Damocles in the shape of a DM5  billion cut in the federal budget hung over his ministerial  accounts, although he hoped that his ministry would not be  seriously affected by it. He no longer had to put up the  funding for the transrapid, but this in itself hardly eased the  strain on his budget, as he still had to provide DM50 million a  year for the associated research. Moreover, one of his  ministry's future priority concerns was to be transport research.</p>

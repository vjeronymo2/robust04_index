			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- President of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Il-song has  said that his country is willing to freeze its nuclear program  if Washington agrees to hold a third round of high-level talks  with Pyongyang, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter quoted Kim  Il-song as saying today.    "President Kim Il-song said that North Korea (DPRK) would  freeze its nuclear program, but with assurance that a third  round of talks would take place and that North Korea could  replace the present nuclear reactor system," Carter said at a  press conference.    "But he did not agree to permanent freezing of the nuclear  exercises, nuclear activities in North Korea," Carter said,  adding that Kim Il-song made it clear that this is possible  "only if there is assurance of light water reactor technology  being available to North Korea."    Carter returned here Saturday [18 June] morning via the  truce  village of Panmunjom following his four-day private visit to the  DPRK. He passed through Panmunjom Wednesday on his way to  Pyongyang after meeting with South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam, Deputy Prime Minister and National Unification Board  (NUB) Minister Yi Hong-ku and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu  during his three-day visit to Seoul.    The former U.S. President, who met with President Kim  Il-song  twice during his stay in Pyongyang, said that the DPRK leader  has made two specific requests.    One is that the U.S. would support the DPRK's desire to  replace graphite moderated reactor with light water reactor and  the other is that the DPRK be assured officially it will not be  subject to nuclear attack from the U.S. or other outside forces,  Carter said.    He noted that President Kim Il-song would like that to be  done within the context of the joint declaration of the DPRK and  South Korea concerning denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    Washington, Carter said, is willing to reassure the DPRK  against nuclear attack and to support inter-Korean agreement on  denuclearization.    "I was authorized to say that in the context of the  North-South Korean declaration on denuclearization, that the  U.S. will be willing to join in on such assurance," he said.    Carter quoted Kim Il-song as saying that the DPRK never has  planned to "develop nuclear weapons."    He clarified what appeared to be the major discrepancy  between him and U.S. President Bill Clinton after reports on  Friday evening that Carter informed Kim Il-song that the U.S.  stopped discussing sanctions at the United Nations and agreed to  hold the next round of high-level talks with Pyongyang.    "I informed President Kim that in my opinion, if (North  Korean) commitments were carried out, the need or effort of  sanctions would be put in abeyance and that the third round of  talks would be rescheduled soon to resolve all the issues  related to the nuclear issue," Carter said.    Referring to the effect of sanctions against the DPRK,  Carter  said, "I don't think that threat of sanctions has any effect at  all as far as damage to its economy, society is concerned."    While briefing South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on his  Pyongyang visit this morning, Carter also conveyed President Kim  Il-song's proposal for an inter-Korean summit. Kim Yong-sam  accepted the proposal forthwith.    Carter, who was visiting the Korean peninsula in a private  capacity, is expected to brief the Clinton administration as  soon as he returns to the U.S. on Saturday evening.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Travel: The last (or first) stop in western Europe - Nicholas Woodsworth boards a train for Trieste, where the northern and the Mediterranean world once fused Who travels to Venice these days? Just about everybody, it seems. We were gung ho, we were thousands strong, and we were in an Italian train heavily armed with zoom lenses, phrase books, packsacks, guitar cases, travel bags and video cameras. We - British, American, German and a dozen other nationalities - were Gulf allies. We were about to invade the Gulf of Venice. As I jumped off the train at Mestre, the rail junction 10 minutes across the water from the Venice station, I felt like a deserter: relieved. Who, on the other hand, travels to Trieste these days? Just about no-one. When the Trieste train pulled in at Mestre I found myself in a carriage with just one other passenger. There were no video cameras on this train, but gone, too, was that air of anticipation, that excited sociability that envelops travellers on their way to much-celebrated, much-visited places. Instead, there was a solitary man, in a plain white shirt, absorbed in a technical manual on the transportation of liquid oxygen. I began to wonder if my yearning for little-celebrated, little-visited places in Italy was sensible after all. I needed reassurance. I glanced at my map, following the rail line 100 miles north and east of Venice. It snaked up and over the head of the Adriatic Sea, then down a narrow corridor of Italian territory at the top of the former Yugoslav coast. At the end of the corridor, squeezed against the water and almost entirely surrounded by the new state of Slovenia, sat Trieste. I gazed at different coloured chunks on the map. The geography here was improbable; it seemed to have little to do with the Italian world. Beyond Slovenia, just 55 miles from Trieste and the Adriatic coast, lay Austria. Not far to the north-east was Hungary. To the east, only 15 miles from Trieste through Slovene territory, began Croatia; beyond it, Bosnia. For western Europeans, Trieste sits at the end of the line. It lies in such an unlikely corner of Italy that it had to be odd and interesting. My problem was in recognising Trieste as Italian at all. Outside the railway station there were road signs for Zagreb, Lubliana and the ferry to Albania. Trabants and Zastavas mixed with Fiats and Fords. There were Italian voices in the street, but Slovene and Croat, Hungarian and Czech ones as well. More disorientating still, as I walked along the waterfront into the city centre I found I had developed split vision. To my right lay the ships, the docks, the languid early evening strollers of what was obviously a Mediterranean port. But to my left, in domed and colonnaded pomp, sat a perfectly preserved, 19th century neo-classical city - a miniature Prague, Vienna or Budapest. What had happened to the winding street, the grand confusion of architecture, the anarchy of urban planning that makes up most Italian cities? Here were broad, rectangular street patterns and large ceremonial squares, bronze statues on plinths and vast stone buildings of uniform height and window spacing. The whole thing was saved from heavy-handedness only by pseudo-Greek marble statuary, fluted columns and fussily ornate friezes on building facades. I was confused. Here was imperial magnificence, weighty civic decorum - order. It was most un-Italian. Mittel-Europa on the Adriatic? Only the strangest of histories could account for it. But I did not plumb the mysteries of Trieste's past that night. The city's behaviour after dark is as un-Italian as its architecture. Where were the crowds, the noise, the animation? Where were the young people? Wander where I would, the only people I saw on the streets were grey and elderly. Trieste was not only middle-European, it was a middle-European gerontocracy. By 9pm the city had locked up and gone to bed. I went to bed, too. I finally spotted some under-70s the next morning. They had just emerged from a private English language school. We chatted. I asked them if they knew of James Joyce. They did, of course - everyone in Trieste knows James Joyce. He is a city celebrity. For more than a decade at the beginning of the century Joyce, when he was not sitting writing in cafes, was teaching English in Trieste classrooms. I wandered in. I did not meet any avant-garde geniuses, but I did meet Richard Baudains, an English writer who supports himself in the same time-honoured fashion. We went out for a typical Trieste lunch, goulash. The language business is booming these days in the city, Baudains told me, but it is not a happy story. The local economy is shrinking, the city population in decline, work scarce and young people acquiring every job skill they can get before going to look for employment elsewhere. Magnificent and neo-classical it may be, but Trieste - distant, isolated and generally ignored - is little more than a wizened appendage of Italy. It has not always been so. When Joyce lived there Trieste was at the centre of things, a busy trading port, banking centre and continental crossroads giving Mediterranean access to one of the greatest European states of all time, the Austro-Hungarian empire. If the city has an un-Italian feel, it is because it has only been Italian for 75 years; until the end of the first world war and imperial collapse it had been part of the Habsburg possessions for more than 600 years. After the second world war it was only returned to Italy by the Allies in 1954. Even today, Trieste's Italian-ness is disputed: after years of economic neglect by Rome, a third of its citizens vote for some form of autonomy. Why shouldn't the Triestini carry on being themselves, eating goulash, if that is what they want, I ruminated over lunch. Not surprisingly, I found they do a decent strudel, too. They also linger in cafes for hours and, like the good folk of Vienna, read newspapers and contemplate political life. Anyone who has watched Italians drink coffee or talk politics - they manage to turn both into hurried and desperate acts - will appreciate the difference, and realise that measured, ordered Trieste could never become fully Italian. The more I walked around it, the more I saw Trieste as a footnote to history, a city shorn of its function. It is like a stage set after the cast of a drama has packed up and moved on. Is it destined to be forgotten for-ever? Westerners may no longer pass through the city on their way to holidays in Split, Dubrovnik and Greece. Others have taken their place, though - the thousands of eastern Europeans who swarm into the city avid not for luxury goods but basics like pots and pans. What does Trieste look like to them, I wondered? I hopped on a bus. Two hours later, in the Croatian port of Rijeka, I had some idea of the answer. It looks pretty good. From Rijeka, Trieste is not the end of the line but the start of one. If Trieste is simply neglected, Rijeka is battered. Relief convoys roll through town on their way south. On leave, weary soldiers in combat fatigues sit in cafes. The civilians of Rijeka look poor and tired. Stubble here is not a designer accessory for the trendy. Everyone has it. Even the women. But the people of Trieste and Rijeka are not so different: they are victims of a common, not-so-distant history. Before Croatian independence, before Yugoslav control, before occupation by Italian fascists between the wars, Rijeka was an imperial port. What Trieste was to the Austrians, Rijeka, her sister city, was to the Hungarians - a meeting place with the Mediterranean world. Look behind the decay of the Rijeka waterfront and you will find remnants of the same imperial magnificence found across the border, the same heavy-handed authoritarian architecture, the same elegant, neo-classical window-dressing. In the bus on the way back to Trieste we began nervously rehearsing our lines for the non-Croat-speaking officials waiting to trap us at the Italian border. 'I am to shopping in Trieste,' we learned from the one English-speaking Croat on the bus. 'I am to shopping in Trieste,' we all repeated under our breaths for the next half-hour. I grew philosophical. The wheels of history had turned before, and would turn again. Trieste was a place where the northern and the Mediterranean world once fused. Perhaps it is where east and west will fuse in the future. We are all parts of the historical process. Our missions explained, the border passed, we all got off the bus and went shopping. Trieste is only a two-hour train ride from Venice. Information can be obtained from the Italian Tourist Board, No 1 Princes St, London W1R 8AY. Tel: 071-408-1254. For the more adventurous, a trip to the Istrian peninsula in Croatia is not as dangerous as it sounds: north-eastern Italians do it all the time. Istria offers top-class Mediterranean sea-side facilities at about half the Italian price.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> AETNA ENDS ITS MORATORIUM  </P> <P> Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth-largest seller of property and casualty  insurance in California, said that it is resuming sales to new customers of  auto, homeowner and commercial liability policies. The announcement ended a  two-week moratorium on such sales while the company evaluated how the state  Supreme Court decision upholding most of Proposition 103 would be enforced. A  company spokesman said Aetna had concluded from statements made May 11 by state  Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that the state intends to allow the  insurance industry a fair rate of return in California for each line of  insurance. Numerous insurers have expressed satisfaction at Gillespie's  decision to allow a profit for each line of insurance, while a number of  consumer groups have criticized the decision.  </P></p>

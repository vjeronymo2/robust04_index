In an article to be published Sunday in Parade magazine, Maria Cooper  Janis talks about her father's appeal to women, and says "he often had to do  the turning down, and we would sometimes even joke about it. One social  Cleopatra circled around him for weeks in the South of France, barely  tolerating my mother's presence. Finally she found her moment. She swept over  to him on the steps of the Hotel du Paris in Monte Carlo and sank down at his  feet. Looking up at him, she pleaded, 'Oh, Gareee! I must have turned my ankle!  Would you please carry me upstairs?' Without missing a beat, my father looked  down and said, 'Gee, I'm so sorry, but I've got a bad back! I'll tell you what:  You stay here and I'll get the concierge to carry you.' And, with that, he  proceeded up the steps." Cooper, who made 98 films, died in 1961 at age 60.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

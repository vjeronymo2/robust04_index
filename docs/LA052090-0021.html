			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REASON AND RHETORIC ON FLAG BURNING AND FREE SPEECH  </P> <P> Your excellent picture of a young lady shredding the American flag (front page,  May 15) is unlikely to send a message to Congress where reason has so obviously  succumbed to rhetoric. I can appreciate full well what the anguished face in  the picture is "saying."  </P> <P> Call it symbolic speech or what you will, I "read her lips" as the desperate  call of an intelligent, conscientious, young person directed to the ruling  class in this nation to put an end to foreign wars and interventions, to  restore respect for the Constitution and laws of the United States, and to  embrace as a plank of our foreign policy the age-old doctrine of the comity of  nations.  </P> <P> It is a sad reflection of our times that the people who flirt so freely with  the words "democracy" and "freedom" are hellbent on the incarceration of  conscientious dissenters. What we don't seem to realize is that we are  returning to pre-independence days when the British used the sedition laws to  suppress free speech.  </P> <P> Who would have thought that only a few months ago, Congress gave standing  ovations to the two greatest dissenters of our times. They, of course, were  anti-communist dissenters. And that's another story!  </P> <P> LEO NEALON  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

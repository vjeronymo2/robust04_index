Senator  Evans says he is encouraged by what he heard during the meeting.  He says pressure from the Somali population, which is tired of  the fighting in the African nation, could also force the rival  clan leaders into agreement.    Our correspondent, James Schofield, reports:    [Begin Schofield recording] Sen. Evans' surprise meeting  with  Aidid came at the end of a week-long visit to the Horn of  Africa, during which Evans also discussed Somalia with the  presidents of Ethiopia and Eritrea. But Evans said he had not  come to broker peace, but will evaluate the situation in  Somalia. Fears have been expressed that the withdrawal of U.S.  troops by the end of March could return the country into  anarchy. But Evans said his contacts with Aidid and Ali Mahdi  were encouraging, and that Australia has no intention of pulling  out its remaining service personnel just yet. [end recording]</p>

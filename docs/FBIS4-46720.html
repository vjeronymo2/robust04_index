			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Jurgis Jurgelis, General Director of the </F> State Department of Security, by Ramune Sakalauskaite; place and  date not given: "Security Service Chief Knows Quite a Bit, But  Doesn't Say Much"]    [Text] On 20 January 1994, LIETUVOS RYTAS published an  investigative report which provided quite a few critical facts  about the activities of the country's security service. The week  before last, Seimas adopted the law governing the State  Department of Security. The name of the service was also changed  at the same time.    Compared to previous heads of the Department of Security,  51-year-old Jurgis Jurgelis, the current general director, has  headed this service the longest. He is the eighth head of the  service, having been preceded in the post by M. Laurinkus, D.  Arlauskas, V. Zedelis, Z. Vaisvila, B. Gajauskas, P. Plumpa, and  K. Mickevicius.    This LIETUVOS RYTAS journalist talked about the activities  of  the service with Jurgis Jurgelis, General Director of the State  Department of Security.    [Sakalauskaite] Can you either confirm or deny published  press reports that a great deal of specialized equipment is now  being brought into Lithuania. If this is true, is it known what  kind of equipment is involved, and do you have information on  who is using it?    [Jurgelis] In my opinion, there is a greater quantity of  petroleum being brought in than of the products you mentioned,  although I do not doubt that there could be and that there is a  demand for them. Just take a look at how many protective  services are being established in Lithuania--at banks,  enterprises, and other institutions. And all of them want to  have--and do have--specialized technology. Each system is being  established independently and the protection at some banks  outstrips the Security Service in terms of its quality, for  example, even in its signalization technology. The technology is  being used not only for spying, but also as a defensive measure.    The costs of optimally outfitting an establishment would  reach several hundred thousand U.S. dollars. At the present  time, when the import of specialized technology is not checked  very much, it is pouring in in various ways. I had the  opportunity to observe some instances--even at the state  bank--of listening apparatus operating as a radio transmitter.    [Sakalauskaite] Do you have information as to which  organizations this specialized equipment is concentrated in?    [Jurgelis] It is to be found in those which are involved in  spying, protective services, and in criminal structures.    [Sakalauskaite] Is the State Department of Security able to  check how criminal structures use the specialized equipment?    [Jurgelis] I do not know who would be capable of checking on  them at the present time.    [Sakalauskaite] Does this mean that criminal groups can  listen to what the general prosecutor is saying in his office?    [Jurgelis] I do not doubt that such technical possibilities  exist. The prosecutor's windows are not screened from the  outside. It is possible to hear what is being said in the office  over a certain distance, based on the vibrations of the glass  window panes.    [Sakalauskaite] Has the department gotten to the bottom of  the listening equipment found in the office of R. Visokavicius,  the former chairman of the directorate of the Bank of Lithuania?    [Jurgelis] This investigation was conducted by the police; I  do not know what conclusions were reached ultimately.    [Sakalauskaite] In one interview, President A. Brazauskas  appealed to the public for the return of documents removed from  KGB headquarters. Perhaps some documents have already been  returned?    [Jurgelis] I haven't heard of even a single sheet being  returned. At any rate, I am certain that there will be no flood  of people returning documents.    [Sakalauskaite] Is the service conducting an investigation  to  try to determine who stole the documents? Is the service trying  to get them returned?    [Jurgelis] We are interested in the material that the KGB  removed after the putsch. Russian ambassador to Lithuania N.  Obertyshev stated that his country refused to negotiate on the  issue of the removed documents, asserting that there was no law  governing such a procedure. I do not think that a law is needed  to have something returned that was stolen. The KGB removed the  documents at a point in time after independence was  reestablished. Russia is also not returning historical documents  of the pre-war Lithuanian security service. These documents  contain information about historical, pre-war personages. The  ambassador's statement notwithstanding, a discussion of the  issue should still be initiated. I understand that Russia is  afraid that we will learn about the entire secret service that  worked in our country. That is why they also do not want to  return operational materials in which Russia's interests are  reflected.    I already had information after the putsch about the removal  of the documents from the KGB building. I have no doubt  whatsoever that R. Baltusis, a national defense department  worker (who is an alumnus of the Klaipeda nautical school, the  former head of the Klaipeda motorized troop batallion, holds the  rank of major, and whom the Ministry of Defense sent on a  training internship to the United States--R.S.), and S. Simkus,  who earlier worked in the security department, were involved  when the files were stolen. And incidentally, a third, still  unidentified person, participated in the operation as well. The  files were transported by automobile. There are no doubts  regarding the participation by the aforementioned individuals in  the theft or the fact of the theft itself. There were witnesses  at the time, the majority of whom changed their testimony after  some time. It subsequently turned out that 11-12 bags of  material from Section I (foreign intelligence) were stolen. It  is possible that there is information in there about scientists  and artists who traveled throughout the world and provided the  security service with written accounts of their travels.    Criminal proceedings were brought as a result of the  aforementioned thefts, but they were cancelled when there was a  lack of evidence, because some individuals, as I mentioned,  changed their accounts. When I was a member of the Supreme  Council commission investigating the activities of the KGB, I  associated with witnesses who related how specific individuals  packed bags, carried them, opened the gates, and removed the  load. We also knew about a conversation between the individuals  who were guarding the building and the individuals who were  transporting the bags. There were also some minor thefts. Other  new things are becoming known as well. However, when compared  with the trucksful removed to Russia, the thefts by Lithuanians  are not major ones. There is no doubt that the KGB files went  astray into private hands.    [Sakalauskaite] Are you aware of people being blackmailed  with the stolen files?    [Jurgelis] Yes, I have heard that there were attempts to do  this.    [Sakalauskaite] Democratic countries have analytical  services  which strive to predict events in their own as well as in other  countries. Has such an institution been established in  Lithuania, how many people work there, and who receives its  product?    [Jurgelis] An analytical section has been established in the  department. Although quite a few people work there, it is not  sufficiently strong. Salaries are not large, and there is a lack  of specialists. The section collects and analyzes both official  and public information. All countries have such sections within  their security services. Another section processes operational  material. If one wants to have a complete picture, the analysts'  material has to be merged with the results obtained by the  operational section. In accordance with the law, we provide  information to the Presidency, the Government, and the  prosecutor's office. We could perhaps also provide some open  information to members of Seimas as well, but this is not  outlined in the law.    [Sakalauskaite] A reorganization was supposed to start in  the  service you head at the end of last year. Has the process of  change concluded? What are some of the more distinct changes and  innovations?    [Jurgelis] It was thought at the end of last year that the  law governing the Security Department would be adopted. However,  the deliberation and the adoption of the law dragged out over  more than three sessions. When I arrived to head the service,  some were actively proposing to start a reorganization, even  though there had been very many such reorganizations up to that  time. It isn't smart to proceed as at times in the past, when  the goal was solely to let people go, because after receiving  their notice of dismissal, they will do no work the remaining  two months. I never considered a personnel reorganization, when  the goal is to let certain people go and to accept others. The  law grants me the right to handle personnel in a way that  protects the service's interests. The primary reasons for  dismissing someone from his position are deteriorating health,  loss of confidence, loss of citizenship, renunciation of one's  oath.    [Sakalauskaite] The press has reported that former political  prisoners previously worked in the service. Is this tradition  being continued, have you succeeded in structuring the system in  such a way that political parties or movements would not exert  an influence on your workers?    [Jurgelis] I believe that very different types of people can  work in the department. What they were before is not important;  what is important is what they are now. The service is obligated  to be depoliticized. Former political prisoners work in our  service now, too. At present there are almost no more factual  reports of workers who are influenced by parties or social  movements.    [Sakalauskaite] Last year, Russian special services detained  a couple of Estonian intelligence officers. We are not aware of  any reports of Lithuanians being trapped by Russian  counterintelligence. Do we not have any such officers, or are  they working very skillfully?    [Jurgelis] Let the Russian special services fish for our  intelligence officers and believe that we have them. In fact,  keeping intelligence officers stationed abroad is very  expensive. The majority of information can be obtained via  official channels.    [Sakalauskaite] Why didn't the Security department react to  published stories in the press about U.S. intelligence offices  that have been established in Lithuania? Did you learn about  this fact from the press? If not, what more can you tell us  about the activities in Lithuania by the U.S. and the  corresponding services of other countries?    [Jurgelis] Since I do not have sufficient information on  this  issue, I would not want to talk about it.    [Sakalauskaite] Can you confirm or deny stories that  Lithuanian security has information about residents and  intelligence officers of foreign countries working here, but is  not undertaking any action against them because it doesn't know  how to deal with them?    [Jurgelis] We have information about intelligence activities  in Lithuania by certain foreign countries, but I would not care  to detail them for the press.    [Sakalauskaite] I have heard that before the war, Lithuanian  security had recruited a newspaper editor for 400 litas a month.  Do you have reliable, or perhaps even more closely linked people  among journalists? What are the financial arrangements with them?    [Jurgelis] We do not have any such journalists. This kind of  connection is quite widely used in the world, even at the  highest levels.    [Sakalauskaite] According to Dutch law, each citizen of the  country has the right to know how much of the money allocated to  the special services is spent on listening gear, on intelligence  officers, and on other requirements. Does Lithuania intend to  adopt similar measures?    [Jurgelis] The decision by the Seimas to announce--when  approving the budget--how funds would be spent, including funds  allocated to the security department, exceeds in terms of its  democratic nature the standard used in most Western countries.  On the other hand, will a security service that is defending the  interests of a country make information public that is useful  for the special services of foreign countries? I do not believe  that all information about funds ought to be published. I am not  contending that there should be no control over how funds are  used. The Seimas National Security Committee currently executes  oversight functions. I believe that a confidential oversight  service ought to be created.    [Sakalauskaite] At a press conference that took place at the  beginning of the year, you informed us about presumptions that  the remains of bishop V. Borisevicius and about a thousand other  victims of torture by the NKVD in 1944-1947 might be buried on  the outlying estate of Tuskulenai (on the grounds of the  Interior Ministry's House of Culture and Sport). Has the version  of events which you mentioned proven to be correct?    [Jurgelis] Yes. We have not yet done any excavating, but I  am  certain that about a thousand people are buried on the grounds  of the outlying estate of Tuskulenai, people who were sentenced  to death and shot or who were brought in from the outlying  districts around Vilnius as resistance fighters who had died.    [Sakalauskaite] On what basis do you draw such conclusions?    [Jurgelis] I am relying on our sources of information that  we  will reveal at the appropriate time. In acordance with the  established order of things at that time, a sentence would be  carried out in the prison cells at KGB headquarters, and the  corpses would be transported to the outlying estate of  Tuskulenai, which was surrounded by a fence.    I believe that we will succeed in determining the identities  of the buried and to announce who executed the sentence. We  expect to begin excavations at the end of April or beginning of  May.</p>

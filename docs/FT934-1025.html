			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (16): Clear winner of the crisis - Profile: Svenska Handelsbanken Svenska Handelsbanken is one of the clear winners of the Nordic banking crisis. It has suffered much lower losses than its rivals and is the only leading bank in Sweden, Norway or Finland which neither received nor sought any form of state assistance. The bank's reputation has clearly benefited, enabling it to pick up market share. It also fares better than most of its rivals in terms of credit rating and customer satisfaction. And yet, with clear signs that the worst of the Swedish banking crisis is over and many competitor banks recapitalised, it remains uncertain whether the bank will derive any significant long-term commercial advantage from its performance. Signs that Handelsbanken had turned the corner to better times have been clear since the first quarter. By the nine-month stage, profits had reached SKr1.39bn compared with a SKr883m loss in the same 1992 period. The improvement can be attributed to a 30 per cent rise in profits before credit losses to SKr6.67bn and to a 12 per cent fall in credit losses to SKr5.28bn. Analysts are now predicting a full year profit of about SKr1.8-2bn, after last year's SKr840m deficit. So what did Handelsbanken do right, when so many other Nordic banks foundered on the rocks of financial deregulation? In one sense, it simply benefited from having weathered a crisis of its own in the early 1970s which led to tighter credit control procedures. This meant that when the Swedish financial market was deregulated in 1985, it did not chase new business as aggressively as other banks, putting its emphasis on profitability, not volume. A significant result of the strategy was that Handelsbanken lent less to property companies and therefore it suffered less from the collapse in property values which lie at the heart of Sweden's banking crisis. Last year, for example, real estate accounted for 60 per cent of the bank's SKr8bn lending losses, compared with the Swedish average of 75 per cent. The bank highlights two other reasons for its success. One is an emphasis on competence and decision-making at branch level. 'If you look at the financial crises in different western countries, you often see that some of the worst credit decisions have been taken by banks without local knowledge,' says Mr Arne Martensson, the bank's chief executive The other is a relentless drive to cut costs. Handelsbanken already claims to have the lowest cost base of any Nordic bank, because it has held down staff numbers even though it has maintained a large number of branches as part of its emphasis on local market expertise. Far from being complacent about its market position, it promises further cost-cutting to maintain its competitive edge. The question now is whether Handelsbanken will benefit from the goodwill associated with its performance. It has certainly gained market share in the past three years - its share of total lending among Swedish banks rose from 16.5 per cent to 17.3 per cent between 1990 and 1992, while its share of total deposits increased to 15.3 per cent from 13.9 per cent. Making further gains, however, will be harder, as Mr Martensson acknowledges, now that the bank's competitors are showing clear signs of recovering their strength. SE Banken has rebuilt it balance sheet with a SKr5.3bn rights issue, while state-owned Nordbanken, stripped of the bulk of its bad loans, has rebounded strongly into profit. Mr Martensson says bluntly that the state gave Nordbanken too much support to the clear competitive disadvantage of the country's other banks. One sign that Handelsbanken is determined not to lose out in the battle for business as the Swedish economy recovers was its decision to launch a SKr2.7bn rights issue during the autumn. This lifted its capital adequacy ratio to 12.4 per cent, far higher than the 9.4 per cent level it reached in 1989 when bank profits were at a peak. Part of the reason the bank wanted such a strong balance sheet was to improve its credit rating, but it also wanted funds to help build up its bank network throughout the Nordic region. It already has seven branches in Norway, following the acquisition of Oslo Handelsbanken in 1990 and Stavanger Bank in 1991, and it has started up operations in Denmark and Finland. 'Our ambition is to build up the type of operation which we have in Sweden in other Nordic countries,' says Mr Martensson. Here, too, the bank is unlikely to have things all its own way because SE Banken has recently announced plans to set up offices in Oslo and Helsinki. But Mr Martensson believes Handelsbanken has gained a head start on its rivals, partly because it was able to exploit the banking crises in both Norway and Finland to get an earlier foothold on better terms. The bank is also aiming to build up its life insurance business in Sweden. It is already the country's fifth-largest life insurer with a 7 per cent market share. Given that Handelsbanken is also seeking to develop its banking operations in Sweden, it came as some surprise when it pulled out of the bidding for Gota Bank, the state-owned bank, earlier this month. Mr Martensson said the price being sought by the government was 'far too high' and the bank would be risking its credit rating and international competitiveness if it went ahead with the purchase.</p>

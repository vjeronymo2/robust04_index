			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Cresson accuses Germany over state aid Germany was treated yesterday to a taste of the abrasive style of Mrs Edith Cresson, writes Christopher Parkes in Hanover. Beleaguered but unbowed, the French prime minister stunned German industrialists by announcing that they enjoy more state aid than their French counterparts. Opening the Hanover Fair, Europe's biggest annual business show, she launched a vigorous defence of French industrial policy as a model for the European Community. While the Bonn government wavers on the issue, which is pencilled into the Maastricht Treaty on economic and political union, German industry stoutly rejected the idea. Mrs Cresson also demanded support for Jacques Delors' call for increased EC budget contributions and more transfers from the rich to the poorer states. This is another delicate issue in cash-strapped Germany, which is struggling to rebuild the Eastern economy.</p>

The Syrian side  will contribute the remaining costs of equipment in addition to  providing the land, the building, and the other requirements of  the project. It will receive 51 percent of the profits. The  project, which will be under joint Syrian-Chinese management,  will begin production nine months after obtaining the approvals  and completing the necessary legal procedures.    -- A plant for assembling micro-buses which will also be  established in the free zone under the same previous terms.    -- A plant for assembling electronic products (computers,  TV sets, VCR's, calculating machines, and so forth).    -- A plant for ordinary bicyles to be established in the  Hims Governorate.    -- A plant for metal cans (to cover the needs of mineral  water and soft drink plants in the countries of the region) with  a production ranging from 300 to 500 million cans annually.    -- A plant for spark plugs with a production of 200  million annually at a cost of $8.5 million.

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Kravchuk denied extra power The Ukrainian parliament yesterday blocked President Leonid Kravchuk's bid for additional power. It also refused to give Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister, the extraordinary authority over the economy he requested, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.

Parliament's vote is a serious defeat for Mr Kravchuk, who last month undermined his prime minister's request for greater economic authority by launching his own bid for extra powers. The parliamentary speaker, Mr Ivan Pliushch, put the president's proposed constitutional amendments to two ballots but still failed to push them through.</p>

During detailed discussions in Salalah on  a wide range of issues, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Omani  Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id reviewed the latest situations in  occupied Kashmir, Afghanistan, Palestine, and Bosnia, and  reacted strongly to the atrocities being committed by Indian  forces against the innocent Kashmiris. Expressing serious  concern over the situation in Kashmir, Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id  stressed the need for a solution to the Kashmir problem, which  is in the best interests of both India and Pakistan.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto apprised the Omani sultan of  the latest situation in occupied Kashmir, saying Kashmir is the  core issue between India and Pakistan and it needs to be  resolved in accordance with the UN resolutions. As a first step  in this direction, human rights violations in occupied Kashmir  should be stopped to create a congenial atmosphere for  meaningful negotiations. India, she said, should allow people  from other countries to visit occupied Kashmir and assess the  situation. The prime minister reiterated that an Islamic  Conference Organization mission should be allowed to visit  occupied Kashmir.    During the talks, Benazir Bhutto suggested a more frequent  exchange of views between Pakistan and Oman on regional and  international issues. The two countries should lay the  foundations for wider economic cooperation because there are  many areas in which they can increase cooperation. Potential  areas of cooperation include the delimitation of the maritime  boundary; defense production; a gas pipeline project; joint  ventures to establish chemical fertilizer plants; a ferry  service between Karachi, Gwadar, and Oman; and the export of  manpower from Pakistan to Oman.    Radio Pakistan special correspondent Abdul Aziz Khan reports  in his dispatch from Salalah that during their talks at the  (Qasr-i al-Bosin), Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Sultan  Qabus Bin-Sa'id discussed several agreements. The talks were  held in the atmosphere of trust and goodwill that is  traditionally found between the two neighboring countries. Our  correspondent says the two leaders attached special importance  to the expansion of fraternal relations between Pakistan and  Oman and also reviewed the security arrangements in the Gulf and  the current status of the Economic Cooperation Organization.</p>

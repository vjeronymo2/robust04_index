			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The United States  and North Korea are expected to hold an unofficial working-level  contact this week to wrap up their negotiations on inspection of  North Korean nuclear facilities, diplomatic sources said Monday.    The United States will then hand over detailed plans for  inspection to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for  it to work out with North Korea, the sources said.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers, meanwhile, told her  weekly press briefing Monday that the talks between the United  States and North Korea were making "good progress, and we'll  have an announcement...hopefully soon."    "We continue to insist on full inspections," Myers said. "We  think we're going to get inspections, and we will continue to  work with the North Koreans as we work toward a final resolution  of this."    Although there had been some progress in the U.S.-North  Korean talks, they were by no means completed, Myers said.    "As Secretary (of State Warren) Christopher said last week,  that we're moving toward inspection," she said. "That's  important."    Asked about North Korean President Kim Il-song's New Year's  Day statement that the North Koreans had reached some sort of  agreement with the United States, Myers said, "I think that  that's the status of the dialogue now. We are still in  dialogue. So, I don't want to suggest that it's completed. But  I think President Kim sort of indicated that there will be  inspections."    In this connection, the diplomatic sources said that the  United States had wanted to conclude its negotiations on  inspections on all seven nuclear sites before 1993 was over, but  because of some differences of opinion that cropped up in the  final stage, they had to be carried over to new year.  Therefore, the United States and North Korea will hold another  contact in New York this week to work the differences out, they  said.    Unless North Korea comes up with unexpected conditions, the  two sides will be able to decide on the venue for talks between  North Korea and the IAEA, they said, indicating that the site of  North Korean-IAEA meeting had been the stumbling block.    As soon as the IAEA inspection gets underway, the United  States will directly announce the date for a third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks and the suspension of the  "Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea.    The announcement will also contain a virtual agreement  between the United States and North Korea on the nuclear issue,  the sources said.    As for the venue for North Korea-IAEA talks, the possibility  cannot be ruled out that the two sides can decide on it through  a telephone contact, the sources said. But the sources said  they could not be optimistic about the outcome of the IAEA-North  Korea talks since Washington and Pyongyang have not worked out  details on the IAEA's regular inspection.    Over at the State Department, meanwhile, spokesman Mike  McCurry told his weekly briefing that the dialogue between the  United States and North Korea "certainly made some progress and  we expect to continue our discussions."    Asked to clarify the North Korean Foreign Ministry statement  that the talks had made "a breakthrough," McCurry said, "I'm not  sure we said anything as staggering as `breakthrough'."    With regard to Kim Il-song's New Year's Day message on a  joint statement soon to be issued, McCurry said he believed what  Kim meant was that "there could be progress on this issue  through negotiation, and I think that we believe that's an  accurate assessment."</p>

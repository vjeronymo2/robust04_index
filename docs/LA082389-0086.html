			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY ENJOY ESPRIT DE ALBACORE;  </P> <P> EVEN SKEPTICS BELIEVE THAT PRIZED SPORTFISH FINALLY HAS RETURNED  </P> <P> For those aboard the Pacific Dawn, the tiny clump of floating kelp had a  special significance. Beneath it could have been the source of excitement not  seen in these parts in more than three years.  </P> <P> Skipper John Shull guided the sportfisher slowly past the brown paddy --  floating kelp is known to attract open-sea species of fish -- when suddenly,  the sound of line screaming from two trolling rigs filled the air, followed by  the cry, "Hookup!"  </P> <P> Fishermen scrambled for their equipment and toward the bait tanks. Those  trolling either reeled in or fought their fish. It was apparent then that all  were starving for that long-awaited "tuna fix."  </P> <P> Soon, two sizable yellowtail were brought to the surface by the trollers. They  were gaffed and hauled onto the deck. A few fishermen looked disappointed.  </P> <P> "I thought for sure they were going to be tuna," one of them muttered, hoping  to see for himself that the prized albacore were indeed back, as reported.  </P> <P> Shull, owner and skipper of the Pacific Dawn, repositioned the boat over some  fish he had metered near the kelp paddy and soon all doubts were removed.  </P> <P> A yellow iron produced a strike and minutes later a silvery-blue fish was  gaffed and brought over the rail. A chorus of "Albie!" rang out.  </P> <P> Another hookup, this time on a live anchovy. Another shining fish gaffed and  brought flopping upon the deck.  </P> <P> Albacore!  </P> <P> These premium tuna, the absence of which baffled experts and severely injured  local sportfishing, were well within range of the overnight fishing fleet.  </P> <P> They hit the deck one after another during a frantic bite that lasted for  nearly two hours in offshore Mexican waters barely 80 miles south of here.  </P> <P> The fishermen flung their anchovies as best they could into the wind and moved  from one side of the stern to the other, following their drifting baits as they  were swept by the currents. Others plucked fresh baits from the tanks and  returned to their place in the fast-moving "A-Train." Those who were hooked up  raced up and down the deck trying to keep up with the small but powerful tuna.  The crew worked frantically to keep up.  </P> <P> One deckhand worked the gaff and systematically plucked tuna -- including some  sizable bluefins -- out of the water and onto the deck. The other oversaw the  action while standing atop the bait tanks, tossing anchovies over the rail to  keep the schooling fish near the boat and watching for fish on the surface.  </P> <P> "Boil on the starboard bow!" he yelled, and the nearest fishermen cast,  bellowing, "Fresh fish!" if a fish took the bait.  </P> <P> Skipper Shull, meanwhile, helped with the gaffing and gave sound advice to  those in need of such.  </P> <P> "If Mr. Penn had wanted a thumb on that spool, he would have put one there," he  said to one fisherman trying to stop a sizzling run with his thumb on the spool  of a Penn reel.  </P> <P> The sacks filled quickly with albacore averaging about seven pounds and a few  bluefin tuna in the 20- to 40-pound class.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel's Brad Bridges, who had already boated a yellowtail, bluefin and  a few albacore, hooked into a dorado under the kelp but lost the colorful fish  when it leaped out of the water and shook the hook.  </P> <P> Soon, however, the hookups became less frequent. The fish that still showed on  Shull's meter had moved into deeper water and were less active. The decision to  move was made and the trolling lines set out.  </P> <P> The once-quiet galley now echoed with happy chatter.  </P> <P> "This is the best bite in years," said Bob Curtis, 61, who has fished for  albacore for 25 years. "I'm not in shape for this. I really should be  elsewhere."  </P> <P> John Mantele, a 30-year veteran on the albacore circuit, said he watched the  counts rise steadily before making his reservations.  </P> <P> "I called up my partner, got his (answering) machine and just said, 'They're  back,' and he knew what I meant," he said.  </P> <P> Across the horizon, other sportfishers, many of which had long been idle, were  visible in every direction, searching for the longfins. Competition between  skippers was evident as they monitored each others' successes and failures via  radio -- all hoping to be "top boat" by day's end.  </P> <P> Beneath overcast skies and amid a steady west wind, those aboard the Pacific  Dawn encountered similar but shorter-lived bites throughout late morning and  early afternoon, including one during which bluefin tuna in the 50-pound-plus  range crashed the albacore party, sending a few ill-prepared fishermen into  muscle-wrenching battles.  </P> <P> Oxnard's Mark Wallace had his entire spool of line stripped from his reel.  Others struggled with the meaty bluefins for what seemed eternity. Greg Bayme  of Laguna Niguel landed what later won the boat's jackpot: a bluefin tuna that  easily weighed more than the boats's 50-pound scale could measure.  </P> <P> Using 20-pound-test line, Bayme started on one side of the boat and ended up on  the other, where he stood for more than 30 minutes as the fish sounded time and  again before finally succumbing.  </P> <P> "Everyone was saying some guy got spooled and I though I was next," a smiling  Bayme said after boating the tuna.  </P> <P> Between bites, Shull continued to roam the choppy seas as twilight slowly  turned to darkness. The passengers had retired to the galley, where dinner was  being prepared.  </P> <P> An hour or so had passed without incident when the alarm sounded again: line  screaming from one of the trolling rigs and the cry, "Hookup!" Food and drink  were left at the tables, tossed about the galley by the growing seas.  </P> <P> Half of those aboard hooked up almost at once in the most chaotic bite of the  day. The fishermen whooped and stomped their way up and down the rails, over  and under the lines of the others. Grasping for fresh bait, they stepped  hurriedly over the flopping tuna that quickly littered the deck to catch "just  one more."  </P> <P> By day's end, the bite Curtis called the best in years had become "the best in  ages."  </P> <P> The limited load of 18 passengers -- who paid $150 apiece -- had combined for a  total of 85 albacore, 19 bluefin tuna, four yellowtail and Bridges' bull  dorado. The bull dorado was caught shortly before dark, giving him a  four-species day. One of the better counts of a 1 1/2-day trip had been radioed  back to Fisherman's Landing and the Pacific Dawn could be labeled top boat.  </P> <P> When word of the albacore showing 200 miles south of here was received early  last month -- from a commercial bait boat passing through the area en route to  Cabo San Lucas -- the landing operators were wild with optimism. The fish were  very small and the size of the schools unknown, but trips were organized  nevertheless.  </P> <P> Three- and five-day boats began to report encouraging numbers of the fish.  Experts, who said the three-year absence of albacore is a normal occurrence,  implied that conditions were such to allow for a northward migration.  </P> <P> However, some overnight boat captains were skeptical of the reports.  </P> <P> Nick Cates, owner-operator of the New Lo Anne, said: "I'm not excited. Those of  us who have been around know better. Most of us have been through this before."  </P> <P> Business was hurting, and skippers such as Cates were tired of being teased by  the presence of small albacore well out of their reach. He and others suggested  that these fish may have come from a resident population at Guadalupe Island  and would soon disappear.  </P> <P> But six weeks passed and feelings have changed. These albacore did move north  and it became evident that sizable schools of albacore were within reach.  </P> <P> Small albacore, maybe, but albacore nevertheless.  </P> <P> "They taste the same and they still put up a good fight," Paul Morris,  Fisherman's Landing manager, said.  </P> <P> Bluefin tuna, bigger and more powerful and in the same area, have been getting  some attention lately, Shull said. "But mention albacore and (fishermen) go  nuts."  </P> <P> Apparently so. Last year at this time, some skippers claimed to be operating at  as low as 20% of potential, despite the presence -- albeit scattered -- of  bluefin and bigeye tuna. Now, the landings are operating "at or close to 100%,"  Morris said.  </P> <P> Parking is a mess. Boats are coming and going at all hours. Cartloads of tuna  are regularly being lugged up the ramps and telephones are ringing off the  hooks.  </P> <P> "Now if only it'll last another month or so," Shull said.  </P></p>

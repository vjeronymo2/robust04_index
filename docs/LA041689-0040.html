			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GALLANT LADY  </P> <P> I recommend the Gallant Lady's cruise in the San Juan Islands. Read about it in  your Travel Section last July (Travel Tips, July 24) and was there two weeks  later. A welcome change of pace. Scenic, relaxing and excellent food. A true  labor of love for Capt. Dick, his wife Lyn, family and crew. Nice people. A fun  trip! For information, contact Gallant Lady Cruises, P.O. Box 1250, Vashon,  Wash. 98070, or call (206) 463-2073.  </P> <P> VIRGINIA McKINNEY  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

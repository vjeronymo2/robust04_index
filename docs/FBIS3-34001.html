			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, Feb 2 (AFP)--Two more Omani banks are  planning to merge to benefit from attractive incentives offered  by the Central Bank to encourage mergers as part of overall  economic reforms in the oil-rich Gulf state.    The Oman Arab Bank (OAB) and the Oman-European Bank (OEB)  have been involved in negotiations for merger, which will be the  third in Oman since the Central Bank announced the incentives  three years ago, bankers said on Wednesday [2 February].    "We are holding negotiations but they are still in their  initial stages," OAB general manager, 'Abd-al Qadir 'Asqalan,  told AFP by telephone from Muscat.    "The capitals of both banks already meet the requirements  set  by the Central Bank but the merger is in line with the  government policy to cut the number of banks and strengthen the  banking sector."    Oman had 11 national banks and 12 foreign units before  mergers were launched and the Central Bank issued instructions  for raising their capital to at least 10 million Omani riyals  (26 million dollars).    The first mergers involved the Bank of Muscat with Al-Ahli  Bank and the Oman Commercial Bank with the Omani Al-Masraf  institutions. All of them merged to ensure their capital meet  Central Bank requirements and to raise their adequacy in line  with guidelines by the Bank for International Settlement [BIS].    Central Bank incentives for merging banks include a deposit  of 10 million riyals (26 million dollars) for 10 years with an  interest rate of three percent and exemption of taxes on  profits for five years.    Officials have said they wanted to halve the number of banks  on the grounds the local market is relatively small.    "Mergers will strengthen the banking sector as they will  boost the financial position of banks and cut competition in the  local market," said Mansur al-Zakwani, banking chief at the  Omani Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "This will also enable  banks to face foreign competition."    'Asqalan, whose bank is owned by the Jordanian Arab Bank and  the Omani International Company for Development and Investment,  said merging with OEB could give birth to a bank with a capital  of 20 million riyals (52 million dollars) as the two have a  capital of 26 million dollars each.    "We do not want to talk about the situation now as we have  not yet entered into details. But we might raise the capital  later," he said.    Other Gulf states are urging their banks to merge or raise  their capital to strengthen their financial position and meet  the eight-percent level set by BIS as a floor for capital  adequacy, the ratio between shareholders equity and assets. The  BIS move, which took effect in January, is intended to ensure  banks worldwide have enough funds to face a financial crisis.    Most of them have reported positive results of their  measures, which included stronger intervention in banks, regular  inspection of their balance sheets and incentives to merging  units. In the United Arab Emirates, officials said the adequacy  of the country's 47 banks had exceeded 10 percent.    The banking measures in Oman run parallel with large-scale  reforms to revive the economy and lessen reliance on unstable  oil earnings.    The reforms include privatisations, freeing interest rates  on  loans, new incentives to investors, opening up the stock market,  and upgrading the infrastructure to attract foreign capital.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hartons cuts losses to Pounds 0.33m Hartons Group, the distributor of semi-finished plastics, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 325,000 for the six months to June 30. Turnover dropped 22 per cent from Pounds 33.1m to Pounds 25.7m, largely because of the disposal of a French subsidiary in March. Turnover for continuing operations rose slightly from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds 24m. Losses per share worked through at 0.7p (2.8p) and no dividend is declared.</p>

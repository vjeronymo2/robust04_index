			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Sofia seeks new ways to revive Soviet trade BULGARIA is seeking new ways to finance and revive trade with the Soviet Union, after this market and those of the former Comecon countries virtually collapsed earlier this year. But Bulgarian officials stress they do not want to be completely dependent on the Soviet Union again, for fear their own enterprises will not make the necessary adjustments to western markets. Until 1989, 80 per cent of Bulgaria's total trade was with Comecon countries, the Soviet Union accounting for 60 per cent, and eastern Europe, 20 per cent. In the first quarter of 1991, compared to the first quarter of 1990, Bulgaria's trade with the Soviet Union fell from 60 to 50 per cent, and trade with eastern Europe, from 23 to 11 per cent. Mr Atanas Paparizov, Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, believes trade can be revived through a payments union, similar to the European Payments Union set up in 1950 to break down the bilateral and quantitative controls which marked trade in western Europe in the 1930s. Largely financed by the US, this let currencies in western Europe be freely transferable between each other, and provided credit to help settle each country's monthly net position with other members. Mrs Mariana Todorova, deputy minister for foreign economic relations, and Mr Ivan Pushkarov, minister for industry and trade, oppose such an idea. 'A Payments Union is redundant. We do not need to keep these relations as they are. It means maintaining the old structures. Instead, we must restructure our trade. We have to diversify,' Mrs Todorova said. Mr Pushkarov believes privatisation and a new foreign investment law will help shift Bulgaria's dependence away from the Soviet Union, enabling Bulgaria to earn hard currency to pay for Soviet oil imports. Trade with the Soviet Union collapsed partly because of the switch to hard currency payments between itself and its former east European allies. The Soviet Union reneged on its energy contracts with Bulgaria, whose energy-intensive industrial sector depends on oil imports. Until 1989, Bulgaria imported 11m tonnes of oil from the Soviet Union. In 1990, deliveries fell 20 per cent, to 7.8m tonnes. Earlier this year, the Soviet Union agreed to supply 5m tonnes for 1991, or 400,000 tonnes a month. Bulgaria received only 200,000 tonnes for January and the same amount for February.</p>

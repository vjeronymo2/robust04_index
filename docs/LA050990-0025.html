			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE CHANGES ELECTION POLICIES  </P> <P> Community advisers for the North Hollywood Redevelopment Project Tuesday night  unveiled new regulations to tighten up the group's election procedures after  voter confusion at a meeting two months ago ended in a shoving match.  </P> <P> The 16-member group is called the Project Area Committee or PAC.  </P> <P> The new rules, which PAC members will vote on at next month's meeting, call for  voters and candidates in attendance on election night to provide proof that  they reside or own a business in the 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment  zone. Residents must show identification containing a picture, such as a  driver's license, and merchants will have to bring a copy of their business  license before being allowed to vote for PAC members.  </P> <P> Election notifications would be published in a newspaper, and elections would  be held at the first PAC meeting 30 days after publication.  </P> <P> The committee did not reschedule the controversial elections to fill nine  vacancies on the volunteer panel.  </P> <P> "We feel these changes are appropriate and basically nail down all our  procedures," David Gered said. "We want to make sure elections are fair and for  everyone to know what kind of proof is needed."  </P> <P> The regulations stemmed from a contentious meeting in March, when several  redevelopment foes from Hollywood accused the PAC of conducting elections  tainted by insufficient public notice and confusing rules on voter eligibility.  </P> <P> Amid the confusion, two North Hollywood PAC members walked out of the meeting,  depriving the panel of a quorum and leading to an abrupt, angry adjournment.  When a Hollywood resident attempted to videotape the comments of a North  Hollywood PAC member, a shoving incident erupted.  </P> <P> Tuesday night, a uniformed Los Angeles police sergeant stood watch over the  meeting at the First Baptist Church on Ostego Street. Police were called by the  CRA at the request of PAC members, said Jerry Belcher, the redevelopment  project director.  </P> <P> Several Hollywood activists attended the meeting, and one man videotaped the  discussions. The Hollywood residents have long protested redevelopment plans in  their own neighborhood and have said they are determined to bring their  campaign against CRA policies to North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Norton Halper of Hollywood, one of the protesters at the previous meeting, told  the group, "It's unfortunate you may think of me in an adversarial role," but  he said the interests of the redevelopment agency and the interests of the  inhabitants of the area do not always coincide.  </P> <P> The protests come at a sensitive time for the North Hollywood redevelopment  project. The CRA is planning to mount its own drive soon to seek public  approval to empower the agency to spend tens of millions of tax dollars to  continue urban renewal in the area. The City Council and mayor will ultimately  approve the massive spending increases.  </P></p>

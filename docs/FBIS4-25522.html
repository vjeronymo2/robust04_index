			<p>BFN     [Text] From 31 May to 1 June, Chen Bangzhu, provincial  party committee deputy secretary and provincial governor,  inspected and guided work in Lingling Prefecture.    Speaking on Lingling's industrial production, Governor Chen  Bangzhu pointed out: Industrial enterprises have always been a  hard nut to crack and a focal point of Hunan's overall work. It  is imperative to speed up the enterprise property rights system  reform to give more scope to the dominant role of the public  ownership system. This, he noted, was a matter of great  significance to Hunan's overall work. In so doing, we should  see to it that state-owned assets are not siphoned off.  Moreover, we should comprehensively and unhesitatingly assist  and equip each and every city-based small factory.    Speaking about improving Lingling's industrial enterprises,  Governor Chen Bangzhu emphatically pointed out: The key to  improving Lingling's industrial enterprises lies in tapping  latent potential, laying a solid foundation, enhancing reserve  strength, and stepping up lateral cooperation.    In view of Lingling's poor and weak industrial foundation  and  irrational industrial structure, Governor Chan Bangzhu called on  comrades in charge of Lingling Prefecture to redouble efforts  and build more infrastructure facilities, including more water  supply networks, more electricity supply networks, and more  highway networks.</p>

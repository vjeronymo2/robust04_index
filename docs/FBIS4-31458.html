			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 6 (CTK) -- Imrich Kruzliak, whose  recent statement as an external adviser to the Slovak president  that the Czech Republic should recognise Sudeten Germans' right  to homeland, has aroused a great response, believes that the  Germans should acquire this right as a "moral satisfaction." He  made the former statement at the Sudeten German congress held in  Nuremberg in mid-May. The latter statement he made in an  interview with CTK.    "I wish the Sudeten Germans gain understanding on all sides  and acquire the right to their homeland," Kruzliak told CTK. "It  is impossible either to blame Sudeten Germans for the Munich  Agreement or condemn them on the principle of collective guilt.  Not only the Landsmannschaft but also official German  representatives require a solution to the problem," he stated.    "The older generations are dying out. They will not return  to the Czech Lands. The young people apparently have no strong  relation to the Czech Republic," Kruzliak commented on the Czech  fears of the return of Sudeten Germans to the Czech Lands. "None  of them insist on the revision of borders," he said, adding that  the question of Sudeten German rights to homeland could be  settled by a sort of ethnic minority rights codex, whose  adoption is being considered by the Council of Europe, the  United Nations and the European Union (EU).    "I would be glad if Czech journalists found the courage to  admit the truth about history," Kruzliak said in reaction to  "distorted information" in the press, which pointed to his  presence in Nuremberg. He resolutely denied the idea that the  statement he had made in Nuremberg on Sudeten German rights was  a call for the abolition of the Benes Decrees (providing for the  transfer of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War  Two). "The Benes Decrees cannot be simply cast off," he said.    "I was invited to the (Nuremberg) congress as a private  person," Kruzliak stressed. He added that Sudeten German leader  Franz Neubauer had introduced him as an adviser to the Slovak  president by error.    "I am nearing my eighties and I wanted to use the  opportunity  to thank the Landsmannschaft (SL) for its support from the time  of the communist oppression and for the presentation of SL's  European Charles Prize to the former Chairman of the World  Congress of Slovaks Stefan Roman in 1986," Kruzliak explained.    He described as "ridiculous" the information by the Czech  left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO that he and Neubauer embraced and  kissed. "This is not usual in the West. We always used to laugh  at the kisses exchanged between former East German and Russian  top leaders (Erich) Honecker and (Leonid) Brezhnev," added  Kruzliak, who lived in emigration for 40 years.    Jan Klepac, who is in charge of the staff of external  advisors and consultants of Slovak President Michal Kovac, said  that the "Slovak Presidential Office does not believe that  Imrich Kruzliak appeared in Nuremberg on behalf of the head of  the (Slovak) state, and Kruzliak does not claim such a position."    "We should not waste time in discussing the fact that  somebody quoted Kruzliak as having said something he has never  said," Klepac commented on Kruzliak's alleged statement on the  abolition of the Benes Decrees.</p>

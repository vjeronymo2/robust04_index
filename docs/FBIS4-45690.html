			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Monteiro: "Dealing in Death"] </F>   [Text] Enterprises in the First World are using tactical  excuses to ship toxic materials to the Third World. Brazilian  legislation has loopholes that permit the entry of such  substances. But the mobilization of ecologists resulted in  England for the first time being forced to receive return  shipments of toxic elements sent to a factory in Sao Paulo.    Environmental engineers from 26 countries approved a  recommendation to the governments of the Latin American nations  urging them to prohibit the export of toxic and hazardous waste  to Latin America, including waste that could theoretically be  recycled. This proposal was one of the main conclusions of the  Meeting on the Cross-Border Movement of Garbage and Toxic and  Hazardous Waste organized in Santiago de Chile in November by  the Economic Commission for Latin America (CEPAL), an agency  linked to the UN, and by the Secretariat of the Basel  Convention. The meeting was also attended by representatives  from environmental defense agencies such as Greenpeace and the  Caribbean Conservation Association.    Laws preventing the importing of toxic waste have been  passed  in 103 countries of the Third World. In Latin America,  Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, and Panama have  legislation restricting toxic cargo traffic. The Organization of  African Unity approved the Bamako Convention in 1991 prohibiting  the importing of toxic garbage to the African signatory  countries along with the sale of substances whose use is  prohibited in the producing countries.    In the meantime, the great difficulty confronted by the  nations of the Third World in preventing this "dealing in death"  is the failure of the government to supervise the cargo normally  shipped by Western European countries and the United States.  According to Alfredo Gastal of the Environmental Department of  CEPAL, in addition to passing restrictive laws, the countries of  the Third World need to strengthen the organizational structure  of institutions responsible for the environmental area and they  must also train officials so that domestic legislation and  international treaties may be complied with completely.    Brazil is not a member of the group of nations that prohibit  the entry of toxic waste of any kind in its territory.  Regulatory Decree 138 of the Brazilian Environmental Institute  of Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has some loopholes that  permit the entry into Brazil of waste-containing metals such as  zinc, lead, copper, chrome, among others, plus used batteries  for "recycling" and waste coming from steel production.    The current standard forbids the importing of used tires,  plastics, and chlorinated solvents. A company that wishes to buy  waste from abroad must be registered with the IBAMA and submit  an expert report from a government environmental agency  establishing that it is capable of handling the products.    Brazilian legislation on importing toxic garbage can be  improved with the help of the new regulation being analyzed by  IBAMA and as a result of the passage of the bill on this topic  introduced by Federal Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ [Green  Party--Rio de Janeiro]). The IBAMA standards will have to be  spelled out during the first half of this year and it is  probable that they will prohibit "any importing of waste except  when there is a proven need," according to Biologist Leda Famer,  who is in charge of the solid waste management program of that  institute. The criterion for spelling out the rules will be  "exclusively environmental," according to Leda.    Thanks to the exceptions provided for in the rules currently  in force, IBAMA in 1993 approved the importing of 12,000 t of  lead from the United States, Great Britain, Peru, and Puerto  Rico. The lead waste is used by battery, fuse, and metal ingot  manufacturers. The agency also authorized the entry of 35,000 t  of scrap paper into the country. Brazil is self-sufficient in  shredded paper production so that it was not necessary to import  this waste, said Leda Famer.    In spite of the organizational problems relating to the  inspection of toxic cargo shipped to Brazil, IBAMA managed to  reduce the volume of imported aluminum scrap to 600 t by August  1993. In 1991, the total exported to Brazil came to 6,254 t and  the next year the figure was 3,380. The waste is processed in  Brazil for the manufacture of radiators and aluminum alloys.    Sidney de Miguel's bill prohibits the importing and  exporting--by Brazilian enterprises--of toxic waste "of any  kind, even for recycling." According to the explanation, Brazil  still allows the entry of toxic substances for reprocessing  purposes, thus becoming "one of the last possible target  countries for unscrupulous trafficking in toxic waste."    According to the bill, companies that would like to manage  hazardous waste will have to prove that they have the technical  capacity to do so before they can go ahead. They will have to be  registered with the National Register of Hazardous Waste  Operators to be monitored by environmental agencies, and they  will have to submit a management plan to the government  authorities. They will also annually have to inform the  environmental agencies as to the quantity and nature of waste  handled, its final destination, and any possible accidents. The  bill defines the handling of hazardous waste without legal  authorization or in an inadequate manner as a crime against the  environment and public health; it calls for penalties ranging  from six months to two years imprisonment for those responsible.    The representative of the Green Party in the Federal Chamber  cited cases of damage caused by the irresponsible handling of  toxic substances such as contamination--with mercury and  lead--of at least 50 children in Vila dos Pescadores, in Cubatao  (SP [Sao Paulo]) and secret dumps of HBC, known as drill dust in  Cidade de Meninos, Caxias (RJ).    Due to current flaws in legislation and monitoring  difficulties, the participation of the environmental defense  society and agencies becomes fundamental in stopping this kind  of traffic to the underdeveloped countries. The Brazilian  section of Greenpeace at the end of 1993 prevented a load of 200  t of waste containing heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury,  lead, among others) from being "recycled" by the Produquimica  Enterprise based in Suzano (SP) for the production of  fertilizer. The waste was not biodegradable, and if it had been  used in agriculture, it could contaminate workers and consumers.    The Sao Paulo enterprise purchased a load from the British  metallurgical firm of Beaver Metals located in Birmingham in the  form of "micronutrient for fertilizer production." Alerted by  Greenpeace, which analyzed the waste in Great Britain, the State  Basic Sanitation Technology Company (CETESB) seized the cargo of  10 containers in the port of Santos to check the product's  makeup. Days later, a new lot of nine containers holding the  same cargo arrived at the terminal in Sao Paulo. CETESB proved  that the products were toxic.    Although it was toxic material, the cargo could have legally  entered the country if Produquimica had been registered with  IBAMA. Because the importing company did not take care of this  legal obligation, CETESB had a tool for demanding the return of  the cargo to England, a transaction that was completed in  January. According to company owner Gerard Walter Schultz,  importing micronutrients does not have to be authorized by  environmental agencies because those nutrients are not  characterized as toxic waste, something that was denied by the  analysis done by CETESB.    The Sao Paulo enterprise was fined more than 20 times by  CETESB for irregular dumping of waste in flowing waters, soil  contamination due to improper storage of toxic material,  exaggerated emission of particles into the atmosphere, and use  of equipment without installation license issued by CETESB.  Produquimica has until 30 June to transfer the Suzano factory  located in a watershed protection area.</p>

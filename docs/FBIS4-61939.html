			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian at 1300 GMT on  10 May carries an item on the results of the 7 May visit to  Crimea by a Ukrainian delegation headed by acting Prime Minister  Yefim Zvyahilskyy. At UNIAN's request, members of the delegation  commented on the trip to meet with Crimea's leaders.    In the view of Roman Shpek, Ukraine's economy minister,  "Crimea remains a political issue and one has to know how to be  noble. It is not worth trying to convince one another on the  telephone of incorrect approaches -- it should be done on the  basis of an analysis of local enterprises' balance sheets. As  far as relations with the regions is concerned, it is necessary  to change from confrontation to cooperation."    Roman Shpek added that last year the Supreme Council of  Crimea had turned down assistance from the IMF, the World Bank,  and the International Finance Corporation. This year, however  Crimeans asked for such help and Kiev is prepared to meet their  requests. The minister of the economy continued: "It is worth  studying carefully Yuriy Meshkov's economic decrees. Firstly,  in order to bring them into line with Ukrainian legislation and  secondly, to use the beneficial aspects of the decrees when  reforming Ukraine's taxation system."    Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, Ukraine's finance minister, said:  "Ukraine's budget relations with Crimea are set in accordance  with the 18 February 1994 treaties between the governments of  Ukraine and Crimea. The amount of taxation that can be received  by the Crimean budget for 1994 is 7.4 trillion karbovantsi.  Crimea's share in financing general state programs is 4.3  percent or 6.2 trillion. However, according to an agreement  Simferopol does not transfer these funds to Kiev. The Republic  of Crimea's expenses reach 4.7 trillion karbovantsi. It has  been agreed that Crimea should transfer just 2.7 trillion  karbovantsi to Kiev." Hryhoriy Pyatachenko added that in the  first quarter Crimea owed 500 billion karbovantsi because of a  fall in production and transferred nothing to Ukraine's budget.    Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine,  said he considered Yuriy Meshkov's decree on "Banks and Banking  Activity on the Territory of Crimea" to be the most dramatic  contradiction: "I think this law was copied from the Ukrainian  law on banks but with the difference of where it mentions the  National Bank of Ukraine, the decree mentions the Republican  Bank of Crimea which becomes the property of the Republic of  Crimea." He expressed concern at the Crimeans' insistence to  obtain the right to issue licenses for the activity of  commercial banks. In Yushchenko's opinion talks with  representatives of Crimea would continue, but the best option  would be if "they repealed the legislative acts that contradict  Ukrainian legislation." The National Bank chairman reserved the  right to "use protectionist measures to protect the national  currency from imported Crimean inflation."</p>

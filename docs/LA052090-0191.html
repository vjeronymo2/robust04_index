			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. CONTINI'S DEATH  </P> <P> I was deeply saddened to learn of Edgardo Contini's death. He was far more than  an architect.  </P> <P> He was a colleague from the UCLA campus. In a development community  characterized by glitz and slickness, he personified charm and class. It was  always a delight to interact with him, even when he was on the other side of  the bargaining table. He brought intelligence, dignity, patience, wit and a  quiet strength to the process of development. He will be sorely missed.  </P> <P> LAURA LAKE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Editor's Note: Edgardo Contini died April 28 at age 76. His obituary was  published in Section A of The Times on May 1.  </P> <P> </P></p>

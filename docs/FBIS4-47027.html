			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK news department: "Maritime Communists </F> Remark Broadly on President Kim's Visit"]    [Text] VLADIVOSTOK correspondents have been able to  establish that the events associated with the first official  visit to Russia, and to Vladivostok in particular, of Kim  Yong-sam, the first civilian president of the Republic of Korea,  were far greater than the official press reported in this  regard. In the range of political parties and movements that did  not deprive themselves of the pleasure of expressing their  attitude to the Russo-Korean summit, the communists, who did not  renounce their principles, could also be heard.    Representatives of the now numerous communist parties set up  pickets on Tuesday at the building on Aleutskaya Street, 45a,  where the consulate general of the Republic of Korea is located,  at the very time when a meeting between the Korean delegation  and leaders of the kray was beginning in the House of  Negotiations on Sanatornaya Street.    Grouping themselves under a red flag, the activists passed  out their own "Statement" to the staff of the consulate general  of the Republic of Korea and also eagerly distributed it to the  representatives of the press. The document, which was signed by  kray committees--KPRF [Communist Party of the Russian  Federation], RKKP [not further identified], and the VKPB  [All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks]--announces a "resolute  protest against the slanderous campaign unleashed by certain  circles of South Korea," and also expresses "full support of the  policy of building socialism in the DPRK."    Other documents turned over to VLADIVOSTOK correspondents  indicate that the local communists are steadfastly following the  course of communist construction in Russia as a whole. Thus, a  "Joint Statement of the Political Parties and Organizations of  Russia" (from the VKPB to the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist  Communist Youth League]) and a "Statement" of the Secretariat of  the VKPB Central Committee were disseminated under the windows  of the consulate general. These very curious texts have a very  unambiguous political slant; for example, there are passages  like this: "The All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks is proud  of the fact that a candidate for membership in the VKPB Central  Committee is Captain S.P. Subbotin who, while defending the  Korean sky from vultures, executed the first ram attack in a jet  aircraft, knocking down 11 American aircraft, of which two were  "flying fortresses." Also appearing quite natural in this  connection is the expression "full support and solidarity with  the heroic Korean people who monolithically united around the  Labor Party of Korea headed by the experienced leader Comrade  Kim Il-Song..."</p>

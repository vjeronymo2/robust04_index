"I have not heard yet that an agreement was reached in  principle," the top government spokesman told a news conference.  "I don't think we have reached an accord."    Takemura's comment followed a report in Friday's edition of  a  leading business daily, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, saying that  Washington has agreed in principle to accept an action program  Japan will finalize possibly on Tuesday.    The action program will feature the introduction of an open  bidding system for state-ordered public works projects to  eliminate any discrimination against foreign participants in  bidding.    The U.S. has threatened to impose sanctions if Japan fails  to  take steps to increase the openness of its construction market  and secure greater foreign access by January 20.    Earlier this week, four cabinet ministers reaffirmed that  the  projected action plan should be designed to boost transparency,  objectivity and free competition in Japan's construction market.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, meanwhile, expressed  hope that Japanese and U.S. negotiators would reach an agreement  in the negotiations before the January 20 deadline for possible  U.S. sanctions against Japan.    "Both Japan and the United States are engaged positively in  negotiations and therefore sanctions will be avoided," he said.    The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is  scheduled to endorse the action program at a cabinet session  Tuesday.    Government sources said the program features opening  biddings  for public works projects, allowing foreign contractors to  participate.    To be opened to foreign bidders will be national projects  exceeding 700 million yen and those of local governments worth  more than 2.7 billion yen, they said.    The sources said Washington raised no objection to the  Japanese plan during the recent informal market access  negotiations in Tokyo.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commander in Chief Ahtisaari: </F> Defense System Not To Be Changed"]    [Excerpt] Commander in Chief and President Martti Ahtisaari  noted in his first order of the day that Finland's defense is  based on an independent and believable national defense  capacity, and it does not require any changes to the current  system, but instead needs careful and goal-oriented development  work.    "This decade has shown that the changes are unpredictable  and  the reform difficult to foresee. Therefore, the words of Field  Marshal Augustin Ehrensvard, which are inscribed at the entrance  to the coastal fortification Suomenlinna, still hold true:  `Coming generations, stand on your own feet and do not trust  help from outside!'"

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PESTICIDE PLAN RAISES CONCERN FOR STATE LAWS  </P> <P> President Bush will announce a seven-point package today intended to strengthen  the nation's laws and regulations involving the use of pesticides on food  products, but environmental activists expressed alarm that the initiative could  preempt more stringent state regulations.  </P> <P> The plan, which would require legislation to be submitted to Congress later  this year, was hailed by Administration officials as a move to give regulatory  agencies authority to move with more dispatch in dealing with food safety  questions.  </P> <P> Although only a broad outline of the program was available Wednesday,  environmental officials reacted hotly to a provision that is expected to  prevent California and other states from adopting standards more restrictive  than those contained in the proposed federal law.  </P> <P> "It is a wolf in sheep's clothing," said Rick Hind of the U.S. Public Interest  Research Group.  </P> <P> Similar criticism was voiced on Capitol Hill and by California  environmentalists, who said that it appeared the package would do more to  protect food producers than to protect food.  </P> <P> Administration officials declined to divulge details of the proposals, but the  head of the Environmental Protection Agency hailed the initiative as a strong  step toward speedy action in cases where the use of chemicals could endanger  food safety.  </P> <P> The plan, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said, "is responsive to a number  of problems this agency has had in administering our pesticide law."  </P> <P> Sources said the proposals would sharply reduce the time it takes the  government to remove a potentially dangerous pesticide from the market and that  it would allow the EPA to halt the use of agricultural chemicals thought to be  hazardous.  </P> <P> But environmental groups had hoped the Administration would take a tougher  stance.  </P> <P> In California, the revisions are likely to become an issue in the gubernatorial  campaign.  </P> <P> "The heart of this proposal is to preempt the right of Californians to set food  safety tolerances," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who chairs  the political and environmental coalition pushing a sweeping 1990 ballot  proposition that would outlaw any known cancer-causing chemical in foods.  </P> <P> One of the chief authors of the proposition is California Atty. Gen. John K.  Van de Kamp, who said Wednesday that any plan that would preempt the state's  ability to act on pesticides and food safety is "simply unacceptable."  </P> <P> "This is a states' rights issue," Van de Kamp said. "If Californians want to  ban cancer-causing pesticides, we should have that power."  </P> <P> He called on members of the California congressional delegation to oppose the  Administration proposals.  </P> <P> One member of the California delegation expected to challenge the  Administration plan is Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the  House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment. Waxman  has introduced his own bill, which is far more restrictive than the plan  expected to be announced by the White House today, and he plans subcommittee  hearings next month.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is running for governor,  sharply criticized the move toward preemption of state authority.  </P> <P> "This is going to cause an uproar," Wilson Press Secretary Bill Livingston  said. In San Diego, Wilson spokesman Otto Bos said that if the Administration  proposal weakens state authority, "Pete Wilson will oppose it as he always has.  </P> <P> "California has tougher laws on pesticides than the nation as a whole, and Pete  has in the past voted against attempts to preempt the state laws with federal  law," Bos said.  </P> <P> Besides preventing the state from going beyond federal law, sources said that  Bush's proposal would provide for a weighing of cancer risk versus the  perceived benefits of pesticide usage, a standard fiercely opposed by  environmentalists. Just as the Exxon Valdez oil spill created a furor over  offshore drilling, the use of the growth-enhancing chemical Alar on apples  created nationwide concern about food safety earlier this year.  </P> <P> Although Alar is not a pesticide, public concern over its possible cancer risks  eventually forced the chemical off the market. The scare passed rapidly, and  the EPA's Reilly has said that a rapid restoration of public confidence in  apple supplies is evidence of the credibility of the environmental agency.  </P> <P> As the outlines of the Bush proposals began to circulate Wednesday, Al  Meyerhoff, a senior attorney for the Environmental Resources Defense Fund in  San Francisco, said the plan is "nothing more than putting a happy face on a  program that is already bankrupt."  </P> <P> "This will do nothing to prevent future Alars," he said. "We will have sons of  Alar for years to come."  </P> <P> Staff writer Keith Love contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp and review intensify nuclear debate (3) Sir, Dr Dieter Helm calls for the Nuclear Review to have wide terms of reference (Letters, November 4) involving a thorough investigation of costs and benefits of nuclear power. This is certainly welcome from the nuclear industry's point of view, but Dieter Helm omits to point out the obvious, that the full costs and benefits of all the alternative fuels have to be encompassed in such an examination. The thorough work already carried out for the Department of Trade and Industry by Professor David Pearce on the full costs of fuel cycles is relevant here, showing as it does the huge external costs of many fossil fuels. External costs identified in this study for nuclear are very modest by comparison. Dieter Helm also implies long-term insight into the future price of gas, in his comments on future nuclear projects versus combined cycle gas turbines. Such a sure insight into the future gas market will draw to his doors a queue of people almost as long as that waiting for the better mousetrap. I do hope that the traffic conditions in Oxford will bear the strain. Adrian Ham, chief economist, Nuclear Electric, Barnett Way, Barnwood, Gloucester GL4 7RS</p>

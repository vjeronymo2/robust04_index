			<p>BFN     [Text] ABSA [Amalgamated Banks of South Africa] Bank has  disclosed that it has dismissed its senior security official and  former Vlakplaas police base operative, Mr. Andries van Heerden.  Mr. van Heerden has been implicated in third force activities  and the supply of arms to KwaZulu. Mr. van Heerden was named by  Goldstone Commission's informant Q as the alleged middle man in  arms deliveries to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. ABSA chief  executive, Danie Cronje, said Mr. van Heerden had been dismissed  two weeks ago following the completion of an internal  investigation.    Regarding ABSA security head Dougie Crewe, who Q claimed had  assisted Mr. van Heerden, Dr. Cronje said no evidence was found  implicating him in third force activities. Dr. Cronje said  although the internal investigation was completed some time ago,  the bank had been advised by the Goldstone Commission and the  Transvaal attorney general, Dr. Jan d'Oliveira, not to release  any information earlier. However, following the arrest of the  former Vlakplaas chief, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de Kock, in  connection with the Goldstone allegations, Dr. d'Oliveira gave  ABSA permission to make the findings public.    Dr. Cronje said the suspension of maintenance employees,  Victor and James Ndlovu, would remain in force on the advice of  the attorney general. They have been implicated in train  violence and investigations are continuing.</p>

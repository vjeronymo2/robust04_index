			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CARLUCCI WARNS ON PROTECTIONISM  </P> <P> Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci cautioned today against strict  protectionist legislation to help the declining U.S. defense industry, saying  the country can't "go it alone" technologically.  </P> <P> "If we protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, we reduce the  incentive to invest in modern facilities and advanced technologies, and we  deprive ourselves of access to advances in technology being achieved in foreign  countries," Carlucci told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs  Committee.  </P> <P> Congress is weighing renewal of the Defense Production Act, which expires Sept.  30.  </P></p>

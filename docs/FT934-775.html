			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / US growth revised upwards The US economy grew slightly more briskly in the third quarter of this year than had been previously thought, Reuter reports from Washington. The reason, said the Commerce Department, was businesses stepped up production of goods for inventories. Third quarter gross domestic product was valued at Dollars 5,140bn. In a second and final look at national output during the third quarter, the department said GDP expanded at a 2.9 per cent annual rate instead of 2.7 per cent as earlier estimated. Though third-quarter growth was modest, it eclipsed 0.8 and 1.9 per cent increases in the first and second quarters. Consumer spending was strong, helping set the stage for a firmer closing quarter. Inflation was restrained in the third quarter, with the implicit price deflator rising at a 1.6 per cent rate.</p>

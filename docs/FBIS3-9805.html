			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bela Csepe, parliamentary group leader of </F> the Christian Democratic People's Party, KDNP, by Janos A.  Szilagyi; place and date not given: "The KDNP's Suggestion Is  Not a Campaign Trick"]    [Text] Janos Szabo Hatvani, director of the State Property  Agency [AVU], also participated in the 28 March session of the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. At the meeting the  KDNP's concerns about privatization were discussed, and the  party's latest suggestion that no privatization contracts should  be made until the new parliament takes office was also mentioned.    [Szilagyi] The KDNP's latest suggestion regarding the change  of ownership met with indignation in economic and financial  circles. Why did the executive committee deem it necessary to  suspend privatization?    [Csepe] The executive committee was aware of the fact that,  being a party with a small parliamentary representation, the  KDNP cannot have the necessary amount of say in the decisions  and privatization deals would not be stopped after its call.  The main reason for our initiative is that the Christian  Democratic concerns should not be forgotten about before the  elections and later, when the new government is set up. It is  to be feared that during the weeks when the public is busy  dealing with the elections, and when it is no longer possible to  draw attention to the irregularities through raising questions  in Parliament, further bad and irreparable decisions can be made.    [Szilagyi] According to the AVU director, the executive  committee made a hasty statement that serves campaign purposes.    [Csepe] I refuse this most firmly. We have not now begun to  deal with this issue to win over the voters. The KDNP's current  proposal is a reformulation of our former criticism.    [Szilagyi] Have you prepared any analyses about what effects  your initiative can have on the fate of enterprises awaiting  privatization that are on the brink of bankruptcy, and how the  proposal will affect Hungary's foreign image?    [Csepe] The executive committee's statement was based on the  KDNP's former privatization investigations and analytical  assessments. My personal view is that it is useful to implement  this proposal, with the provision that it should not be applied  in those cases where the suspension would be damaging from a  financial or economic point of view.    [Szilagyi] According to our information, many KDNP members  also had a negative view on this proposal. Many of them  consider it damaging and unfavorable for the party's image. Did  you coordinate this proposal with the party's other leading  bodies and its parliamentary group?    [Csepe] We did not widely discuss the proposal, this was a  decision of the executive committee in its own sphere of  authority. I do not think that it will become a source of  tension in the party.</p>

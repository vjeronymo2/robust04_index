			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Management: How to stand out in a crowd - Getting yourself noticed in the jobs market If the 1980s were years of 'boom and bloom' in the US, the 1990s look like being chronicled for their 'doom and gloom'. With more than 9m unemployed in the US (approximately 7 per cent of the workforce), redundancy victims are adopting new tactics to increase their chances of re-entering the diminishing permanent job market. 'Think portfolio,' urges Marty Nemko, a career consultant and radio presenter based in Oakland, California. He advises jobless clients to discard their old curriculum vitae. In its place he prescribes a marketing document which pieces together only specific projects and experience directly relevant to the position the candidate is seeking. Since applicants can be up against anything from 500-800 competing hopefuls for a single position, 'make your application applicable and unique', says Nemko. His recipe for an effective portfolio includes a variety of marketing tools. For a teacher that might incorporate a lesson plan, a video tape of the candidate in action, samples of students' work and a superior's evaluation of the project. 'Old-type resumes are archaic and Neanderthal,' says Nemko. 'Employers view them as puff pieces of propaganda. They bear no relation to the job at hand.' Keith Copeland, manger of employment at Apple Computer, agrees that applicants should try to stand out. He recommends a one- or two-page CV highly tailored to the job on offer. 'Be focused. Make an impact. Show you have understood the position and demonstrate how your skills and your experience relate.' The portfolio approach worked for 48-year-old Carolyn Stull, who was forced to look for a new job in 1991. 'When I first began my job search I came across many companies who 10 years ago would have been interested in me. But whereas in the past they might have accepted a candidate with 80 per cent of the required job skills, today they can get a specialist on board with all the required skills.' Stull's initial lack of success incited her to begin her own business as a freelance grant writer, pairing organisations requiring project finance with fund donors. Once she had handled several projects independently she was able to craft her own portfolio CV with summarised case studies taken from her own experience. The result was an executive directorship with the California Foundation for the Retarded. With thousands more applicants than vacancies, employers can afford to demand specific skills, thus paring out the middle management generalists. Lee Harris, director of employment at the Bank of America, finds that the pool of redundant resources on the market has reduced the bank's entry-level recruitment programme. 'Whereas we would have brought in people to train them up, now we can hire individuals with all the required skills immediately,' says Harris. With only 15 per cent of redundant workers presently expecting to be recalled to their former field of employment, compared with 40 per cent following past recessions, victims of America's downsizing have a big challenge on their hands. 'Think job light. Accept change as a friend. And don't take yourself too seriously,' advises management guru Tom Peters, from his Vermont-based office. Consultants urge candidates to consider lower-salaried positions, to add to their skill base and retrain on to leading-edge technology. Time out of employment should be used to undertake voluntary or part-time work which is job related and can be added to the resume. 'And, of course, network,' urges Robert Chope, a psychologist and director of the Careers and Personal Development Institute in San Francisco. 'Use people as you have never used them before. Tell the clerk in the supermarket, the teller at the bank that you are looking for a job. It's nothing to be ashamed of these days.'</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik joint owner surprises with sale FIVE DAYS after trading started in Bakyrchik Gold, a company set up to exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, one of the previous joint owners, Chilewich, a New York-based trading organisation, has sold virtually all its 25 per cent stake. The sale took the market by surprise - there was no hint of it in documents issued in connection with the Pounds 9m placing by Williams de Broe - but BK Gold's share price remained steady after the news at 140p, a 17 per cent premium to the placing price. Chilewich is understood to have been under some pressure from its bankers and sold at 128p a share to raise Pounds 3.8m to pay off bank debt. The shares went to institutions who had had their applications scaled down in the original placing. Minproc, the Australian resources and engineering group which was BK Gold's other joint owner, also sold some shares - 560,000 received from Chilewich as part of its disposal and 190,000 from its own holding  - to raise nearly Pounds 1m to fund costs incurred in bringing BK Gold to the market. Minproc still owns 23.7 per cent of BK Gold and has no intention of disposing of any more shares for at least a year. Mr David Hooker, BK Gold chairman, said the Chilewich shares were placed last week when it was clear that demand at the placing was unsatisfied. 'We are delighted the market was strong enough to take the shares. It is better for the stock to go out all at once like this than to be dumped or dribbled out to the market,' he said.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Three big cheers for no 'beef' A former Democrat aspirant to the White House (Gary Hart) was plagued by cries of 'Where's the beef?' What the complaint meant, when translated out of journalese, was the relative absence of plans to raise federal spending or intervene in the conduct of business and industry. The British government's white paper on competitiveness, now appearing after a long gestation period, has been predictably greeted with similar cries. The kinds of 'beef' that exponents of competitiveness usually want are nearly all pernicious: tax favours for selected sectors, disguised export subsidies, or threats to overseas countries such as President Bill Clinton's 'targets' for import penetration into Japan. The absence of such items is a good feature of the white paper. Except in the education and training field few new policies are announced. For the rest the white paper restates existing policies. Some new ideas are to be 'studied' or 'investigated'; and in their search for hard announcements officials have been forced to drop in sentences such as: 'Lord Walker is to be personal adviser to the president of the Board of Trade on overseas investment.' The document is reminiscent of many of the products of pre-Thatcher Tory governments in its mixture of exhortation, statistics and summaries of mostly minor government moves. The postwar style comes out clearly on the cover, which illustrates a melange of industrial processes - as if to reassure ministers who might have been alarmed by the patient explanations of the official writers (paragraphs 1.27 to 1.29) that all sectors of the economy are (equally) important and that 'many of today's high-tech industries include ones in the service sector'. The white paper is torn between the desire to show that Britain's performance has been relatively good over the past 15 years of Conservative government and the need to show that it has not been good enough, in order to sustain exhortation about competitiveness. On the whole the first requirement tends to prevail. The document has many good things, in spite of its title. It can be regarded as a sort of economic report: an embryonic version of a document such as the US Council of Economic Advisers' Report, which reflects the outlook of the incumbent administration, but is reasoned and analytical, with a statistical framework that changes little from one president to the next. The white paper should be improved, given a new title and made into an annual event until it achieves such status. But it has a long way to go. It is a difficult document in which to find one's way. There is no index, list of figures or even detailed table of contents. Maddeningly, the statistics from which the charts are drawn are omitted so one either has to guess or fax the Department of Trade and Industry if one wants more than an impressionistic glance. The white paper authors try hard to come out with a concept of competitiveness by which they can square their economic conscience. In the end they settle for the OECD definition: 'The degree to which (a country) can, under free and fair market conditions, produce goods and services which meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real incomes of its people over the long term.' The OECD definition might please politicians by giving some credence to the notion of all countries being more competitive, but it is opaque enough to put off others from fuller analysis. Deconstructed, the definition means some combination of reasonable productivity growth and an appropriately valued real exchange rate. If people want to use words in this funny way, why should we seek to spoil their game? But alas the issue does matter. The white paper's official authors desperately try to undo damage by inserting in the body of the document that 'there are prizes in world markets for all'. But what competitiveness means to most people is illustrated by the white paper's sub-heading: Helping Business to Win. Overall performance can only be translated into competitiveness if countries are ranked in an imaginary league table rather than being content to improve on their own. The big defect in talking about countries being more or less competitive is that it makes world trade a form of warfare in which one country can only gain at the expense of another. Thus unfortunately the lack of 'beef' in this white paper is all too likely to mean pressure on this or another government to produce a much more interventionist document which will really attempt to boost Britain's trade at the expense of other countries. For being more competitive means, in ordinary language, being more competitive against others. The positive conclusion from international comparisons is that, judged by labour costs, the UK is the most competitive of the European Union countries except Italy, and is also more competitive than Japan. Only the US is more competitive. Even in 1990 when the UK entered the exchange rate mechanism, unit labour costs in manufacturing were lower than in Germany and France. How come if America and Britain are so competitive that they have such notorious current payments deficits? One could say that it is non-price competitiveness, such as delivery, design and so on. But that would be scraping the barrel. The payments deficits could be the mirror image of budget deficits, but that is not completely convincing either. An alternative explanation is that these deficits reflect international differences in private savings relative to investment opportunities, or inflows of capital funds across the exchanges. In the latter case, as some people will be sorry to hear, there may be no problem at all. There is such a thing as being too competitive. Let us suppose that by some magic British labour costs could be halved overnight relative to those of other countries. Unless there were some change in underlying international capital flows the improvement could not last. British producers would for a time be swamped with extra demand, which would be fine for a while. Eventually, however, a combination of higher domestic costs and an appreciation of sterling would choke off the extra demand. The result would be a return to the original level of competitiveness and balance of payments, with a great deal of disturbance en route. Fifty years ago yesterday, a much more important white paper was issued, the wartime coalition government 1944 paper on employment policy. The promise of that earlier document was to provide conditions for high employment. Alas, that hope has been dashed from our lips. If unemployment were a question of just a few countries with overvalued real exchange rates, then it might make sense to see the problem in terms of competitiveness. But when high unemployment is a common problem among nearly all developed countries, it makes no sense at all to see it in these relative terms. Nor does it make sense to call for greater competitiveness against developing or former communist countries which are hard put to pay their way even with their comparatively low wages. Some ministers in the Thatcher government of the 1980s were brave enough to talk of workers being priced out of jobs. Present-day ministers prefer to translate this unpalatable concept into the superficially softer one of lack of international competitiveness. The effect is, however, to project the problem on to the outside world - as if somehow inferior performance by China or the Czech Republic would make western European unemployment go away.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK's low cost advantage  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unit kabour costs (at present exchange rates) UK = 100        1990          1992              1992                            (Average)       (Post ERM exit)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium         97.8           NA                NA Canada          98.6         94.1              99.7 France         101.3        102.5             114.0 Germany        107.9        115.7             128.8 Greece         115.0          NA                 NA Ireland           NA          NA                 NA Italy           92.5         93.1              93.2 Japan           81.8         99.3             113.0 Netherlands     93.1         98.7             112.5 Portugal       236.6           NA                NA Spain          124.3           NA                NA UK             100.0        100.0             100.0 US              79.0         75.4              83.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: National Institute for Economic and Social Research  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE OF EMBARCADERO FREEWAY DIVIDES SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> CITYSCAPE: MANY CALL THE QUAKE-DAMAGED STRUCTURE UGLY AND WANT IT RAZED. BUT A  POWERFUL GROUP OF MERCHANTS FAVORS REOPENING IT.  </P> <P> When he looks at the elevated Embarcadero Freeway, Mayor Art Agnos sees an  opportunity to tear down an aging eyesore and replace it with a sunken parkway  that would more befit one of the most scenic parts of a most scenic city.  </P> <P> When Chinatown merchants look at Agnos' plan, all they see is red.  </P> <P> Agnos' proposal to raze the double-deck waterfront freeway, which has been  closed to traffic and propped up with timbers since last October's earthquake,  has renewed an old argument over what to do with a highway San Francisco never  wanted but now may be unable to live without.  </P> <P> Merchants from the city's northeast corner -- Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach  and especially Chinatown -- argue that the Embarcadero is essential to bring  customers and commuters into the city.  </P> <P> Chinatown community leaders say they will illustrate their displeasure with the  idea of losing the freeway by closing down their neighborhood shops Monday and  flooding City Hall with protesters while the Board of Supervisors takes up the  issue.  </P> <P> "It is the first time in 205 years of Chinese history in the United States that  we've had any kind of protest or movement," said Rose Pak, blunt-talking  spokeswoman for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. "Shutting down business is a  very strong political statement. It's unheard of."  </P> <P> She said 600 of Chinatown's 850 business owners had agreed by Thursday to close  their doors from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Monday. She said this is a measure of how  important the freeway is to merchants, who report an estimated 30% decline in  customers since the highway was closed by the earthquake.  </P> <P> Agnos, supported by preservationists who never liked the freeway and newspaper  editorial writers who have come to hate it, nonetheless plans to ask the state  to replace the 65-foot-high freeway with a tree-lined boulevard that would  reacquaint the city's Financial District with its historic waterfront.  </P> <P> "San Francisco has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- a chance to remove one  of the worst blights on the face of any American city," he said in announcing  his plan.  </P> <P> He has likened the freeway to a recalled automobile whose safety was called  into question by the Oct. 17 Loma Prieta Earthquake.  </P> <P> "Now," he said, "San Francisco is faced with the choice of spending more money  on a defective and hopelessly unsightly model or trading up for a new and  improved version."  </P> <P> The existing model snakes off the west end of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay  Bridge and slithers through a new forest of high-rise office towers that have  slowly replaced the warehouses and wholesale fruit markets that once butted up  against the city's northern waterfront.  </P> <P> Originally, the Embarcadero was intended to connect the Bay and Golden Gate  bridges by running along the city's northeast shoreline -- and coursing through  such treasured areas as the Embarcadero, Fisherman's Wharf and the Marina.  </P> <P> Public resistance in the 1950s stopped construction in mid-span, but what had  already been built was allowed to open. Many San Franciscans have hated it ever  since -- for killing views of the bay, hiding the historic Ferry Building, and  for just being a freeway.  </P> <P> San Franciscans have long resisted freeways, an attitude visible in any one of  several unfinished projects -- including sections of the Embarcadero Freeway  itself -- that curiously dead-end in mid-air.  </P> <P> Agnos' plan would make the Embarcadero Freeway a long off-ramp spilling traffic  onto a wide, tree-lined boulevard. This surface-level road would slide  underground in front of the Ferry Building, built in 1898 and once the busiest  transit station in the United States, to accommodate ferry commuters and  reintegrate the venerable structure into downtown.  </P> <P> An underground off-ramp would shunt some traffic to streets leading directly to  Chinatown before the main road would resurface and connect with an existing  waterfront street called The Embarcadero.  </P> <P> Agnos estimates the project would cost $120 million and take four years to  construct. He said this is about 2 1/2 times the estimated cost of merely  repairing the old freeway, a job that could be finished by the end of the year.  </P> <P> However, he said 86% of the cost of the new project -- about $103 million --  could come from the money Congress allocated to repair earthquake-damaged roads  and freeways. Such funding would require federal approval, as well as the  completion of detailed environmental review documents.  </P> <P> Critics of the plan contend an environmental review will find that the new  expressway would jam traffic on side streets downtown and extend the lines of  cars waiting to squeeze onto the Bay Bridge.  </P> <P> Those fears were supported by an independent consultant hired by the city, who  estimated in a report released Thursday that the new expressway would be able  to accommodate 25% fewer cars waiting to get on to the bridge. The excess would  back up onto city streets.  </P> <P> Such fears are not new. Dozens of irate commuters expressed similar worries in  1985, the last time the Board of Supervisors seriously debated a plan to do  away with the freeway. Although a majority of supervisors privately supported  demolition then, the board voted 10-0 in favor of further studies of the plan.  The idea lay dormant until Agnos revived it.  </P> <P> Supervisor Bill Maher, who favors demolition of the old freeway, predicted the  vote on Monday will be close -- and unlikely to really settle the matter. Even  if state and federal officials bought the Agnos plan, Maher predicted merchants  would then pursue their protest in the courts.  </P> <P> EMBARCADERO FREEWAY PLAN  </P> <P> Long an object of scorn, San Francisco's quake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway has  been nominated for partial demolition by Mayor Art Agnos. Money set aside to  reinforce the double-decked highway would be used to tear down part of it,  making room for a wide boulevard that would dip below ground in front of the  historic Ferry Building before tying into existing waterfront streets.  Highlighted portion in map is the section that would be demolished under Agnos'  plan.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vittorio Testa: "Berlusconi Snubs League"] </F>   [Excerpt] Florence -- [Northern League Secretary] Bossi  leveled charges, issued insults, and urged people to boycott the  candidates of "Farce Italy" [pun on Forza Italia]. And what  about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi? What was his reply to  his ally, from whom he receives nothing but daily derision and  attacks? Berlusconi restrained himself, forced himself to stay  calm, and granted Bossi the tolerance of someone in a very  strong position who looks compassionately on the struggles of  the weak.    "Our political blueprint is so great as to transcend any  selfishness and pettiness," Berlusconi told his 4,000 Florentine  fans at the rally in the sports stadium. "I understand the  difficulties of the parties whose popularity ratings are  falling, but that is natural, because within the two alignments  it is the more important parts that are gaining strength. We  must not alter our stance one iota: The League made a great  contribution to demolishing the old system, and now it can make  an equal contribution to building the new one."    This, Berlusconi explained, because the League acted as a  bulldozer. "But when it comes to building, space must be made  for cement mixers, cranes, and computers." So the League "must  succeed in flanking whoever is particularly well-suited, those  who know how to invent and to organize." That is, himself,  Silvio Berlusconi, who, having claimed the leadership of the  "pole for freedoms," drowned Bossi -- the Bossi who urged people  to boycott Forza Italia -- in a torrent of generosity: "We say  that our allies' candidates are the blood of our blood, the  flesh of our flesh." Then he issued this warning: "Whoever is  elected must examine the votes that he has received; and he will  see in the proportional quota that the decisive votes in his  election were those of Forza Italia." On this sunny Sunday in  Turin, Forza Italia was granted 37.4 percent by the guru of the  Diakron opinion polls, Gianni Pilo -- himself a candidate in  Treviglio -- against the League's 7.4 percent and the PDS'  [Democratic Party of the Left] 16 percent. The Italian Popular  Party [PPI] and the Pact for Italy each received under 4  percent. Berlusconi discussed the figures mainly in connection  with Bossi. They suggest a lower house composed as follow: 356  seats for the pole, 235 for the left-wing forces, and 21 for the  PPI and the Pact.    The word "Wow" appeared intermittently on the two screens  provided for the pleasure of fans who ecstatically witnessed  their leader's performance which lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes.  The performance ended with further promises to lower taxes and  also to distribute "purchase coupons" for health care,  education, and pensions. With these "coupons," families will be  able to decide whether to seek treatment in private clinics or  public hospitals and whether to send their children to private  or state schools.    Pensions will be provided by means of adequate insurance  policies: Only those unable to contract them will receive state  benefits. Berlusconi was particularly tough on the  underprivileged, but rejected the label of a Robin Hood in  reverse who takes from the poor to give to the rich, which [PDS  Secretary] Occhetto stuck on him: "I have changed through  listening to people's problems," Berlusconi said, "and  especially to those of the lowest and the weakest. I see that  within me there is no longer the old Berlusconi."    Then he again promised to create "1 million new jobs," and  this time specified the time scale too: "within the first two  years of our government, if we govern." This, as long as the  state grants a "tax truce" to businessmen. Berlusconi spoke  again about a maximum tax rate of 30 percent, or rather 33  percent, together with exemptions for the most needy and  allowances for families with a large number of children.  "This," he said, "because we believe that it is a natural right  of the state to take one-third of our income. But we believe  that to take 50 percent from us is robbery." A 33 percent rate  "provides a disincentive for tax evasion and an incentive for  investment." [passage omitted]</p>

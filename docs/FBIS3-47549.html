			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an effort to help Asian countries and other  nations beef up their export control of arms and arms-related  technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  is scheduled to establish an "export control support center" on  10 January within the security trade information center, which  is MITI's auxiliary organ. Underlying MITI's establishment of  the support center is its conclusion that as a result of the  scheduled reorganization of the Coordinating Committee on Export  Controls (Cocom) in late March as a new organ designed to  prevent the spread of arms to "strife-potential countries," it  will be more important to strengthen export control systems of  countries other than the advanced nations.    Three staff members will be working at the support center on  a full-time basis, and its planned activities will include the  holding of export control seminars for Asian nations and former  Soviet republics including Russia, and the dispatch of experts  to these nations. MITI, in its budgetary requests for fiscal  1994, has appropriated 40 million yen for the support center.  It held an export control seminar for Asian nations last  October for the first time, but from now on, such activities  will be conducted by the support center.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Arts: Blood and thunder electrify Docklands - Jazz There must be better places than Dockland's Cabot Hall to hold a jazz music festival. Sarajevo is probably more accessible. Heathrow's Eurolounge possesses a more convivial ambience. Even the political atmosphere is repellant to jazz, the far right having recently taken the local authority seat. Those of us who did make it to the mausoleum were rewarded, however, by the sight and sound of decadent music at its electrifying best. The last time I saw guitarist James Blood Ulmer it was against a background of rolling thunder and rain like stair rods in the dark, outdoors at Brecon. It is possible that he carries this sort of weather with him because so it was again on the Isle of Dogs, where his stage backdrop was a neon and rain soaked cityscape overlit with sheet lightning. This time the one man electrical storm had brought fellow harmolodocian and reedsman Sam Rivers with him and a rhythm section of drums (Doug Hammond) and plucked cello (Mooni Abdul Farah). The sound sculptures created by the quartet are not immediately gratifying: Ulmer, working a semi-acoustic sends shards of notes flying from the thumb, constricted chords creating a tension relieved by River's more open, but still abstract blowing. Hammon's drums and Frah's cello (improbably mounted on a three foot spike to allow him to stand) churn menacingly behind. But surrender yourself to the leader's dissonance and strangulated pitch, and the funk and raw blues emotion is hypnotic. Like his mentor, altoist Ornette Coleman, the guitarist suspends his claustrophobic sound from an innate sense of time. Rivers, looking like a leather-clad pipe cleaner man, cut through the fog with plaintive soprano scribbling and shrill flight with the flute. The use of bowed and plucked cello in place of bass adds to the tragic majesty of the work. Hendrix would have loved it. Sponsor: Texaco. Docklands Jazz Festival continues with Jools Holland Big Band (Fri); Bill Bruford's Earthworks and Julian Joseph Qt (Sat); Jazz Warriors and Jazz Jamaica (Sun 3pm, free)</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Capital &amp; Regional plans to float US property interests CAPITAL &amp; Regional, a USM-quoted property company, yesterday announced plans to float off its US property interests as a publicly-traded Real Estate Investment Trust. The company expects to benefit from the deal because it will remove US debt from its balance sheet and so reduce its gearing. In addition, the dividend income from the REIT should significantly exceed the current profit from the US group attributable to shareholders. Moreover, the deal will diversify its US interests and put them in a large entity which is capable of getting access to the capital markets. Capital &amp; Regional yesterday filed a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission which set out the proposed structure of the offering. The company is combining its US interests with those controlled by a Chicago-based property investment group and a portfolio of industrial investments acquired from an insurance company in order to give the REIT sufficient scale. The REIT expects to control a portfolio of 39 properties in Chicago, totalling 5.9m sq ft, of which four, totalling 2.2m sq ft will be injected by Capital &amp; Regional. The REIT will also have options to acquire another four properties. Capital &amp; Regional said it would own a significant minority interest in the REIT after its flotation, which it will retain for at least three years.</p>

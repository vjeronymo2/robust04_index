			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / IMF announces global effort to boost growth: Early completion of the Gatt Uruguay trade round is placed top of the agenda THE membership of the International Monetary Fund last night agreed to join forces in a 'global co-operative effort' to boost world economic growth and held out the prospect of lower interest rates in Europe, report Peter Norman and Peter Marsh in Washington. After a meeting of the Fund's policy making interim committee, member states from the industrialised, developing and former communist countries issued a unanimous declaration spelling out the efforts each group would make to achieve sustained global expansion. Most of the individual measures have already been announced by national governments and their effectiveness will depend on their successful implementation. But the statement will provide policy makers with a checklist to ensure that their countries are living up to promises made to boost growth. The finance ministers and central bank governors comprising the interim committee said they would monitor developments carefully to ensure the hoped-for recovery will be consolidated. They said they supported strengthening the IMF's surveillance of member policies so that problems in the world economy such as crises on foreign exchange markets could be identified and tackled in a timely manner. Early completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks was put at the top of the list of measures to boost growth. The declaration said that there was an 'immediate and urgent need' for a successful conclusion to the round. 'Persistent failure to complete the round would not be a standstill, but could reverse the trend of trade liberalisation which has been an important contributor to growth'. The statement allocated responsibilities to each group of countries. Developing nations were urged to carry forward their economic reform programmes. The statement said that the transformation of the former communist countries to market based economies was a key element of the co-operative growth effort. They were promised increased financial and technical help while the finance ministers who drew up the statement urged improved access for their goods to foreign markets. The industrialised countries were allocated the 'central responsibility' for strengthening growth prospects. The statement recalled the efforts already being made by Japan to increase domestic demand and the US to reduce its budget deficit. In Europe, it said conditions which should allow for a further progressive reduction in interest rates are expected to continue to improve in the period ahead. The statement emphasised the importance of medium term strategies for deficit reduction in nations such as the US with large structural budget deficits. These would have a 'major favourable impact of interest rates, private investment and job creation.' Earlier, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, warned the US recovery would be moderate. Other industrial countries would have to boost demand to achieve a stronger world economy while the US cut its budget and trade deficits.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Observer: BAT takes another puff It would be hard to describe Martin Broughton, the new chief executive of BAT Industries, Britain's fourth biggest company, as a breath of fresh air. True, he is jolly young - 45 - and, like the bosses of most of his competitors, he is no longer a chain-smoker. But he is still at heart a tobacco man, having joined the British-American Tobacco Company over 20 years ago. BAT's performance over the past decade has certainly improved. If it hadn't, it would almost certainly have been taken over by now. However, its preference for recruiting its head honcho from within underlines its conservatism. Lou Gerstner, the 50-year-old boss of RJR Nabisco since 1989, is an ex-management consultant who made his name at American Express; Michael Miles, 53, head of Philip Morris, is a marketing man who joined PM after it took over his employer Kraft in 1989. Both these conglomerates have benefited from a breath of fresh air at the top. Perhaps BAT should try it some time?</p>

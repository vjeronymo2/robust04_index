			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRINTS SHOW ANIMAL SEEN BY GOLFER PROBABLY A BOBCAT  </P> <P> The animal a golfer spotted earlier this week in Mission Valley was probably  not a mountain lion but a smaller, "much less ferocious" bobcat, a spokeswoman  for the State Department of Fish and Game said Friday.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Ginny Boas said that, after a thorough investigation near a fairway  of the Stardust Country Club golf course, fish and game agents had "determined  that the animal in question is a bobcat. Or rather, let's say, because of the  footprints and the markings, we suspect that the animal was a bobcat."  </P> <P> Bill Robinson, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Police Department, said the  golfer called police after he thought he had seen "a small mountain lion"  during a morning round of golf on the course near Hotel Circle South.  </P> <P> "We dispatched officers and a helicopter but had no luck in finding the  animal," Robinson said. "The golfer indicated the cat had gone into a large  drainage pipe that runs adjacent to the course. Fish and game then took over  the investigation."  </P> <P> Both the State Department of Fish and Game and the San Diego County Department  of Animal Control determined that a mountain lion was loose in a Tierrasanta  neighborhood in early October. Residents on Mission Village Drive near San  Diego Jack Murphy Stadium have claimed to have seen one, and investigators  agreed that the tracks -- 3 1/2 inches in diameter -- as well as the signs left  behind, indicated they were right. The animal is believed to have killed a  house cat belonging to a couple on the street.  </P> <P> On the morning of Sept. 27, civil engineer Peter J. Pountney told police he had  seen two mountain lions near his office on Murphy Canyon Road near Balboa  Avenue. Each of the recent sightings -- whether of bobcats or mountain lions --  has occurred in roughly the same area, near or in Mission Valley.  </P> <P> Lt. Ken Maehler of the fish and game department said mountain lions and bobcats  are common in and around Julian and Descanso -- the more mountainous areas of  the county -- and come down to the city after unusually dry weather, which San  Diego has had most of this year.  </P></p>

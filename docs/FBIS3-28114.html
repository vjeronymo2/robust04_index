			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- A government plan to impose a  7 percent tax on goods and services from 1997 has room for  modifications in consideration of the strong opposition within  the ruling coalition, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  indicated Thursday [3 February].    Touching on the resistance from the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) to the tax plan, the top government spokesman said at a  news conference, "if the SDP's stance stays unchanged today, I  am afraid the situation will be serious for the ruling  coalition."    The SDP has threatened to quit the coalition government  unless Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa modifies the plant to  introduce a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to replace the 3  percent consumption tax.    Takemura said the government plan might be revised if such a  revision would help win public support for the introduction of  the tax.    He also expressed hope the government will narrow down  differences through dialogue with the SDP, which is the largest  contingent in the seven-party coalition.    The chief cabinet secretary said the government and the SDP  will hold fence-mending talks Thursday, but he declined to  comment on the possibility of the government retracting the tax  plan outright.    The planned 7 percent indirect tax is scheduled to take  effect on April 1, 1997.    Saying the decision-making process concerning the tax in the  face of the SDP's opposition was "unusual," Takemura  acknowledged it was not all done in the right manner.    Takemura said there is no change in the Thursday evening  schedule of the announcement of a 15 trillion yen fresh economic  package that includes the large-scale income tax reduction. But  a policy-making body of the coalition was forced to put off a  Thursday morning meeting to approve the stimulus program due to  a boycott by SDP members.    As a result, the announcement of the additional economic  package appears certain to be delayed from the original schedule.</p>

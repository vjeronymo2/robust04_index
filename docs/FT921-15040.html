			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Appointments: 'Nuts and bolts' for Bemrose BEMROSE, the Derby-based security printers, will miss the glamour of its association with Sir Gordon Brunton, who has reached 70 and is retiring after 14 years as the company's non-executive chairman. As well as owning the horse that won the gold cup at Ascot last June at odds of 25:1, Sir Gordon, brought in by Sir Max Bemrose, great grandson of the founder, has made some very imaginative contributions to the business, says Roger Booth, who has just been made group chief executive. 'He was tough when he needed to be,' such as in the early 1980s when the company had to fight off Robert Maxwell's attentions. But Sir Gordon, a former head of International Thomson, comes from another world, says Booth, who explains that what the company now needs in its battle with recession is 'nuts and bolts' men. Hence, David Wigglesworth, 61, retiring from group chief executive, becomes chairman. Booth himself joined Bemrose at the end of 1988 when it purchased Henry Booth, the family printing company of which he was managing director and the majority shareholder. Far from having the top job in his sights at the time, he says he had enough difficulty persuading his new colleagues to allow him on to the board.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert back in black JACQUES VERT turned losses of Pounds 4.65m into pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.03m in the year to April 24, as the women's fashion wear group reverted to its core activities. Mr Malcolm Heald, finance director, said that margins had 'crept up on continuing operations', but that the turnround was due to elimination of loss-makers. The board took the decision to restructure at the end of the last financial year: since then Alain Cannelle has been closed, the 51 per cent stake in L'Anglaise sold and JV's part of the Ben de Lisi joint venture sold to Mr de Lisi. Mr Heald said that the group was now able to trade profitably even if the economic climate did not improve, but it might have to look for more cuts if there was a third dip to the recession. Cash flow and retained profit allowed borrowings to be reduced to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 6.11m) at the period-end. Gearing fell from 79 to 37 per cent. Turnover emerged at Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 40.9m restated) and operating profits were Pounds 1.7m (losses Pounds 1.32m). Interest payable was down at Pounds 499,000 (Pounds 866,000). Some 85 per cent of the group's output goes to wholesale with the balance being sold through JV's own retail outlets. At the end of April, it had 23 stand-alone stores, three down on last time, and having added 41 over the year, there were 46 concessions within other stores. Mr Heald said that as a result of the mark-down policy, JV was now 'very clean' on stock - it was down at Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 5m), the lowest since April 1989. Earnings were 8.8p per share, against losses of 40.66p last time. A final dividend of 2p is proposed for a total of 3p, against the 2p interim last time when the final was passed.</p>

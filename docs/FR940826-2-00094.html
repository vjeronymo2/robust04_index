			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> B. As this Court Has Held Repeatedly, Cellular Exchange Service Is ``Exchange Service'' Subject To the Decree's Equal Access Requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alone among the Bell Companies, BellSouth urges the Court to declare that the Decree's equal access and interexchange provisions ``do no apply'' to wireless services. (BellSouth Mem. 6, Apr. 15, 1994) BellSouth has not withdrawn this argument, which the United States rebutted in its earlier opposition to BellSouth's Motion (U.S. Mem. 6&hyph;10, Apr. 29, 1994) BellSouth nonetheless argues that Section II should not be interpreted to have been intended by the parties and the Court to be limited to the landline local exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As more fully set forth in our prior brief, BellSouth's argument is frivolous. Whether or not the issue was ``fully litigated'' (BellSouth Mem. 11) as part of a trial that addressed all aspects of the telecommunications industry, the Decree's interpretation is settled. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The Decree's terms are not themselves limited to landline telecommunications (see Section IV.O, defining ``telecommunications''), and that understanding was set forth in the Department's filings prior to the Decree's entry. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  AT&amp;T and regional company executives committed prior to divestiture that cellular systems would provide equal access. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  This Court has repeatedly ruled that cellular services are subject to Section II of the Decree, e.g., Mobile Services Opinion, 578 F. Supp. at 645; Triennial Review, 673 F. Supp. at 551; AT&amp;T/McCaw Decision, 154 F.R.D. at 4, and has likewise entered more than 49 waiver orders premised on the proposition that cellular services are subject to Section II. The Court of Appeals has likewise proceeded on that assumption without questioning this premise.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Western Elec.

Nov. 5, 1992) (No. 92&hyph;5065) (remanding decision on PacTel's out-of-region cellular service area request for northern Ohio). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Tunney Act contemplates the filing and entry of consent decrees in cases in which no testimony has been taken, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), much less that the issues address had been ``fully litigated.'' If BellSouth were correct, consent decrees otherwise authorized by the Tunney Act could not be enforced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``As set out in the Department's Competitive Impact Statement, the proposed modification would not prohibit the BOCs from offering either cellular radio or land mobile radio. These types of services fall within the definition of exchange telecommunications.'' Response to Public Comments, 47 FR 23320, 23335 (May 27, 1992); accord, Mobile Services Decision, 578 F. Supp. at 645 (``mobile radio services are `exchange telecommunications' within the meaning of Section II(D)(3) of the Decree''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AT&amp;T's Memorandum Replying to the Responses to the Court's Order of April 22, 1983, at 5 &amp; n.* (May 19, 1983); Affidavit of Joseph T. Ambrozy (Mid-Atlantic Region), sworn to May 18, 1983, p. 9; Affidavit of Delbert S. Staley (Northeast Region), sworn to May 18, 1983, p. 15. These representations are quoted at U.S. Mem. 8, Apr. 29, 1994. BellSouth's assertion_ignoring all these statements_that ``the contemporaneous statements of the parties further confirm that they did not intend to impose equal access obligations and interLATA restrictions on wireless networks'' (BellSouth Mem. 8) is at best uninformed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southwestern Bell does not join BellSouth in arguing that Section II does not apply to cellular services_although it comes close, arguing that concerns about market power in cellular ``are illegitimate under the decree.'' (Southwestern Mem. 15) Southwestern argues that ``the wireless switch is not an `essential,' `bottleneck,' or monopoly facility.''' (Southwestern Mem. 7&hyph;11, June 20, 1994) <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  This argument_if it is meant to suggest that the cellular duopoly is not a source of competitive concern because there are two cellular carriers permitted to operate in any particular market <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE> _is without merit, whether argued as a matter of decree interpretation or as a matter of competitive analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> AT&amp;T made the same argument in support of its effort to acquire McCaw. Memorandum in Support of AT&amp;T's Motion for a Waiver of Section I(D) of the Decree insofar as it Bars the Proposed AT&amp;T/McCaw merger, pp. 50&hyph;57 (May 31, 1994) (``AT&amp;T I(D) Mem.''). Before announcing its plans to acquire McCaw, AT&amp;T recognized that the integration of cellular and interexchange services without equal access ``would extend the cellular exchange duopoly_and the apparent noncompetitive pricing of cellular `air time'_into the provision of interexchange services to all cellular customers.'' AT&amp;T's Opposition to RBOCs' Motion To ``Exempt'' Wireless Services from Section II of the Decree, p. 7 (Apr. 27, 1992). Two years later, after AT&amp;T announced its proposed acquisition of McCaw, AT&amp;T offered exactly the opposite view. ``These [cellular] systems are not monopolies that can be leveraged into long distance and manufacturing markets.'' AT&amp;T I(D) Mem. 52. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Southwestern argued to the FCC that it would promote competition if the cellular duopolists were awarded all of the new PCS spectrum. ``[A] choice among service providers stimulates and ensures competition. *&blank;*&blank;* [A] choice would exist *&blank;*&blank;* because there are already at least two such providers in each market.'' Comments of Southwestern Bell Corp., In the Matter of Amendment of the Commission's Rules to Establish New Personal Communications Services, p. 12 (F.C.C. Nov. 9, 1992) (Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314). Southwestern makes the same claim here. ``[N]o provider has the ability to leverage anything at all, regardless of its incentives. There is always a competing mobile provider down the road.'' Southwestern Mem. 12. As we show below, two providers is insufficient for genuine competition in these markets, and Southwestern itself observes internally that these duopolies are ``highly attractive'' because of their ``absence of significant price competition.''

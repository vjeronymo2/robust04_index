			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Shu Guang (5289 1639): </F> "U.S. Troops `Cross the Volga'"]    [Text] In accordance with an agreement reached betwen  them, Russia and the United States plan to carry out their first  joint military exercises in July. The area for the exercises is  in Orenburg Oblast to the east of the Volga, the "heartland" of  Russia. It is reported that technical preparations for the  exercises are almost complete. Even the insignias have also  been made. When the exercises start, the national flags of both  countries will be hoisted side by side, and the purpose of the  exercises: peace-keeping '94, will also be clearly written on  them.    However, two months before the exercises, many members of  the  Russian State Duma have questioned whether or not it is  "appropriate" to hold them, and there is also endless debate in  the press. A major Moscow newspaper wrote on the eve of the  anniversary of the victory in the Second World War: "In those  years, the German fascists only managed to come close to the  Volga, but today we have invited U.S. troops to cross it." On  the other hand, IZVESTIA gave tit for tat and put forward the  view: "If the Russian-U.S. joint military exercises are  canceled, the president will have made a big mistake." The two  opposed views are not giving in and are pitted against each  other like the imaginary "red troops" and "blue troops" in the  exercises. Under such circumstances, President Yeltsin has  expressed his "understanding" of the doubts of the Duma members  and ordered the Ministry of Defense to "discuss the issue of  military exercises with the United States again."    It is said that the scale of the exercises is very small.  Only a total of 250 officers and men on the U.S. side will take  part in it. Also, they will only be equipped with automatic  rifles and other light weapons. The cost is $2.5 million. The  purpose is not to practice coordination in peace-keeping  activities. [sentence as published] At first glance, the  exercises do not involve major interests. Why, then, have the  planned exercises evoked such strong reactions in the Russian  political arena?    Ever since ancient times, the Russian nation has esteemed  the  Volga as the "mother of rivers" and a spiritual source. To  allow U.S. troops, their former opponents, to cross the Volga is  evidently something more than some people can bear  psychologically. This is all the more the case today when  feelings of nationalism are on the rise.    People cannot help associating this with other discord in  Russian-U.S. relations at present. The two sides have not yet  ended their dispute over what kind of "partnership for peace"  should be established; and to date, Russia still wants to revise  the "Treaty on the Reduction of Conventional Armed Forces in  Europe. The reason for such revision is that the "treaty" was  reached between the two major military blocs of NATO and the  Warsaw Treaty Organization several years ago and that if matters  are still handled according to the original treaty, it will be  to Russia's disadvantage. Also, since the second half of last  year, Russia has been seeking "special interests" in the former  USSR area. However, Western countries have regarded this as a  signal that Russia is attempting to restore its "former empire."  The dispute in the Russian political arena over the military  exercises seems to be merely a minor episode in the current not  very harmonious relations between Russia and the United States.    In the past few days, the "weather" for the military  exercises seems to have "turned fine." Russian Defense Minister  Grachev said that the exercises will be held as scheduled.  However, no matter whether or not U.S. troops succeed in  "crossing the Volga," it is evidently not easy for Russia and  the United States to change from being opponents to being  "partners," because this requires arduous readjustments of the  interests of each side.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SWINDELL TURNS DOWN HEAT, BEATS ROYALS, 4-1  </P> <P> It took Greg Swindell awhile to figure out that he's not like that other former  University of Texas ace, Roger Clemens.  </P> <P> Swindell, relying more on style that speed, scattered nine hits Sunday at  Cleveland while pitching the Indians past the Kansas City Royals, 4-1, for his  fifth straight victory.  </P> <P> "In college, he could get in trouble and blow a couple of guys away and head  back to the dugout," Cleveland Manager Doc Edwards said. "Up here, you can't  get away with that, but he had to learn that.  </P> <P> "His stuff is about the same as last year, but now when he get in trouble, he  just keeps pitching."  </P> <P> Swindell won his first six starts last season with a 2.09 earned-run average  and went on to become the first 10-game winner in the major leagues with a 10-1  mark on May 30. He lost his next five starts but still finished with an 18-14  record and a 3.20 ERA.  </P> <P> His first two months this season are only a little less spectacular. In his  five winning starts, Swindell (9-1) has lowed his ERA to 2.47.  </P> <P> "I learned how to pitch last year," said Swindell, who struck out six and  walked two. "I learned I have to use all my pitches in certain situations. I  can't just rear back and throw."  </P> <P> Bo Jackson's 16th home run ruined Swindell's shutout bid in the sixth and tied  the score, 1-1.  </P> <P> The tie lasted less than half an inning before Mark Salas hit a two-run homer  off rookie Kevin Appier (1-2).  </P> <P> "I know I can hit," Salas said. "It's a matter of getting playing time. I'm  real happy. Doc Edwards is putting me in there and I'm getting a shot."  </P> <P> "(Appier) got it up and I got the ball in the air."  </P> <P> Joel Skinner's run-scoring single in the eighth gave Swindell another run to  work with.  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, Oakland 2 -- Dave Schmidt and rookie Mickey Weston combined on a  four-hitter and the Orioles won the last three of a four-game series with the  Athletics at Baltimore before 46,541 fans -- largest crowd at Memorial Stadium  since opening day.  </P> <P> The victory stretched Baltimore's lead to five games in the AL East, while  Oakland leads the Angels by 1 1/2 in the West.  </P> <P> Bob Melvin hit a three-run double in the first inning off Curt Young (2-7) and  added a run-scoring single in the seventh.  </P> <P> Schmidt (7-5) limited Oakland to three hits in six innings, retiring the first  14 batters. Weston, making his major-league debut, yielded only one hit the  rest of the way.  </P> <P> Luis Polonia hit a two-run homer for Oakland in the sixth.  </P> <P> Texas 5, New York 2 -- Ruben Sierra drove in three runs and knuckleballer  Charlie Hough stopped the Yankees as the Rangers averted a four-game sweep by  winning at New York.  </P> <P> Hough (5-6), who lost eight of his previous nine decisions against the Yankees,  did not allow a hit until Ken Phelps hit his third homer with two out in the  fourth. The 41-year-old allowed four hits in eight innings and Jeff Russell  pitched the ninth.  </P> <P> Sierra had an RBI single in the first and a two-run single in the third off  Dave LaPoint (6-6) as the Rangers won for only the 34th time in 105 games at  Yankee Stadium.  </P> <P> Scott Fletcher had a run-scoring double in the first inning and a sacrifice fly  in the ninth as Texas reversed two earlier decisions against LaPoint this  season.  </P> <P> Minnesota 8, Milwaukee 6 -- Gary Gaetti's second home run of the game, a  two-run shot in the ninth inning, lifted the Twins past the Brewers at  Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Frank Viola took a 6-3 lead to the top of the ninth, but left after Milwaukee's  Greg Brock led off with a double. The Brewers tied the score against relief ace  Jeff Reardon (1-2), who allowed a run-scoring double to Jim Gantner, Paul  Molitor's run-scoring single and Robin Yount's game-tying single -- all with  two out.  </P> <P> However, Milwaukee's Chuck Crim (6-4) walked Jim Dwyer with two out in the  bottom of the ninth before Gaetti connected.  </P> <P> Seattle 8, Toronto 2 -- Jay Buhner hit a two-run triple as the Mariners scored  three runs in the first inning on their way to beating the Blue Jays at  Toronto.  </P> <P> Scott Bankhead (4-4) allowed four hits in seven innings, struck out three and  walked four.  </P> <P> Toronto's Frank Wills (0-1) yielded five runs on six hits in five innings.  </P> <P> Edgar Martinez hit a solo homer in the second and Greg Briley added a  bases-empty shot in the fourth as the Mariners built a 7-1 lead.  </P> <P> Boston 7, Chicago 4 -- Luis Rivera had four singles and Joe Price earned his  first AL victory by pitching the Red Sox past the White Sox at Chicago.  </P> <P> Five of Boston's seven runs off Steve Rosenberg (2-3) were unearned as the Red  Sox equaled their longest win streak of the season at three straight.  </P> <P> Price (1-2) allowed five hits in six innings. Two of the hits were two-run  homers by Fred Manrique and Ivan Calderon.  </P></p>

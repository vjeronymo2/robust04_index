			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- The current rate of  inflation in Russia at about 8-10 per cent a month opens up  prospects for credits from the International Monetary Fund,  Russian President Boris Yeltsin said. Speaking at a meeting with  the heads of regional administrations in Moscow on Wednesday,  Yeltsin said that "in April the IMF will allocate Russia 1.5  billion dollars" if the current level of inflation is  maintained. If the economic situation improves, Russia may  count on another 5-7 billion U.S. dollars in the future, he  added.    The president stressed that "the current level of inflation  in Russia is the lowest in the CIS." It almost meets the target  figures, although May and June will be difficult, he said.  Yeltsin stressed that the government is now working on a draft  budget for 1995 and will submit it to the State Duma, the lower  house of the Russian Parliament, in September 1994.</p>

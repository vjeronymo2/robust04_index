			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: West German inflation at 2.9% West German consumer prices rose by 0.1 per cent in June from May, taking annual inflation to a provisional 2.9 per cent, the German Federal Statistics Office announced in Wiesbaden yesterday. It is the first time since April 1991 that the headline annual rate of inflation has been below 3 per cent, assuming there is no upward revision. The June figure is the same as that for May, although last month the final figure was revised upwards to 3 per cent. The preliminary inflation figure is based on data from the states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hessen, North-Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria. Price pressure on rents and services subsided but food prices rose, reflecting seasonal factors. David Waller, Frankfurt Wholesale prices in Denmark jumped 0.6 per cent in May from April, and commodity prices rose 0.8 per cent. Wholesale prices had posted a 0.1 per cent monthly rise in April. Economists in Copenhagen said the increases were higher than expected but were unlikely to push consumer prices over forecast levels. Danish consumer prices for May released on June 20 showed a 0.4 per cent monthly and 1.9 per cent year-on-year rise, slightly lower than market expectations. The Danish government has forecast consumer prices will rise 2.0 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 1995. Italian wage inflation stood at an annual 2.5 per cent in May, the same level as in April. The May figure compares with an annual growth of 4.1 per cent in consumer prices the same month. Industrial producer prices rose 3 per cent in the year to April.</p>

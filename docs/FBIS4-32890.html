			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Bricente from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] OCI [Central Information Office] Chief Guillermo  Alvarez Bajares says the national government's immediate  priority is to send a bill to modify the Central Administration  Law to the legislature so that several ministries can be merged.    The executive branch wants to merge several ministries,  among  them the Development Ministry and the Foreign Trade Institute  which would become the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  Meanwhile, the Urban Development Ministry would be merged with  the National Urban Development Fund to form the Infrastructure  Ministry.    Alvarez Bajares explained that the Central Admiministration  Law establishes how ministries are divided, and will require  that a reform bill be sent immediately to parliament.    [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] The deadline is as soon as  possible. This does not mean we will be working on this on  Monday or Tuesday, but we will do so as soon as possible.  President Caldera discussed this several times during his  electoral campaign and he is now implementing these corrective  measures. [end recording]    Alvarez Bajares said that regardless of who wins the  presidential elections in Colombia, Venezuela will pursue  relations with the neighboring country in the truly positive  manner in which they have been pursued so far, but in accordance  with the integration process established by both governments.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: SIB faces battle to promote reforms TO THE average investor, the regulatory system must sound like alphabet soup: SIB, SRO, SFA. The letters take on meaning only when investors find they must turn to the regulatory system for redress in some way. Let us say, for instance, that your financial adviser has been pocketing your money instead of investing it in unit trusts as you had believed. Or you were convinced to buy an investment contract which you believed allowed instant access, only to find it does not. It is then that letters like SIB become important. SIB is the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog; and last week its chairman, Andrew Large, said he would keep a tighter rein on the self-regulating organisations (SROs) which, nominally, it supervises. After a lengthy study of why the regulatory system failed to prevent the theft of more than Pounds 440m from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, Large concluded that SIB's decision to maintain an arm's-length relationship with the SROs was a decisive factor. This might not seem like much improvement in the quality of investor protection. And indeed, it might not be. On the other hand, there are signs that Large is prepared to force SROs to take measures which, occasionally, counter the commercial interests of their members. This is a necessary first step to improving the quality of investor protection, particularly for retail investors who do not have the sophistication or muscle of large institutions which can get redress more easily. Signs of this new, tougher stance have emerged already. Last December, the board of a proposed new super-SRO for retail financial services, to be known as the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), was told it must improve standards of investor protection significantly if it wants to get off the ground. Among other things, it must tighten rules for selling - particularly life insurance - by making the charging structure clearer and restricting instances where people are sold inappropriate products. While Large's criteria may sound like common sense, the SROs are under considerable pressure from their members to resist. A case in point is last week's response by the actuarial profession to proposals from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) on disclosure. The OFT had urged that prospective customers be told of a policy's surrender value in each year of its life before buying it. While it is impossible for life insurers to know exactly what the surrender value will be, they have a fair idea of expenses and can make some projections. The information can help consumers understand what will happen if they cancel before maturity and could discourage them from buying policies unless they are certain they can keep up premiums. But the actuaries, many of whom work for life insurance companies, claim the OFT measures would only confuse consumers and are urging the Treasury to reject them. Meanwhile, the Life Insurance Association (LIA), an industry trade body, is urging the adoption of a complaints procedure outside the scope of the new PIA. Under the LIA proposals, consumers who fail to have complaints upheld by the adjudicator risk being forced to bear the costs of the investigation. Many people with complaints could back off if faced with having to pay the bill. Publicly, the SROs insist their prime mission is to protect the public interest and claim they turn a sufficiently blind eye to the commercial pleas of their members if the public is at risk. But consider, then, an article which appeared last week in a trade journal catering to independent financial advisers (IFAs). In it, Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra - which regulates IFAs - slams the OFT proposals and says they will make the insurance industry uncompetitive. Jillings vows 'to fight alongside other bodies in opposing some of the proposed nonsense (from the OFT).' If that is the case, Large has his work cut out.</p>

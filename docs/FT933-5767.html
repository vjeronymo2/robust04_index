			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (6): Better chance than most - Zimbabwe ZIMBABWE climbed, reluctantly, aboard the structural adjustment bandwagon in 1991, largely jettisoning the ideological baggage that so constrained the economy during the 1980s. The five-year programme started badly, primarily due to the worst drought in living memory, global recession and high interest rates. Few of the programme's quantitative targets are likely to be met by 1995. Real GDP, programmed to increase 25 per cent over the five years, will have fallen some 2 per cent by the end of this year, with the result that incomes today are around their levels of 20 years ago. Even if all goes well over the next two years, it will take conceivably until the turn of the century for income per head to regain its 1990 levels. Initial programme-funding targets have proved wildly optimistic and the government has been forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for an extended structural adjustment facility, as well as stepping up its reliance on aid. Fiscal targets have been missed - for which the drought is blamed - and last year's budget deficit of 11.3 per cent was well above the 6.6 per cent programme target. Exports, which by 1993 were supposed to have reached some Dollars 2,150m, are languishing around Dollars 1,500m, and will fall substantially short of the 1995 target of Dollars 2.6bn - the World Bank's forecast, of tobacco exports doubling by the late 1990s, being a classic example of confusing a short-term blip with a long-term trend. In the past six months, the pace of reform has quickened, though heel-dragging continues in the parastatal sector. On the positive side, finance minister Bernard Chidzero, in a remarkably opaque budget presentation in July, promised to halve the budget deficit to 5.4 per cent of GDP this year, by keeping spending growth to half the inflation rate while revenue rises more than a quarter. Investment is gradually - grudgingly - being liberalised, as are exchange controls. Individuals may now hold foreign currency deposit accounts in Zimbabwe banks, repatriating 'flight capital' on a no-questions-asked basis. In mid-year, Mr Chidzero opened a window to portfolio investment, guaranteeing free remittability of dividends and profits to foreign investors who buy shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. The main obstacle to foreign investment remains exchange control, which discriminates against the country's traditional - and loyal - investors, who were in Zimbabwe before independence in 1980. Trade is being liberalised, with exporters allowed to retain half their export earnings - and this will increase to 60 per cent at the end of the year - and a further 20 per cent of imports on open general licence. In July, too, important moves to liberalise agricultural marketing were announced, and a commodity exchange now operates out of Harare, trading in the main agricultural exports. But because there has been more pain than gain, so far as the man in the street is concerned, the Economic Structural Adjustment Programme is extremely unpopular. With elections scheduled by March 1995, some slippage in implementation seems more than probable. The politically-driven, and very popular, land designation programme - by which government can compulsorily acquire commercially-owned farmland for resettlement purposes - is incompatible with some of the government's more progressive policies designed to attract foreign investment. In the final analysis, Zimbabwe has a better chance than most of breaking the African mould and making a success of economic reform. Should it fail, it will have much to do with institutional and political shortcomings, and the over-indulgent attitude of some donors, specifically the World Bank.</p>

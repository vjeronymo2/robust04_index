			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Televison Once again the most interesting group of programmes is on Channel 4 as part of the 'Banned' season. The second in the documentary series The Truth About Lies (9.00) is sub-titled 'The Big Lies Of The 20th Century'. It covers everything from Stalin's agricultural policies to McCarthyism, from the Katyn Forest Massacre to Tiananmen Square. Damned In the USA (10.30) is a 'Without Walls' special exploring freedom of expression in America which is statutorily protected by the constitution. But moralistic pressure groups persuade corporations to cease funding programmes which they dislike. Freaks (11.50) is a 1932 Hollywood movie intended to 'out-horror Frankenstein'. It tells of sideshow freaks taking revenge on a female trapeze artist. Not shown in Britain for 30 years, it is a curiosity rather than a great film. Horizon investigates prehistoric man on the north American continent (8.10 BBC2). Panorama asks 'The Major Question': has the Prime Minister got what it takes to come up with the right answer? (9.30 BBC1).</p>

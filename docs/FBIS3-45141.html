On the morning of 12 January, the  provincial party committee and the provincial government held a  work conference in Shenyang to make overall arrangements for  this reform. Yu Junbo, standing committee member of the  provincial party committee and director of the organizational  department of the provincial party committee, presided over the  conference. Wen Shizhen, standing committee member of the  provincial party committee and vice governor of the province,  set forth the guiding ideology, principles, tasks, methods, and  steps for the reform of the public servants system and the wage  system on behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government.    Wen Shizhen pointed out that the next step of the reform of  party and government organizations at the provincial, city, and  county levels is devoted to firmly implementing the various  programs approved by the CPC Central Committee, the State  Council, and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee. In line  with the demands of the central authorities and with the  stipulations of the provincial plan on organizational reform,  the number of party and government organizations at the  provincial level should be reduced from 90 to 65, with their  functionaries reduced by about 1,800 persons, or a reduction of  22.6 percent; the number of party and government organizations  at the city level should be reduced from 74 on an average to 52  for each city, with functionaries reduced by 24,000 persons, or  a reduction of 24.8 percent; and the number of party and  government organizations at the county level should be reduced  from 53.5 on an average to about 28 for each county, with the  functionaries reduced by 5,700 persons, or a reduction of 21.5  percent. The reform of institutions should be carried out in  line with respective characteristics according to the forms of  removal, incorporation, transfer, and [words indistinct].  Efforts should be made to reduce by 10 to 20 percent the number  of the staff of institutions that live off state revenues.  Meanwhile, efforts should be made to basically complete the  reform of party and government organizations at the city level  within two years.    With regard to the implementation of the public servants  system, Wen Shizhen said, "It should take about two years to  basically set up the public servants system throughout the  province, while carrying out the reform of party and government  organizations and the reform of the wage system in order to  bring the personnel management of government at all levels into  a new operational mechanism and in order to gradually perfect  the management of government personnel."    The provincial government organizations will implement the  public servants system by three stages and in groups. In the  first half of this year, they will complete the installation of  positions. By the end of this year, they will complete the  transition of existing personnel to public servants and use a  new personnel management operational mechanism. By the first  half of next year, most cities in the province will set up their  public servants system.    The wage system reform of party and government  organizations,  as well as institutions, should be carried out in line with the  demand of building the socialist market economic system and with  the principles of distribution according to work and linking  work remunerations with practical contributions in order to  overcome egalitarianism. At the same time, these organizations  and institutions should gradually set up their wage system with  their own characteristics and set up a normal wage increase  system to help form and develop a classified management system  and a effective incentive system.    Wen Shizhen demanded that in carrying out the reform of the  wage system, we should seize the key points, clearly understand  and master the stipulations of policies, and be meticulous in  organizing implementation in order to basically complete the  implementation task for the wage system reform of party and  government organizations and institutions in the first half of  this year.    Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, made a speech at the conference. He stressed, "In  line with the demand of the market economy, we should vigorously  seize the key point -- changing functions -- in carrying out the  reform of labor, employment, and distribution systems." He said  that changing the functions of government is the key point of  the organizational reform. If the government refuses to change  its functions and continues to use its original management modes  and forms, it will be unable to bring the relations between the  various sectors into better balance, to reduce the number of  organizations and staff, and to improve administrative  efficiency.    Wang Huaiyuan pointed out that the simultaneous reform of  labor, employment, and distribution systems will cause grave  difficulties and great influence and thus it is a major event  having a bearing on the overall political and economic situation  of the province. He demanded that all levels of party  committees and governments should strengthen organization and  leadership, make overall arrangements and plans, and be  meticulous in organization so that they can carry out reform in  a positive and sound manner.</p>

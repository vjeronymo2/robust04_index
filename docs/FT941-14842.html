			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Suppliers braced for aluminium output cuts Suppliers of bauxite and alumina, the main raw materials for aluminium, are bracing themselves to face some of the worst market conditions in living memory if talks, starting in Brussels today, for co-ordinate cuts in international aluminium production are successful. Even without more cuts by aluminium producers, western world alumina is heading for a supply surplus of more than 1m tonnes in 1994 and next year compared with demand of about 34m tonnes, says Mr Tim Armstrong at the CRU International research organisation. 'If substantial (aluminium) cuts are agreed, the market for alumina (aluminium oxide) and bauxite (aluminium ore) will be appalling. Prices will go to historically low levels and stay there for a couple of years.' Trade representatives from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the US start two days of negotiations this week and hope to agree terms for a reduction in world annual aluminium output of up to 2m tonnes to help bring supply and demand back into balance. Australia is by far the biggest producer of aluminium's raw materials, with an annual capacity of about 42m tonnes of bauxite and 13m tonnes of alumina, according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Other big bauxite suppliers include Guinea in Africa, about 16.3m tonnes; Jamaica, 11m tonnes; and Brazil 10.3m tonnes. Jamaica also features among the foremost alumina producers, with annual capacity of 3.5m tonnes, not far short of the 5m tonnes in North America. (It requires about two tonnes of bauxite to produce one tonne of alumina and about two tonnes of alumina to produce one tonne of aluminium). Most bauxite and alumina is sold via long-term contracts but the spot market price, which peaked at USDollars 700 a tonne in 1988, averaged between Dollars 180 and Dollars 200 last year and is now down at Dollars 140. Mr Armstrong said that CRU's latest report* showed that demand from the Commonwealth of Independent States had helped buoy up international bauxite and alumina prices in the past two years at a time when aluminium prices crashed to all-time lows because of an unexpected surge in exports from the former Soviet Union. Now the alumina refiners were feeling the full impact of aluminium output cuts announced by western producers last year.

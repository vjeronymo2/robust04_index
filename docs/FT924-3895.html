			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Prices on the LME continued to fluctuate irregularly as the market sought to establish a fresh set of trading ranges after, apparently, bottoming out of its bear trend, traders said. Setbacks found support at well above levels ruling a month ago but there is still considerable resistance to stall prices before a significant rise can gather momentum. Support for three-month COPPER is being found on dips to around Dollars 2,180 a tonne whereas in early November support was in the Dollars 2,125-Dollars 2,130 band. Three-month ZINC and ALUMINIUM seem to be underpinned at Dollars 1,070 and Dollars 1,200 compared with Dollars 1,030 and Dollars 1,160 respectively. London's robusta COFFEE futures were showing signs of resuming their uptrend by the close after absorbing a bout of profit-taking. Dealers said the mood on fundamentals and technicals remained bullish after Wednesday's rise to a 10-month peak. London COCOA ended near the day's lows on sterling's strength against the dollar and the French franc. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: UN peacekeepers plan helicopter evacuation of 145 wounded from Gorazde United Nations peacekeepers are planning the helicopter evacuation of 145 seriously wounded people trapped in Gorazde, the last Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Serb commanders yesterday refused to let an emergency relief reach Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area under Serb siege for 15 months. Earlier, Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic gave permission for the passage of the desperately needed food and medical supplies. It is the first overland convoy to try to reach Gorazde since Serb forces intensifed their offensive there last month. Some 60,000 people since then have depended on air-dropped relief supplies that cannot feed the entire population, most of whom are refugees from the Serb assault on east Bosnia. Local election officials reported a 96 per cent turn-out in the weekend referendum on the union of Serb-held territory in Croatia with the self-styled Serb state in Bosnia. Rebel Serb leaders said they planned to announce the union of their two areas on June 28, despite a call from Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to postpone the union which would likely scupper a Serb-Croat truce on dividing Bosnia.</p>

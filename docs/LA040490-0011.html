			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 KEY STEPS CUT RISK TO HEART, STUDY REPORTS  </P> <P> Six thousand middle-aged men who were at high risk of developing heart disease  have cut their chance of dying of a heart attack by nearly 25% as a result of  quitting smoking, lowering their cholesterol levels through diet and taking  drugs to treat high blood pressure, according to a report being published  today.  </P> <P> The findings, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., appear to  confirm the widely held assumption that common-sense steps to modify the  behavior and treatment of those at risk for heart disease can significantly  increase their life span.  </P> <P> They also appear to vindicate the controversial, multimillion-dollar 12,800-man  Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) that was criticized when it  ended in 1982 because it was initially unable to show any difference in the  health of men given special treatment for smoking, high blood pressure and diet  and those who received more typical care.  </P> <P> "This may not entirely settle the debate over things like cholesterol," said  Marcus Kjelsberg, director of the coordinating center for the MRFIT. "But it's  an important piece of the puzzle. It suggests that there is a real benefit to  intervening on these risk factors."  </P> <P> The MRFIT study began in the early 1970s, following two groups of just over  6,000 men between the ages of 35 and 57 who were judged to be at high risk for  heart disease because they smoked, had high blood pressure and high  cholesterol. One group received normal care. The other was given dietary advice  to lower cholesterol levels, medication to lower blood pressure and counseling  to quit smoking.  </P> <P> When the study ended in 1982, after each group had been followed for about  seven years, there appeared to be no difference in death rates. Today's article  reports on the two groups three years later, or 10 years after the study began.  </P> <P> This time the researchers found a dramatically lower incidence of fatal heart  attacks, and an overall mortality rate for all causes that was 7.7% lower among  those men given special treatment.  </P> <P> "Preventing heart disease is not like treating a cold or a headache," said  Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,  which sponsored the study. "It takes years to build up the risk and it takes  years to eliminate it."  </P> <P> The results do not address the question of which of the three risk factors is  most to blame for causing heart disease.  </P></p>

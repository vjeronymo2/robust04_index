			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading ACTIVITY in derivatives markets died away somewhat yesterday, although traders in stock index futures reported continued rolling-over of positions in the FT-SE futures from the December to the March contract, writes Terry Byland. Some interest from US sources was identified in the index futures but this was not enough to counter-balance profit-taking pressures from UK market specialists. At the official close of the session, December showed only the barest premium against the cash market and later dealings saw only a modest increase in the premium. However, strategists expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the day's trading which was regarded as a pause for profit-taking. Similar trends were evident in traded options, where overall volume dipped from 32,955 contracts to 23,446 but business in the FT-SE contract increased  -11,584 contracts against 10,374. Hanson headed the stocks list with 1,684 contracts trading as investors took a fresh look at the profit figures.</p>

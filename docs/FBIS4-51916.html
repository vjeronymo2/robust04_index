			<p>BFN     [Text] The prices of agro-fishery products, it is feared,  may surge as middlemen at wholesale markets dealing with  agro-fishery goods across the nation decided yesterday to  abandon their wholesale business and stick to their own  intermediary job.    A sudden stoppage of the middlemen's wholesale business may  cause chaos in the distribution of agro-fishery goods and a  sharp rise in their prices.    About 2,000 middlemen held a rally at the Karak-tong  Agro-Fishery Wholesale Market in Seoul to agree to stage a  lawful labor struggle until the government rewrites the recently  revised act concerning the distribution and price stabilization  of agro-fishery goods.    Under the newly revised act, which went into effect this  past  Sunday, the government has banned licensed middlemen at  agro-fishery wholesale markets from carrying on the wholesale  business.    Middlemen are only allowed to act as intermediaries between  city- designated wholesale companies which collect agro-fishery  goods from producers and retailers or wholesalers.    In the process, they receive a broker's commission on traded  agro-fishery products. The current fee is 4 percent.    In the past, however, middlemen acted a wholesalers and  earned huge profits in the process of relaying agro-fishery  goods from wholesale companies to actual retailers or  wholesalers by charging more than a 4 percent commission on  transacted goods.    The middlemen's unlawful wholesale practice has played a  major role in increasing the price of agro-fishery products.    The wholesale business, however, has accounted for about 80  percent of the total transactions of goods at agro-fishery  wholesale markets.    There are about 11,000 licensed middlemen across the nation,  including 1,500 at the Karak-tong wholesale market along with 69  city-registered wholesale companies which can collect  agro-fishery goods from producers and list them on the wholesale  markets for public auction.    Agro-fishery products brought into the Karak wholesale  market  amounted to 6,675 tons yesterday, down 1,072 tons from the  previous day but the wholesale prices of agro-fishery goods  increased an average of 5 percent.    To soothe the middlemen's growing protests of the revised  act  and a possible price surge of agro-fishery goods, the Ministry  of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries yesterday decided to  designate the month of May as a guidance period for middlemen  before the implementation of the revised act.    The ministry also said that it will assist in the  establishment of retailers' cooperatives which can buy  agro-fishery goods directly from the city-registered wholesale  companies.</p>

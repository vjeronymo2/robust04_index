			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Bush finds Saddam as elusive as ever: Iraqi provocations have so far failed to push the UN into retaliation THE Bush administration has often found reading the mind of Mr Saddam Hussein to be a frustrating exercise; in its final days before handing over to President-elect Bill Clinton the task is proving no easier. In a series of provocative actions - harassment of United Nations relief workers in the Kurdish protective zone of northern Iraq, violations of the southern no-fly zone, obstruction of UN weapons inspectors, incursions into the demilitarised zone along the newly demarcated Iraq-Kuwait border - Iraq has sought to test the resolve of the US and its coalition allies, as it prepares for a change of leadership. The response to these separate but related incidents has been firm but uneven, and a gap may now be emerging between the US, backed by the UK, and the rest of the UN Security Council over whether Iraq has overstepped the line. All reports from Washington suggest that President George Bush is fed up with Mr Saddam's provocations and ready to order a military riposte. At the UN in New York, Iraq's continued defiance appears to have engendered more frustration than anger. Wholesale Iraqi disruption of the aid operation in Kurdistan drew little more than mutterings while warnings to Iraq about incursions across the Kuwaiti border have not been backed up by any display of force. But violations of the two no-fly zones have been met swiftly: an Iraqi MiG aircraft which ventured into the southern zone a fortnight ago was shot down immediately, and threatening Iraqi missile movements were met with a 48-hour ultimatum. 'The real distinction is that challenges in the no-fly zone threatened the lives of allied pilots,' said Ms Laurie Mylroie, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. US officials argue they have already established both the legal authority to deal with violations of the no-fly zones, which are operated under UN resolution 688, and the operational framework, because all military options have been worked out to confront a long list of Iraqi violations over the last 18 months. 'If the determination is made that enforcement of the UN resolution needs to be undertaken, it will be without warning,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman. The demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border is more recent, so less case history has been established. Operationally, the area also falls under the direct supervision of the UN's observer mission, rather than of the allied military command in the region. However, the US has sought to link the various incidents together, and on Monday night the adoption by the UN Security Council of a statement warning Iraq of 'grave consequences' was delayed by a last-minute American move to add an introductory paragraph to the text agreed in day-long consultations. This paragraph stressed that the Iraqis' seizure of weapons, including missiles, at their former naval base at Umm Qasr, which now lies partly in Kuwait was part of a pattern of defiance. At US insistence, the council statement also cited a series of border incidents involving the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (Unikom) which maintains a staff at Umm Qasr, and Iraq's banning of 70 UN weapons inspectors from entering the country in a non-Iraqi charter aircraft. Baghdad's proposal that the UN use Iraqi Airways or a land route from Jordan violates the Gulf ceasefire resolution. Iraq clearly found the Security Council warning less than compelling since yesterday it defiantly compounded its offence by conducting another unauthorised expedition to the Umm Qasr base. Some US officials see Iraqi defiance as an encouraging sign of Mr Saddam's need to bolster his domestic position because of the damaging effect of the UN embargo. US intelligence suggests that food shortages have worsened considerably in recent months since Jordan began to enforce the embargo more assiduously, helped by Mr Saddam's own measures to ban certain imports. Other Middle East analysts, however, say that at his weakest, Mr Saddam did not allow demonstrations in Baghdad, for fear that a notionally pro-government crowd might turn against him; he now appears confident enough to allow demonstrations. But if the US may perhaps be misreading Mr Saddam's domestic strength, it is possible the Iraqi leader is misreading Mr Bush's position: he may tweak Mr Bush into action in his last week in power, or he may provoke Mr Clinton into a show of strength at the start of his presidency. Mr Saddam may also be misreading the cohesion of the international coalition that faces him. Some of the Arab countries involved in the Gulf War are now less public in their opposition to Iraq, but although Turkey rumbles occasionally, it continues to support the Provide Comfort relief operation in Kurdistan. And Russia has now joined the US, the UK and France tocreate a 'Permanent Four' that excludes only China among the permanent members of the Security Council.</p>

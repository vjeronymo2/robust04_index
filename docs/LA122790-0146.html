			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> FTC Backs Networks: The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Economics  recommended that the Federal Communications Commission repeal the so-called  financial interest and syndication rules that prohibit the three major TV  networks from participating in the $3-billion program rerun business. Both the  networks and the Hollywood studios and producers are engaged in last-minute  lobbying campaigns before the FCC makes its decision early next year. The FTC's  BOE joins other government agencies, such as the Justice Department and the  Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information  Administration, which previously stated that they favor lifting or relaxing the  restrictions.  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Observer: Put out to Grasse? What will Nigerian military ruler General Babangida do when he relinquishes power? There have been reports in the French press that he has already bought a property on France's Cote d'Azur for around FFr10m. It's a villa near Grasse standing in three hectares of land and was built in a Moorish style in the 1850s. Queen Victoria once stayed there. However, old Africa hands play down the significance of any such purchase in terms of what it says about Babangida's future plans. For a start, it is standard practice for heads of state both in and out of work to buy properties in stable countries like France, and several have second homes on the Cote d'Azur. It doesn't necessarily mean he has given up all political ambition. One need look no further than Zaire's president Mobutu, who has several properties in France and Switzerland and has turned out to be one of Africa's great survivors.</p>

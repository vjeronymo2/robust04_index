			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Nightfreight shows sharp jump to Pounds 1.35m In its first set of results since coming to the market in May, Nightfreight, one of the UK's largest independent express parcel groups, yesterday announced pre-tax profits sharply up from Pounds 539,000 to Pounds 1.35m for the six months to May 31. The shares reacted favourably to the announcement, rising 5p to 105p, matching the initial flotation price. Turnover more than doubled from Pounds 9.31m to Pounds 21.8m during the period, although Pounds 11.9m of the increase came from the acquisition last November of PHS Group and Greenline. Volume throughput from its core Nightfreight network showed a 19.6 per cent increase. Mr Russell Black, chief executive, said the bulk of the improvement came from new business, rather than existing customers. Profits from continuing operations increased from Pounds 623,000 to Pounds 1.23m, with a further Pounds 540,000 coming from PHS and Greenline. Since the flotation Nightfreight has opened a new depot in Lincoln, and it plans further expansion in Cheshire and the Scottish Borders during the second half. It also recently established a joint venture with Toga Freight, to give it access to the Irish market. The company achieves the bulk of its profits during the second half of the financial year, and Mr Black said it was on target for its prospectus forecast of Pounds 4.5m. Earnings per share emerged at 2.62p (1.54p) and an interim dividend of 1.13p is declared.</p>

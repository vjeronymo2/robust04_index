			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Bosnia's warring parties face toughest hurdle: Negotiations are still failing to produce a long-sought breakthrough THE signature by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem President, of the military chapter of the international mediators' proposed peace settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina is the first evidence of progress for a month in the New York negotiations. But it is hardly the breakthrough the world has been waiting for so long and so anxiously. Though all the warring parties - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - have now signed two sections of the three-part agreement: the constitutional framework and the ceasefire arrangements - they stand or fall together and the most difficult hurdle has yet to be overcome. That consists of the plan to divide the country into 10 largely self-governing provinces, with a central government responsible mainly for foreign relations, an important provision given Bosnian Serb ambitions to join a Greater Serbia. Given the latest attempts by the Serbs to clear the Moslem population out of certain regions of eastern Bosnia - allocated mainly to the Moslems on the map tabled by the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen - the prospects for an early agreement on the map must be considered slim. Mr Izetbegovic has refused to hold any face-to-face meetings with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, as long as the Serbs continue their military offensive and campaign of forcing the Moslems out of their homes and villages. Mr Izetbegovic was due to leave New York last night, leaving his foreign minister to lead the Moslem delegation. It remains to be seen whether he can be persuaded to change his mind, following the pressing appeals of the UN Security Council and the mediators. It is nevertheless significant that he should have signed the military agreement at this particularly tense juncture of the fighting in eastern Bosnia, when an even less co-operative attitude on his part could have been expected. The Moslems were on the verge of signing together with the Serbs and Croats in January, even before the negotiations moved from Geneva to New York. But they held back pending the fulfilment of a list of frequently changing conditions, the most constant element of which was a water-tight system of international control of heavy weapons, which would deprive the Serbs of the means to resume hostilities. The Vance-Owen plan spoke only of UN monitoring of heavy weapons, a promise which was understandably not taken too seriously by Mr Izetbegovic, given the international organisation's poor record in this field. General Satish Nambiar, the outgoing UN commander in the former Yugoslavia, is now reported to have given an undertaking that the heavy weapons will be physically controlled by the UN, even though it does not yet have the necessary means to do so. What really appears to have persuaded Mr Izetbegovic to endorse the agreement is the new direct US involvement in the peace talks, previously the sole responsibility of the UN and European Community mediators, Mr Vance and Lord Owen. The parachuting of relief supplies by the US to the people of eastern Bosnia may not have been the outstanding success that it was intended to be and certainly fell short of Moslem expectations of military intervention. But Washington's promise that it would contribute a substantial number of troops to the 40,000 to 60,000-strong international force which will be required to enforce a peace settlement in Bosnia, appears to be a guarantee that the control of heavy weapons will be more effective this time round. Now that Mr Izetbegovic has joined the other parties in endorsing the military agreement and has been seen to adopt a more constructive attitude towards the peace plan, the mediators are expected to switch pressure to the Serbs. With the full backing of the US and the Security Council, which has severely condemned the latest Serb offensive in eastern Bosnia, Mr Vance and Lord Owen will attempt to push the Serbs into making the relatively small provincial border adjustments which would make the proposed map more palatable to the Moslems. To achieve this, they are counting on the support of Russia which, like the US, has appointed its own special representative to the talks. There may still be a long way to go before a full agreement is reached, but the mediators' tactics of progressively isolating the chief culprits of the Bosnian imbroglio is at last beginning to bear fruit. The military agreement provides for the implementation of a ceasefire within 72 hours from the time of the conclusion of the peace settlement. Its main provisions, apart from a cessation of hostilities, include the withdrawal of all forces and heavy weapons to designated provinces and locations according to a 45-day timetable. UN forces will monitor and, it appears from the latest undertakings given by General Nambiar, physically control all heavy weapons. Sarajevo will be demilitarised and so-called 'blue routes', to be patrolled by UN forces, will be established to ensure the freedom of movement of civilians, commercial goods and humanitarian aid to and from the city. The constitutional framework for Bosnia-Hercegovina, endorsed by all the parties, provides for a unified, but decentralised state, with most governmental functions carried out by its 10 provinces. The provinces, however, may not enter into agreements with foreign states or with international organisations. The constitution will recognise three 'constituent peoples' (Moslems, Serbs, Croats), as well as a group of 'others'. The provinces and central government shall have democratically elected legislatures and chief executives and an independent judiciary. The presidency shall be composed of three elected representatives, each of the three constituent peoples. Bosnia-Hercegovina is to be progressively demilitarised under UN/EC supervision and the constitution will provide for 'the highest level' of internationally recognised human rights.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Omar Uarashvili: "UNA Is Anxious To Head </F> Workers' Movement"]    [Text] A conference of Lvov Oblast workers, which was  devoted to the establishment of the Lvov Oblast Coordinative  Center of Workers Movement, was held on 23 April at the Radio  and Television Palace of Culture in Lvov. Mykola Semenchenko,  head of the Donbas regional council of strike committees, and  representatives of company staffs from Rivne and Vinnytsya  Oblasts were also invited to participate in the conference  organized at the initiative of the Ukrainian National  Assembly-Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNA- UNSO]. UNSO  Deputy Commander Dmytro Korchynskyy speculated that the workers'  movement is currently in a state of "clinical death." Therefore,  in his opinion, the UNA-UNSO should revive the movement which  will defend the interests of Ukrainian workers. Rostyslav  Novozhenets, deputy chief of the Lvivprylad company, pointed out  in his speech that, as of today, privatization is ruinous,  because it is conducted without taking into account workers'  demands, favoring the Mafia instead. In his opinion, the  independent trade unions are no longer able to defend workers,  despite the fact that they are headed by Rukh People's Deputy  Yaroslav Kendzyor. Oleksandr Ilyuk, a representative of the  Rivne metal-concrete construction plant, as well as other  participants, noted that they no longer trust any civil or  political parties and trade unions, such as Rukh or the Congress  of Ukrainian Nationalists. In their opinion, only UNA-UNSO can  really uphold workers' demands. Participants in the conference  adopted a resolution to establish, under UNA auspices, the  Ukrainian Labor Assembly which will comprise company staffs,  free trade unions, and strike committees. Also voiced at the  conference were appeals to workers to support UNA-UNSO  candidates in the local elections.</p>

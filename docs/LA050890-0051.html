			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS  </P> <P> U.S. Facilities Corp.: The Costa Mesa insurance and reinsurance company said  its first-quarter earnings more than doubled, to $814,000 from $401,000 for the  year before. Revenue was up 25%, to $17.6 million from $14.1 million. The  company said the revenue increase resulted principally from continued rate  increases, growth in the number of accounts in the company's medical stop-loss  business, and higher net investment income.  </P></p>

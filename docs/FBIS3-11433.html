			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial entitled: The Appointment of a Minister Without </F> Portfolio]    [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany confounded  public opinion several weeks ago with the announcement he had  proceeded to appoint Mr. Roberto Aleman as minister without  portfolio. The presidential decision was immediately understood  as a political solution aimed at pleasing a party that had  recently decided to join the new government alliance. After the  announcement all sorts of controversies have risen in the  country's political and legal circles.    A decision which in the beginning seems to have originated  as  the result of the new government election coalition has now  turned into a real conflict in which all sorts of legal theories  have developed. As a consequence of this situation, the National  Assembly Board of Directors has proceeded to deem President  Endara's appointment as unconstitutional before the Supreme  Court of Justice. As a result of the National Assembly's  position, President Endara has said he has ample authority to  carry out this or any other appointment he may seem fit.  Nevertheless, in short, the national Constitution is quite  clear with respect to the distribution of duties between  ministers of state. First of all, it demands the existence of a  law. No one can deny the president's right, granted by the  Constitution, to carry out the appointment of ministers of  state. Likewise, it is also true that right is in effect when  the National Assembly has approved the establishment of the  position and apportions sufficient funds as part of the nation's  income and expense budget.    President Endara's supposed freedom to appoint officials as  established in Paragraph One of Article 178 of the Constitution,  supporting grounds of that appointment, is not enough, not even  given an analysis of budgetary and personnel administration  regulations. Much less is it justified prior to an electoral  period.    If after four years of government for whatever reason the  president decided the creation of a new position in the state  bureaucracy was necessary, this must have been included in the  state's budget. Even if the appointment was that of a  presidential adviser, as they have tried to justify, it must  have been made through the signing of the president and the  corresponding minister.    The appointment of the minister without portfolio or an  adviser was legally and fiscally validated through one single  signature, that of the president of the Republic. What is even  worse, the presidential measure has entailed other important  consequences such as the decisions of the Cabinet Council, which  should be signed by the new member. This holds particularly  true given there is no law creating this post, and the minister  without portfolio does not have functions. It would be legally  an appointment without a specific objective, which could border  on a criminal offense against the public administration.    We believe the appointment of a minister without portfolio  is  another of the so many bloopers President Endara has made during  his administration. The minister without portfolio will be a  minister without specific functions, receiving a high salary and  without a justification.    Should the figure of the minister without portfolio be  maintained, the Cabinet Councils would include the body of  advisers, making its functioning inoperative. This would also  adversely affect the economic policy of reducing the government  payroll, for which so many lower-ranking public employees were  sacrificed.    Regardless of the Supreme Court of Justice's ruling on this  issue, the appointment made by President Endara to please a  political demand represents an unpardonable sneer at the  Panamanian people, particularly the thousands of Panamanian  people who are unemployed and the very public servants who have  struggled for a wage hike.    While government leaders have said they do not have enough  money to meet the demands of thousands of fellow Panamanians who  yearn for a job in the government or higher wages, the  government proceeds to appoint a minister without portfolio  without any legal or fiscal basis. In an attempt to analyze the  legality of this issue, it must be asked "What annual report  would the new minister present? What report would be explained  before the Assembly? What would be the obligations and rights  of this new public servant, and has he previously filed a  declaration of his properties?"    That is why the announcement on the reaction of the  Legislative Assembly, which has filed an unconstitutionality  writ against the appointment, is so important. This decision is  not the result of an individual's feelings, rather, the  institutional reaction of that important state branch. This  represents a forewarning against the actions of the president of  the Republic. The state is not a private farm in which  decisions are made arbitrarily. The legal order must prevail  not only in the defense of the state but also out of respect for  those holding government offices. Consequently, given the above  presumably legal justifications, the principle of legality,  which does not permit the creation of an arbitrary figure, must  prevail.</p>

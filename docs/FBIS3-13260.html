The tape recommends evading military  service and not paying taxes as a means of opposing the  government's policy. Yiftah El'azar reports:    The hero of the videocassette is an imaginary character  called Ron Segev, a tank brigade commander, and deals with his  misgivings under the autonomy. Segev is detained by a joint  patrol of the Palestinian police and the Israeli Border Police  while demonstrating against Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in East  Jerusalem. Segev decides to become a prisoner of conscience and  inspires others to follow in his footsteps. Elyaqim Ha'etzni,  head of the action committee, hopes that in real life Israelis  will turn to civil revolt.    [Begin Ha'etzni recording] It is a path of non-violence  aimed at opposing a regime which almost clandestinely -- we call  it the Oslo underground -- surprised and hoodwinked the nation,  and with the help of pro-PLO votes in the Knesset, is taking the  country away from the people. It is a path of nonviolence.  [end recording]    The cassette contains the names of right-wing intellectuals,  such as Professor Yisra'el Eldad and Prof. Hilel Weiss, as well  as senior military commanders in the reserves, who support the  action. Among the measures recommended are dodging military  reserve duty and evading the payment of taxes. Ha'etzni said it  is important to learn how to carry out civil revolt in order to  prevent a repetition of actions like that of Barukh Goldstein,  who perpetrated the Hebron massacre.</p>

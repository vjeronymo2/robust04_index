			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] will partially  liberalize fire and non-life insurance premium rates, which are  currently uniform among insurance companies, as early as 1996.  The measure, a response to the U.S. demand in the Japan-U.S.  framework talks, will be implemented as part of such insurance  system reforms as allowing life and non-life insurance companies  to participate in each other's business through their  subsidiaries. The idea is to begin with the insurance policies  geared toward large corporations, then gradually and flexibly  broaden the scope of liberalization so that insurance companies  can accommodate the change. The aim is to reduce premium rates  through competition among the insurance companies, thus  lessening the burden on policy holders.    Under the current system, such major non-life insurance  policies as those for fire, casualty, and automobile insurance  are exempt from the application of the Antimonopoly Law.  Premium rates for those policies types are about the same  throughout the industry. Moreover, the non-life insurance  industry's Insurance Premium Rate Calculation Team calculates  rates on the basis of the current conditions of premiums paid by  companies and the administrative costs involved, then submits  them to the MOF for approval.    The new system will enable insurance companies to set their  premiums independently according to their own expenses within a  certain limit -- for example, 20 to 30 percent -- above or below  the premium rates put forth by the Calculation Team. Companies  wishing to exceed the limit in either direction will be allowed  to do so after submitting to the MOF the basis for calculating  their premium rates and gaining the ministry's approval. Even  in that case, however, given the need to secure the financial  resources for insurance payments, the maximum discount rate is  not expected to exceed 40 percent.    If the setting of insurance premium rates is liberalized,  insurance companies are expected to set substantially higher  premium rates and exact more demanding conditions for high-risk  subscribers. Therefore, the scope of liberalization is foreseen  as being limited at first only to such corporate insurance  policies as fire insurance for factories, then expanded in  stages to other types of policies. But in the case of automobile  liability insurance, which is compulsory, liberalization is  likely to be deferred in order to avoid the situation of  insurance companies being unable to pay sufficient insurance  money to accident victims.</p>

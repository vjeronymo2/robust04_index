			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bent Bak Andersen, Linda Bang Jessen, Bent </F> Sorensen: "Large-Scale (Massive) Search"]    [Excerpts] Hashish seizure: Fourteen people have been  arrested so far after the largest hashish seizure in the history  of Denmark. However, the police are still looking for 11 tons of  hashish and three suspects.    With their massive raid Sunday [3 April] morning the police  and custom officials had hoped to crush one of the  best-organized hashish organizations in Denmark once and for  all. Having monitored the gang's activities in their rooms, the  police knew that the gang members were going to try to smuggle  12.5 tons of Moroccan hashish into Denmark, but when the police  raided the container ship Hela at Helnas Bay the morning of  Easter Sunday, only 1.5 tons of hashish was found.    The police do not know what happened to the rest of the huge  shipment beyond the fact that some of it was dumped at sea. Some  of it might have been smuggled ashore before the ship reached  shallow waters in southwestern Fyn bay during the night before  Sunday. [passage omitted]    Over the next few days the police will search the bottom of  Helnas Bay with a fine-tooth comb looking for the hashish which  had been tossed overboard, and they are urging everybody in the  area to keep an eye out for summerhouses that have unusual  visitors.</p>

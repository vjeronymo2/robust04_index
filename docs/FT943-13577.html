			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television BBC1's new panel game Gagtag is described as a comedy trivia quiz and a battle of wit. It is chaired by Jonafan Woss, sorry Jonathan Ross, and the team captains are Bob Monkhouse and Frank Skinner. Like 'Relate' which is now described as what it isn't ('the organisation previously known as the Marriage Guidance Council') Skinner has to be defined as the one on 'Fantasy Football League' who wasn't David Baddiel (8.00 BBC1). The following programme is presented by the other Ross: Nick. Crime Limited (8.30 BBC1) undertakes to 'look at crime from the viewpoint of victims and their families' which means that viewers get the usual ration of dramatised mayhem but develop a warm glow of worthiness at the same time. Clever. Chandler And Co is also managing to have things both ways: the women are attractive, gutsy and bright while the men are bald, unfaithful and wimpish; standard stuff in the tunnel vision age of feminism. But at the end of Episode 1 one woman began to see some of the hazards of the current belief in female infallibility. Promising. (9.30 BBC1).</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat directors invested in related hotel FOUR DIRECTORS of Queens Moat Houses, the suspended hotel company, were private investors in a project which was backed partly by Queens Moat. The four are shareholders in Ashford International Hotel, a Business Expansion Scheme set up in 1988 to develop a hotel of the same name in Kent. Queens Moat provided management services and financial support to Ashford and was expected to buy the company when the scheme expired. Following mounting losses due to recession and other troubles, Queens Moat decided not to buy the hotel when the scheme lapsed in March. According to filings at Companies House, Mr Gerald Bell, group operations director at Queens Moat, holds 40,000 shares in Ashford, equal to 0.5 per cent. Mr Martin Marcus and Mr David Hersey, who were suspended from Queens Moat when its financial problems appeared, hold 25,000 and 5,000 shares respectively. Mr Robert Abson, director of UK operations, holds 5,000 shares. These shareholdings were not revealed in Queens Moat's accounts. In Ashford's accounts, Mr Marcus and Mr Hersey appear as directors and shareholders of both companies, but neither Mr Bell nor Mr Abson is identified as a Queens Moat director. Mr Andrew Coppel, appointed earlier this month as a consultant to Queens Moat, said the shareholdings were not disclosed publicly because they were insubstantial. 'I have no reason to believe these shareholdings had any influence on the decision to invest or manage the hotel,' he said. The Ashford scheme was set up by Capital Ventures, which had earlier introduced Queens Moat to two other BES hotels in Harrogate and Chester. The Chester Hotel was bought by Queens Moat in April last year for Pounds 9.5m, allowing BES shareholders to at least double their money. Six Queens Moat directors, including Mr John Bairstow, the chairman, held shares in the Chester project. According to one City analyst, 'eyebrows were raised' when these shareholdings were revealed after the purchase was completed. Queens Moat managed the Ashford hotel from its opening in 1990 and received management fees from Ashford of nearly Pounds 82,000 in 1991. Queens Moat owned Pounds 2.5m of Ashford's preference shares and extended an unsecured loan of Pounds 1m to the company. In Ashford's accounts, there was a statement of financial support from Queens Moat, which expires at the end of June. With Queens Moat facing a financial restructuring, Ashford's future is unclear. However, Queens Moat's bankers are unlikely to withdraw support now that the Government has approved construction of the Ashford international station for the channel link.</p>

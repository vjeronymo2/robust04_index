			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / US accuses Unita rebels of violating deal TENSION mounted yesterday between the US and Unita, the Angolan rebel movement, as the group continued to threaten to derail the country's peace process after suffering defeat in its first democratic elections. The US yesterday accused the movement, previously supported by the US and South Africa, of violating the country's superpower-brokered peace accords after saying it was withdrawing its forces from the new unified army to protest at alleged electoral fraud. Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state for African affairs, criticised Unita's decision to pull out of the integrated Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). 'This is an unfortunate step which is not in accord with the spirit or letter of the Angola peace accords (signed in May 1991 in Portugal),' he said. Senior officials of Unita dismissed Mr Cohen's statement and warned him not to interfere. Unita's withdrawal from the FAA, combined with its increasingly aggressive rhetoric and its disregard for international opinion, raised the prospect of plunging the vast country back into instability. Diplomats said they were frustrated by Unita's failure to stay within the peace process and concerned that Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita's mercurial leader, was refusing to see foreigners, including the US observer and the special representative of the UN secretary-general. A statement issued at midnight on Monday by Gen Arlindo ing Chenda Pena, joint commander of the FAA, said Unita felt betrayed by the government and was quitting the force until three conditions were met: a review or cancellation of the electoral process, a ban on the National Electoral Commission issuing further results and consideration of 'intimidation' during polling by the anti-riot police. 'We are ready to return to FAA as soon as serious negotiations are undertaken between the MPLA government and the Unita leadership with all the genuine opposition leading to a solution of the present national crisis,' Gen Pena said. The National Electoral Commission said yesterday it would not issue final results until tomorrow. However, official returns from 85 per cent of the vote show President Jose Eduardo dos Santos leading Mr Savimbi by 50.8 per cent to 39.4 per cent.</p>

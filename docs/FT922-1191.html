			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Telegraph flotation at 325p - Conrad Black's Hollinger group will retain majority holding THE PRICE for the flotation of the Telegraph was set yesterday at 325p, giving the group a market value of Pounds 435.5m. Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger group is reducing its stake in the newspaper publisher from 87 per cent to 68 per cent through the sale of 26m shares, raising Pounds 84.5m before expenses. The company is not raising any new money. Hollinger, the Canadian-based group, plans to retain a majority holding in the Telegraph. The price is lower than earlier hopes suggested, reflecting some weakness in the stock market in recent weeks. Mr Russell Edey, of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising on the flotation, said, 'in the jolly days after the election we would have got a few pennies more.' He said he did not think either the cancellation of the GPA flotation or concern about Mirror Group Newspapers had directly affected the issue. The price puts the group on an historic fully taxed p/e of 16, and a prospective gross yield of 4.1 per cent on the 10p net dividend the Telegraph is forecasting for the 1992 financial year. Of the 26m shares being sold, 13m are available to the public with up to 10 per cent of those earmarked for Telegraph employees. The other 13m shares have been placed, 12m in the UK and 1m in Canada. Applications close on July 1 and the basis of allocation is expected to be announced by July 2. Dealings are due to start on July 8. COMMENT The great imponderable in the Telegraph flotation is how many of its readers will apply for shares. The assumption is that their social class and propensity to own shares will combine with a loyalty to the brand to persuade them to apply in droves. On that basis the issue should go well, and there should be a premium in the after-market. But whether the Telegraph constitutes a sound long-term investment at this price is quite another matter. There are no directly comparablestocks, but a prospective p/e of around 15 1/2 on forecasts of Pounds 42m pre-tax (Pounds 40.5m in 1991) is a sizeable premium to the market, while the forecast yield is at a discount. That looks a bit steep for a mature business with a still declining customer base. Add the likelihood that the company will be the vehicle for the personal ambitions of its majority owner and an even more cautious approach is justified. See Observer</p>

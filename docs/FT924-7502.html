			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (2): An easy target - Fightback campaign EVEN his worst enemy would probably concede that Mr John Hewson, leader of Australia's conservative opposition, is a brave man. Faced with an apparently disintegrating Labor government, it would have been easy for Mr Hewson to sit back and wait for the prime ministership to fall into his lap. Instead, he and Mr Peter Reith, the shadow treasurer (finance minister), persuaded the Liberal and National parties which make up the conservative coalition to take an almost unprecedented step: publication of a detailed programme for government, known as Fightback] In most areas, Fightback] proposes to extend or complete structural economic reforms initiated by the present Labor government or its predecessors. But the scale and scope of the proposed reforms makes it an easy target for Labor claims that the coalition plans a Thatcherite revolution. Under a Hewson government, privatisation of government-owned businesses would be stepped up, tariffs would be reduced to a maximum of 5 per cent by 2000, most of the remaining regulatory constraints on industry would be swept away, and the resources industry would be largely freed from constraints imposed by environmental and Aboriginal lobby groups. Each of these proposals is controversial in its own right, as Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, and Mr Bob Hawke, his predecessor, have discovered over the past decade in forcing more tentative changes through a sometimes reluctant parliament. But Fightback] goes further in two crucial areas: Industrial relations. Australia has a unique industrial relations system under which a network of quasi-judicial federal and state industrial relations commissions set wages for about 80 per cent of workers, often without reference to productivity, supply and demand or ability to pay. The commissions can order compulsory arbitration of disputes and fine or imprison workers or employers who fail to comply. Overlaying the commission structure is a separate prices and incomes accord between the government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), under which aggregate wage increases have been restrained in return for tax cuts and improvements in the 'social wage,' such as low-cost medical care. Labor has initiated tentative reform by reducing the number of occupational wage award classifications, and encouraging workplace bargaining agreements, although deals must still be registered with the relevant commission. Senator Peter Cook, the industrial relations minister, says this 'quiet revolution' has led to nearly 400 agreements in the past 12 months. Some agreements have triggered remarkable improvements in productivity. For example, Mr Michael Deeley, the former chairman of ICI Australia, says workplace agreements have transformed the competitive position of many of the company's plants. However, many employers are critical of the limited scope for negotiation allowed by Labor's new regime. The industrial relations commissions retain the power to block deals between workers and employers. For example, a recent deal between Qantas Airways and 18,000 employees was rejected by the federal commission on the grounds that neither side had justified a proposed 10 per cent pay increase. Mr Ian Spicer, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says many of the agreements which have been registered are 'quite uninspiring' especially when compared with what is being achieved in other countries. Fightback] responds to this concern by proposing the abolition of compulsory arbitration and occupational awards, except where employers and workers agree to remain within the existing system. Compulsory trade union membership would also be abolished, together with restrictions on overtime and shiftwork, which often attract legally enforceable penalty payments under the existing system. However, a minimum wage and other safety net provisions would be retained, undermining government claims that Fightback] would lead to exploitation of workers. Fightback] also implies that control of monetary policy would be handed over to an independent central bank. Mr Hewson has yet to spell out exactly how this would be done, but it is likely to be a key element of the reform programme if aggregate wage demand is to be restrained without the benefit of the present government's accord with the unions. The most likely scenario is a variant of the successful New Zealand model, under which the bank is instructed to achieve a specified medium-term inflation target. Taxation. Fightback] proposes the introduction of a 15 per cent goods and services tax, similar to Europe's value added tax, to switch the emphasis of revenue raising from direct to indirect taxes. The GST would raise consumer prices, but would be offset by personal tax cuts and the abolition of seven existing indirect taxes, including payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and petroleum excise tax. Economists are divided over whether the imposition of a GST would lead to an increase in the savings rate, and hence to a long-term reduction in Australia's perennial current account deficit and mountainous foreign debt. But most agree that it would benefit export-orientated industries by removing taxation from business inputs. Mr Hewson says he is confident that voters will understand the reasoning behind the GST proposal despite government attempts to portray it as a tax on essentials. His position is also strengthened by Mr Keating's attempt to introduce a GST in 1985, when he failed to win cabinet agreement in spite of presenting a strong case. However, the taxation proposals have come under attack from a wide range of organisations, including the ACTU, the poverty lobby, the churches, the tourism and construction industries and local authorities. In addition, the proposed tariff reductions are strongly opposed by parts of manufacturing industry - notably vehicle manufacturers and textile companies - and the plan to ease restrictions on mining has angered both environmental and Aboriginal lobby groups. The biggest fight is likely to be with the trade unions over the coalition's labour reform proposals, described by Mr Martin Ferguson, ACTU president, as a recipe for social conflict in 'a ratbag world of industrial relations.' However, Mr John Howard, the coalition's industrial relations spokesman, discounts the prospect of a bruising battle with the unions as a pre-election bluff. There is some evidence that he is right. Mr Ferguson told a recent business conference organised by the Amdahl Executive Institute that the unions were determined to protect workers by maintaining the award system. But he said the ACTU's response to the election of a conservative government would depend on circumstances. 'The ball is in the coalition's court. The union movement will not pick an industrial relations brawl,' he said. Nevertheless, Mr Hewson will need all his undoubted political courage if he is to resist pressure for piecemeal changes in Fightback] So far, his nerve has held. But holding the line may prove increasingly difficult as the next federal election moves inexorably closer.</p>

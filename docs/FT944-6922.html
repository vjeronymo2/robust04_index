			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Blair draws up radical change to Clause IV Labour's ruling National Executive Committee will meet on Wednesday to consider detailed proposals produced by Mr Tony Blair for radical redrafting of Clause IV of the party's commitment to widespread nationalisation. In a 17-page consultation paper being posted to NEC members over the weekend, the Labour leader calls for a new statement of values committing the party firmly to a competitive market economy. The consultation paper, which is subject to amendment by the NEC, will be sent to party members and affiliated unions next week in the first stage of a three-month consultation programme. A final version, intended to set out an updated statement of the party's aims and values for the 1990s, will be presented to the NEC in February or March and will probably then have to be approved by a special conference of party delegates. The consultation document makes a strong case for radical changes in Clause IV, which commits the party to common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. It points out forcefully that Labour is the only socialist party in Europe not to have changed its constitution in the last 80 years, during which time social and political conditions have been transformed. Most of Mr Blair's proposals focus on placing Labour's traditional values in a more modern setting, in line with his pledge to modernise the party, which he made in his first big speech as leader at the party's conference in October. In a passage that will ease leftwing suspicion of Mr Blair's motives, the consultation document says that public services must treat all citizens equally on the basis of their 'common humanity' rather than their purchasing power. A long section on economic policy promises to deal with 'concentrations of wealth and power' by adapting socialist values to modern conditions. However, the paper says it does not follow that common ownership is the only means of ensuring an equitable delivery of services and distribution of wealth. The consultation paper closes with a long list of priority values for the party, including social justice, democracy and equality. Officials said the paper was intended to provide a focus for discussion in the NEC and the wider party. 'It is not a draft. There is a lot of work to do yet,' a senior official said.</p>

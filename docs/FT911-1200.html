			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / A failed connection: Government commitment to telecoms competition appears to be wavering Less than two months after the government launched its telecommunications white paper, the new policy is beginning to look frayed at the edges. The white paper proclaimed that the exclusive rights to provide mainstream telephone services - previously held by British Telecom and its smaller rival Mercury Communications - would be abolished and the market would be opened to new competitors. Now, the companies which were expected to provide that competition - cable television operators, mobile communications companies and utilities such as British Rail - are accusing the government and the regulator, the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel), of selling out to pressure from BT. Mercury is also unhappy, although it is keeping a low profile in the belief that its influence will be greater if it works behind closed doors. The cause of the rumpus is the arcane, but vital, issue of interconnection charges - how much competitors must pay if they use BT's network to pick up or deliver calls. BT has the only network covering the whole of the UK and its rivals are therefore dependent in almost all cases, on BT's carrying calls for at least part of their journey. The competitors argue that the proposed interconnection fees are so swingeing that their profit margins will be squeezed and their ability to compete with BT undermined. The dispute may also have tarnished the impressive reputation of Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Oftel. He had come to be regarded as a fair-minded defender of both consumers and competitors against the near-monopoly power of BT, which still has 95 per cent of the market. 'There is concern that Carsberg's credibility is being undermined because he has caved in to BT,' says Mr Peter Borer, managing director of British Rail Telecommunications. There has been speculation both in the industry and in the City of London that the government has abandoned its tough line on introducing competition because it is anxious to maximise the value of its 49 per cent stake in BT, which it plans to privatise in the current financial year. Ms Maev Sullivan, Mercury's director of legal and regulatory affairs, describes the white paper as the 'BT prospectus'. Oftel's proposals for the interconnection fees consist of two elements: the first, a conveyance charge, would compensate BT for the costs of carrying a competitor's call, plus a reasonable profit; the second, the 'access deficit' charge, is designed to compensate BT for the fact that it runs unprofitable local networks. The idea is that BT has to keep its call charges higher than they would otherwise be in order to subsidise line rental charges which are lower than their costs. The intention is that competitors should make a similar subsidy to BT's local network whenever they use it. Oftel has produced illustrative figures suggesting that competitors might have to pay BT 0.3p a minute for local calls, 1.8p a minute for national calls and 11.6p a minute for international calls under the access deficit arrangement. Oftel's proposals have been attacked on five main grounds: The whole matter is being decided behind closed doors. Oftel is planning to determine the final interconnection rates on the basis of figures presented by BT, but these will not be open to public scrutiny. BT argues that its access deficit is Pounds 2bn a year, an estimate that competitors view as wildly exaggerated. Professor Bill Letwin of the London School of Economics argues that Oftel should hold public hearings. He says this would allow independent experts to challenge the assumptions on which Oftel bases its conclusions. Competitors are being forced to subsidise BT's inefficiency. The complaint is that the interconnection charges are to be based on BT's actual costs rather than the costs that would be incurred by an efficient operator. Mr Alan Harper, business strategy director of Unitel, one of the new breed of mobile communications networks, argues that this 'passes on to us inefficiencies in the BT system'. There should be no access deficit charge, only a conveyance fee. Mercury says that, under its existing interconnection agreement, it already pays a fair share of BT's costs of providing lines. If the new proposals stand, says Mr Peter van Cuylenberg, Mercury's chief executive, 'we will end up paying twice for the same elements of BT's network'. BT argues that an access deficit payment is necessary because it is not free to increase its line rental charges to cover the cost of providing them - a process known as rebalancing. The result is that competitors can undercut BT on long-distance and international calls because they do not bear the same burden. Mr Nick Measham, a telecommunications analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, says that the solution to the dispute is for the government to 'stop being cowards and remove the constraints on rebalancing'. There is no meaningful way of calculating an access deficit. Because it is impossible to make a call without a telephone line and there is not much point in having lines unless one wishes to make calls, it is pointless to try to allocate BT's costs between its services, the argument goes. Oftel's new critics are fond of pointing out that Sir Bryan made the same point himself in a speech last year, when he argued that 'attempts to quantify any cross-subsidy between calls and exchange lines are unlikely to yield any meaningful answers'. Sir Bryan, however, now seems to be doing just that. No account is taken of the benefits that BT gets from easy access to customers. Oftel proposes to calculate the access deficit by taking BT's revenue from connection and line rental charges and then subtracting the costs of providing lines. But competitors say that customers with BT lines tend by default to use BT for carrying their calls. BT also has the chance to sell its customers sophisticated new services and equipment - something not available to its competitors. 'BT still controls the customer at the end of the line. It wants us to pay the costs but not get these benefits,' says Unitel's Mr Harper. Although Sir Bryan has refused to discuss the interconnection dispute, he plans to publish a paper clarifying his policy in the next two weeks. Mercury, for one, hopes this will lead to significant modifications of the arrangements. Other potential competitors say they have been reassured by Sir Bryan's argument that the current interconnection proposals will only be an interim arrangement, as the whole matter will be up for review in 1993. There have even been suggestions that the issue could be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at that stage. Such suggestions, however, only serve to reinforce the idea that the government is concerned to have a quick fix now to help it sell the rest of its shares in BT. But it would be better to get the system right first time. New shareholders, after all, might feel misled if they bought shares in the company on one prospectus only to discover that the regulations were tightened once the sale was made.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling's silver lining The party conference season is often an anxious time for sterling. Last week saw a wobble on worries that the prime minister's authority would take another knock at Blackpool and that interest rates would be cut to regain some political bounce. This week will show if such fears are justified. On the surface, though, they look distinctly overdone. A rate cut at conference time was a favourite trick of Lady Thatcher's. Politically inspired cuts have become controversial since the pointedly disparaging remarks in Norman Lamont's resignation speech. While Mr Major may be in for a rough ride, it is hard to discern a shock with palpable economic consequences. One risk is that a bitter row over VAT on fuel may convince the markets that the government is unable to confront its deficit problem. But the City has been shading down its estimates of the PSBR and has given up expecting much by way of tax increases in November. The extension of VAT to items other than fuel - newspapers look a particularly obvious candidate after recent price-cutting - offers some compromise between those Conservative who want to maintain services and those who dislike direct tax increases. It might just suffice. Raising revenue through VAT will increase the headline inflation rate, however. That may be a further reason for caution on interest rate cuts. The money markets are discounting a mere half point fall by the end of the year. Sterling would be well under-pinned for the next few months if that is all that happens while continental countries cut much more.</p>

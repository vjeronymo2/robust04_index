			<p>BFN     [Text] The factions of the Liberal-Democratic and Russian  Unity and Accord parties in the State Duma came out with formal  statements on the Yugoslav developments, Friday.    The Liberal Democrats said that, to the growing surprise and  discontent of the fraternal Serb people, the Duma failed to take  action on the Yugoslav developments. That damaged the Duma's  international image.    The Liberal Democrats felt the Duma's strategy for the  former  Yugoslavia must be based on the message of the numerous  addresses and statements made by their leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy.    They advised the Duma to replace discussions of the Yugoslav  developments with resolute moves against barbaric anti-Yugoslav  actions by the United States, Germany and other countries.    The Liberal Democrats suggested that Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev address, without delay, the State Duma. Depending on  what he had to say, the Duma would decide whether he could  remain in office.    The faction of the Russian Unity and Accord party in the  State Duma said, in turn, that mistakes by the Foreign Ministry  tended to aggravate the Bosnian conflict. The Unity and Accord  party felt Moscow had blundered by hurrying to recognize unitary  Bosnia- Herzegovina, favoring the idea of one-sided  anti-Yugoslav sanctions and giving the green light to NATO's  plans to bomb Serb positions.    The parliamentary faction of the Unity and Accord party  called for immediate action on President Yeltsin's initiative  for an international conference on the Balkans.    It said Russia was to be the first to propose the lifting of  the "meaningless and unfair anti-Yugoslav sanctions". And if  the Croats and Moslems moved to torpedo peace negotiations,  Russia must push for the introduction of sanctions against those  two communities.</p>

More than 40 police were deployed at  Nigeria Union of Journalists House before the arrival of  Ransome-Kuti, preventing him and others from entering the  conference hall, the witnesses said. The human rights activist  later read the text of his speech, in which he called for the  immediate resignation of the regime of Sani Abacha, in front of  the hall to a crowd of journalists and human rights activists.    The blockade was the second time in a month that the police  tried to prevent a press conference in the same hall. On  January 13, Chief Arthur Nzeribe, the leader of the Association  for Better Nigeria, a pro-military group, was prevented by  police from addressing the press at the same venue.    Ransome-Kuti criticised the regime of General Abacha, who  came to power in November after ousting the then civilian head  of state, Ernest Shonekan. The human rights activist accused  the present military leadership of "corruption," insincerity and  political "gimmickry." The constitutional conference being  planned for this quarter by the regime was a ruse by the  administration to "consolidate its hold on political power," he  said. He described some members of the National Constitutional  Conference Commission, set up last month to prepare the  conference as "bandits and discredited politicians."  Ransome-Kuti called for the immediate resignation of Abacha's  regime and the handover of power to a national government which  would convene an alternative national conference. "We shall  henceforth consult, organise and mobilise Nigerians against  dictatorship", he stated.    Meanwhile it was reported that General Shehu Musa Yar'adua,  a  former deputy head of state in the late 1970s, had been arrested  last weekend by security agents. Yar'adua last month called on  Abacha not to stay in power beyond December 31. The arrest,  reported by the local press, has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>

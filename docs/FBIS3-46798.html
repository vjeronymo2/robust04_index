Here is  our comment on the issue:    The most important event in the Vietnamese-European  Community  is the official visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  to some EC countries in early July 1993, since the two sides had  established diplomatic relations in October 1990. On this  occasion, the Vietnamese prime minister had talks with Chairman  Jacques Delors, and two vice chairmen of the EC. The two sides  agreed to promote bilateral relations to a new stage. The EC  chairman was interested in the socioeconomic situation in  Vietnam and its diplomatic policy which help improve relations  among nations in the regions and held that Vietnam has followed  a correct political policy.    Chairman Jacques Delors committed to create favorable  conditions for Vietnam to broaden its relations with the EC  member countries. For their part, the EC member countries also  promised to encourage their group to do business with Vietnam.  The two vice chairmen also held that the visit by Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet was on time and believed that the  Vietnam-EC relation will be further developed in the future.    Before 1990, the EC had provided Vietnam with neccessary aid  worth of $110 million, (mainly with flour). In 1992, Vietnam  and the EC signed a contract to manufacture 106 items of textile  products. The contract had been implemented since early 1993.  However, due to the lack of technical equipment, Vietnam was  able to hand over to the EC 54 items of goods.    The two-way trade between Vietnam and the EC was estimated  at  $530 million, but Vietnam's export was only $224 million. The  EC also funded Vietnam's program to integrate those who left the  country illegally. However, the aid provided for Vietnam by EC  is still limited, and did not respond to the expectations of  both sides.    For this very reason, at 19 November session, the EC  Parliament adopted a resolution on the EC participation in the  international program on the repatriation of the Vietnamese  refugees. The resolution appreciated the results of the program  which was manifested by the increasing number of voluntary  repatriates from 1988 to 1992. The resolution called on the EC  committee to take appropriate measures to complete the program  on time, and called on its member countries to fulfill their  commitments. The resolution held that the program result can  only be sustainable with the help for Vietnam to promote  socioeconomic situation. Vietnam needs to have (multiple) aid  granted by EC for developing countries. The resolution called  on the EC committee to carry out a large scale cooperation  program with Vietnam. The resolution also advocated further  talks for the signing of a framework agreement on economic and  trade agreement with Vietnam in this year, [words indistinct] of  the representation of Vietnam, following the signing the  agreement.    These activities are in conformity with the statement by EC  Chairman Jacques Delors at the first meeting with Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet, that let's start a new stage for the future.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Serb Socialists fail to oust Panic Serbia's ruling Socialists yesterday abandoned their campaign to oust Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, after they failed to win the backing of President Dobrica Cosic, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The failure to oust the Belgrade-born US businessman was a defeat for Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and raises the stakes in the bitter power struggle between Mr Milosevic, on one side, and Mr Panic and Mr Cosic on the other. The Socialists said their turnaround was conditional on the federal government and the prime minister accepting their 'well-intentioned criticism' as a political warning.' Key Serb politicians yesterday tried to distance themselves from the no-confidence motion proposed on Monday by the 68 deputies from the Socialist party and its satellite, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical party. After three days of manoeuvrings, President Cosic, a well-known writer also seen as the embodiment of Serb unity, yesterday publicly lashed out at the no-confidence motion as a 'half-baked and irresponsible move'.</p>

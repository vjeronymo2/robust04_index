			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / G7 lists investment terms for east: Western ministers attempt to strengthen hand of reformers TRADE ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations spelt out at the weekend actions needed from the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to attract more foreign investment. They also agreed that western economies must open their markets to more imports from the former communist states. The list of necessary measures - including the legal protection of foreign investment and private property, reliable banking systems, clear rules on responsibility for environmental damage, and well-defined contract laws - was agreed with economics and trade ministers from the seven most important eastern economies at an 'east-west trade summit' in Munster. It amounts to a deliberate move by the G7 countries to strengthen the hands of market reformers in eastern Europe, when facing hostility to foreign investment. However, the most substantive result to emerge from the two-day conference, organised by Mr Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, in his home town, was a separate deal between Germany and Russia allowing the resumption of Hermes export credit guarantees on German exports. In bilateral discussions, Mr Andrei Nechayev, Russian economics minister, was able to satisfy his German counterpart that Russia would give governmental counter-guarantees for Hermes-backed trade, the absence of which has effectively blocked new contracts for German exports since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The deal means that guarantees from Hermes, Bonn's leading export credit agency, can now be given up to a ceiling of DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) this year, although this level will be reviewed every three months. German exporters, above all those from former East Germany, have been badly hit by the absence of export credit insurance to Russia. Ms Barbara Franklin, US commerce secretary, said after the conference that the eastern delegates welcomed pressure for a reliable legal framework for foreign investment. Mr Nechayev admitted the Russian parliament, more conservative and suspicious of economic reform than the government, had held up passage of such legislation. He hoped a satisfactory legal framework for investors would soon be in place.</p>

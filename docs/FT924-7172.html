			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Yeltsin seeks to restore faith of S Korean investors: Why Russia is anxious to revive economic co-operation while Seoul-based companies remain cautious MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, is hoping to revive South Korean investment confidence in his country during his visit to Seoul, which begins today. In spite of Russia's potential as a source of both raw materials and high-technology, most Korean companies are cautious about its prospects. Total Korean investment in the CIS, mostly in Russia, has amounted to Dollars 27m since 1989, when the two countries established trade offices. This is only about a tenth of the investment Korean companies have made during the same period in China, another recently opened market for Korea. Moreover, Korean investment in the CIS has declined from its peak in 1990, when it reached Dollars 16.4m. This included Dollars 16m invested by Hyundai in a timber and furniture joint venture in the Russian Far East, the single largest Korean investment to date. Investment dropped to Dollars 2.9m in 1991. Although it has risen to Dollars 7.3m during the first 10 months of 1992, only Dollars 306,000 has been committed since June. Korean companies have been deterred by growing political turmoil and foreign exchange problems. Hyundai, Korea's largest conglomerate, complains that new export taxes and foreign exchange controls are threatening the future of its timber project, in the port of Svetlaya. Moreover, investment confidence was weakened after Russia was unable to meet interest payments on a Dollars 1.5bn loan and trade credit package granted in 1990, when the two countries established diplomatic ties. The debt problem forced Korea to withhold a second promised loan tranche of Dollars 1.5bn. An apparent solution was reached last week when Russia agreed to pay the overdue interest in cash and kind. Resumption of Korean credits will enable Russia to buy more Korean goods and increase bilateral trade, which amounted to Dollars 1.2bn in 1991 with Korea enjoying a slight trade surplus of Dollars 48m. Some of the credits have been used to purchase Korean production facilities and components. But the granting of further loans has become a political issue in this year's presidential election. 'The government is rushing to promote economic co-operation with Russia, which is unprepared to utilise Korean economic aid,' Mr Kim Dae-jung, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Democratic Party, said yesterday. Nonetheless, Korean investment in Russia should grow next year. Daewoo is planning to invest Dollars 20m in a bus assembly plant in Khabarovsk and Dollars 10m in a St Petersburg consumer electronics factory. Kohap, a textile group, is developing plans with local Russian officials to establish an industrial complex for Korean companies in the port of Nakhodka. Mr Yeltsin's visit will include the formal signing of a contract for a feasibility study of a proposed Dollars 20bn project to develop natural gas reserves in the Russian republic of Yakut-Sakha. The study, will involve a consortium of Korean companies, including state-owned Korea Petroleum Development, Daewoo, Yukong Oil, Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar. Of more immediate impact will be Korean assistance in converting Russian military factories to civilian use in return for technology transfers, in such areas as aerospace, machinery, electronics and telecommunications. Both Daewoo and Samsung have already imported Russian aerospace technology. Daewoo Heavy Industries is building, from designs provided by Kamov Helicopter Scientific &amp; Technology, pilotless helicopters that will spray agricultural pesticides. Russia also hopes to sell military equipment to South Korea with this week's signing of a military co-operation treaty. However, Seoul is expected to purchase only a limited quantity of weapons to increase understanding of the Soviet-made arms that North Korea is using. Double taxation and customs clearance agreements will also be concluded during Mr Yeltsin's visit.  --------------------------------------------------            KOREAN-CIS TRADE  -------------------------------------------------- Year     Amount           Surplus        Surplus                           favours      Dollars m  -------------------------------------------------- 1989     Dollars 559m     Russia             183 1990     Dollars 889m     Korea              149 1991     Dollars 1.2bn    Korea               48 1992*    Dollars 763m     Russia              84  -------------------------------------------------- * Jan-Sept  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Korean Foreign Trade Asociation  -------------------------------------------------- Korean investment in CIS  -------------------------------------------------- Year     Amount              No of projects  -------------------------------------------------- 1989     Dollars 480,000           2 1990     Dollars 16.45m            3 1991     Dollars 2.9m              9 1992*    Dollars 7.3m             12  -------------------------------------------------- * Jan-Oct Source Bank of Korea  --------------------------------------------------</p>

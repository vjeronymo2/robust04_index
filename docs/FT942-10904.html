			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / World News in Brief: Yemen's civil war intensifies as north targets Aden Heavy ground fighting erupted throughout Yemen with air attacks against several cities as the country entered its third day of an intensifying civil war. Northern military leaders in Sanaa, the capital, said they aimed to capture the southern port city of Aden and take control of the country. They said the south fired a Scud missile at Sanaa which exploded close to the presidential palace. Fears about the conflict coincided with concerns about tight oil supplies to push oil prices higher. North Sea Brent crude rose by 50 cents to Dollars 16.05 a barrel. Page 24; Background, Page 2</p>

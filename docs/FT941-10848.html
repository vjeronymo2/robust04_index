			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Central Asians look westwards Leaders of central Asian republics have been sending signals they are serious about establishing a stable, friendly environment for economic development. The International Monetary Fund has put its name behind two republics, issuing credit to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is negotiating with Uzbekistan. An increasing number of investors have been bypassing Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states for central Asia, especially Kazakhstan. This has occurred in tandem with Russia's demise as the economic crossroads and clearing house for the 14 ex-Soviet republics. Uzbekistan's recent and sudden conversion to free market policies has been greeted with interest, and some scepticism, since President Islam Karimov has watered down or failed to implement previous reforms. But the Uzbek programme, announced on January 23 by presidential decree, promises for the first time to auction off state enterprises publicly; foreigners may bid. The decree enacts a five-year tax holiday for manufacturers established under more than 50 per cent foreign ownership, and phases out import duties in July 1995. Uzbekistan is rich in gold and produces a huge cotton crop. The Kazakh president, Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, announced an economic reform programme last week that goes even further then Uzbekistan's. It freed prices on consumer goods on January 1, set a 1994 budget deficit target of 4 per cent of GNP, and froze state salaries, a risky step in the conservative republic. Kazakhstan is attracting attention primarily because of its tremendous deposits of oil and natural gas. But Mr Nazarbayev has also embarked on what ranks as among the ex-Soviet Union's most ambitious privatisation programmes. Last year, Philip Morris became the first private owner of a large Kazakhstan enterprise, paying Dollars 313m (Pounds 208.6m) for a big cigarette factory and tobacco farms in the capital, Alma-Ata. Now, the government has issued a list of 38 more state-owned enterprises, some employing up to 40,000 people, for auctioning to the foreign bidders. In Kyrgyzstan, President Asghar Akayev, frustrated by parliamentary and bureaucratic conservatives, recently obtained more authority to pursue his reformist programme. Kyrgyz voters endorsed Mr Akayev with a 96 per cent approval rating in a national referendum, and he has said he will push ahead with structural reforms and privatisation. Even if many of these reforms are only partially put into practice, they reflect a greater acknowledgment in the region than at any time in the last two years that the Soviet days are over.</p>

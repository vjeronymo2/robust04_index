			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Smokers' damages cases begin Smokers who believe they have been seriously injured as a result of the negligence of tobacco companies have been 'unlawfully and irrationally' denied legal aid to pursue their claims, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr Michael Beloff QC was launching 28 test case actions relating to a total of 227 claims. He said the group action, potentially worth more than Pounds 20m, could not go ahead without legal aid because the alleged victims - mostly from Liverpool but also from London and the south-east - lacked funds to fight a legal battle for compensation. Gallaher, Rothmans, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco are accused of negligence in failing to take steps to minimise the dangers of smoking, carrying out or publicising research into the risks, or giving adequate warnings of those risks. Mr Beloff said 110,000 people in the UK died prematurely each year as a result of smoking and hundreds of thousands more were damaged. Leading lawyers had estimated individual potential claims ranged between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 250,000. Many of his clients were seriously ill and three had died since the first application for legal aid had been made. The Northern Area Legal Aid Committee had 'killed' claimants' hopes of obtaining redress. It decided last year that the tobacco companies were prima facie in breach of the duty to take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of harm and give reasonable warnings. But committee members were not persuaded that any single individual in the group action, who suffer from a range of smoking-related diseases, could establish that he or she fell ill as a result of that breach of duty. The committee also decided that the cost of taking on the tobacco companies 'was not worth the candle'. Mr Beloff described both decisions as 'curious and unreasonable' and asked Mr Justice Popplewell to quash them and to order a fresh hearing before a different committee. The hearing continues today.</p>

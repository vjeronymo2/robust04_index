			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Sally Blyth and Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] In a final act of brinkmanship, Britain has  declared to China its bottom line on the future of the military  sites. It is believed that Britain has informed China that if  no agreement is reached officially by early July, Britain cannot  guarantee that all military facilities would be ready for  handover by July 1, 1997.    Hopes of reaching an overall agreement on defence sites will  rapidly fade unless China accepts Britain's position at this  morning's meeting.    Britain's bottom line includes two contentious points that  remain unresolved despite protracted negotiations: A limit on  the size of the Stonecutters Island naval base and the number of  military residential blocks to be handed over to China. It is  understood that Britain told China of its position on both  issues at yesterday's plenary session of the Joint Liaison Group  (JLG).    China has insisted on a much larger naval base and  complained  that Britain was willing to hand over only 30 percent of the  residential blocks available.    Britain had hoped an agreement could be reached this morning  by the expert team, in time to be endorsed by the plenary  session. Britain's timetable is for the Hong Kong Government to  apply for the funding necessary for redeveloping these military  sites at the last Legislative Council finance committee meeting  of the political calendar on July 15. A JLG agreement will have  to be reached soon to allow enough time between now and mid-July  to prepare the necessary papers on funding for committee members.    The funding will be essential for the redevelopment of  military hospitals and refurbishment of a number of buildings at  some military sites, as well as the expansion of the  Stonecutters Island naval base before 1997. This will take time  to complete. Further land reclamation works on Stonecutters  Island, for example, will take at least three months.    China has agreed to hand over any military sites not used by  the military to the future Special Administrative Region  government.    The expert team talks on the military sites have been  conducted simultaneously with the JLG plenary session, which is  due to end today.    At yesterday's meeting, both sides failed to agree on right  of abode for returning Hong Kong migrants. Britain has also  failed to secure China's agreement on the construction of the  much-delayed Container Terminal Nine (CT9). The granting of CT9  development rights is one of the main issues on the JLG agenda.    Guo Fengmin, the head of the Chinese JLG team, said China  would not agree on the terminal until Hong Kong people had been  consulted. China has insisted that the terminal must be built in  a cost-effective way.    If no agreement on defence lands is made this morning, it is  expected that both sides will announce agreements on a number of  multilateral treaties affecting the economy and trade.    Meanwhile, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, Lu Ping, has said an agreement on airport financing  could come as early as the end of this month. In an interview  with the ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL published yesterday, Lu was  quoted as saying China would accept debts for the airport far  above the HK$5 billion limit once insisted upon and contained in  the Memorandum of Understanding. Lu's comments are the  strongest signal of support from China so far on the latest  airport financing proposal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 25 Feb (EFE) -- The 24  alleged Zapatists imprisoned in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of  Chiapas State, have presented reports of torture, isolation, and  starvation for several days, which are currently being  investigated by the state authorities.    In an interview held on Thursday evening with Chiapas  Governor Javier Lopez Moreno at Cerro Hueco Prison, the 24  members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN)  complained about mistreatment. Among other things, the Zapatists  said they were denied medical attention and food. They added  that they were isolated and some of them tortured for hours and  that no authority tried to prevent this, a government source  told EFE today.    Father Pablo Romo, member of the Fray Bartolome de las Casas  Human Rights Center (led by Bishop Samuel Ruiz, mediator in the  armed conflict), told EFE the Zapatists were subject to physical  and psychological torture. "The tortures and threats -- which he  did not specify -- mainly occurred at the time of their arrest  rather than in prison, but other arbitrary actions occurred  there," Romo said.    The EZLN members were arrested, along with 46 comrades who  have been released, shortly after the EZLN's 1 January military  uprising, and their release has been demanded on numerous  occasions by nongovernment human rights organizations and the  EZLN general command.    Following his meeting with the prisoners, the governor said  an investigation will be ordered "to ascertain if the inmates'  complaints are justified" and, if they are, the culprits will be  "severely" punished. "I am interested in an investigation to  learn if it is true this abuse was perpetrated. All the  complaints will be investigated because no inmate's human rights  should be violated," the governor stated.    Lopez Moreno visited the Cerro Hueco Prison a day after  meeting with Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, chairman of the National  Human Rights Commission. It is surmised they discussed the  Zapatists' case during the meeting.    Pablo Romo told EFE that the Zapatists who have already been  released were also subject to arbitrary actions at the time of  their arrest and during their imprisonment and that "it is  almost certain they will file criminal charges against their  aggressors." Romo admitted the government is "firmly" determined  to receive and solve their complaints because it will not let  the authorities perpetrate illegal actions.    Two weeks ago the Chiapas Congress approved a law to punish  torture, and it adheres to other reforms carried out by Chiapas  State legislation within the last 40 days to decriminalize  certain activities, including riots and demonstrations against  the government, which were formerly punishable. The reforms were  followed by the approval of an amnesty law for the Chiapas  rebels and other groups which might rise up in arms, but it  holds the amnesty contingent with the surrender of weapons.    Thirty-eight of the 70 Zapatists arrested at the beginning  of  the armed conflict were released on 28 January, and eight more  were released on 22 February following recommendations from the  Attorney General's Office to the state's Superior Court of  Justice. All the released rebels had to pay between $330 and  $666 each to leave prison. Their bail was paid by the National  Indian Institute and the Fund for the Management of State  Justice, given the EZLN's lack of resources.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AS USUAL, CANADIENS' ROY HOLDS OFF JETS, 5-1  </P> <P> Goaltender Patrick Roy of the Montreal Canadiens is usually the calmest man on  the ice.  </P> <P> But when the Winnipeg Jets show up, Roy gets excited.  </P> <P> Roy stopped 25 shots Wednesday night at Montreal and led the Canadiens to a 5-1  victory over the Jets that enabled Montreal to tie the Buffalo Sabres for first  place in the Adams Division.  </P> <P> Roy, 8-0 against the Jets, had his toughest test in the first period, when he  made 13 saves. He held the Jets scoreless for 47 minutes while the Canadiens  were building a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> Roy, 9-5-0 this season, lost his shutout when Pat Elynuik scored with less than  13 minutes remaining.  </P> <P> Montreal broke the game open in the second period when it scored three goals  while outshooting the Jets, 14-4.  </P> <P> Shayne Corson and Stephane Richer each scored his ninth goal for the Canadiens.  </P> <P> Richer is becoming the key offensive player.  </P> <P> "I just show up every night," he said. "The way I've been playing just gives me  more and more confidence."  </P> <P> Boston 5, Hartford 2 -- Although his record against the Whalers isn't perfect,  the Bruins' Andy Moog is at his best when he faces them.  </P> <P> In a game at Hartford, Conn., Moog stopped 24 shots to improve his record  against the Whalers to 11-3-1 and extend the Bruins' unbeaten streak to five  games.  </P> <P> The Bruins' Bob Joyce, who had not scored in 13 games, had his first goal and  an assist to lead the offense.  </P> <P> Minnesota 2, New Jersey 1 -- Clark Donatelli scored on a breakaway 95 seconds  into overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., to give the North Stars their fourth  victory in a row.  </P> <P> Goaltender Jon Caajsey stopped 30 shots to become a 10-game winner and put  Minnesota just four points out of first place in the Norris Division.  </P> <P> Kirk Muller scored for New Jersey at 2:50 of the second period, and Dave Gagner  tied the game at 14:35 with his 10th goal.  </P> <P> New Jersey failed to score on six power-play opportunities. The North Stars, in  the last 28 situations in which they were a man short, have given up only two  goals.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, St. Louis 2 -- The Maple Leafs trailed, 2-0, late in the first  period at Toronto, then scored five times in a row to turn the game around.  </P> <P> Mark Osborne's goal at 14:35 of the second period put Toronto, 10-10-0, in  front to stay.  </P> <P> The second goal for the Blues was the 18th of the season for Brett Hull.

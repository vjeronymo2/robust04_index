			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Water After a deluge of information last year, water company shareholders are suffering a drought. That unhappy situation is likely to continue until July when Ofwat, the industry regulator, unveils companies' price limits for the second half of the decade. Since the companies themselves will know Ofwat's decision in May - and will have to distribute the figures internally for planning purposes - the weeks running up to the official announcement are likely to be especially choppy. Let's hope that the Stock Exchange's watchdogs will be more than usually alert. Capital spending plans for most water companies have been edging down as the government has relaxed water quality targets. Since lower spending means less borrowing, the companies might live comfortably with a tighter price cap as a result. But the benefit has not been spread evenly. Thanks to its peculiar geography, for example, Northumbrian Water's spending plans have crept higher. There must be a chance that at least one of the water companies will appeal to the Monopolies Commission. A price cap which pushed interest cover close to two times might provoke such an appeal, on the grounds that the company would be unable to raise sufficient funding. Welsh Water's recent sterling bond included a cover ratio of 1.5 times in its covenants. But lenders will demand greater protection as water companies start to borrow in earnest. Whether Ofwat will be prepared to give ground on this issue if faced with the threat of appeal remains an open question.</p>

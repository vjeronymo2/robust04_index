Payolas to  the bosses. So they can work. In the south as well as the north.  Even after "Clean Hands." And what if one rebels against the  blackmail? One quits. Or escapes abroad. That is the astounding  result of a survey carried out among young businessmen. Who  nevertheless have not lost hope that Di Pietro &amp; Co....    Pino Arlacchi teaches Applied Sociology at the College of  Political Sciences, University of Florence, and is considered  the leading Italian scholar on organized crime. The research for  this article was coordinated, from the standpoint of  methodology, by Professor Alberto Marradi of the University of  Florence, and was carried out by a team of researchers of the  ARS (Association for Social Research) of Florence.    The young businessmen of Confindustria [General  Confederation  of Italian Industry] have had the courage to press for a survey  of corruption and Mafia criminality--a survey that has long been  urged but never carried out, until now, because it would be  disturbing, possibly upsetting, to the paunchy and not  altogether sound nor transparent body of Italy's industrial  capitalism. The survey set out to measure the extent of the  bribery system before and after "Clean Hands," assess the damage  inflicted by organized crime on productive companies and on the  development of southern Italy, and to provide an idea of the  depth of penetration of the country's small and medium-sized  industries by dirty money. A sector, that is, in which the  almost 800 heads of companies who responded to the questionnaire  sent to the 7,563 members of the Association of Young  Businessmen operate.    The survey was based on the assumption that a large sector  exists consisting of clean businesses and businessmen who have  been damaged by unfair and/or violent competition on the part of  dirty and politically protected businesses and businessmen.    To the question on the occasional or compulsory practice of  payment of bribe money to obtain public contracts prior to the  investigation of corruption, 85 percent responded affirmatively.  This 85 percent encompasses much of the Italian anomaly in the  field of corruption. According to the considered opinion of the  company heads, in no other developed Western country are the  vast majority of companies compelled to pay bribe money to its  public works and services contracting officials on an ongoing  regular or occasional basis.  <H5>  Inflation? Blame It on Bribes </H5>   The cited figure proves homogeneous for the entire national  territory in that individual values range from a minimum of 82  percent who responded affirmatively in the north-central regions  (Umbria, Tuscany, Marche, Emilia Romagna, and Sardinia), to a  maximum of 98 percent of affirmative responses by businessmen  residing in the three regions in which organized crime is most  deeply rooted (Sicily, Calabria, and Campania).    The results of the survey therefore provide a confirmation  of  evaluations that insist upon the rational and systemic nature of  corruption. The differences between North and South, and between  "mafiose" zones and "nonmafiose" areas are not such as to  justify attributing exclusively to Southern Italy, or to mafia  presence, the degrading of relations between the economy and  governmental authority. They provide no basis in fact for  postulating a division of the country between a supposed clean,  productive North, where the government and the enterprises  working for it benefit from ethics and behavior typical of  "advanced development," and a supposed South pervaded by an  outlaw mentality and praxis.    The totalizing dimension of the pre-Clean Hands incidence of  corruption that emerges from this survey does lead, however, to  deductions of a politico-economic nature. When the payment of a  sum of money becomes a common practice, a compelling or quasi  compelling custom incumbent upon all the businesses in a given  sector, it will tend to be considered as a tax and to be  transferred to final prices. The businesses that sell public  works or services will pad their cost estimates and will request  upward revisions in ongoing works projects to cover this "tax."  And in the final analysis, the entire cost of those public  works, and of the kickbacks and bribes included therein, is  borne by the taxpaying citizens.  <H5>  Enter Clean Hands </H5>   In the case of generalized extortive  racketeering--commonplace in Italy, especially in the commercial  operations sector--the costs of bribe money translate into price  increases and in this case are borne by the consumer-citizen.    In both cases, the effect is inflationary and its costs are  not borne by the givers or receivers of the bribes, who  therefore, for their part, have no great interest in breaking  the circuit of solidary "omerta" [the mafia code of silence], or  in rebelling. The corruption machine ran smoothly for over a  decade with the consensus or support of the partners, until the  Milan magistrates intervened. But the magistrates intervened on  the basis of concerns other than the rise of the inflation rate.    The unraveling of the system at the stitches came about by  way of "little episodes" of internal origin into which the  action of a third power--the judiciary authority--began to delve  and eventually dismantled the gearing of the machine, but not as  the result of a collective protest action by the system's  entrepreneurial component. The entrepreneurial system itself  mounted no opposition whatever, either on principle or in  practice, to the praxis of bribery.    Out of loyalty to the amoralist and familist tradition of a  certain Italian capitalism? In keeping with an economic ethic  averse to "protestation?" The point is arguable.    The responses to the question on changes in the system of  kickbacks after the advent of Clean Hands indicate a situation  that is by all means positive, in that there has unquestionably  been a change, but by no means certain as to its long-term  effects. The entrepreneurs who responded to the question on  continued payment of bribe money after the judiciary  investigations of corruption are divided as follows:    a) 42 percent stated that "the practice has greatly  diminished";    b) 40 percent judged that "the practice is slightly less  widespread" than before;    c) only 5.5 percent considered that the practice "has  disappeared";    d) 13 percent deemed that "bribe money continues to be paid  as before."    The evaluations are clearly cautious, pointing more toward  the reality of a transition than of an acquired success with a  permanent future. If the responses objectively reflect a factual  situation, we find ourselves confronting a serious crisis, in  terms of the compactness and cogency of corruption, that could  lead to a split of the enterprise system into two sectors: those  enterprises that "pay," and those that refuse to pay bribe money  because the magistracy's growing pressure will render  inoperative any possible retaliation by the government  contracting officials.    Any illusions as to the coming about of a duality of this  nature within the intermediate term are best avoided. The  enterprises that "pay" will in any case, sooner or later, end up  with a competitive advantage over those that refuse to submit.  The extra cost borne by the enterprises that pay will shrink  their immediate profits, but this shrinkage will be more than  offset by the most-favored-enterprise treatment they will  receive in terms of future contracts reserved for them by  corrupt contracting officials.    The results of the survey relative to the damages and  distortions induced by the presence of organized crime in the  national economy and individual regional economies present a  mixed composition of lights and shadows. While marketplace  relations at a few levels have been affected to what is still a  minor extent by the criminal investigations, they have been hit  in a severe and alarming way at other levels. These are the most  sensitive levels, in that they concern investment decisions and  the growth of existing enterprises.  <H5>  When Corruption Nullifies the Market </H5>   To the question regarding constraints on the buying and  selling of capital goods and raw materials, the overwhelming  majority--87 percent, or 659 in absolute figures--of the  entrepreneurs who responded ruled out the presence of  constraints of any nature whatever. This proportion drops to 72  percent in the three regions at maximum risk, where 13 percent  of the respondents stated that they are bound by constraints  stemming from "threats" or the "fear of incurring unpleasant  consequences." The ratio is 3.3 percent for the country as a  whole.    These figures appear to contradict the cataclysmic  assessments of the extent of penetration and direct conditioning  of the Italian industrial markets by criminal enterprises and by  the economic and political power coalitions linked with them.  and to indicate the continued existence of abundant and  broad-ranging free-market potentialities today in the industrial  fabric of the regions most stricken by the mafia pathology.    The measurement of the influence exerted by organized crime,  and blackmail of a politico-administrative nature, on the  bidding for public works contracts, as evaluated by this survey,  confirms evaluations obtained by other means. To the question:  "Have you ever had to refrain from bidding on a public works  contract because of pressures or threats?" 73 percent of the  young entrepreneurs who responded stated that they had not. But  this "no" consists of a minority of contractors operating in the  high-risk regions and a more substantial majority of contractors  residing in other regions. In Calabria, Sicily, and Campania,  only 42 percent of the respondents stated that they had not been  compelled to forgo competitive bidding on a public works  contract. All of 23 percent stated that they had abstained  because of threats they had received from competitors tied to  organized crime, and 35 percent because of constrictive  pressures of other nature. Given the close ties or simply the  coincidence between Southern Italy's corrupt politics and the  mafia powers there, it is not far-fetched to deduce that the  latter two figures can be combined. This gives us a total of 58  percent of the heads of small and medium-sized enterprises in  Italy's more polluted South being compelled by the force of  politico-mafioso intimidation to renounce one of their  fundamental rights.    The question on compulsory cession of capital shares  produced  a significant confirmation of the progression of degenerative  factors in the economy of broad zones of Southern Italy.    Overall, 85 percent of the respondents denied the existence  of this pathology in the zones of their respective activities.  But the division of the country in this respect emerged very  sharply. While 93 percent of the entrepreneurs operating in  Lombardy reported absence of the practice of compulsory cession  of shares by enterprises, 53 percent of the heads of enterprises  in Calabria, Sicily, and Campania reported a massive presence of  this pathology there. If the latter figure can be taken as  representative of the entire regional business community there,  it follows that the presence of capital generated by organized  crime or political corruption influences directly the ownership  of approximately half the industrial enterprises of three  Italian regions, in which 12.6 million people, or approximately  one fifth of the Italian population, live.  <H5>  Diffusion of Tainted Capital </H5>   It is in the capital market that research finds the source  of  a full-fledged "criminal unification" of the country. To the  question on the presence, in the responder's zone of activity,  of companies benefiting from the inflow of capital of dubious  origin, only 38 percent responded negatively. All of 54 percent  of the respondents as a whole stated that "some" enterprises  benefit from tainted capital, and 6.4 percent stated that there  were many such enterprises. The perecentage of entrepreneurs who  affirm the existence of at least some suspicious enterprises in  their zone of activity is notably homogeneous. The band of  variations around this figure was narrow, ranging from a minimum  of 53 percent in the central and northern regions to a maximum  of 59 percent in the northwestern regions.    The results of this study thus confirm the view that divides  the expansion of capital and illicit investments in Italy into  two fundamental periods. The first, in which profits, both  lawful and unlawful, of the criminal enterprises were  transformed into investments and bank deposits in the areas of  interest to the criminal groups, provoking an exodus of "clean"  enterprises and capital, and a stagnation of Southern Italy's  economy, is identifiable with the 1970's. The second period  began in the 1980's and is still in progress. It is  characterized by an emigration from Southern Italy not only of  clean capital, but also of tainted capital in search of  exploitable opportunities and camouflage, which are no longer  possible in their areas of origin that were degraded and  depressed during the preceding decade. It can therefore be  stated that some 20 years of expansion of illicit activities in  our country have created a situation in which the presence of  capital of criminal origin in virtually every geographical zone  and economic sector is highly probable.    The greatest damage inflicted on southern Italy's economy by  the presence of political corruption and organized crime is not  the imposition of kickbacks, payment of bribe money, and other  forms of graft that distress the heads of industries and  translate into blackmail, threats, and damage to dissenters.  This is just the most visible and obvious aspect.    The greatest damage is that which does not meet the eye. It  is expressed in the impeding of business growth, a crippling,  "silent" flight of capital from the region, and in the deterring  of investment in the region by northern investors. These  pathologies represent today perhaps the main obstacles to a  takeoff of Southern Italy's economy. Turning to the question on  abstention from investment in the entrepreneur's own region  because of the dominant criminal activity there, the ratio of  resident businessmen who responded affirmatively in the three  regions that are traditional mafia strongholds was 27 percent,  versus 3 percent for the nation as a whole, and 1 percent for  Northern Italy. The discouraging effect on private investment  directly attributable to organized crime involves one fourth of  the young entrepreneurs in Calabria, Sicily, and Campania.  <H5>  Defeat the Mafia, for Economic Development </H5>   If the foregoing figures are taken as indicative of the  ratio  of capital investment being deterred, and if the fact is taken  into account that the young entrepreneurs comprise the most  dynamic, and the "most resistant to discouragement," sector of  the business community, it can be said that the presence of  organized crime is responsible for a "shortfall" of a good one  third of investments, production, employment, and revenue.    In other words, it can be stated that a winning strategy for  countering the mafia and corruption could contribute to raising  by about one third the fundamental economic variables of the  most polluted regions.    To the above-indicated dynamics must be added the  consequences of the shortfall of investments from outside the  economic system of the high-risk zone itself and of Southern  Italy as a whole. Between 25 and 26 percent of the entrepreneurs  operating in Northern Italy's most industrialized regions  reported having decided not to invest "in one or more zones" of  the country, specifically owing to the presence of organized  crime in the zones of interest.

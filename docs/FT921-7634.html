			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Carbon Link buys German coal producer Carbon Link of the UK has acquired AUG, an eastern German producer of activated coal, from the Treuhand privatisation agency with the help of venture capital from the East German Investment Trust. The purchase, for an undisclosed price, commits Carbon Link to invest DM20m (Pounds 6.9m) in AUG up to 1995. Treuhand stressed that because of the sale to Carbon Link, AUG would not become an 'extended workbench of west German companies'. Under the deal AUG is assured of the exclusive supply of coconut shell activated coal from Sri Lanka which is processed and marketed under the Precolith label. This rounds out the company's line of products to include all applications of activated coal: environmental protection, water treatment and removal of pollutants from air and water.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted that because the statute specifies both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of work expected to be completed and the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timeframe for an academic year for use in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, an institution might need to prorate or adjust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program assistance for its students. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the span of time from the first scheduled class at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the school year until the last examination at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of the school year (excluding any weeks that consist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusively of vacation time and all other activities not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly related to instruction, preparation for examinations or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations) is twenty-five weeks, the institution would need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make adjustments in accordance with individual program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Because summer sessions generally would not be long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to constitute the equivalent of a complete semester or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter, as they are under various current program regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program funds awarded for summer sessions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be adjusted to reflect the lengths of the sessions. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive discussion of the potential effect of this new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of academic year on Federal Pell Grant calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be found in the NPRM on the Federal Pell Grant Program to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published shortly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Full-Time Student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes it is necessary to have a definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time student <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that is applicable to all Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. A definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time student <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is needed because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is based, in part, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workload of a full-time student, and because the term is used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elsewhere for other purposes in part 668. The Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed a definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time student <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that would be based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a slightly modified definition found in the Federal Pell Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the campus-based program regulations. This definition also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would incorporate parts of the definition of full-time student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the FFEL program regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the Secretary proposes to define a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an enrolled student who is carrying a full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic workload (other than by correspondence) as determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution under a standard applicable to all students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrolled in a particular educational program. In determining a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's workload, an institution would be permitted to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combinations of courses, work, research, or special studies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution considers sufficient to classify the student as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student. Under this proposal, for an undergraduate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student, an institution's minimum standard must equal or exceed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 12 semester hours or 12 quarter hours per academic term in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an educational program using a semester, trimester, or quarter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system; (2) 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours per academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year for an educational program using credit hours but not using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a semester, trimester, or quarter system (or the prorated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent for a program of less than one academic year); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 24 clock hours per week for an educational program using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This definition also provides for a method for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time status for students enrolled in an educational program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using both credit and clock hours. In order to evaluate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined workload of the student, an institution could determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time status based on the sum of the proportionate workload  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried in terms of credit hours and the proportionate workload  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried in terms of clock hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, an undergraduate student could be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student if he or she undertakes a series of courses or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seminars that equals at least 12 semester hours or 12 quarter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours in a maximum of 18 weeks. For cooperative education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, an undergraduate student could be considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student if the work portion of a cooperative education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program in which the amount of work performed is equivalent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the academic workload of a full-time student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is particularly interested in establishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum standard for a full-time academic workload for students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who receive funds under the FFEL programs. Currently, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of those programs, an institution determines what a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time academic workload is for these students. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that, because no minimum requirement for an academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workload of a full-time student exists under the FFEL programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is the potential for abuse of FFEL program funds through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of the definition of an academic year. For example, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution might have educational programs that are measured in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit hours and do not use academic terms. The institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could claim that it offers a full academic year's worth of work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over a thirty-week period by giving a full-time student a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of instruction, which the institution claims to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to 24 semester or 36 quarter hours. This situation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result in the receipt of an inordinately large amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL program funds for the amount of work actually accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary requests comments on whether, to further address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this potential abuse, he should also establish a weekly minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time workload for educational programs that are measured in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit hours but do not use academic terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

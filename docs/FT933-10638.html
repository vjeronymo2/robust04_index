			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Judgment day Having finally summoned up the courage to cast off the shackles of the ERM, European governments are surprisingly reluctant to use their new freedom. Perhaps the lack of news on interest rate cuts yesterday means finance ministers still do not understand it was unbearably high interest rates - and not speculators - that brought the system to its knees. Perhaps, like Britain last autumn, they must endure a period of nervous anxiety about inflation and the exchange rate before setting policy firmly on course for recovery. That could explain the muted response of equity markets to the weekend's developments. Granted Danish shares rose by 4 per cent, but the Paris market was up by only 2 per cent. In Madrid and Brussels the gains were even less. Unless governments deliver the hoped-for interest rate cuts reasonably soon there is a risk that even such a modest overall advance could stall. None of the markets with newly liberated currencies is likely to show the kind of spurt London put on after the UK left the ERM. To a greater or lesser degree Sunday night or something similar was discounted in advance. That only adds to the risk of disappointment. It may well be that the French franc has further to fall as interest rates are cut. Sterling began to recover only after rates had fallen to 6 per cent and some real economic recovery was in sight. But the French authorities would be deluding themselves if they thought holding interest rates steady would support the franc for long. Foreign exchange markets would then be back to worrying about growth forgone, rising unemployment and a mounting budget deficit. Sooner or later, lower short-term rates will have to come.</p>

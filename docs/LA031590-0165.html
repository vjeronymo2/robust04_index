			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUS PASSENGER GETS TRIP TO POLICE STATION AFTER JOY RIDE  </P> <P> A passenger on a Santa Monica city bus decided to take it for a joy ride  Wednesday, driving through the city for 15 minutes before parking and going  into a restaurant, where he was arrested, police said.  </P> <P> Three other passengers were on the bus at 4th Street and Broadway in Santa  Monica when the 45-year-old man jumped into the driver's seat at 7:30 p.m.  after the regular driver left the bus for undetermined reasons, Sgt. George  Cortwright said.  </P> <P> The man, who refused to give police his name, drove several blocks, hit a  parked car, and continued to Pico and Centinela boulevards, where he parked the  bus with the engine running. One passenger followed him into a nearby  restaurant where two California Highway Patrol officers and a Los Angeles  police officer were eating, Cortwright said. The passenger told the officers  what had happened, and they arrested the man for investigation of grand theft  auto and kidnaping.  </P></p>

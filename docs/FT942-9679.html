			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Major seeks long-term judgment Mr John Major last night used the truce in British politics to appeal for more time and ask that his government be judged over the full five-year term of its mandate, which he intended to complete. He also used it to try to heal differences in the Conservative party on the European Union by arguing that Britain needed to be there to ensure that the EU made the right decisions on its future. In a warmly received speech to Scottish Conservatives - which was stripped of party-political point-scoring because of the death of John Smith - the prime minister urged politicians to abandon the negative approach to politics. 'Sometimes I feel that there is too much knocking, too much carping, too much sneering. Too much setting up of Aunt Sally against Aunt Sally,' he said. 'Being negative can be an addictive drug . . . But like any drug it corrodes and destroys the body in which it exists. And one body which it runs the risk of corrupting is the body politic itself.' He said the government was not yet halfway through the five-year mandate it had won from more than 14m people 'and I intend to complete it. And then I shall say: judge me on my whole term of office. All of it. You can't judge a house when only the foundations are laid.' The government wanted to complete the agenda that he set out last October at the party conference in Blackpool - the priorities were to achieve a stable economy, combat crime and raise standards in schools. Mr Major said inflation had been brought down and keeping it down would remain the cornerstone of economic policy. Crime was being tackled with new legislation, and teacher training was the last part of the education reform programme. On Europe, Mr Major warned that 'unless it makes the right choices about policy today - unless it adopts free-market policies and believes in them - Europe won't be up there in the next century with the US, Japan and China'. That was why Britain must play its full part. But he acknowledged that the issue of Europe touched deep nerves in the British politics. A Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph shows that 45.5 per cent of those questioned would vote Labour in a general election, 25 per cent Liberal Democrat and 24.5 per cent Conservative. The figures are based on a sample of 1,155 electors interviewed between May 4 and May 9.</p>

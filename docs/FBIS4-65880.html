			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Annette Levy-Willard: "Izetbegovic Urges Lifting </F> of Embargo"]    [Excerpt] Why did Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic  decide to stop in Paris on Sunday evening [22 May] on his way  back from Riyadh, where he had been on pilgrimage to Mecca? "To  see Bernard-Henri Levy's film "Bosnia!" in which he plays an  important role," the president's advisers consistently argue in  order to maintain the fiction of a "private nonpolitical visit."    It was therefore vital for the Bosnian president to go and  see the film, despite the late hour. So, at around 2230, when  the Saudi plane landed at le Bourget Airport, Alija Izetbegovic,  accompanied by the Bosnian ambassador to France, climbed into  one of the cars placed at his disposal by the official visits  department, crossed Paris as if it was a Le Mans race, with  motorcycle outriders and flashing lights, and went to the  Haute-Feuille cinema, in the Latin Quarter, where Paris' Bosnian  community was waiting for him.    At the end of the film, President Izetbegovic stood up and  addressed his compatriots in Serbo-Croat. "People have heard a  great deal said about Bosnia," he said, "but it is much more  important to see than to hear. This film is a very powerful  documentary which will stir up consciences in France and abroad.  You have just seen a painful truth but the film does not show us  as victims. It shows the resistance of our people caught  between the grip of Croatian fascism and Serbian fascism."    The Bosnian president then drew up an optimistic picture of  the military situation on the ground: "We are now stronger and  they are weaker. I have just visited the front lines and I  noticed a strange strength there. Our people cannot be  defeated. Faced with the dilemma of `fighting or dying,' we  have chosen to live."    Condemning the Western countries which "intervened to impose  an embargo on arms for Bosnia," Alija Izetbegovic is now asking  them to stop intervening: "Let us fight," he cried. "The Serbs  have not succeeded in turning us into criminals like them. Does  this mean we will forgive them one day? No, we will never  forgive what they have done to our women and children." The  crowd in the cinema gave a long standing ovation to the  president and philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy.    At the Raphael Hotel in Paris on Monday morning, the real  purpose of the Bosnian president's flash visit to Paris could no  longer be concealed: To give support to the campaign of the  intellectuals, who will present a list called "Europe Begins at  Sarajevo" in the European elections. Izetbegovic came to try to  convince the French that the embargo should be lifted and the  partition of Bosnia rejected. [passage omitted]</p>

Opening the evening session, Ivan Rybkin, the elected  chairman of the State Duma, said that he believed the Duma's  main task was "to finish structuring itself and begin lawmaking  work."    Boris Zolotukhin, who spoke next, informed the people's  deputies of a coordinated decision by leaders of deputies'  associations to hold a recess in the plenary sessions of the  Duma to allow for the work of factions and deputies' groups.  During the recess "the nominations for and the number of Duma  deputy chairmen are to be agreed upon, as well as the  nominations for the posts of heads of State Duma committees."    The composition of the Duma Credentials Commission was also  approved before the recess. The commission must now elect its  own head.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / W German inflation revised upward: New rate matches level of pay offer to public sector workers WEST GERMANY'S inflation rate proved higher than first estimated last month. Announcement yesterday of a 4.8 per cent annual rate came as public sector workers considered whether to strike over a pay offer of exactly the same size. The new figure compares with the provisional 4.7 per cent earlier reported for March by the federal statistics office based on returns from four states. The steady rise in German inflation above 4 per cent has prompted the Bundesbank to lift official interest rates to record post-war levels, with the central bank also concerned over the rapid increase in money supply. Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank director, said recently that although inflation would fall well below 4 per cent by the year's end, it was unfortunate in view of wage talks that it would remain above this level for a while. The public sector unions have called strike ballots after turning down a 4.8 per cent package. Mr Issing said it was too early to tell when the higher interest rates would brake money supply growth, indicating that they would not be cut for some time. 'It's like a big tanker,' he said of the money supply expansion. 'If it's on the wrong course, it takes time to correct this.' West Germany's trade surplus totalled DM1.6bn (Pounds 560m) in February against DM412m in January and DM2.1bn in February, 1991, the statistics office said. Figures for the whole of Germany, already reported, showed a February surplus of DM2.2bn, up from DM45m in January.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon the members of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] Central Executive Bureau held  a meeting, at their request, with President Ion Iliescu to  examine the current political situation and the role to be  played by the PDSR, as the government party, to solve the  political, economic, and social problems facing Romania.    According to a communique sent to us, the members of the  PDSR's Central Executive Bureau do not consider that there is  currently a political crisis in Romania, and the activity of the  institutions of the law-governed state is taking place in  conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the country.  In this context they acknowledged the efforts made by President  Iliescu to establish a climate favorable for the internal and  international stability of the country.    The second part of the meeting was devoted to the  examination  of certain issues related to the PDSR's current preoccupations,  both at the central and local levels, the activity of its  factions in both houses of Parliament, and relations with the  parties supporting Nicolae Vacaroiu's cabinet and with the other  parliamentary political parties.    The PDSR communique emphasizes that the Central Executive  Bureau has found that lately the attacks intensified against the  party and its top leadership, and especially against PDSR  Executive Chairman Adrian Nastase. According to the communique,  the members of the PDSR Central Executive Bureau reject, quote,  such demolition tactics that are not foreign to certain forces  of the opposition, unquote.    The PDSR Central Executive Bureau has decided that coherent  and firm actions should be initiated at all levels against  corruption and the phenomenon of infraction, to rebuild the  population's confidence in the authorities of the law-governed  state, says the PDSR communique signed by PDSR Deputy Chairman  Ion Solcanu.</p>

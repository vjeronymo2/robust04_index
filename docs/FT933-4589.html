			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: CRH in IPounds 147m rights issue for expansion CRH, Dublin-based international construction and building materials group, announced yesterday a one-for-five rights issue to raise IPounds 147m (Pounds 135m) to finance acquisitions over the next two years. The size of the issue, at IPounds 2.60 per share, surprised analysts and the shares closed down 9p at 292p. The announcement was made simultaneously with better-than-expected interim results showing an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 25.1m on turnover up 17 per cent to IPounds 647m for the six months to end-June. At the same time the company reported two further building material acquisitions in the US for IPounds 30m. It is buying Pennsy Supply, a building materials supplier in Pennsylvania, and Clemente-Latham Concrete, a ready-mix concrete supplier in upstate New York. They had combined sales of Dollars 46m last year. Dublin analysts were surprised by the cash call, underwritten by UBS, given the small size of the acquisitions identified so far. They have upgraded their forecasts, however, for the full year on the back of the interim result. Mr John Conroy of NCB stockbrokers is predicting full-year earnings per share of 18p, in anticipation of a better second half result and 'the two eps-enhancing acquisitions in the US'. Mr Jack Hayes, managing director for finance and development of the group, said: 'We think it is a good time to be buying now, and we want to be able to do so without overstretching ourselves.' He said CRH has spent some IPounds 600m on acquisitions over the past decade and a further IPounds 300m in capital investment, most of which has been financed from cash flow. Only IPounds 104m has been raised since 1984 in one rights issue and two placings. Acquisitions totalling IPounds 100m are expected to be made this year, including the latest two in the US, and similar spending is anticipated in 1994. Mr Hayes said that without a rights issue, group gearing could approach 100 per cent. 'This could have acted as a constraint on new acquisitions. We want to keep our flexibility to be able to move fast' he said. Gearing will fall from 60 per cent at June 30, to just below 20 per cent after the rights issue. Earnings grew by 13 per cent to 6.98p (6.17p) in the half year, and an interim dividend of 2.34p (2.25p) is declared. COMMENT This call by CRH on a market which is not awash with surplus cash is a cheeky move by a group which has put in a good performance in comparison with its industry peers. But it looks as though investors will buy the explanation that CRH needs to finance a very aggressive acquisition programme to consolidate its diversified base in the US and European construction industries. With interest cover now almost half the level four years ago, some strengthening of the balance sheet was called for. But CRH will have to find the acquisitions quickly and deliver the earnings to reward its shareholders' faith. A p/e of 16 on forecast earnings of 18p this year indicates investor caution.</p>

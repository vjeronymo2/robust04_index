			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL CITES TRAFFIC EFFECTS IN FARMLAND REZONING DENIAL  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the defeat of a county tax increase for road improvements,  the Ventura County Planning Commission denied a proposal Thursday that would  have set the stage for a new development in the Santa Rosa Valley east of  Camarillo.  </P> <P> Measure A, the proposed half-cent sales tax that was defeated Nov. 6 by a 2-1  margin, would have given funds to the county to improve Santa Rosa Road, a main  east-west artery that connects Simi Valley and Moorpark to the Camarillo area.  </P> <P> The county's General Plan prohibits development where roads are inadequate to  handle an influx of new residents.  </P> <P> Nine agricultural land owners in the Santa Rosa Valley who have attempted for  years to have their property zoned from open space to one-acre parcels were  denied their request for a General Plan amendment, which would have changed 12  parcels to 278 additional parcels, adding about 900 people to the area if fully  developed.  </P> <P> In a 3-2 vote, with commissioners Laura Newman and Mary Alice Henderson  dissenting, commissioners said that while they understood the plight of the  owners, they could not approve their request to change the county's General  Plan without first addressing traffic, sewer and educational effects.  </P> <P> The rezoning proposal will still be submitted to the Board of Supervisors on  Dec. 4, said Stanley Cohen, attorney for the Caston Trust, which represents all  the property owners who own a total of more than 330 acres.  </P> <P> Property owners told stories of keeping their land in agricultural use in the  past, only to find that neighbors had received approval from the Board of  Supervisors to develop adjacent property in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Carolynn B. Nicholson, who owns 57 acres, said her property is surrounded by  one-acre zoning. "We've been bounced around by the county. . . . We entered  into a land-use contract so that agriculture would be preserved, but that was  not the direction that the Board of Supervisors took."  </P> <P> Nicholson said the helicopter company that sprays her crops told her that it  will no longer be able to spray because of the proximity of housing. "I cannot  stay in agriculture," she said.  </P> <P> Henderson, who attempted to change the land-use amendment from one acre to five  acres and leave four of the parcels in a greenbelt to be approved by the county  and Camarillo, said she could not accept the planning staff's recommendation to  deny the proposal.  </P> <P> "This is a true horror story. . . . I think we can try to appease both," she  said.  </P> <P> But commissioners also heard pleas from Camarillo officials that the land-use  change could only bring more problems.  </P> <P> J. William Little, Camarillo's city manager, said approval of the Caston Trust  proposal, along with other developments in various planning stages, would add  about 6,200 people to the area.  </P> <P> "That's like building a city equivalent to the size of Ojai," he said.  </P></p>

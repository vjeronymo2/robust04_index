			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff offers farewell Pounds 1.2m pay-out Pittencrieff, the natural resources and communications company, is offering share-holders a farewell Pounds 1.2m pay-out, as the delayed demerger of the two divisions got under way again yesterday. Shareholders will receive a 4p second interim dividend before the demerger takes effect at the end of June. Mr Terry Heneaghan, Pittencrieff chief executive, said the company had been unable to pay a final due to the demerger. 'We thought shareholders deserved the dividend and we had the resources to pay it,' he said. Pittencrieff also announced that it had scrapped plans to list the communications company in the UK through an introduction. Mr Heneaghan said the complications of meeting the requirements of the US and UK regulatory bodies would have meant a further delay of up to four weeks. Pittencrieff Communications Inc will now be listed solely on Nasdaq. Pittencrieff shareholders are being offered one share in a new company, Pittencrieff Resources, for every share in the original group. They will also receive five PCI shares for every 24 of the original company. Pittencrieff Resources has applied for a listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

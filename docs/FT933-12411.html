			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Romania fails to agree IMF deal Romania has failed to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a new standby arrangement which would unlock Dollars 3bn of foreign loans, Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. An IMF mission left Bucharest yesterday after two weeks of negotiations failed to produce an agreement to replace the previous one which expired last March. Mr Maxwell Watson, head of the mission, said the outstanding issues were the need to restructure state-owned enterprises and to curb inflation. The country's failure to impose stricter financial discipline on state companies, which have built up Dollars 2.4bn in inter-enterprise debt, is seen as a major contribution to inflation. Inflation reached 225 per cent a year in May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today at 12:00 pm the fourth reactor of the Kolskiy  Nuclear Power Station was closed down due to a technical fault  in the security system. Currently, the energy block is  functioning at one percent of capacity. However, the fourth  block can be repaired only after the third one, which stopped at  the end of 1993, renews its work. The first and the second  blocks were temporarily closed down about four months ago.    A working commission has been set up on the Kolskiy Nuclear  Power Station. It is expected to give an expert evaluation of  the condition of the reactor which is out of order, an Interfax  correspondent learned.</p>

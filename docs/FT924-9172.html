			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls marginally in futures-related activity SHARE prices were influenced by futures-led activity and small-lot trading, the Nikkei average falling marginally in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 33.61 to 17,031.59 after fluctuating in negative territory for most of the session, recording a day's low of 16,903.01 in the morning, and a high of 17,122.67 just before the close on arbitrage buying. Volume edged up to 180m shares from 153m, reflecting some buying from public funds and investment trusts. Declines led advances by 462 to 420, with 174 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 5.48 to 1,288.37. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off just 0.48 at 1,031.59. Mr Yasuhiko Jinza, manager of stock investments at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer, said that while a US economic recovery through fiscal spending could be good for Japanese exporters, Mr Clinton's calls for a tougher stance on trade were a cause for concern. Institutional investors remained on the sidelines. Rumours that the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan had made inquiries about share prices prompted speculation that financial authorities were eager to stop excessive selling. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said buying orders by trust banks were raised to the 17,000 level from 16,500, also indicating support. High-technology blue chips were weaker on concern about earnings due to currency fluctuations. Hitachi receded Y10 to Y728 and Fujitsu Y6 to Y551, but Toshiba gained Y5 at Y603 on foreign buying. Speculators returned to theme stocks related to nuclear fusion. Shoko, the chemical wholesaler, was the most active issue of the day, forging ahead Y61 to Y570. The company trades in deuterium, a chemical used for nuclear fusion experiments. Aisin Seiki rose Y20 to Y1,160 on the same theme. Pharmaceutical issues were lower on profit-taking, but Sankyo defied the trend, advancing Y30 to Y2,300 on forecasts of firm growth. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 23.74 to 18,503.59 in volume of 11.3m shares. Aoyama Trading, a men's clothing retailer, rose Y110 to Y7,540 on hopes of an increase in sales of its cheaper office worker suits. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly stronger yesterday.

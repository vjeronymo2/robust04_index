			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY IN PAKISTAN  </P> <P> In your story on new democracies (Part A, March 25), your staff writers Robin  Wright and Jim Mann make a number of flimsy and unsubstantiated charges against  the Pakistan government.  </P> <P> For instance, when discussing the perceived rise in corruption during this  government's tenure, your writers fail to provide a shred of evidence.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has repeatedly offered to sack any member of her  government against whom a corruption charge is proved. Trial by allegation is  neither fair nor is it practiced in any democratic nation.  </P> <P> You quote an unnamed analyst as saying that Ms. Bhutto is ". . . politicking,  not governing. . . ." Allow me to dispel this impression by quoting from the  Jan. 8 issue of the IMF Survey: ". . . the Pakistan Government has made a  commendable start in tackling many of the country's financial and structural  problems. A number of further, broad-based measures are being implemented in  the current fiscal year and others are scheduled for 1990/91 and thereafter.  These measures are expected to correct financial imbalances . . . while putting  Pakistan on a more balanced and sustainable economic growth path." Not a bad  end-of-year report on somebody your "analyst" says is "not a good manager."  </P> <P> Your writers then go on to speculate at some length on the stability and  durability of this government. The recent PPP victory in a crucial Lahore  by-election suggests that popular support is still intact, and there is no  reason to doubt Ms. Bhutto's ability to govern for the remainder of her term.  </P> <P> I would like to assure your readers that in Pakistan democracy is alive and  well.  </P> <P> IRFAN HUSAIN  </P> <P> Minister of Information  </P> <P> Pakistan Embassy  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

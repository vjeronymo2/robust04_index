An official of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), which  groups all the opposition organisations, told AFP that the phony  papers had been distributed since January 6 and that another  edition was being prepared.    "We imitated the dummy and the lay-out with photos of Saddam  Husayn and filled the columns with criticism, calls for  overthrowing the regime and revelations which Iraqis living  under Saddam's rule are not used to," the opposition official  said by telephone from Irbil in northern Iraq's autonomous  Kurdish region.    Other INC leaders contacted by telephone in Irbil and London  said the distribution of the fake BABIL edition was continuing  despite a campaign by the Iraqi authorities to confiscate all  the copies.    They said another edition was being prepared in Irbil, which  has been under the control of Iraqi Kurds since 1991, and where  the INC have a computerized printing-house.    "The state television had to issue warnings on January 16,  calling on the Iraqis to denounce the offenders," a INC official  said.    "We receive all the Iraqi newspapers in the north. The  citizens living under the control of Baghdad need to be able to  hear other views than the official literature," he added.    He said it would not be difficult for the opposition to  infiltrate other publications into the country.    Iraq's Kurds declared autonomy after expelling Iraqi troops  from their mountainous region in an uprising which followed  Baghdad's defeat in the Gulf war early in 1991.</p>

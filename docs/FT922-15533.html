			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / West Midlands chambers see indications of recovery SCATTERED signs that the West Midlands economy may be starting to move out of recession have emerged from a survey of companies in the region by chambers of commerce which was published yesterday. For the fourth quarter in succession, a growing proportion of manufacturing companies have reported an increase in both home and export orders. The same is true for service companies on the domestic market, but the proportion experiencing a rise in export orders fell in the March quarter after three successive quarterly increases. The chambers' survey covered the performance of almost 450 companies, split nearly evenly between the manufacturing and service sectors. Membership is strongly weighted towards small and medium-sized companies. The west Midlands region is regarded widely as a barometer for the state of UK industry. The returns for the March quarter in the chambers' series of three-monthly surveys show that, in manufacturing, nearly 30 per cent of companies have growing order books. In the services sector, 30 per cent of companies have lengthening order books for the home market, and 26 per cent for exports. But the survey also shows that cashflow remains a significant problem for most companies and that investment intentions remain subdued. Moreover, up to 20 per cent of companies are still intending to lay off personnel. All of this suggests that the proverbial light at the end of the recession tunnel is only dimly visible. Mr Howard Davis, chairman of the west Midlands group of chambers, said there was 'a serious problem of overtrading looming for cash-strapped companies who have survived so far, but may find they cannot finance swelling order books.'</p>

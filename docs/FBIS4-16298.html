			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- Sergey Glazyev, Andrey Golovin,  Oleg Rumyantsev, Aleksandr Tsipko, Veniamin Sokolov and other  politicians have announced the formation of a Russian movement,  the People's Alliance [Narodnyy Alyans]. Members of the  founding council have called upon their supporters in the  provinces of the Russian Federation to start forming local  structures of the movement.    Sergey Glazyev, one of the leaders of the People's Alliance  and the chairman of the State Duma committee for economic  policy, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "We are calling for a  union, so that we may avert the final collapse of the Russian  state, avert sedition, disintegration of the economy, moral and  spiritual degradation."    He also said that the founders of the movement proceeded  from  the fact that "historically Russia developed as a multinational  society within a single state which belongs equally to all  peoples of our country, and the peoples of the former USSR  retain their right to uniting in different ways on a voluntary  basis, including political unification."    The statement of the People's Alliance says that a union of  this kind can "prevent a relapse into authoritarianism."  "Forming the policy and strategy of national reconciliation"  was named as the main aim of the movement. It was stressed that  the new sociopolitical movement "supports solely those reforms  which stimulate the growth of production and strengthen the  positions of Russian producers both in their own country and on  the world market."    According to Sergey Glazyev, the People's Alliance regards  establishing a true democracy in Russia as its aim. "At the same  time, we are convinced that democracy must grow on a national  soil, help strengthen people's dignity and teach them a  conscious attitude to politics," he said.    The founders of the movement insist that traditions of  parliamentarism should be carried further and reinforced, which,  in their opinion, is in agreement with "Russia's traditions of  popular assemblies [veche] and contributes to respect for the  constitutional system, law and legislative activity."</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / US and Russia in Bosnian initiatives THE US and Russia are taking new initiatives to try to breathe life into the peace process in Bosnia, spurred on by the Bosnian Serbs' expected rejection of the international peace plan in their referendum last weekend. Croats and Moslems, meanwhile, fought savage street battles yesterday in the Bosnian town of Mostar, which was rocked by a big explosion, possibly an ammunition dump. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the way had been cleared for a new round of discussions between the US and its allies, 'some of whom have been wanting to hold up until after the referendum'. Consultations with US allies would be held by phone over the next few days. But he said he had no plans to go to New York on Friday for a UN Security Council foreign ministers' meeting, being sought by Russia. The meeting, if held, would discuss UN peacekeeping projects, but the US fears it would underline the world's failure to agree on what to do next about Bosnia. Though the Bosnian Serb referendum results are not expected until tomorrow, Mr Christopher appeared to assume overwhelming rejection of the Vance-Owen peace plan. The US consultations about Bosnia coincide with a peace mission by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister. He went to Berlin yesterday for talks with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, and is due to meet Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian leaders in Split and Belgrade, starting today. Mr Kozyrev said last night: 'We won't let a few militants and warlords stop the international community from extinguishing the war in Bosnia.' The international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, will also fly to the former Yugoslavia today for talks with the Croatian and Bosnian presidents. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the peace talks, was much more optimistic than his western counterparts about the Bosnian situation, when announcing Mr Kozyrev's mission in Moscow yesterday. 'It is our view that there are not so many hardliners among the Bosnian Serbs and they will be further isolated,' he told journalists. Serbia's 'very clear stand' for a peaceful settlement, and its blockade of supplies to the Bosnian Serbs, except food and medicine, would change their minds about the peace plan. Mr Churkin reiterated Moscow's proposal that the Vance-Owen plan should be implemented by the international community by stages. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday apologised for his army chief, General Ratko Mladic, who threatened bomb attacks in western cities, particularly London, if the west intervened in Bosnia. 'That was an irresponsible and emotional reaction,' Mr Karadzic said. Britain dismissed Gen Mladic's remarks as 'bombast and bluster'. Croatian radio claimed that the big explosion in Mostar yesterday was caused by a Moslem ammunition dump, which went up 'with tragic consequences'. Moslem-controlled radio reported the historic centre was in flames after the explosion. It accused Croat artillery of levelling the city centre. 'Several ancient objects have been utterly destroyed. The medieval bridge, listed as a world heritage by Unesco, was severely damaged.'</p>

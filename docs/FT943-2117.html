			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Subdued M4 points to weak inflation pressure Lending by banks and building societies to the private sector was subdued last month, providing further indications that inflationary pressures in the economy remain relatively weak. Figures from the Bank of England show that lending by banks and building societies - M4 lending - rose by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.9bn last month. This was lower than the market consensus of a Pounds 2.2bn rise. M4, the broad measure of the money supply which consists of notes and coins as well as bank and building society deposits, increased by 0.4 per cent last month compared with July. In the year to August M4 grew by 4.7 per cent, down from 4.8 per cent in July. Analysts yesterday admitted that the weakness of M4 was striking in light of the overall strength of economic recovery. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets said: 'This increase of Pounds 2bn is absolutely peanuts compared to the levels we saw five years ago. This shows that this is not a recovery driven by demand for credit.' This patchy picture in the levels of lending was further underlined by figures from the British Bankers' Association, which showed that lending to the corporate sector continued to fall last month. Overall lending by the main British banking groups to the private sector rose to Pounds 1.6bn last month, up from Pounds 1.5bn in July. However, lending to the non-financial companies sector fell, as the corporate sector, which is now increasingly cash rich, continued to repay its debts. Manufacturers repaid Pounds 185m in August, while property companies repaid Pounds 227m. Lending to individuals, in contrast, rose by Pounds 836m last month, compared with July, while consumer credit rose for the fifth successive month, with a Pounds 236m rise over July. Personal deposits fell by Pounds 748m. Lord Inchyra, director general of the bankers association said: 'The combination of a further increase in consumer credit and a substantial fall in personal deposits suggests that consumers may now be feeling the effects of higher taxation.' Lending to financial companies also rose, with a Pounds 197m rise in the level of lending to insurance companies and pension funds. Lex, Page 22</p>

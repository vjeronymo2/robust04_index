			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro De Leon Carpio said that fiscal  reforms are intended to ensure tax fairness. The president also  denied that the reforms could undermine the Guatemalan  population.    According to the president, extraordinary taxes will only  affect approximately 3,000 persons and legal entities that earn  more than 500,000 quetzals in income. Likewise, he indicated  that "it is completely false that the reforms proposed last week  will tax the majority of the population since the VAT  [Value-Added Tax] remains at 7 percent and the only thing that  is being sought is to widen the base rate.    He pointed out that if Congress does not pass the reforms  proposed by the Executive Branch, tax evasion could total 250  million quetzals during the year. De Leon Carpio also said that  the government is under pressure to cut its liability and  increase its revenues in order to be able to invest more in  basic services that will benefit the population. "Hospitals and  schools alone owe more than 1.2 billion quetzals to their  creditors," he stipulated.</p>

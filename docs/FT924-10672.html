			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / People: Powerful moves at Rolls-Royce Less than six months after being appointed managing director of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI), part of Rolls-Royce, Richard Maudslay has been promoted again. From November 1, he will be managing director of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, reporting to the man he succeeds - Terry Harrison, the newly-appointed chief executive of Rolls-Royce. Maudslay, a 45-year-old engineer, began his career in 1969 with NEI Peebles in Edinburgh. This May, after seven years as md of NEI Parsons, he was named md at NEI. His responsibilities will now include NEI, along with the Industrial Power Group's three other main businesses, R-R Industrial &amp; Marine Gas Turbines, R-R Nuclear Engineering and R-R Industries Canada. He also joins the Rolls-Royce corporate executive committee. Maudslay's move brings two further appointments. His successor as md at NEI will be Andrew Perkins, md of R-R Nuclear Engineering since early 1992. Perkins in turn is succeeded by Tony Roulstone, currently general manager for performance and engineering systems at R-R Aerospace Group.</p>

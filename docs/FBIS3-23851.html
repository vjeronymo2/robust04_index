			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Fedorov (St. Petersburg): "We Need a </F> Precise Program"]    [Text] Representatives of the trade-union organizations of  the largest machine-building enterprises called upon all labor  collectives in the country to stop the total devastation of the  national economic complex and to not be indifferent observers of  the tribulations of national industry. They had gathered for a  joint meeting in the Kirovskiy Zavod joint-stock company.    It has been more than 70 years since Russia experienced this  kind of economic collapse, and whereas the collapse then was  caused largely by the effects of civil war and intervention, now  the powers that be are wholly to blame. As speakers said at the  meeting, all structures of production management--local,  regional, and national--are absolutely paralyzed.    Agricultural machine building, however, might be in the  worst  position. All work has stopped at the largest tractor  plants--the Altay, Vladimir, Volgograd, Lipetsk, and Ural  plants. Tractor production is at a standstill at the Kirov  Plant, and this has halted operations at most other related  enterprises. Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers  have had to take an unpaid leave from work.    The survival of the enterprises, speakers said, will require  a precise government program for emergence from the crisis,  primarily entailing changes in tax policy, the alleviation of  the effects of mutual non-payments, and the creation of  advantageous conditions for Russian producers of goods.    "It has to begin with the payment of the state's debts to  the  rural community and with its economic revitalization," said  Chairman Pozdnyakov of the trade-union committee of the  Rostselmash joint-stock company. "Then industry will also  recover."    Speakers suggested that all members of labor collectives be  asked to gather at their previous places of employment as a  means of exerting social pressure and reinforcing the  consolidation of the laboring public. An organizing committee  was formed to take charge of the preparations for an all-Russian  conference of industrial workers.</p>

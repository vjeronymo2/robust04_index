			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Filatov, Russian presidential </F> administration chief: "Who Is Unhappy with Civic Peace"]    [Text] It would seem that the idea of national  conciliation should be welcomed by all. It has been welcomed,  in a word. As soon as negotiations began on a possible  agreement, however, it emerged that representatives of various  political forces will find it rather difficult to come to terms  on this score. To be sure, immediately voices began to be  heard: "What is the point of launching this burdensome  undertaking in the first place?" Indeed, is it impossible to  pursue reform without a civic accord agreement? Of course, it is  not. Yet is it necessary to prove how much more difficult this  will be in the conditions of confrontation and political  hysteria and without a mechanism for coordinating social  interests?    In my opinion, we have had our share of such difficulties  and  can now sum up the results. The reforms have been moving not  dynamically and consistently enough primarily owing to political  instability. Hence the forced deviations from reform in the  sphere of economics, the wary attitude by Western investors, the  inefficiency of some power institutions, and many other things.  It is specially dangerous that not only politicians have found  themselves on different sides of the barricades, but that  society itself has begun to divide into conflicting camps. Do  we have the right to pass up the opportunity to pacify society  and provide it peaceful living conditions?    This chance, I am sure, exists today. Parliamentary  elections have been held; there are two years to go before  presidential elections; a new constitution has been adopted and  put into effect; the Federal Assembly is beginning to function  in a steady rhythm....    Yet all of this, alas, against the backdrop of an economic  and social crisis. But if we unleash a war of public rallies  and provoke a wave of strikes, will bread become cheaper or will  pensioners enjoy better living standards?    Yes, the process of preparing and signing the accord -- and  this is precisely a process -- will not be easy. Its  implementation will be still more difficult. Yet the way work  on the document has been proceeding in the past few days shows  that the efforts by all the sides concerned are not in vain.    It will be recalled that the first version of the accord,  prepared by a working group, aroused serious objections in the  course of discussion in the Public Chamber. Some thought that  the document should describe in detail which principles should  underlie economic policy and specifically how reform will  develop. No question: It would be good to agree on this....  Yet, after all, our task is to ensure the broadest possible  circle of parties to the agreement, attracting sensible  political figures of all orientations. This is why the  conciliation pact is of a fairly general character.    Yet even the most general formulas did not come about  easily.  Some thought the accord was too rigid; others, on the contrary,  considered it too vague.... Yes, this has been a process of  mutual concessions and search for conciliatory formulas and  compromise; and how can it possibly be otherwise?    Here is just one example. The original version envisioned  sanctions in the event of a violation of the accord's provisions  by one of the sides. In particular, the Conciliation Commission  was to be granted the right to initiate the question of  excluding the corresponding participant from among the  signatories or to move proposals on measures of political  responsibility, including the dismissal of "transgressors" from  leading positions and stripping them of deputy status. Later on  we abandoned such a rigid approach, and this immediately allowed  the range of the agreement's supporters to be broadened.    Nonetheless, even today the document contains several  provisions which are evoking sharp disagreement by a number of  opposition movements. This is primarily the point obligating  all sides to refrain from demands to introduce such amendments  into the Constitution which could destabilize the situation in  society. Or the obligation not to initiate political campaigns  with the aim of holding early elections to federal power bodies.  But here, in my opinion, lies the line which cannot be passed  in the search for compromise. If we renounce these provisions,  the document -- even if signed by all the participants in the  political process without exception -- will be nothing more than  a mere declaration.    Is there a danger that not all opposition parties will sign  the agreement of public accord? To be sure, there is. But I  would not regard this prospect as tragic. There is one  circumstance which, in my view, should compel all sensible  politicians sooner or later to put their signatures under this  document. Possibly, with their remarks and qualifications (it  will be recalled that the agreement is open to accession at any  time). It is hardly likely that the president's most principled  opponents will want to stay aside from the process of  reconciling social interests and elaborating a coordinated  policy. And in this sense the agreement will be just a starting  point. It will set in motion a mechanism that will be in  operation for the next two years: conferences, "roundtables,"  and temporary working groups with representatives of parties to  the agreement.    As for those who will not want to conduct a peaceful  dialogue.... Well, society must know the names of these leaders  and the parties they represent. I think that this will also be  useful: It should not be forgotten that not so much time is  left before the next presidential elections.</p>

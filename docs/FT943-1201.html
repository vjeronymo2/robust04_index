			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (16): New dimensions favoured - Joia Shillingford on enterprise networking and databases As PC users are increasingly linked into enterprise networks, they are starting to become more demanding. They know that information vital to their work sits in other computers on the network. And they ask, not unreasonably, why they cannot get it out in the form they want. The answer is that a lot of this information is probably stored in relational databases. According to David Carew-Jones, international marketing manager of US-based Pilot Software: 'Relational databases are really good at presenting the same type of information in the same form each month. But they aren't so good in areas like sales and marketing where what's needed is a quick response to ad hoc queries requiring complex analysis.' He and many other executive information system (EIS) suppliers believe that multidimensional databases are much better for on-line analytical processing (Olap) by users. This is because relational databases are best for transactions which require access to parts of the database that are closely related. By contrast, detailed marketing analysis may require looking for connections and patterns in parts of the database which are not closely related. In a multidimensional database designed for Olap, data is organised into dimensions. For example, a four-dimensional entry might include a geography dimension (eg sales regions), a price dimension, a time dimension (eg when sold) and a product dimension. Users can interrogate the database quickly using any combination of dimensions. Olap's cause prospered when Ted Codd, the father of the relational database, wrote a paper on the subject (commissioned by US Olap company Arbor). He agreed that multidimensional databases were better for some types of analysis and defined 12 Olap rules to which they should conform. Nevertheless Codd says that Olap databases are 'not a substitute for relational databases and should be used in conjunction with them, or with files from legacy (old) systems.' Olap databases usually take a copy of the information on the company's main database at regular intervals  - every 24 hours, for example  - and re-index it by dimensions. Codd has evaluated two Olap databases which conform to most of his rules. They are Arbor's Essbase, on which Comshare's Commander Olap is based, and TM1 from US-based Sinper. However, he has not evaluated all the Olap products on the market and there are many other products which claim to conform. Other suppliers include Pilot, IRI and Kenan. He says that when selecting an Olap database, users should: Decide how much concurrent working is needed between the analysis activity and the company's main operational database. Make sure that the analysis activity doesn't interfere with the day-to-day running of the operational database. For this reason an Olap product which can operate in a client-server environment, with operational and Olap databases on different server computers may be best. Try out different systems to see which provide the level of performance required both in terms of computer power and in terms of usability. However, Codd warns that once an Olap database is in place, the pressure to make use of it can become intense.</p>

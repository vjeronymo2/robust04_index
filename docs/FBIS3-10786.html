He holds the U.S. Government  responsible for the current situation in the country:    [Begin Jean-Louis recording, in Creole] All the actions  being  taken by my colleagues, including deputies and senators, have  been dictated by the State Department. We know this very well.  The State Department has already forced the parliament,  including deputies, senators, and the president, to take a  number of measures such as -- you recall -- the Washington  agreement. These same men had the president sign it, and got the  parliament involved. Once we arrived here, they gave us no  support for voting on the agreement, which could have ended the  crisis.    Second, they had us go to Governors Island, then in an  underhanded manner, sabotaged the Governors Island Agreement.  Consequently, it could not be implemented. They had us  participate in the New York pact for the normalization of  parliament, then encouraged the 18 January parliamentarians to  create all the disturbances you now see going on. You know what  happened in the Senate on 9 March. [end recording]</p>

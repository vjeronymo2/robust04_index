			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Cadbury has basic 'majority backing' THE MAJORITY of res-pondents to the Cadbury committee report on corporate governance have been 'generally supportive' of the initiative but have detailed reservations about some of its suggestions. Staff serving the committee said yesterday that 64 per cent of those who expressed a view about its recommendations were in that category. Among them were the Confederation of British Industry which, while supporting the report in principle, objected to the enforcement mechanisms suggested by the committee. An analysis of the 70 responses to the report, prepared by committee staff, showed that only 16 per cent of respondents opposed its recommendations, against 20 per cent who were were 'very supportive'. The committee, known informally by the name of its chairman, Sir Adrian Cadbury, issued a draft report in May recommending a code of best practice to be followed by corporate boards of directors. The code, which is voluntary, is intended to improve the performance and financial reporting of companies. Aspects of the report have been criticised by those who will be most affected by them. Some leading industrialists say that the report has gone too far, while some institutional shareholders have objected that it does not go far enough. Staff serving the Cadbury committee said that a significant minority of respondents - 25 out of 70 - expressed no general view about the proposals as a whole, but simply offered comments about aspects of the report.</p>

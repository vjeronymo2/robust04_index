			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Shares in Dreyfus surge after merger talk SHARES in Dreyfus Corporation rose sharply yesterday after an announcement by the New York mutual fund group that it had been in merger talks with an unnamed financial institution sparked speculation that the company would become a bid target in the financial services industry. After rumours of an impending takeover had driven Dreyfus's stock up Dollars 4, or 10 per cent, to Dollars 44 7/8 , the company was forced to issue a statement saying it had been in merger discussions with an unnamed company, but they had been terminated. The announcement depressed the stock price, but they still ended the day up Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 7/8 as investors bet that other companies would soon display an interest in acquiring Dreyfus, which is one of the country's biggest mutual fund companies with Dollars 80bn in assets under management. Industry analysts said yesterday that a banking group had probably been in merger discussions with Dreyfus. The mutual fund industry has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the last few years and banks have been eager to get into the market. Analysts suggested that one of several big banks, including NationsBank, Mellon Bank, Banc One and JP Morgan, would be keen to buy the fund group.</p>

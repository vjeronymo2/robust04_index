			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE HANDYMAN: CRACKS IN CULTURED-MARBLE COUNTER LEAVE FEW OPTIONS FOR  HOMEOWNER  </P> <P> Q: Less than a year ago, I installed a cultured-marble counter and sink in our  second bathroom, and in a very short time, I've noticed small hairline cracks  forming around the drain. Is there any way I can just buff those out?  </P> <P> S.A.,  </P> <P> Lake Forest  </P> <P> A: "That's unusual for a new sink to develop cracks like that," says Larry  Hohenstein of Amco Builders and Plumbing Supply in Costa Mesa. "They usually  form with age. There's really not much you can do at this point because of the  way the sinks are made. Cultured marble is made with a plastic overlay that  gives it color. However, what happens is that during normal use, when you get  toothpaste, cleansers, drain cleaners and all the other things people put in  their sinks onto the surface, it destroys the plastic. When it gets to the  point where you're really embarrassed by it, you'll just have to replace it.  </P> <P> "There is one product, 100% cultured onyx, that can be repaired. It's a little  more expensive than the marble, but when you have cracks, you can attach a  lambs-wool pad to your drill and buff them out."  </P> <P> Q: The plaster surrounding the outside of my shower has formed blisters in  which the plaster has bubbled and inside there's a powdery substance. I would  assume it's caused by moisture. How do I get rid of it?  </P> <P> T.L.,  </P> <P> La Habra  </P> <P> A: "It sounds like it's a gypsum plaster, and what really needs to be used in  that area is a cement plaster or a cement backer board with tile, something  that won't absorb water," says Lee Ferguson of Alpine Plastering in Fullerton.  "Ideally, the plaster in that area should be removed down to the bare studs and  a paper-back lath should be put on, then the cement plaster applied on top of  that."  </P> <P> Q: Isn't there something I can put on my hands and arms while painting that  will keep paint from sticking to my skin?  </P> <P> S.B.,  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P> <P> A: "Try a product called 'Glove Coat' that you rub into your hands before  painting," says Mike Payne of Vista Paint in Orange. "After painting, you just  wash with soap and water, and it should come right off."  </P> <P> Q: In remodeling our bathroom, I'd like to keep the present bathroom tile,  remove the tub enclosure and install a shower curtain. However, the enclosure  is about 9 years old, and I'm afraid that once we get it off, we won't be able  to make the tile on the walls that are underneath match the rest of the tiles.  Any suggestions?  </P> <P> P.Y.,  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> A: "When an enclosure has been there for years, it will tend to discolor the  tile," says John Wintercorn of Martin Shower Door in Chino. "Unfortunately,  there's no magic solution to remove it. After removing an enclosure, we will  scrape it with a putty knife and then a single-blade razor to remove any  caulking, then go over it with scouring powder. I've heard of people using pool  acid to try to get stains off, but that's really too dangerous to work with.  I'd recommend just trying with abrasives and filling in the holes left by the  enclosure with some type of quick-setting sealant."  </P> <P> Q: In rearranging furniture, I found a problem with a lamp I'd like to have sit  on a corner table. In order for it to work, I would have to string the cord 10  feet to the nearest wall socket. Would it be hard to string the cord under the  carpet to the socket?  </P> <P> P.B.,  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P> <P> A: "That's probably the easiest and best solution; the only problem is it's  illegal," says Arlan Strong of Uni-Lite in Anaheim. "The fire codes say you  can't have electrical cords under rugs, mainly because they're stepped on a  great deal and they get worn and you don't notice it until it starts a fire.  The only other way to do it without having the cord show is to install an  outlet on the floor."  </P></p>

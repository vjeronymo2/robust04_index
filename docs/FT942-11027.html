			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Predicting project costs Sir, Andrew Taylor ('Pounds, pioneers and more pounds', May 3) gives some interesting examples of capital cost growth. The Rand Corporation of the US carried out a report for the US department of energy on final cost against first detailed estimate for a variety of large pioneer construction projects. On average it was more than two times higher. Further effort was applied to analysing cost growth and performance shortfall for energy plants in terms of the amount of new technology, complexity, state of process development and the thoroughness of scope of the initial estimate. In the third part of the work, a systematic method was developed to enable application of the technique to future examples, to predict a final cost ratio together with a standard deviation. We used this method for process plants quite successfully in my previous company. The problem, however, always remains that, when asked to make a judgment, people tend to gravitate towards their optimistic notions and the results of these careful calculations are not always well received.

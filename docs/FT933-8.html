			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (38): Old ways die hard in the countryside - Sara Webb explores a village called Pilana THE DOWRY which Mr Ram Pal Tyagi had to provide for his daughter's wedding earlier this year consisted of a moped, a fridge, a television, a double bed, a sofa set, an iron safe, clothing, household utensils, cash, gold and ornaments. Yet Mr Tyagi, who farms sugar cane and wheat in a village 50 km north of New Delhi, describes himself as 'a man of only average means'. Dowry is illegal in India, but it remains a fact of life in many parts of the country, particularly in the rural areas. Furthermore, the shopping list of demands from prospective husbands these days is more likely to include expensive consumer and electrical items in preference to the traditional gifts of bedding and clothing. The villagers of Pilana, where Mr Tyagi lives, are sufficiently close to Delhi and well enough tuned in to the media to be influenced by consumer trends. Nor is this 8,000-strong village in Western Uttar Pradesh unusual in this respect. A survey by the Indian Market Research Bureau of more than 800 Indian villages showed that 77 per cent of them receive television transmissions - an important influence on consumer trends - while 40 per cent of families own a bicycle and 35 per cent have a radio or TV. At least 60 per cent of the villages have shops which sell soap, detergent and batteries. Today, toothpaste from the village shop is replacing the traditional Indian tooth-cleaner - a twig from the neem tree. Pilana has all of these. Its roads and houses are bricked. Electricity runs for as much as eight hours a day and there are telephone connections. More than 100 of the 800 families in the village have a television, and more than 50 families own a tractor. There are water pumps and tap connections to many of the houses. The children go to school in the village, and over half the inhabitants are literate now. In the last five years, Pilana has gained a veterinary clinic and a health centre. 'We are more prosperous than before, thanks to better irrigation, better cultivation, and better employment and transportation in the village as well as outside,' says one elderly Brahmin. The changes have not only been material: increased contact with the outside world has led villagers to question some aspects of traditional village life. Many of the villagers are only too aware of the ridiculous burden placed on them by the dowry system in a modern age. 'People realise it is not a good thing because the amount of the dowry is getting out of proportion and it is difficult to meet the requirement,' says Mrs Sukarma Tyagi, a grandmother with three daughters and two sons. The average family pays between Rs300,000-Rs400,000 (about Pounds 6,250 - Pounds 8,300) in dowry, well in excess of their annual income. The upper caste families in Pilana have land holdings of about 10 acres, earning roughly Rs6,000 per acre. Still, even though Mrs Sukarma Tyagi says there is 'a lot of talk' that the practice of dowry should be stopped, change is unlikely to be rapid. Take the example of representation on the village council. These councils, which are responsible for village development, were usually dominated by men from the higher castes. In the last couple of years, the councils have had to include women and untouchables - the so-called scheduled castes such as the sweepers and leather-workers. In the village of Pilana, there are five women and four scheduled castes on the council of 20. 'Of course there is representation of women on the council but they are not active participants because they are not educated,' says the village head, leaning back on his charpoy to take a drag from a splendid long-necked water pipe. Mrs Manisha Tyagi, one of the female representatives on the council for the last two years, says she has never attended a meeting because she is too shy and frightened of offending the other members. She comes from a neighbouring village and, like all women who marry into Pilana society, she must keep her face veiled in public. 'I don't like having to cover my face in front of the men at the meetings. Also, everyone in the village is related and I'm scared I might say something that offends my relatives or makes life difficult for my family'. The scheduled castes also have their council representatives, but they complain that they do not have much influence because upper caste brahmins have a majority on the council and so can overrule the untouchables. Yet despite these gripes, many village members admit that relations among the various castes are relatively harmonious, although the caste distinctions are clearly upheld, with different castes having their own residential areas. 'There's definitely more mixing between the castes,' claims Mr Srinikias Dixit, a elderly Brahmin in the village. However, there are limits to the degree of mixing. Untouchables were not allowed to use the village well, although their situation improved when hand pumps were installed in their own area. And even now the untouchables are not allowed to worship in the same temple as the upper castes, with the result that they are collecting money in order to build their own temple. Marriage between members of different castes is unthinkable to the villagers. Indian newspapers titillate their readers with a diet of horror stories about unfortunate couples who disobey the strict caste rules. The penalty is often death: in one recent case, the husband and wife were beheaded by their relatives. One of the shoe-makers in Pilana, who belongs to a scheduled caste, says that '95 per cent of the things associated with untouchability have gone. Now we put more emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene, and education has contributed to this. Upper caste people find us more acceptable than 20 years ago.' And although he feels that he would probably never be able to earn his living except as a shoe-maker because of his caste, 'at least I hope my children might be able to do something else for a living, thanks to education.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by economist Andrey Illarionov from "Ekspertiza" </F> section: "Budget As Mirror of Government's Real Intentions"]    [Text] The budget submitted by the Russian Government to  the State Duma concentrates its main passions, political  intentions, and targeted priorities:    -- a costly state;    -- the bureaucracy's financial revenge;    -- discrimination in education, science, culture, art, the  legal system, and all civil society;    -- open allegiance to power structures;    -- a return to the practice of monstrously inefficient state  expenditure;    -- payment of for the political support of agrarian and  other  lobbies;    -- deceiving its own country and the world community.    In any country the presentation of the state budget to  parliament is a very important political event. No other  documents -- programs, statements, and promises -- can reveal  either the alleged or real intentions of the government as can  the budget.    The draft federal budget for 1994 with its recent April  corrections submitted by the Russian Government to the State  Duma clearly shows what the features of the new stage of  "continuation of the reforms" are and what the aims of the  present government team are. This is all the more interesting  because "in this document," as V. Chernomyrdin has frequently  stressed, "we have tried for the first time in many years to  tell the truth and only the truth."    What is the truth about the state budget?    Let us compare the three draft budgets for 1994. The first  was prepared in February to a considerable extent under the  influence of B. Fedorov, who at the time had only just left the  government. The second was derived from the first as a result of  numerous discussions and amendments in the direction of "greater  feasibility" and "greater inflation security" and was submitted  as an official draft to the Duma in March. Finally on 26 April  -- immediately after the session of the IMF directorate which  officially granted Russia the second part of the systemic credit  -- the government sent the Duma the new draft budget with an  increased deficit. The differences between these three drafts  come down to a change in the relationships between the various  items.    Sociocultural measures were subjected to the biggest change.  Whereas in 1992, not the best year, 10.3 percent of all state  expenditure was channeled into these purposes, in 1993 the  figure was 7.8 percent and according to the March draft of the  budget it was 6.8 percent and according to the April draft 6.4  percent.    Expenditure on national education shows the same tendency --  5.8, 3.9, 3.9, and 3.4 percent respectively.    Financing for fundamental scientific research was in no  better a position. The government leadership's repeated  statements and promises to support science acquired concrete  expression in a reduction in science's share in all state  expenditure, from 2.6 percent in 1992 to 2.2 percent in the 1994  draft.    The programs and spheres also subjected to reduction  included  the conversion of the defense industry, the conservation of the  environment, the legal system, reserves, and the supplementing  of state stocks, the implementation of international arms  limitation treaties, and the extinguishing and servicing of the  foreign debt.    Against the background of the mass reductions the budget  items for which expenditure is growing both relatively and in  absolute terms deserve special attention. Thus, for instance,  according to the February version of the budget it was planned  to spend 0.5 percent of all state expenditure on pure subsidies  for agriculture, while in the March version the figure was 2.2  percent and in the April version 2.6 percent. In all in  February it was planned to spend 1.3 percent of all state  expenditure on agriculture, in March the figure was 2.8 percent,  and in April 7.4 percent. And this is obviously not a limit  since agricultural workers are still dissatisfied and the  government, in its 23 February decree, promised them nearly 12  percent of all expenditure.    Expenditure on agriculture for various items is increased in  varying degrees. Whereas expenditure on maintaining  agricultural production is increasing by a factor of 25 as a  whole, expenditure on the development of private farming is only  increasing by a factor of 11 while expenditure on the  acquisition of imported output for agriculture increased by a  factor of 96! Now it is becoming clear who is getting the funds  saved at the expense of our teachers, doctors, scientists, and  cultural and art workers.    Graphic evidence of the government's resolute return to the  "trench digging" practice of the pre-reform years was the  increase in expenditure on one of the most ineffective and  corrupt avenues for the use of state funds -- centralized  investments. Their proportion in the GDP is to increase from  1.7 percent in 1993 to 4.8 percent in 1994.    Expenditure is also increasing on defense (4.7 percent of  the  GDP in 1992, 4.4 percent in 1993, and 5.1 percent in 1994); on  law enforcement activity and the security organs (1.3, 1.5, and  1.7 percent of the GDP respectively); and on mobilization  training (0.02 percent of the GDP in 1993 and 0.05 percent in  1994).    Generally speaking even the present 20 percent of overall  state expenditure which goes on defense is the level of the  prewar years of 1913 and 1940 and also of the time of the most  acute confrontation between the USSR and the United States  during the Cold War. Are we planning to go to war again?    Another record-beater in terms of the pace at which  expenditure has increased was the "state management" item,  particularly that part relating to the central apparatus of  ministries and departments. With an average growth rate of 470  percent for all budget expenses, expenditure on the maintenance  of this part of the state machine is increasing by a factor of  17.3 and its share in the GDP is quadrupled -- from 0.05 percent  to 2 percent.    Since Government apparatus leader V. Kasov asserts that the  numerical strength of the number of those employed in the  federal organs of power has remained constant for several years  now -- about 35,000 people -- and premier V. Chernomyrdin even  speaks of reducing the size of the organs of state management  and the numerical strength of the apparatus workers, this  increase in expenditure means that each one remaining will have  a considerably more substantial share of the national pie. As a  result average expenditure "per federal apparatus capita" will  increase from 200,000 rubles [R] a month in 1993, which was 3.4  times more than the average wage for the national economy  (R59,000) to about R3.5 million a month, which is over 12 times  the average Russian monthly salary in 1994 (R280,000 according  to the Ministry of the Economy forecast). So that the Russian  bureaucrat will seemingly not disappear..    In addition it is planned to increase the proportion of  funds  channeled to help other levels of power from 2 percent to 3.4  percent of the GDP. The central government thus receives an  additional financial lever for exerting influence, including  political influence, on the situation in the regions.    Since the main aim of the March and April amendments to the  budget, as the premier stated, was to reduce its inflationary  potential, we should look at what kind of a change there has  been to that part of its deficit which is covered by Central  Bank credits and thus generates inflation. The February draft  provided for a loan of R35 trillion (4.8 percent of the GDP) for  the purpose, the March draft proposed R38 trillion (5.2 percent  of the GDP), and the April budget R44.4 trillion (6.1 percent).  Consequently the inflation threat is not decreasing but  increasing. At the same time this is the best illustration of  the way the government leadership's loyalty to the word it gave  at the talks with the IMF that in any case Central Bank credits  would not exceed 5 percent of the GDP.    Moreover, the Russian tradition of executing the budget is  known for the fact that the amendments regularly made to it  reduce its revenue and increase expenditure and consequently the  deficit. That this tradition is not forgotten is borne out by  recent government decisions. The story of the scandalous  reduction of excise for vodka and spirits had not been  forgotten, less than two weeks had elapsed since the budget was  submitted to parliament, yet the government had already decreed  that the Izhevsk production association of machine building  enterprises be exempted from excise on motor vehicles and that  expenditure on the coal sector be increased. A few more weeks  elapsed and there was a new increase in expenditure. This time  90 percent of their increase is intended for the agrarian lobby.  Obviously this is not the final amendment.    Now we can understand the government's real intentions. The  approval of the budget by the State Duma as a law will mean the  deputies' public solidarity with that system of views.</p>

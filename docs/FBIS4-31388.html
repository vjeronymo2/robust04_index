			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Knin, June 8 (TANJUG) -- President of the republic  of Serb Krajina (RSK) Milan Martic has agreed that the first  round of talks on economic issues with the Croatian side be held  on June 16-17 in Plitvice in RSK territory, the office of the  RSK president said in a statement on Wednesday. Martic made the  decision after receiving additional international guarantees  that all issues relating to the Croatia-Krajina conflict would  in future be resolved through talks on an equal footing and that  the international community would not tolerate Croatia's policy  of force, the RSK news agency ISKRA reports.    Moreover, says ISKRA, Martic also received firm guarantees  that a political settlement would not be prejudged in any stage  of the talks and that it should be sought within the  Geneva-based international conference on the former Yugoslavia.  Martic's office also said that the RSK president had decided to  agree to the talks after consultations with co-chairmen of the  international conference Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg and  U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi.    The RSK was founded in late 1991 in the Serb ancestral lands  in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from the  former Yugoslav federation and attempts to downgrade the Serbs  to a national minority. In March 1992, the RSK was placed under  U.N. protection.    Martic's talks with the international mediators in Geneva  also tackled the implementation of the RSK-Croatia truce signed  in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb last spring. The RSK president  said that Croatia had not fully honoured the agreement and  warned that this could seriuosly impede the peace process.    Akashi personally guaranteed that he would insist with the  Croatian side to immediately meet the obligations it undertook  under the truce agreement.</p>

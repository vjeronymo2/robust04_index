			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAILOUT AGENCY RIPE FOR FRAUD, CONGRESS TOLD;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE RESOLUTION TRUST CORP. IS TOO DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE LAWYERS AND  CONSULTANTS, THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE WARNS. A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN  STAFF IS URGED.  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office warned on Monday that the Resolution Trust Corp.,  the federal agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout, is understaffed and  too heavily dependent on lawyers and consultants, making it vulnerable to fraud  and abuse.  </P> <P> In testimony at a Senate hearing, Comptroller General Charles Bowsher charged  that more than a year after the establishment of the RTC, the agency's skeleton  staff relies too much on outside contractors -- mainly private lawyers,  accountants and appraisers -- to manage the $30 billion to $40 billion in  assets that Washington has taken over from failed S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> In an interview after his appearance, Bowsher said he believes that the Bush  Administration should expand the RTC's staff substantially to avoid repeating  the mistakes that were made in late 1988, when the government rapidly sold off  a wide array of troubled S&amp;Ls without first accounting fully for their  assets.  </P> <P> Because there is so little government oversight of those consultants, the RTC  could easily become the victim of a new round of S&amp;L abuse, including  inflated fees and other conflict-of-interest problems involving attorneys and  accountants who are hired to handle legal and financial work at failed thrifts,  Bowsher warned.  </P> <P> He also charged that the RTC still has not accounted fully for the assets it  holds.  </P> <P> The testimony came as, separately, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision  reported that losses in the S&amp;L industry moderated in the second quarter of  1990, suggesting some relief for what is left of the financially troubled  industry.  </P> <P> Private-sector S&amp;Ls -- those that have not been taken over by the  government -- posted a combined loss of $196 million for the three-month  period, down from $374 million in the first quarter and $3.4 billion in the  fourth quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> In his testimony before a governmental affairs subcommittee, Bowsher warned  that unless the RTC's staff is beefed up with additional specialists, the  agency's massive disposal of S&amp;L assets could turn into another debacle for  the government, much like the recent Housing and Urban Development scandals.  </P> <P> "We lost a lot of money at HUD because we didn't have enough talent in  government for the proper oversight of outside contractors," he said. "And when  I saw the billions of dollars going into this program and so much of it going  to private contractors, I was concerned."  </P> <P> The RTC currently has 3,200 employees, and the Bush Administration plans to  increase that staffing to a peak of 6,200, Bowsher said -- a level that he  insisted is meager by historical standards in Washington.  </P> <P> By contrast, Bowsher noted, the Reconstruction Finance Corp., set up by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the New Deal to help industries whose  companies had failed during the Depression, had as many as 12,000 staff members  at its peak.  </P> <P> "The RTC doesn't have enough staff in place," Bowsher added. "They have to have  some management systems in place. . . . They have to have people who know what  the assets of these S&amp;Ls are . . . or this is going to be a very bad  situation."  </P> <P> Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chairman of the subcommittee, charged that the RTC  is already too lax in its supervision of outside consultants.  </P> <P> Pryor said lawyers are already profiteering at the RTC's expense, charging $300  per hour in some cases. And he warned that inflated fees charged by consultants  and private contractors could seriously reduce the amount of money the  government will be able to take out of the S&amp;Ls that it sells to the  public.  </P> <P> In response to Pryor's charges, Lamar Kelly, director of the RTC's asset  management division, acknowledged that the agency has no way of knowing whether  any conflicts of interest exist among the thousands of lawyers and other  professionals hired to oversee the failed thrifts.  </P> <P> He said that the RTC now has 120,000 legal cases pending and that it has been  forced to hire thousands of lawyers around the nation without cross-checking on  their backgrounds to determine whether they have previously been involved in  questionable S&amp;L transactions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED TO PAY FINE FOR AIR POLLUTION;  </P> <P> EMISSIONS: THE $1-MILLION PENALTY IS THE LARGEST IN THE AQMD'S HISTORY. IT  SETTLES 6,750 ALLEGED VIOLATIONS.  </P> <P> Lockheed Corp. agreed Thursday to pay a record $1-million fine to settle  allegations by air quality officials that Lockheed's paint-spraying activities  at its Los Angeles area plants violated anti-smog rules.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District said it was the biggest penalty  in the 10-year history of the El Monte-based agency. The fine came seven months  after Lockheed paid a record $1.5-million penalty to the U.S. Occupational  Safety and Health Administration to settle 440 alleged violations of workplace  safety rules at its local plants.  </P> <P> The AQMD cited Lockheed, a Calabasas-based aerospace and defense systems  concern, for about 6,750 alleged violations after a seven-month inspection of  its facilities last year, said Peter C. Mieras, an AQMD deputy prosecutor.  About 6,000 of the violations concerned Lockheed's inadequate record-keeping  procedures, he said.  </P> <P> Record keeping is important, Mieras said, because Lockheed operates under rules  that allow the company to use some coatings and solvents the hydrocarbon  emissions of which exceed normal AQMD limits. Lacking correct records, the  agency can't monitor whether Lockheed is operating legally, he said.  </P> <P> The remaining 750 alleged violations occurred when paint spraying by Lockheed  workers emitted more hydrocarbons than Lockheed's records showed, Mieras said.  </P> <P> When released into the air, the hydrocarbons in paints and solvents mix with  nitrogen and sunlight to cause ozone -- the major component of smog. In recent  years, the AQMD has clamped down on the Los Angeles furniture industry because  its heavy use of coatings and solvents is a major contributor to smog.  </P> <P> "Fumes from paints are not an insignificant source of pollution for us," said  AQMD spokesman Tom Eichhorn. He said fumes from evaporating paints and solvents  emit 11 times as much reactive hydrocarbons as all the oil refineries in the  basin.  </P> <P> Besides paying the penalty, Lockheed agreed to adopt better record-keeping  procedures and to acquire state-of-the-art painting equipment that would meet  AQMD standards on paint-related emissions.  </P> <P> "Lockheed has assured the district that it wants to protect the environment and  is committed to complying with district rules," Dale Daniels, Lockheed  executive vice president, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Lockheed said the AQMD and OSHA citations were not related. But the findings of  both agencies focused on plants in Burbank, Palmdale and Rye Canyon near  Valencia that are operated by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., the company's  aerospace unit. Some of Lockheed's work at those facilities involves classified  projects for the Pentagon, including production of a top-secret stealth fighter  jet that is supposed to evade enemy radar.  </P> <P> The AQMD typically inspects industrial companies once a year for possible  violations of anti-smog rules. But the AQMD was unable to enter Lockheed's  classified areas until a year ago because its inspectors had not yet received  security clearances, Mieras said.  </P> <P> The Lockheed penalty eclipsed the previous record AQMD fine of $335,000 levied  last October against Gary Lazar, the owner of 160 gasoline stations where  gasoline pump nozzles failed to keep gasoline fumes from escaping into the air.  </P></p>

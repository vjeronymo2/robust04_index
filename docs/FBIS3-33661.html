Now 53, the man with silver hair and a pepper-and-salt  moustache emerged from three years in the wilderness last year  to succeed Major-General Khaled Nezzar as defence minister.    Nezzar was widely considered the strongman of the five-man  presidential college that has ruled since president Chadli  Bendjedid resigned on January 11, 1992, shortly before the  cancellation of the second round of a general election that the  fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was set to win.    Zeroual has kept his forays into the public debate on the  country's political future to a minimum.    But in two memorable statements on October 24 and January  16,  he warned that while the army remained neutral, it would not  stand by passively in the face of dangerous developments that  were threatening the fate of the nation.    His unscheduled televised broadcast on January 16, a vain  attempt to galvanise the key political players into attending  this week's abortive national conference, had the stamp of a  presidential hopeful.    It had been hoped the conference could choose a new  president, but in the absence of comprehensive participation,  the task fell to the HCS.    In that televised speech, Zeroual called in firm and solemn  tones for a "new national political system to enshrine true  democracy, to guarantee all individual and collective freedoms  and to put an end to political, economic, cultural and  ideological monopolies."    He also called for a "complete break from the old style and  methods of management."    Zeroual's army colleagues portray him as reserved and a man  of principle. He resigned as commander of land forces and  deputy chief-of-staff and quit the army in 1989 after clashing  with Bendjedid about his plans for a military shake-up.    He was then named ambassador to Romania, but resigned after  less than a year to get away from politics and spend time in his  hometown.    After the assassination of caretaker president Mohammed  Boudiaf on July 29, 1992, there were persistent rumours that he  would be appointed interior minister or a kind of  secretary-general of the five-man presidency.    But he got neither job, and it was much to the surprise of  most people that he was appointed defence minister on July 3  last year.    His appointment was seen as the army's way of inciting the  politicians to reform the management of the civil service.    Zeroual, who advocates a professional army, has in his long  career as a serving officer commanded the Tamanrasset military  region in the extreme south of Algeria in 1982, Bechar on the  Moroccan border in 1984 and Constantine in eastern Algeria in  1987.    He has also commanded two of the army's training schools,  including the Cherchel Academy, the nursery for the officer  elite.</p>

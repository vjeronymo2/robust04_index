			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Resentment surfaces in Russia's Arctic sea of oil sludge: John Thornhill finds people are beginning to raise their voices in a region used to suffering pollution in silence The remote Russian Arctic town of Usinsk is blinking in bewilderment in the glare of international publicity. US claims that a recent oil spill nearby was several times larger than the world's previous worst disaster in Alaska in 1989 have provoked outrage from the local authorities, hostility from the local oil company, and a mood of bemusement among the local population. Some residents just do not understand the fuss, given that similar spills have happened before without stirring much controversy. Mr Philip Gursky, a ruddy-faced pensioner, who lives in a rough-hewn wooden cottage by the Kolva river, says he has seen many oil leaks, blow-outs and burning slicks in the 40 years he has lived in the region. He shrugs his shoulders at the latest incident after which scores of workers removed oil from the river outside his front door. 'I am used to it,' he says. Sadly, Russia is accustomed to such accidents, although it remains unaccustomed to the controversy they now arouse. A local environmental group claims that internal documents obtained from Komineft, the oil company responsible for the faulty pipeline, reveal there were more than 1,900 leaks between 1986 and 1991, with an alarming acceleration towards the end of that period. Environmentalists estimate Russia may lose 1-3 per cent of its oil output each year through leaks in its 45,000 miles of pipelines. In an industrial culture that stresses production over the environment, managers prefer to pump oil rather than repair damaged infrastructure and shut and re-start wells. Mr Vyacheslav Bibikov, vice-president of Komi Republic - reputedly one of Russia's more reactionary regions, gives the official response. 'The situation is localised and controlled and we consider that excessive attention has been given to this accident. Nothing terrible has happened here,' he says. Mr Nikolai Ponomaryev, deputy general director of Komineft, reacted even more fiercely when questioned by western journalists and environmental campaigners. In a flash-back to Soviet-style attitudes, the glowering Mr Ponomaryev refused to discuss the company's pipeline capacity on the grounds of 'commercial secrecy' and suggested foreigners who had failed to win business in the area were exaggerating the affair. Perhaps no-one will ever know how much oil has been spilled near Usinsk. Local government officials and Komineft directors ridicule US Energy Department claims that 270,000 tonnes of oil has leaked. But even accepting the minimum official figure of 14,000 tonnes - which western oilmen in the region find hard to believe - the spillage still represents an appalling environmental blight. Mr Anatoly Nyukin, head of Komi Republic's civil defence, says he has not seen one dead bird or fish as a result of the accident. But local residents point out that pollution killed much of the local wildlife long ago. Mrs Chesleva Popova, mayor of the 170-year old Kolva village, says: 'There was a very big resource of fish here 10 years ago. But now there are practically no fish left.' She says those fish they do catch are used to make a traditional local dish. 'But often the fish smell strongly of oil and it is not pleasant to eat,' she says. More than 200 people have been working intensively to clear up the damage. Using vacuum pumps and bulldozers, they have cleaned up most of the black sludge that oozed into the Kolva and Usa rivers, where 7km-9km of river bank were heavily polluted. But removing the estimated 11,000 tonnes of oil which remain in the flooded marshlands will be slow and laborious. So far the clean-up has been eased by the relatively mild weather. But temperatures can drop to minus 50 degrees in winter and the oil must be removed before the spring thaws threaten to spread a fresh ecological disaster. The 60,000 who live in and around Usinsk are hardly strangers to such hardships. The grim and grimy town, which clings to the edge of the Arctic circle, was built in a region infamous as one of the most terrible islands in Stalin's Gulag archipelago. Many 'criminals' from the nearby Vorkuta camp settled in the area after their release. There is an acceptance of hardship and a reluctance to moan found rarely in Russia's bigger cities. Usinsk itself was built 20 years ago by Komineft to support oil exploration. Like most Soviet industrial enterprises, the company created its own mini-welfare state, building eight schools, a kindergarten and a hospital. Some residents fear Komineft will run these down now it is a privatised company with profits in mind. Unemployment is already rising alarmingly as the company sheds workers. The arrival of western companies is beginning to change the town. Conoco, the US oil group, has set up the Polar Lights joint venture with Archangelskgeologia, a Russian exploration company, bringing much-needed jobs to the region. Komi Arctic Oil, a joint venture between Komineft, Gulf Canada, and British Gas has also developed a field north of Usinsk and set up smart offices in town. That seepage of capitalism is already visibly transforming Usinsk. Snickers chocolate bars are on sale in street kiosks; posters of scantily clad women straddling motor-bikes are displayed in the small shopping centre; BMW cars cruise the streets disgorging the local hard men clad in leather jackets, gold chains and shell suits. The after-effects of the spillage may speed further social change. Komineft's managers, alarmed at the publicity and fast-falling share price, must appreciate they are now accountable to a far broader constituency than party bosses or central planners. Local government officials know they now live in a transparent world and have responsibilities for a precious environment which Green groups claim is of international significance. And the townspeople of Usinsk are slowly understanding that as shareholders in the privatised Komineft they are also part-owners who can influence the company's and region's development. There are tentative signs that after years of silence local people are beginning to raise their voice. 'I do not want to say that people were afraid by what has happened but they think about the future and want to make sure this is not repeated,' says Mrs Popova. One shop assistant raises a common plea: 'Usinsk is my town. It is my home. I do not want anyone to spoil it any more.'</p>

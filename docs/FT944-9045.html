			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Lloyd's may face fresh Pounds 1bn claim The latest group of Lloyd's of London members to launch legal proceedings in an attempt to win compensation for losses yesterday said their total claims could exceed Pounds 1bn. The Sturge Names Action Group, which represents more than 3,000 Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market - said it hoped to raise about Pounds 5m from members for its fighting fund and to begin issuing writs in January. Syndicates run by Sturge managing agents were among the worst-affected by Lloyd's recent problems, including heavy US asbestosis and pollution claims. But the action group acknowledged that the pool of funds available to meet damages won by any Lloyd's Name was limited and could be exhausted by cases further ahead in the legislative queue. It is likely to be more than 18 months before any Sturge case reaches court. Mr John Rew, action group chairman, hinted that the group was hoping for a fresh attempt by Lloyd's at an out-of-court deal. Many Names believe that if another attempt is made at a settlement those pursuing legal action would fare better that those who are not. The action group said total losses on the relevant Sturge syndicates in 1990 and 1991, the latest years to be reported, had reached Pounds 747m but might exceed Pounds 1bn. The action group is focusing initially on claiming damages for losses incurred by syndicate 210, run by one of the Sturge managing agencies, which are subsidiaries of Sturge Holdings. Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Sturge Holdings, is a former chairman of Lloyd's. The action group's case is that a reinsurance policy taken out by the syndicate in the 1970s to provide protection against 'long-tail' liabilities  -those which can take many years to produce claims - should not have been commuted in 1991. The action group says that removing the reinsurance cover resulted in Names losing at least Pounds 100m. The group said it planned legal action against Sturge managing agencies, agencies which placed members on Sturge syndicates, and Neville Russell, Sturge's auditors.</p>

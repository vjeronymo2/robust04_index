			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING UMBRAGE WITH 'GOOD MANNERS'  </P> <P> I would like to compliment staff writer Nikki Finke on her witty article  regarding good manners in the '90s.  </P> <P> I have a suggestion I believe covers the field most succinctly, and it has to  do with -- of all things -- golf.  </P> <P> As presently codified, the rules and etiquette of golf are far more complicated  than any book on manners ever written; however, I would refer you to the  ancient rules of golf.  </P> <P> Play the course as you find it. Play the ball as it lies. Do what's fair.  </P> <P> It seems to me that those rules cover most any social situation I have come  across in a long life.  </P> <P> DON PORTER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Illegal rice transactions in  the six months to the end of March nearly tripled compared with  a year earlier due to the worst postwar rice harvest last year,  a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE showed Wednesday [4 May].  According to the survey, conducted through Food Agency offices  in 47 prefectures in April, the Food Agency reported 430 cases  of illegal rice dealings from October to March, a 2.7-fold  increase over the year before.    Of the total, administrative action was taken against nearly  50 cases.    In Japan, rice is kept under government control and is  distributed only through licensed wholesalers and retailers.    In one case, the Food Agency sought legal action against a  rice dealer in Toyama Prefecture for selling rice through  unauthorized sales channels, a violation of the Food Control Law.    The survey showed that at least two agricultural  cooperatives, one in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, and the other in  Shizuoka Prefecture, were found to have sold rice outside  government-controlled channels.    In some 40 cases, the agency issued administrative notices  ordering dealers to abide by the law.    The survey showed that 14 of 50 retailers and supermarkets  across the nation were found to have ignored the agency's  instructions to sell bags of mixed domestic and imported rice.  Thai rice was found to be unpopular among Japanese consumers,  and wholesalers were forced to buy back unsold Thai rice from  retailers at a discount rate, the survey showed.</p>

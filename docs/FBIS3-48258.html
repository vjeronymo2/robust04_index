The commercial services price  index (CSPI), which captures price movements for all types of  services transacted between businesses, is the third price  index, the first two being the wholesale price index (WPI) and  the consumer price index (CPI).    2. Changes in the CSPI chiefly reflect changes in  supply costs, such as real estate prices, personnel costs, and  the strength or weakness of service demands by business.    3. If we compare the CSPI to the domestic WPI  (commodity prices), we find that in addition to the difficulties  in making judgments directly overseas, the service industry is  easily subject to upward pressures in personnel costs because  the service industry overall is labor intensive. If labor  productivity in the service industry can be increased by  abolishing some firmly established fees through deregulation,  the CSPI will move a bit more flexibly.]  <H5>  Recent Stable Movement for the Third Price Index </H5>   The commercial services price index (CSPI), created by the  Bank of Japan (BOJ) and announced in January 1991, tracks price  statistics which show price trends for each type of service  transacted between businesses. For a long time this remained a  void in price statistics despite a shift toward services in  Japan's economic structure.    Heretofore in Japan the wholesale price index (WPI), which  tracks price movements of commodities (things) transacted  between businesses, and the consumer price index (CPI), which  tracks the prices of goods and services purchased by households,  have been employed as the representative price statistics. The  CSPI, with the other two indexes, measures currency purchasing  power and business trends and is a third set of price  statistics, which carries with it a deflator function.    The current CSPI, which uses the 1985 inter-industry  relations tables as its baseline, divides 714 products into the  seven categories of "finance and insurance," "real estate,"  "transportation," "information services," "communications,"  "advertising," and "other services." The identified prices as a  rule are contracted prices between businesses. About 2,400  prices are currently collected in cooperation with 369 companies.    In calculating the index, the weighted average (Laspeyres  formula), which is determined by a fixed weight given to an  article taking as the basis from the inter-industry relations  table the amount of intermediate trading, is calculated and then  indexed with the base year (1985) equal to 100. Although  previously this was released on a four-and-a-half period basis,  beginning this July the index is released monthly.    If we look at the changes in the CSPI since 1985, we find  that it generally moved laterally until about the middle of 1988  and then climbed upward considerably into 1991, while its  movement since has settled down (figure 2).    CSPI movements become clearer if we compare them to the same  month the preceding year (because there are large seasonal  increases in April and October when service contracts are  modified, it is useful to look at movements in the CSPI in  comparison to the same month for the preceding year as a basis  for making judgments).    According to this, after being negative for the most part in  1986, it shifted to the plus side and remained for a time within  a stable range of a just less than 1 percent. However, since the  fall of 1988, allowing for a temporary period of expansion in  its growth rate brought on by the introduction of the  consumption tax, until the end of fiscal 1990, it accelerated  upwards almost in a straight line (its peak was February 1990 at  5.7 percent; however, ignoring the consumption tax, the  substantive peak was December 1990 at 4.1 percent). Following  this, the rate of increase turned sluggish beginning in 1991 and  from this April we have seen a growth rate of barely 1 percent  (figure 3).     &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     It is appropriate as with other prices that commercial  service price movements be based on the relationship between  supply and demand which in this case encompasses target  services, but we do need to keep in mind the following points.  <H3>  Trends in Commercial Demand and Their Reflection in Supply  Costs </H3>   First, regarding movement on the demand side, commercial  service demands change reflecting trends in business earnings,  economic transactions, the distribution situation, or investment  trends in construction and equipment. Basically, commercial  service prices follow these occasional trends in business  conditions as a result.    Second are cost factors on the service supply side. Various  cost factors for service providers, such as shifts in operating  expenses for materials, fuel costs, and necessary real estate  prices, etc., have an effect on CSPI as do increases in  personnel costs and shifts in labor costs brought on by  improvements in labor productivity from investments in  automation. Among these, because the input weight for labor as a  service category is currently high, changes in personnel costs  have a powerful influence on commercial service costs (above all  in civil engineering and construction, legal, and accounting  service costs for "other services," software development under  "information services," and passenger travel and freight  shipments under "transportation").    Third, exogenous factors such as movements in interest rates  and currency exchange prices, competitive promotion and  deregulation mechanisms, and technological improvements have an  impact on service prices in related fields. For example, both  long-term interest rates for various leases under "other  services" and maritime and international air freight for which  numerous contracts are negotiated in foreign currencies under  "transportation" have a tendency to manifest movement which  reflects trends in exchange rates.    Moreover, although prices in airline passenger transport  under the categories of "communications," "finance and  insurance," and "transportation" have on the whole been trending  downward since the index was started, this appears to be the  effect primarily of lower fees and commissions brought on by  deregulation and the promotion of competition through  competitive rate drops and financial deregulation involving new  entries into the electric power transmission business.    By the same token, the upward trend in the CSPI from 1988  through 1990 reflects rising wage costs brought on by a tight  labor supply and expanded commercial service demands together  with increased construction activity and livelier corporate  earnings, trading, and distribution.    Added to this was a further sharp increase in "real estate"  service prices. Upward pressure on prices for "real estate"  service costs such as office, store, and parking rentals can  easily occur in any event given the supply side constraints at  work in real estate. It is fresh in our memories how the rapid  increase in demand for office and store space pushed up "real  estate" service prices as land prices in the center of major  cities skyrocketed during the so-called bubble economy.    By contrast, we can explain the recent sluggish rate of  growth during this business recession in terms of a lowering of  the upward pressure on wages caused by a combination of a  softening in the demand for labor, decreased corporate demand  for services, and a softening in the demand for real estate.    When we compare the movements in the CSPI, which is in phase  with service prices among businesses, with those of the domestic  WPI, which is the cost of things, there is a similar pattern on  this point which reflects the fabric of supply and demand among  businesses and which follows trends in business conditions.  However, at the same time, the CSPI throughout has risen at a  pace exceeding the domestic WPI and has reached a higher level  with relatively less flexibility.  <H5>  The Path To Reduced Differences With Commodity Prices </H5>   Regarding this, first, the drop in import prices in recent  years, reflecting stable international crude oil prices and the  high yen exchange rate, has created an environment contributing  enormously to the stability of the domestic WPI (direct  judgments are difficult to make regarding the CSPI in terms of  overseas factors, given the unique nature of service activities).    This and existing practices and regulations (licenses and  notices), which directly relate to the setting of fees, and  commercial services have influenced not a few fields, which  impedes flexible price movements.    Further, there are differences between the CSPI and the  domestic WPI in the impact of upward pressure in personnel  costs. Excluding some fields such as finance and insurance,  labor productivity in the service category is lower than for the  manufacturing industry. There is a high weight assigned to  labor costs in the input matrix (from preliminary calculations  based on an extension of the inter-industry relations tables for  1988, personnel costs nearly doubled to 35.0 percent for the  CSPI subject services average as opposed to 18.7 percent for the  domestic WPI).    This is one factor behind the sharper increase in the CSPI  than in the domestic WPI during periods of tight labor supply  and for its never falling smoothly when demand for services  weakened. On the other hand, should productivity increase in the  future in the service industry and shrink relative to the  manufacturing industry, the potential is there for the gap  between the CSPI, which represents service costs, and the  domestic WPI, which represents commodity prices, to shrink for  the same business phases.    Currently, expectations in numerous fields have burgeoned  for  deregulation as one pillar of our economic strategy. If we look  at commercial services, we see that should relaxing or  abolishing all regulations and ingrained practices move forward,  prices will advance a step toward flexible responses to supply  and demand relationships through the deregulation of established  fees. Further, we can expect that productivity will be pushed  upwards through the promotion of new entries and investments,  making it easier to lower prices in the mid-term.    This will bring about a rise in the level of qualitative  consumption through lower prices for the consumer and the  elimination of foreign and domestic price differences and will  contribute to an increase in the economic well being of the  Japanese people.</p>

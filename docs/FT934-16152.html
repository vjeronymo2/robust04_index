			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE carrot of an early interest rate cut persisted in coaxing derivatives investors to the market and pushed the FT-SE future higher, Christine Buckley writes. While some doubts continued whether rate cut hopes would become reality, it was difficult for traders to swim against an optimistic tide and buying of the December contract on the FT-SE 100 was almost frenzied early in the session, according to one trader. Continuing the pattern of recent days, US buyers figured large as purchasers along with local traders. December opened at 3,128 and quickly climbed to its day's high of 3,148. But as the cash market reached an all-time high a sense of perspective began to curb derivative excitement and the contract began to fall back. Just before lunch it dipped down to 3,122. Volume notched ahead of recent levels and broke the 10,000 mark to close at 10,706 contracts traded. At the official end of trading December stood at 3,131 - a premium of just over 30 points to cash and just over 9 points in front of its fair value premium to cash. A quieter day was seen in traded options after the previous day's high volume. The number of lots traded fell back over 14,000 to 32,420. Of the stock options Hanson was the most heavily traded at 2,877 lots with Amstrad in second place at 1,992 lots.</p>

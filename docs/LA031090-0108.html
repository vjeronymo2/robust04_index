			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH CELEBRATES TRIUMPHS  </P> <P> Molly Murphy MacGregor thought being a woman was something to be proud of,  something to be celebrated. That's why in 1978 she helped launch a one-day  event in Sonoma County to honor women and their achievements.  </P> <P> Three years after that, National Women's History Week was started as support  for the idea of celebrating women and their contributions to American life  grew. In 1987, National Women's History Month was born with a Congressional  proclamation.  </P> <P> March is National Women's History Month. Southland events scheduled to mark the  monthlong celebration include art exhibits, theatrical presentations, special  award programs and seminars on topics that reflect this year's theme --  "Courageous Voices Echoing in Our Lives."  </P> <P> The theme "really speaks to the spirit of and the action of the women who have  proceeded us," MacGregor says. Women, she says, need "to realize that they are  part of that continuity."  </P> <P> MacGregor heads up the National Women's History Project in Windsor, Calif.,  which promotes the rediscovery of women's history by creating resource  materials for schools, churches and businesses.  </P> <P> The celebration honors more than famous women, MacGregor says. "We want to say  we are recognizing all women, all cultural backgrounds . . . women who work  outside the home and inside the home, young and old -- all women."  </P> <P> Susan Rose, executive director of the Los Angeles City Commission on the Status  of Women, says: "There really is a need to recognize the achievements of women,  and the fact here is that their contribution -- the role of American women in  history -- had been consistently overlooked and undervalued, both in history  and literature, throughout the social sciences that we study. . . . This is a  real effort to recognize their accomplishments and achievements."  </P> <P> The commission serves as an advocate on women's issues such as child care,  sexual harassment in the workplace and empowerment of women of color.  </P> <P> "There's a statement of purpose around Women's History Month that talks about  the critical role women have played as part of the labor force, the unique role  they have played as volunteers, their participation in the establishment of  early charitable and cultural institutions in our country," Rose says.  </P> <P> "We look at March as a time to celebrate, and that's the underlying approach to  Women's History (Month): to recognize and celebrate womens' achievements. The  more we recognize . . . women's accomplishments and achievements, I think the  more that will be significant for young girls who need role models to follow."  </P> <P> Here is a sampling of Women's History Month events around the Southland:  </P> <P> * March 12-April 13: "Images and Reflections of Women Artists," a showcase of  work by 95 Los Angeles women artists, features works ranging from traditional  to avant-garde.

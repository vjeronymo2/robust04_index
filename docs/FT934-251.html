			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / US indicators promise good start to 1994 The US economy is poised for a healthy start to the new year according to the administration's principal measure of future economic prospects. The index of leading economic indicators rose by 0.5 per cent in November, the fourth consecutive monthly rise. At the same time, sales of existing homes rose in November by 2.9 per cent to a record annualised rate of 4.21m homes, according to the National Association of Realtors. The main components contributing to the rise in the index of leading economic indicators were lower claims for unemployment benefits, increased orders for new commercial buildings and business equipment and higher prices for raw materials, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The department said eight of the 11 elements of the index were pointing upwards in November, including more requests for building permits, stronger orders for consumer goods and longer average work weeks. The index of coincident indicators, intended to mark the pace of current economic activity, rose 0.5 per cent in November, also the fourth consecutive monthly rise. Mr Bob Elrod, president of the realtors' association, said buoyant home sales were driven by buyers' increased confidence in the economy. 'Consumers are reading the market accurately, knowing that conditions are prime for buying. An increase in resales on this magnitude is a substantial vote of confidence in the economy,' he said. The realtors' survey showed home sales rising strongly in the Midwest, east and south last month, but falling in western states. The median house price rose fractionally to Dollars 106,800 (Pounds 75,600), 4 per cent higher than a year earlier. Surveys such as the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, published earlier this week, show that the almost unfaltering strength of recent economic statistics has produced a surge of optimism in the US. Sales indications show this feeding through to purchases of expensive items such as homes, household appliances and cars. The steady diet of good economic news has encouraged some economists to predict growth rates for the whole US economy of more than 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. Although that pace is not expected to be sustained in the new year, most economists believe steady growth of around 3 per cent is likely in the first six months of the year.</p>

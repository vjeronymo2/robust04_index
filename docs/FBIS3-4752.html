Chairman of the British-Korean Friendship Parliamentary  Group  Robert Parry said in a statement on February 6 expressed deep  concern over the fact that at a time when a prospect of a  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was being  opened through the DPRK-U.S. talks, the U.S. hardline  conservative forces were overruling the DPRK-U.S. joint  statement and the agreement reached late last year and bringing  the situation to a hopeless phase.    He urged the British Government not to join in the anti-DPRK  campaign launched according to the script written by the United  States, taking into account the possible unfavorable effect on  world peace and security of the catastrophic situation created  by the reckless moves of the U.S. hardline conservative forces.    The Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korean  Reunification released a statement on February 7 denouncing the  United States for reinforcing its Armed Forces in South Korea  and its neighbouring countries in a bid to stifle the socialist  system established in Korea.    It called on the world people to condemn the U.S. moves  against the DPRK.    Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Association of  Tanzania S.J. Mabulla, in an interview with the KCNA  correspondent in Dar-es-Salaam on February 2, demanded that the  United States promptly stop forcing a comprehensive inspection  on the DPRK and presenting a military threat to it, solve the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through negotiations,  withdraw its nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea and  discontinue large-scale nuclear war exercises for good and all.    He called on the international community to strive hard to  check the [word indistinct] on big [words indistinct] peace and  reunification of the country.    The Belgium-Korea Solidarity Committee in a statement on  February 9 said that to finally solve the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula and create a favorable climate for the  independent and peaceful reunification of Korea depended  entirely on the U.S. attitude.</p>

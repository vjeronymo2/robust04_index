			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Fall in NZ budget deficit forecast MS RUTH Richardson, New Zealand finance minister, yesterday forecast a sharp reduction in the budget deficit to NZDollars 1.44bn (Pounds 522m) in the year to June 30, down from the NZDollars 2.28bn she predicted in her August budget. Ms Richardson made the forecast - and a series of others which she said proved that the economy was improving - in the so-called 'opening of the books exercise'. This detailed mini-budget statement was issued a a month before the November 6 general election. Since it was elected three years ago the pro-business National party government has consistently claimed that the previous Labour government deliberately kept secret the parlous state of the finances of the then state-owned Bank of New Zealand. In the last budget Ms Richardson said she would legislate to ensure every government would issue an 'honest' statement on the economic health of the country. However the legislative timetable prevented the law being passed, and opposition parties say the exercise has been turned into a political one staged to gain votes. Dr Michael Cullen, Labour finance spokesman, had predicted the budget deficit announced yesterday would be below that announced on budget night. Ms Richardson said the improved fiscal outlook since the budget arose from higher than expected tax receipts since June, sharp falls in local and international interest rates and a rise in the exchange rate. 'These factors contribute to a substantial reduction in debt servicing payments,' she said. She added that there had also been a sharp fall in social welfare payments due to a lower number of unemployed. The economy was expected to grow by 2.9 per cent in 1993-94 and up to 3.5 per cent in 1995-96, Ms Richardson said. The budget deficit would steadily shrink over the coming years, and would be almost eradicated in three years' time with a deficit of just NZDollars 54m. Tax income had picked up sharply since the budget, and government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product would fall from 37.9 per cent this year to 34.6 per cent in 1995-96. Net public debt as a percentage of GDP would fall from 47.9 per cent in 1992-93 to 44.6 per cent in 1995-96. Ms Richardson said business investment was projected to grow by 12 per cent this year. There was also high levels of consumer confidence and spending and some lift in house prices was expected. Inflation would remain within the range of nil to 2 per cent.</p>

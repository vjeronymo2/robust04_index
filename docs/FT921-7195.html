			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / The European Market: EC tornado forces subsidy rules on Spain's lossmaking industries MR JOSE ANGEL Fernandez Villa spent Christmas down a coal mine just outside Oviedo, the capital of Asturia in northern Spain, to protest at government plans for the retirement of 6,000 miners from Hunosa, the decrepit state mining company. Then, earlier this month, he announced his retirement as leader of the powerful Soma-UGT mineworkers' union, to take advantage of the very same retirement scheme. His going was a first victory in what is becoming an industrial tornado in Spain. Madrid is finally giving in to European Community subsidy rules with a massive restructuring of its lossmaking steel, coal and shipbuilding industries before the advent of the 1993 single market. Up to 30,000 jobs could be lost in these industries and many experts say this will not be nearly enough. Only about 20 per cent of the 140,000 employees at the state industrial holding company, INI, work in profitable companies. INI has meanwhile decided to go to the capital markets this year to raise Dollars 1.7bn in new funds for the handful of its companies it considers viable. But even these include desperate cases such as Ensidesa, the integrated steelmaker, which could have lost more than Pta30bn (Dollars 291.3m) last year and the Inespal aluminium group (losses of Pta25bn), which INI is trying to sell off to Alcan. Iberia, the state airline, lost Pta50bn last year and attempts by the government to recapitalise INI's newly created 'viable division' - companies where profits are possible  - are being monitored by the European Commission in case they are slipped illegal subsidies. The sheer scale of the jobs threat has also jolted unions, especially as it coincides with the drafting of a tough economic convergence plan which the government hopes will guarantee Spain entry in the first division of the European Community's economic and monetary union at the end of this decade. A remark by Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, to the effect that 'the best industrial policy is not to have one,' has also frightened workers. In a violent protest a few weeks ago in Murcia, capital of the Mediterranean region which includes the naval works at Cartagena, the local parliament was attacked and badly burned. The government is being very careful, and nowhere more so than in Asturias which is heavily unionised. Hunosa, the biggest employer in the region, is Spain's biggest coal producer and a financial basket case. Since its creation out of 18 lossmaking coal producers in Asturias in 1967 it has never made a profit. 'As a business, this is a ruin,' says a refreshingly open official. 'The idea never was to make any money but to create jobs in Asturias and supply Spain with coal.' That will no longer do. It costs Hunosa Pta32,000 to bring a tonne of coal to the surface and imports from South Africa can be landed on Spanish soil for a sixth of that. Last year the company lost Pta65bn and the European Commission has threatened legal action unless Madrid stops subsidising the operating losses. Under a plan presented in Brussels recently, employment will be cut by a third, to 12,000. Some 4,500 workers - including Mr Fernandez Villa - will take early retirement on full pay until they are 68 years old. It is a good deal. In regions such as Asturias, the Basque Country and parts of Murcia - which have suckled for years at the state's financial teat - the trick now is to implement industrial cuts while financing infrastructural investments which could help attract new investment to the regions and soothe troubled voters. Regional politics are crucial to Spain's stability, and a few days after the Cartagena riot, the government said it was diverting Dollars 800m in new investment to the Murcia region. In the Basque Country, the possible closure of integrated steelmaking outside Bilbao is likely to be countered with the building of a huge steel mill. In Asturias, the government's promised new investment incentives will cost up to Dollars 4bn. Asturias is particularly difficult. Unlike the Basque country, it has no tradition of private enterprise, and has poor road, rail and air links with Cantabria, the Basque Country and, ultimately, France. However Mr Victor Zapico, the Asturian industry counsellor, or minister, insists: 'We are not a lost cause. We just need to bury the notion that the state will always provide.' Asturians hope a Dollars 1bn chemicals plant being built by DuPont near the port of Gijon will attract other investors but replacing lost coal jobs will be hard. Unfortunately for Asturias, the government's 6,000 job cuts at Hunosa will draw losses down to just Pta50bn, and EC coal subsidy rules to be introduced in 1993 will probably be stricter. The present 'plan' is a play for time, not a solution. Government officials insist they are determined to cut industrial subsidies, however, and that they will not be intimidated by violence. 'The stones (thrown at Cartagena) will not alter a single comma of the restructuring plan for Cartagena,' said Mr Alvaro Espina, secretary of state for industry. 'The truth is that there are many (industrial) groups making money in the country (but) really innovative businessmen hardly ever walk the corridors of this ministry.'</p>

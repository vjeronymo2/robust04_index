			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARYL GATES' COMMENTS ON DRUG USERS  </P> <P> Those were hard words uttered by Gates. The public outcry over his remarks is  merely indicative, to me, of just how pervasive the use of illegal substances  has become in our society.  </P> <P> Drug-related murders, whether they be in Colombia or on the streets of Los  Angeles, are a daily occurrence. Unfortunately, it is not always the  drug-related who get killed. We cannot hope to win this war until the casual  user wakes up to the fact that he/she is an accessory to murder under the law .  . . the law of supply and demand. If the demand stopped, it would no longer be  necessary to protect the lucrative commerce of supply. The responsibility for  the killing lies not only in the hard-core street dealer, but at the upscale  cocktail party where friends casually do a few lines; in the dormitory where  the students relax with a joint; in the corporate high-rise office building  where the board members pop a few pills to keep the edge.  </P> <P> If Gates suggests fighting gunfire with gunfire, I couldn't possibly agree with  him more. After all, that is what war is, isn't it?  </P> <P> NATALIE J. MEYER  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

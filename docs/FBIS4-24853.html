			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tiffany Bown] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 2 (AFP)--A steely security net has  descended on Beijing this week as China's nervous leadership  moves to ensure that nobody rocks the boat on the fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. Hundreds of plainclothes  police roam Tiananmen Square -- the vast focal point of the  spring 1989 pro-democracy protests, crushed by the army on June  4 that year -- ready to nip in the bud any undesirable  commemorative activities.    Easily recognisable by their straw hats, dark glasses, and  two-way radios, the uncomfortable-looking officers mingle among  the crowds of Chinese families, moving in quickly to videotape  the movements of any suspicious-looking characters -- such as  camera-wielding foreign journalists.    "They seem to be more nervous this year than ever," said one  diplomat, putting the official paranoia down to fears of  instability amid rising social discontent and concern about the  health of 89-year-old patriach Deng Xiaoping.    The city is crawling with uniformed officers from its  50,000-strong People's Armed Police (PAP) force, developed since  1989 into a strong riot-control unit able to put down  disturbances without calling on the Army -- whose unsuitability  for dealing with civil unrest led to the June 4 bloodshed. But,  should the PAP fail to restore order quickly, the authorities  appear ready to resort to extreme measures again. President  Jiang Zemin recently credited the "resolute measures" taken by  the Army in 1989 for China's present stability.    Security is particularly tight around the homes of  dissidents  and their families -- with whom some foreign journalists, under  an obscure regulation, were recently warned to break all contact  or face the consequences. Many dissidents are already in  detention after an intensive police sweep that began in the  spring following the most significant resurgence in their  activities since 1989. Others, including Tiananmen leader Wang  Dan, have left the capital temporarily, either at the orders of  the authorities or simply to avoid harassment. Those who remain  complain that their every move is being watched.    Ding Zilin, a People's University professor whose son was  shot by soldiers in 1989, was preparing Thursday to launch a  hunger strike in the evening to protest the intensive police  surveillance of her home. Ding's husband Jiang Peikuang said  police had warned friends who also lost relatives in the  massacre not to join them.    The northwestern university district, base in 1989 of the  protests' student leaders, is another focus for police  attention. Everyone entering university compounds must now show  their identity cards, while several student activists have been  sent home early for the holidays. "They're erring on the side  of caution, on the side of stupidity -- no one wants to be  responsible for letting things get out of control," said a  diplomat.    Such "stupidity" is reflected in an apparent directive to  stop all and any large gatherings -- even if most people present  are likely to be foreigners. In recent days, an  innocuous-sounding foreign-embassy bazaar in a five-star hotel  was threatened with closure, a painting exhibition by a  diplomat's wife cancelled, an embassy party in one park banned,  and a foreign journalist's party in another scuppered by an  electricity overload and police road block.    "Their tactics have changed since 1989 -- now they are  simply  not going to allow people to get together," the diplomat said.  Their tactics also include efforts to temporarily diffuse  popular tension over high inflation and other social ills by  reimposing price controls here on a range of staple goods, while  ensuring that the capital's shops are particularly well-stocked.  "Lots of luxury items that are usually quite difficult to come  by are suddenly in the shops at very cheap prices," said one  Beijing resident.    Should these efforts to lull the population into a sense of  well-being fail to dissuade any foolhardy individuals from  commemorating the Tiananmen Massacre openly, the forces are now  in place to deal with them quickly and severely.</p>

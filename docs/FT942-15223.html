			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Brokers fined for Kuwaiti deals Record fines have been imposed on two stockbrokers who earned bonuses of about Pounds 1m each for helping to sell assets of a Kuwaiti client after Kuwaiti assets were frozen in August 1990 following the Iraqi invasion. The client is believed to be the Kuwait Investment Office, the investment arm of the Kuwaiti government. The two men, Mr Anthony John Edward O'Sullivan and Mr Lucas Van der Ploeg, were managing director and executive director at London-based Sassoon Europe, a subsidiary of Singapore-based stockbroker Sassoon, which is itself 49 per cent owned by the KIO. The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body for the industry, said yesterday that the two liquidated 'a large holding' from the client's portfolio in the Dutch and German markets through Sassoon Overseas, a related company in Hong Kong. 'They succeeded in selling some DM1bn of the portfolio over two days and the proceeds were paid to the client despite the freeze orders.' The SFA said both received payments in Dutch guilders equal to about Pounds 1m which were not disclosed to Sassoon. They also helped a 'senior employee' of the same client earn additional income through a 'skimming' operation  - they wrote up contract notes to purchase securities, mostly French equities, at inflated prices. The senior employee had threatened that the client's business with Sassoon would dry up unless the two men agreed to the operation. The men earned about Pounds 500,000 each from the activities while roughly Pounds 2m  - the difference between the actual and reported price for the securities  - was paid into Swiss numbered bank accounts on behalf of the senior employee. The pair have since made restitution for their part of the benefits from the skimming operation. Mr O'Sullivan has been fined Pounds 200,000 and ordered to pay Pounds 33,206 in costs while Mr Van der Ploeg has paid a fine of Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 5,000 in costs. Both have been expelled from SFA registers. Mr O'Sullivan has notified the regulatory body that he intends to seek judicial review of its decision.</p>

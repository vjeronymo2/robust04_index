			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ma'sum Sa'di] </F>   [Text] It is a great step for us to teach a child how to  read and understand the Holy Koran beginning in elementary  school to implement what the president-commander stipulated when  he said, "It is necessary to formulate a plan under which the  student understands the Koran thoroughly upon completion of  secondary school."    However, for many reasons, students, guardians, and teachers  of the Koran have voiced many complaints regarding the plan's  implementation. For this report, we went around to the concerned  parties to become familiar with the causes of the problem and  students' and officials' opinions, hardships, and  recommendations for mounting a successful campaign of faith that  achieves the desired objective.    The importance and results of teaching the Holy Koran to  students are obvious. Such instruction provides students with  spiritual values and concepts by which they can correct what is  wrong. It also helps them develop good language skills.  Elementary school students memorize a suitable number of verses  at each level. This develops their language skills and enriches  their vocabulary with terms that they will use year after year.    Students and guardians have problems with the difficult  instruction and the method used to convey it. The curriculum  includes many long chapters of the Koran and is thus very  intensive and difficult for the child to absorb. For example,  the first-grade curriculum, like that of other levels, includes  two books. One is the Islamic Education Book. It  includes five chapters of the Koran for memorization ("The  Opening," "The Purity of Faith," "Mankind," "Help," and  "Abundance"), several religious teachings (e.g., prayer, the  principles of Islam, and love of God and his Prophet), and short  prophetic traditions. The other book is the Holy Koran for  reading with a commentary on "its readings and its meanings." It  includes more than 30 chapters. Is this not too much for a child  to learn to read and write word by word?    Most believe that the Islamic Education Book is  very adequate for this level. This is what Majidah Hamid, a  teacher, says. She goes on to say that the Koran is very  intensive and too advanced for first-grade students, and that  the Islamic Education Book by itself more than  adequately fulfills the desired purpose.  <H5>  Unsupportive Method </H5>   The teaching method plays an important role and has a  far-reaching effect on the psyche of the child and student. What  is happening in our schools is that some teachers and  instructors are not in harmony with the desired goal. Their  method is unsupportive and tough rather than gentle to make the  subject easy. This generates strong reactions.    One woman, Iman Jamil, relates her hardships as follows: My  daughter, Halah, is in the third grade in elementary school. Her  main problem concerns memorization of the Holy Koran. She weeps  in fear of the teacher of this subject, who threatens to beat  them and screams at them if one of them does not know how to  read a word correctly or did not memorize a chapter well.    Halah's mother says that she does not know how to explain  some of the meanings and verses about which Halah asks, which  the mother finds to be beyond her daughter's age and educational  level. Halah asks her about them continuously, because they are  a part of the curriculum. For example, the chapter, "Women,"  deals with marriage and related matters, which are undoubtedly  beyond the level of Halah, who is not yet 10.    An official source in the Education Ministry told us that  the  ministry has established a process in which parts of the Holy  Koran are introduced at each academic level, from the first  grade of elementary school through the sixth grade of middle  school. He emphasized that the early levels start with short  chapters. Also, the ministry has asked teachers not to require  students to memorize chapters or verses of the Koran except for  those specified in the instructions for each grade, aside from  chapters and verses designated to be understood and explained  generally. The ministry also prepared a manual called From  the Rules of Recitation and distributed it to all teachers  and schools in the country. The manual specifies the recitation  rules, which must be learned in each grade.    Nonetheless, what is happening is raising questions!    Another important thing that we noted, about which many  guardians complained to us, is the fact that teachers digress  from the subject and speak of matters having no bearing on  religion. The president-commander emphasized this point in a  speech during a meeting with officials regarding elementary and  secondary education. He said, "The Koran must be understood in a  precise, integrated curriculum, without independent opinions and  without development and expansion. We want to teach only the  Koran."    Regarding this problem, let us present several illustrations  of what some teachers have been doing in our schools.    Muhammad Talib is in the sixth grade of elementary school.  He  returned one day from school and removed all of the pictures  hanging on the walls of his home, even those of his father and  relatives. When his mother asked him why he did so, he told her  that the teacher of the Holy Koran had told them that it is  "forbidden" to hang pictures on the wall, because it violates  religious teachings!    Wasan, a student in the third grade of middle school, is  still a cause of dismay for her father. He has taken her from  one physician to another because of her difficult psychological  state, which induces a feeling of fear in her. She awakens at  night from persistent nightmares and dreams of death, because  the Holy Koran teacher speaks continuously and in detail of the  nature of death, the size of the grave, the afterlife, how God  will punish mankind, how the body disintegrates, and other  details which have aroused fear and dread in the students'  psyches.    There are many other examples and illustrations. Instruction  in the Holy Koran has thus come to have side effects stemming  from independent opinions and instructional [methods], which  most students find difficult to endure. As a result, most  families with children in school are experiencing difficulties.  <H5>  Courses for Teachers Are Brief and Fast </H5>   In most cases, we find that the teacher is either strict or  incompetent. In either case, the desired goal is not achieved,  because the Koran is learned in a difficult manner. One factor  contributing to this outcome is the failure, despite the  importance of this subject, to select teachers who can teach the  Koran effectively based on principles and methods that  facilitate the explaining and understanding of this subject.    At present, teachers are not well prepared relative to the  importance of the campaign. The Education Ministry has held  training courses, but they have been brief and fast.    The teacher Iman 'Adnan: How can we convey an intensive  curriculum in a simplified, understandable manner if it causes  us hardship, and we find it difficult at times to absorb it? The  Koran comprises foundations and principles, and the courses in  which they enrolled us were very brief, lasting not more than a  month. These courses covered 11 subjects, only four of which  pertained to the subject. I do not know how "reasoning by  analogy and adaptation" and other lessons from which we neither  derived nor understood anything are related to teaching the Holy  Koran. This is a faith campaign. One would assume that it would  be of adequate utility and not so abbreviated. What happened is  that we were dismayed by an intensive, lengthy curriculum, which  we were required to convey in a simplified manner to students  who are still in the early stages of their education!  <H5>  What the Concerned Parties Say </H5>   Our first thought was that the Awqaf and Religious Affairs  Ministry--because it specializes in the principles and teachings  of the Koran and all that pertains to it--would have a role in  the faith campaign in the schools, whether by giving its opinion  and advice or by helping to formulate the academic curriculum  and select the teachers. This is certainly not to say that the  Education Ministry lacks competence in this area. However, a  specialist undoubtedly knows the subject of his specialty better  than others. Accordingly, we went to the Awqaf and Religious  Affairs Ministry, only to be surprised to learn that the  ministry has had no involvement whatsoever in the matter,  although it has expressed its willingness to help and is still  willing to provide advice or help if asked to do so. The  important thing is to achieve a positive outcome and a  successful campaign.    To become familiar with the opinions and observations of  specialists in the principles and teaching of the Holy Koran, we  met with Dr. Muhyi Hilal al-Sirhan, the dean of the College of  Islamic Sciences at Baghdad University. He spoke with us about  teaching the Holy Koran and memorization of it to elementary  school students. He said: The Koran is a rich source of  vocabulary words, a sea of meanings and terms, and an  inexhaustible treasure of meritorious morals and comely  characteristics. It is worthwhile for us to explain to our  elementary students an appropriate measure of the word of  almighty God, which is the best word, and to have them memorize  short chapters and then progressively longer chapters of the  Koran. As to the memorization method at the early elementary  level, the instructor should first use the conventional  memorization techniques used in the schools. When the students  become skillful in this initial phase and can memorize, they can  then be assigned to memorize texts as homework. The memorization  of texts in the school is carried out in steps. After the  meanings and commandments of texts have been taught, and the  students have become proficient in reading them aloud  individually and collectively applying the rules and principles  of Koranic recitation, written verses are then presented to the  students on a blackboard, signboard, television screen, or card.  After the students can consistently read the verses well, the  teacher begins to gradually cover up words, first one word, then  two, then three, and so on until an entire passage is covered.  In this way, an entire chapter can be memorized, paying heed to  the correct pronunciation "rules of Koranic recitation" and  their practical application.    Shaykh Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Sa'di, the chairman of the  Islamic Literature Association and a professor at the Institute  of Imams and Preachers, finds that the teaching of the Holy  Koran in a sound manner enables the student to master the words  of the Holy Koran. He believes that we should follow the method  used in the traditional Kuttab [the lowest elementary level in  the Koran schools], which focuses on memorization of the Holy  Koran. This method consists of teaching children at the early  elementary level the Arabic consonants and vowels and how they  are connected. This is called spelling. Then the student is able  to read any word in the Holy Koran. This method has its  principles and rules. Academic research done in this area can be  circulated to the teachers of the Holy Koran, who can be  enrolled in courses for this purpose. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Sa'di continues: Perhaps it is said that this method is  antiquated and not accepted by modern pedagogy. However,  experimentation has proved that it is the only method for  mastering the words of the Holy Koran.    Psychologically, the students' desire to recite the Holy  Koran can be awakened by making it attractive and by easing the  difficulties of which they complain. The class can be divided  into groups that compete for a prize. Also, young students can  be taught the purpose of reading the Koran by explaining to them  God's reward in the afterlife and the benefit that the student  will enjoy in his temporal life. The current curriculum being  taught at the elementary and higher levels requires some  revisions, namely the selection of short chapters for the lower  levels, longer ones for the middle, and lengthy ones for the  final levels.  <H5>  Ideas and Recommendations </H5>   After we obtained these opinions and heard the hardships of  students, their guardians, and concerned persons, the goal of  all of us is still a successful faith campaign. The following  are some recommendations for review and possibly use by  officials and persons concerned with this subject:     -  The teachers now responsible for teaching Koranic  recitation are not experts in this area. This subject should be  taught by specialists who have extensive experience in this  field. The imams of mosques spread throughout the country can be  used for this purpose, if only for a transitional period, until  a complete Koranic cadre is trained. We also call for developing  current teachers of the Holy Koran by enrolling them in long  courses in the method for teaching and simplifying the subject.    -  Reduction of the curriculum at the elementary levels: How  nice  it would be to limit the curriculum to the "Islamic Education  Book in the first, second, and third grades inasmuch as it  accomplishes the desired goal.    -  We also call upon teachers of the subject to be patient and  gentle, tolerate their students' mistakes, and descend to the  level of their intellect and comprehension without violence,  beating, or threats.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Gazprom to limit foreign investment Gazprom, the Russian company which controls the world's largest gas reserves, says it will limit direct foreign participation to projects which require technical expertise unavailable in the country. Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gazprom chairman, told a Financial Times conference in Vienna yesterday that there 'would be no question of any direct foreign investment or profit sharing' in projects in which current Russian technology was adequate. He said the restrictions applied both to exploration and production of gas reserves as well as to pipeline and other distribution systems. But Gazprom might utilise foreign finance for such projects, he said. Direct foreign participation was welcome, however, in higher-risk developments. These were defined as those in which the 'geologic or climatic challenges' required more advanced technology than that available in Russia. 'In those cases we would be willing to work at all stages with foreigners,' Mr Vyakhirev said. Gazprom is increasingly looking to remote Siberian and Arctic sites, such as the Yamal Peninsula, as well as to the largely unexplored northern Russian continental shelf, for future reserves. Mr Vyakhirev yesterday confirmed that current prices paid by western European customers for Russian gas were inadequate to support the development of such areas. He also questioned whether it was wise to open up the Russian pipeline system to allow other producers in the former Soviet Union to deliver their gas to western Europe. 'The system is already over-committed,' he said. 'we are putting money into expansion . . . access should mean investment.' Mr Vyakhirev said Gazprom intends to expand the southern pipeline route to western Europe which passes through Ukraine. This is despite the 'serious problems' which have arisen between Moscow and Kiev over the pipeline, and a proposal to build a new line to western Europe through Belarus and Poland.</p>

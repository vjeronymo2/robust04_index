			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Greenalls sees savings from bid GREENALLS Group, the pubs and hotels company which has made an agreed Pounds 214.3m offer for JA Devenish, the west country pubs group, said yesterday that it expects to generate some Pounds 3.5m in annual cost savings as a result of the proposed acquisition. The deal would add 550 pubs to Greenall's present estate of 1,450, and the offer document published yesterday identifies areas where cost savings are expected to be made. These include economies of scale and improved overhead absorption resulting from the elimination of duplicated costs and the potential for Stretton Leisure, Greenalls' machine distribution company, to supply amusement, games and music machines to the Devenish pubs. Reflecting a slightly more bullish appraisal of trading prospects Greenalls is now predicting that, after taking into account the savings, the acquisition of Devenish will be non-dilutive in the first full year.</p>

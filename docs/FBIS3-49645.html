			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the political collegium held by Prime Minister  Janez Drnovsek, Maks Tajnikar, Slovene minister for economic  affairs, spoke about the contents of yesterday's talks with  Croatian Minister for Economy Vidosevic at Otocec. They spoke  about Slovene demands that Croatia settles its debt to the  nuclear power plant in Krsko. Minister Tajnikar pointed out that  the demand for settlement of debts due is a business problem  that means that the buyer must pay for the goods purchased. The  problem has not been solved and the two ministers will probably  meet again soon, after the Croatian minister holds consultations  in Zagreb about the Slovene demands.</p>

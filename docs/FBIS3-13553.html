			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 15 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper AL-BA'TH has  stressed that based on its structure, nature, teachings, and  ideology, the Zionist entity was established as a fascist entity  and will continue to be based on the same firm and declared  principles of the mythical Zionist ideology that considers its  followers superior to the rest of mankind.    In a comment today, the paper says: Beyond any doubt, old  and new Zionist history proves the bloody and terroristic nature  of this entity. The Hebron massacre alone provides sufficient  proof of the Zionist thought prevailing in Israel.    The paper notes: Zionist settlers did not appear in a  vacuum. They have always been the realistic and true embodiment  of Israeli policy, since the usurpation of Palestine. These  settlers were armed and instructed to usurp Arab territories.    Concluding, the paper says: It is regrettable that many  sides in the world still refuse to open their eyes to the  Zionist-Israeli fact. The proof is the current farce about the  holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which has been going on for  more than two weeks at the UN Security Council.    In its editorial today under the headline "The Hebron  Massacre," the newspaper TISHRIN says: The holy al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre has torn all the veils of peace behind which the  Rabin government was hiding. The massacre exposed the true  nature of this government.    In the article written by its Editor in Chief Muhammad Khayr  al-Wadi, the paper stresses: There is no difference between the  policy of the Shamir government and that of the Rabin  government. They are both hostile to peace, refuse to  relinquish the occupied Arab territories, and each of them seeks  to achieve the same goal, namely, the establishment of greater  Israel.    The paper notes: The whole world expected the international  community to take practical and effective measures concerning  the Hebron massacre to protect unarmed civilians and to deter  aggressors. However, disappointment was great when it was  proven that the powers dominating the Security Council are still  using double standards every time the issue is related to Israel.    Concluding, the paper says: What happened at the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque is the logical result of the policy of  indifference to Israel, and to spoiling it. The continuation of  such a policy will lead to further Zionist massacres and to  further disruption of the prospects of achieving a just and  comprehensive peace in the region.</p>

This is what  Aristide spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau said to explain to  public opinion that Jean-Bertrand Aristide has nothing to do  with the Mole Saint-Nicolas thing, or the (Portortuga) affair.  The Haitian president is not involved in this matter -- not  closely nor even remotely -- nor is any other member of the  government involved in this matter. However, perhaps the main  person accused, Commerce Minister Louis Dejoie, is. The matter  is still just a rumor, but it will be looked into, says  Jean-Claude Martineau.    [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] Something is being  said discreetly throughout the country: The commerce minister  has allegedly given a company a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas.  The rumor says that no other part of the government knows about  it. Since this is a rumor, we will try to obtain information  about it.    Meanwhile, however, President Aristide would like to inform  the public that he has nothing to do with that matter. Should it  be true, the minister alone must bear full responsibility for  it. When one does not own land, one cannot sell that land. [end  recording]    Let us recall that during a news conference by the Group of  Democratic Parliamentarians [Groupe des Parlementaires  Democrates, GPD], Deputy Samuel Madistin accused the minister of  commerce of having signed a contract with the company  (Portortuga S.A.) granting it a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas.  This contract allegedly gives the company exclusive rights to  build an entertainment and leisure facility on land located in  Mole Saint-Nicolas.</p>

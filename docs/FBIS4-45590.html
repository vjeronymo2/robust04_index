The survey found that 46 percent of drug users are under 18  years of age, while 43 percent are in the 19-25 years' age  group. It also found that 70 of 1,000 students questioned said  they had used illegal drugs at least once.    Education Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros said the government  would launch a massive awareness campaign in schools to teach  junior and high-school students about the dangers of drug use  and addiction. "More than 50,000 teachers will participate in  the programme," he said.    But some local authorities seem unwilling to wait for the  government to take the initiative. In the northwestern Athens  suburb of Iraklio, the first professionally staffed counselling  centre opened its doors this week.</p>

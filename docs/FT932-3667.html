			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel: High hopes of intrigue on the Andalus Express - Nicholas Woodsworth yearns for mystery and passion on a luxury train journey Cordoba - Granada: Glass of Jerez fino in hand, I stand at a swaying bar. Beside me is a woman, dark and dressed in red. Her voice is low, her accent mysterious. Her bangle earrings swing to the rhythm of the train. Framed in the window behind her I can see a Mediterranean spring racing by. But for the moment I am not interested in olive trees, sunflowers and white cottages. I am interested in foul deeds. The woman's eyes have narrowed. 'Murder,' she whispers to me. 'What we need is a good murder.' Beatriz, of course, is only kidding. We are not discussing foul deeds at all, but the reputations of luxury trains. She is one of the red-uniformed hostesses who sees that things run smoothly on the Andalus Express. I am one of 36 guests who have boarded for a four-day tour of the cities and countryside of Andalusia in southern Spain. We both agree. Nothing ever did any train so much good as Agatha Christie's story of violent death on the Orient Express. What matters is not that the Orient Express is no longer oriental - it terminates in Venice - but the cachet remains. Intrigue, mystery and hidden passions have become an important, perhaps vital, part of the romantic lure of luxury train travel. There has not been foul play aboard the Andalus Express so far, but there is plenty of mystery. It is an odd thing to be thrown into intimate contact with total strangers in the close quarters of a rushing train. I gaze down the length of the wood-panelled, art-deco style bar-car at the assembled guests awaiting dinner. We may come from different countries, but as a group we are middle-aged and middle class. We appear, superficially, profoundly ordinary. Is it possible that there are hidden passions and secrets here? On trains, where the mystery of fellow travellers is only slowly unfolded and never wholly revealed, anything is possible. Only this morning, as we toured Seville, we were merely 36 faceless tourists in a far larger crowd of faceless tourists. In the Casa Pilatos, our first encounter with the Moorish traditions of southern Spain, we listened as our guide, Maria-Teresa, introduced us to the architecture of horseshoe arch and colonnaded courtyard, domed roof and polychrome tile. Our comments on the bougainvillaea in the gardens were polite but distant. Not even the overpowering Santa Maria cathedral, where we walked craning upwards like Lilliputians on an inspection tour, brought us together. The only things as stiff as our manners were our necks. It was during lunch, served as the train rolled along the flat plain between Seville and Cordoba, that the ice began to break. In a lavish dining car of brocade upholstery, pale rose curtains and floral inlay wall panels, we worked our way, with a little gentle cajoling from the waiters, through a vast menu: asparagus soup, salmon and endive salad, seafood mousse, batter-fried squid, whitefish with fresh asparagus, veal in red wine sauce, cheese, fruit and three different deserts, including kiwi cheesecake. This is not the kind of meal that goes without comment. Halfway through it, helped by liberal doses of rich red Rioja, American, Swiss and even the British - the most reserved travellers in the world - were beginning to delve into the lives of their neighbours. At my own table, Thaddeus is Norwegian and somewhat short on light humour. Dark and brooding, he seems to have escaped from an Ibsen play. Tom and Karen are not from an Ibsen play, but from Chicago. True, they have some lamentable American habits. They drink Coke Lite throughout their meals. Tom tells questionable jokes, the Waco massacre being his current source of inspiration. He keeps two handguns in his house. And he admires Bruce Willis. But all is forgiven because Tom went to school with Hillary Clinton and has the latest family dirt. Hillary, it seems, has begun throwing things at Bill. First it was a lamp, then a telephone. With this grade of information, Tom is a man I could have more than a lunch or two with. I cannot figure out whether he is a gangster or a society gossip. Following our afternoon walking tour of Cordoba, I am almost certain he is not an architect. For Tom, the great Cordoba mosque, with its 856 magnificent stone columns topped with red and white double arches, is 'kinda cute.' Day 2: Granada - Ronda: Last night, before retiring to bed with a copy of Dial M for Murder, I strolled into the lounge for a little after-dinner dancing. As the train rumbled through the dark towards Granada, couples clung together for support and swayed over the dance-floor to the rhythm of the train and the music provided by Pedro the piano player and his electronic Yamaha. Actually, I find Pedro as mysterious as anyone on this train. He is an accomplished musician. But sometimes, in the middle of some emotional piece, he gets up and walks away from his Yamaha, leaving it playing by itself. Anyone who can be so open about deception has to have something to hide. On the other hand, even Agatha Christie herself would be suspicious of just about every one of the Andalus Express' 23 staff. What, to cite only one example, about the lovely Pilar? She is gorgeous, a delicate Andalusian beauty with flashing eyes. She claims to be the train's technical engineer, on hand to repair electrical systems, plumbing or air-conditioning. A likely story. I do not believe a word of it. Or what about the American mystery couple who came aboard with their own stock of American drinking water? They emerge from their sleeping-car suite only occasionally for meals and tours, and are the subject of intense lunchtime speculation. Honeymooners? An easy enough cover. Certainly they made a good show of it strolling hand-in-hand through the palaces and gardens of the Alhambra this morning. And then suddenly, this afternoon, at the tiny rose-bush-smothered station of Salinas high up in the Andalusian hills, they disembarked without a word, taking their cases of water with them. Rum goings-on indeed. Poirot would not have stood for it. I am going to bed with The French Quarter Killers. Day 3: Ronda-Puerto Santa Maria: The rain in Spain falls mainly on the train. The local guides who show us around the towns we stop in keep telling us that Andalusia is an extremely dry place, but even the weather is acting suspiciously: it is pretending it is English. Today, in the mountain town of Ronda, it is bucketing down. We abandoned our pose as luxury travellers and walked through the rain with plastic bags on our heads. I have added eight more passengers to my list of potential perpetrators of possible crimes. They are four English couples from Coventry who travel everywhere together. Odd in itself. Apparently, the men were executive co-owners of a Midlands engineering firm until, suddenly, a couple of years ago, they upped and sold the company and began a high life of 'retirement.' The dining car is abuzz. There are jokes about spare parts and big guns for Iraq. I am off to bed for a couple of chapters of In Cold Blood. Day 4: Jerez-Seville: The vast meals in the Andalus Express' dining car are beginning to tell. This morning, dressed in our bathrobes and heading in opposite directions to and from the shower car, a rather large woman and I almost failed to negotiate the narrow corridor of carriage No 4. Any more of this kind of eating and passengers will not be able to slide past each other at all. The programme continues at a hectic pace. Today we will be visiting and wine-tasting at the Domecq winery, one of the oldest and largest sherry houses in Jerez. We shall also be attending a performance at the Royal Spanish Riding School. Once again there will be an endless lunch before we return to our starting point at Santa Justa station in Seville. The tour is almost over. But I, for one, have not given up hope. The mystery and intrigue remain until the last minute. How might it happen? A glass of poisoned Double Century? A rigged accident of rearing horses and flaying hoofs? Death by over-eating? And to whom? Pedro the piano player? Tom from Chicago? One of the Coventry crew? The lovely Pilar? The possibilities are endless. The ultimate in train fantasies might still come true. There is time yet for murder on the Andalus Express. Nicholas Woodsworth travelled to Seville on Iberia Airlines (London tel: 071-437-5622). His trip on the Andalus Express was arranged by Cox &amp; Kings Travel, St James Court, 45 Buckingham Gate, London SW1 (071-834-7472). Cox &amp; Kings offers an all-inclusive Andalus Express package - including airfare, London-Seville - for Pounds 1,450. It offers various other luxury Spanish train circuits. Next week: more journeys by train.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / TUC complains over union rights Britain is likely to be condemned by this year's conference of the International Labour Organisation in Geneva over alleged breaches of international conventions on union rights, the Trades Union Congress said yesterday. The latest complaint from the TUC concerns clauses in the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act that came into force last autumn. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, has written to the ILO arguing that the act violates its convention 87 on freedom of association by imposing an obligation on a union to admit individuals or groups to membership whether it wants to accept them or not. He also complains about the act's provisions that further limit the right to strike. The second complaint covers the recent failure of the government to reach an agreement with civil service unions to lift the 10-year ban on unions at the government's GCHQ communications headquarters at Cheltenham.</p>

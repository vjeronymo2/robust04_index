			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / A-level pass rates up for fifth year in succession A-LEVEL results out today show an increase in pass rates for the fifth year in succession, with 80 per cent of entrants securing passes. But the results, announced by the GCE examining boards, will intensify the strain on the higher education system, which has made conditional offers to more students than it can now afford to take. The figures show a 1.6 per cent increase in the number of passes at grades A to C (usually required for university entrance) and a 1.2 per cent rise in the overall pass rate. However, the number of entries in science subjects, which the government has attempted to encourage, fell sharply, although provisional figures indicated that total entries had risen. Business studies showed the biggest rise in entries, up 17.6 per cent after increases of more than 20 per cent in the previous two years. Religious studies showed a rise of 13.1 per cent. However, the number of entrants for physics fell 9.6 per cent. The Business and Technology Education Council, which offers a vocational alternative to A-levels, said the number of students completing its two-year course for the BTEC national diploma had risen by 25 per cent. Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said the fall in the number taking science A-levels was disappointing, but described GCE A levels as a continuing success story which were a credit to students and their teachers. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said that the higher pass rate would intensify the difficulties for admissions tutors and applicants. University applications increased by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this year, but there was no funding for any expansion in student numbers. The universities' difficulties follow a cut by the government earlier this year in the tuition fees payable for each student in arts and non-applied subjects from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300. Most universities have already made conditional offers. Universities cannot refuse any applicant who satisfies the conditions of their A-level offer. Testing time, Page 6</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> BEACH STILL CLOSED FROM SEWAGE SPILL  </P> <P> A half-mile mile strip of shoreline with private access near Laguna Beach  remained closed to swimmers Tuesday after the weekend rupture of a sewage pipe  that leaked about 5,000 gallons of effluent into the ocean.  </P> <P> County health officials said the beach at Emerald Bay would probably stay  closed until the end of the week. However, it could reopen as early as today if  water samples taken regularly since the Friday spill show a drop in effluent  levels, said Michael Wehner, water quality program chief for the Orange County  health department.  </P> <P> Wehner said the beach was closed as a precautionary measure because sewage  contamination can cause gastrointestinal disease. However, he said he did not  expect the spill to pose a danger to marine life.  </P> <P> The spill was the first to close the beach at Emerald Bay, according to Bob  Blankenship, a maintenance worker who helped repair the eight-inch pipe beneath  Coast Highway. The pipe is less than a mile north of McKnight Drive.  </P> <P> A foot-long crack was discovered in the pipe at about 6 p.m. Friday,  Blankenship said.  </P> <P> He said crews worked for 24 hours to dam the end of the drain and pump sewage  from the beach. Rain on Saturday broke the dam and forced workers to redo the  repairs.  </P> <P> The sewage pipes are maintained by a private association at Emerald Bay and do  not fall under city jurisdiction, county health officials said.

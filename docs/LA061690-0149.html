			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : MILLER FINDS HE'S EQUAL TO 'JUSTICE'  </P> <P> Barry Miller had been reluctant to do a TV series. His film and stage careers  were humming along just fine. He won a Tony Award a few seasons back for Neil  Simon's "Biloxi Blues" and had recently worked with such heavyweight film  directors as Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese.  </P> <P> But an old friend, producer/director Thomas Carter, made Miller an offer he  couldn't refuse: the role of brilliant but cynical prosecutor Peter Brigman on  Carter's new dramatic TV series, "Equal Justice," which airs Wednesdays at 10  p.m. on ABC.  </P> <P> "The character Thomas wanted me to play had such moments of charm and moments  of vileness at the same time," Miller says. "I thought it would be  interesting."  </P> <P> Despite his initial reluctance, Miller admits now that it was a good career  move to do "Equal Justice," which follows the lives and careers of public  prosecutors. "The (number of) people who watch one episode is more than the  audience was for all of my movies during the past 16 years," he says. "I was  not resistant to the idea of getting that kind of exposure. It was a wise and  good thing for me to do."  </P> <P> Miller, who also appeared in "Saturday Night Fever" and "Fame," has been  working almost nonstop since receiving the Tony four years ago for his role as  the embittered Jewish private in "Biloxi Blues." Winning the award, he says,  changed his career.  </P> <P> "Francis Coppola saw me in the show and asked me to be in 'Peggy Sue Got  Married,' " he says. He then also did the short-lived David Rabe play "Goose  and Tom-Tom" with Sean Penn, Madonna and Harvey Keitel.  </P> <P> "Harvey introduced me to Martin Scorsese and that's how I got 'The Last  Temptation of Christ.' " He spent a month on location in Morocco on the  Scorsese epic, in which he played a young monk who urges Jesus to preach.  </P> <P> "We were actually back seven centuries there," Miller recalls. "It was amazing  to be thrust into a world like that. I would describe it as hallucinogenic. It  was strange being that far away from home. I had never been that far away from  home and I have never been that far away since." SUSAN KING  </P></p>

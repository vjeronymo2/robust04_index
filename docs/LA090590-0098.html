			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER HIKES ITS COST-CUTTING TARGET BY $1 BILLION A YEAR  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., struggling with sagging sales and high incentive costs, has  increased its target for a cost-cutting program to $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> In July, 1989, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca announced plans to trim $1 billion from  the auto maker's $26-billion yearly budget by the end of 1990.  </P> <P> Chrysler has cut about 2,500 of its 28,700 white-collar jobs since last  October, spokesman Steve Harris said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Since the cost-cutting plans were announced, executives have raised the target  twice, first to $1.5 billion by the end of this year, and now to $2.5 billion  by next June, Iacocca said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.  </P> <P> "Some tentative targets ware being talked about," Harris said. "We haven't  formalized that yet or put the program in place. That is a tentative target  that he (Iacocca) is looking at."  </P> <P> Harris said product-development plans would be exempt from any new round of  cuts.  </P> <P> "Anything having to do with the product or customer satisfaction is intact," he  said.  </P></p>

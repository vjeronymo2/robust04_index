			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Observer: Tall order John Major's ministers cast around for ways in which a Conservative government can curb 'unjustified' pay awards without being made to look too foolish. Meanwhile, an ad appears in the national press for the first time for a Whitehall vacancy at permanent secretary level (in this instance at the Department of Employment), illustrating a rather different problem. Who do Michael Portillo and others expect to find to manage 'a programme and administrative expenditure totalling Pounds 4.6bn and 58,000 staff' at a salary of just Pounds 95,000 'subject to review'. While the analogy of a top civil servant with the chief executive of a public company may be less than complete, the ad states that the successful candidate 'will have worked at (or near) the top of a large private or public sector organisation'. Hence the relevance of the order of remuneration of, say, Tony Greener, chairman of Guinness: turnover in 1993, Pounds 4.66bn (though staff of only just over 23,000); remuneration Pounds 648,000.</p>

His decree published in the local press instructs the state  taxation committee to bring criminal charges in cases of tax  evasion, illegal exports and other offences damaging to  Uzbekistan's economic interests.    Prosecuting officers, the security services and interior  ministry are instructed to speed up investigation into offences  related to tax evasion and illegal exports so that no culprit  goes unpunished.    In one other decree, Karimov ordered an improvement of the  country's banking system and stabilization of financial and  crediting relations. Banks are told to finalize the  installation of computers by 1 October.    The decree also envisages the introduction of computerized  postal services ensuring an automatic stock taking of available  cash and prevention of illicit payment or crediting operations.  Uzbekistan is planning to tighten crediting and monetary  policies and bring an end to easy term government credits to  different sectors of the economy.    In this connection, the government has given local banks  four  weeks in which to study the experience gained by leading world  and CIS banks before submitting proposals on how to readjust  local bank operations to market requirements.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (4): Buildings for commerce - New offices spring up to house the service sector economy FOR several years the private and public sectors have collaborated in improving and expanding the office stock in the heart of Glasgow, as part of the policy of making it a centre of service activities and attracting new businesses. The Glasgow office property market began taking off from 1987 as developers became aware of the city's new potential. A surge of activity began as developers rebuilt or heavily refurbished the office buildings in the business core of the city around St Vincent Street. Part of the pressure came from local businesses such as solicitors, accountants, stockbrokers and advertising agencies who were expanding rapidly and found that their existing offices were both too small and inappropriate for the computer age. The Scottish Development Agency, which in Glasgow was the forerunner of the Glasgow Development Agency, had been trying for several years to persuade developers to look at new sites in Glasgow. It had identified areas of derelict or semi-derelict property adjacent to the core of the city to which it envisaged the city's office area expanding, and thus attracting company headquarters or large branch offices to Glasgow. As Mr Ted Webster, senior partner of the chartered surveyors Richard Ellis, used to point out in the late 1980s, improving the accommodation of indigenous Glasgow businesses was essential to the process of attracting incomers. 'You've got to have the local business community well-housed before you can get many people to come in from outside,' he said. From the late 1980s many buildings around St Vincent Street and West George Street were refurbished or rebuilt, often behind their original facades if these were subject to preservation orders. Office rents in the central business area, which comprises about 8m sq ft of office space between George Square and Charing Cross (the total rises to 12m sq ft including the Park area immediately to the west), increased from about Pounds 8 per square foot for space in prime locations in 1987 to reach a sustained average peak of about Pounds 18 in 1989. According to Mr David Rooney of the chartered surveyors Lambert Smith Hampton, the market reached its zenith in that year, with some deals being done at Pounds 20. It was not until the end of 1990 that the recession began to be felt seriously in the Glasgow property market. Now the market presents a more depressing picture. New development starts have come to an end and Richard Ellis calculates that about 650,000 sq ft of office space is available for rent, with a further 224,000 sq ft due for completion before the end of the year. Whereas the annual take-up of quality office space was running at 500,000 sq ft in the late 1980s, it fell to 350,000 sq ft in 1991 and only 165,000 sq ft had been let in the first five months of this year. Mr Rooney says that Glasgow is experiencing the tail-end of the 1980s boom as the last projects initiated in that period come to completion, and 'no one has the appetite to start new construction on the gap sites'. Much of the overhang consists of second hand office accommodation, 10 to 30 years old, which has been vacated by businesses trading up to more modern premises. This accommodation will be difficult to shift for the time being, he believes, as rents are being driven down by aggressive negotiators. Yet people in the property industry are not as gloomy as one might expect. Mr Webster says: 'It is not a sign of ill-health to have empty buildings. If there wasn't any, people looking for space would go away again.' Glasgow, he points out, traditionally has a stable office property market with demand growing steadily because of the size of the city's hinterland and its large potential workforce, but not outpacing supply, which grows because of the relative ease with which new developments can get underway. The largest single empty building, Tay House, which covers 160,000 sq ft with a wing built on a bridge across the M8 motorway, would be suitable for any company seeking a large amount of high quality space for immediate occupation. The decision of BP Exploration announced this month to leave its headquarters in St Vincent Street in the next year or so will free more high quality office space, although some space has already been taken by Abbey National. Mr Ken Campbell of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley says there is now 'a brake on the market which I see running for the next 12 months. But we are not in free fall: there is no resemblance here to London.' The most significant new development in the Glasgow's office property scene is the Broomielaw project. For years the business district has been gradually expanding south from St Vincent Street towards the river Clyde. The Broomielaw project leapfrogged straight to the riverfront; it involves creating nearly 1m square feet of top quality office space in an area which in 1987 consisted of semi-derelict warehouses and shops.</p>

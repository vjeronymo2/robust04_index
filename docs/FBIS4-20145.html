			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Finance Minister Theo Waigel in the Bundestag in </F> Bonn, in a debate on the spring report of six leading German  economic research institutes; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Excerpts] In Washington I took the opportunity to  describe the German Government's economic and financial strategy  as the basis for the upswing now clearly emerging. Our  international partners appreciate and recognize, above all in  the light of our overcoming the reunification process, that  through our savings and growth policies over the last year we  have been successful in our balancing act aimed at limiting  deficits while at the same time creating an important boost to  growth. This also applies to January's investment and  innovation package aimed at small- and medium-scale firms.    Our financial policy is on the right track. We have enjoyed  more significant success in terms of consolidation than many  others. According to IMF calculations, Germany will achieve the  best results in reducing the structural budget deficit by 1995.  [applause]    Together with Japan, we will next year have the lowest  structural deficit among the leading industrial states. Our G-7  partners have acknowledged that this determined policy of  consolidation will allow us to meet the criterion for joining  the currency union on time, stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty  as a deficit quota measuring 3 percent of GDP.    An issue which was prominent at earlier conferences figured  hardly at all this time around in Washington; namely, the  question of allegedly excessive German interest rates. Looking  back, our path of stringent budget consolidation twinned with  cautious but steady interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank has  proven to be wise, correct, and forward-thinking. [applause]    This has enabled us to meet the markets' expectations  regarding stability. It allowed Germany to attain low long-term  interest rates by international standards during the difficult  first few years following reunification. Germany's long-term  interest rates are now 2 percentage points below the long-term  average. Even the most recent interest rate fluctuation proved  to be lower than in most other countries. For the first time in  four years, the interest rates on the German capital market are  lower than those of the United States. This represents a vote  of confidence by the markets for Germany's efforts toward  stabilization as well as future economic developments.    The success of our economic and financial strategy has also  stretched to inflation rates. The IMF as well as the research  institutes expect a fall in inflation to an average of 3 percent  in 1994. During the second half of the year it will fall back  below 3 percent.    However, the IMF will probably have to revise its prognosis  on one point. A growth rate of 0.9 per cent for Germany as a  whole in 1994 is, in view of the almost across-the-board upswing  among the economic indicators, too little. I have therefore  offered IMF director Michel Camdessus a bet that it will be  substantially higher. Now that the research institutes have in  effect joined in this bet with their prediction of 1 percent  growth for western Germany and 1.5 per cent for Germany as a  whole, I am relaxed about the inspection of my estimate at the  end of the year. What Mr. Rexrodt [economic affairs minister]  predicted in his annual economic report will in fact be  bettered; he was right on target with his prediction. [applause]    In the years 1992 to 1994 there was growth, for example,  for eastern Germany of over 26 percent. That can be compared  with the losses in production in the countries of Central and  East Europe. You should just look at the places which have not  had the benefit of the type of aid we have given in the transfer  of funds from West to East. And the people in the former GDR  would be in the same plight as people in Bulgaria and Romania if  your [Social Democratic Party--SPD] policy were in force, and  you should be ashamed if you do not take that into account.  [applause] [passage omitted]    Ladies and gentlemen: Today, Germany and Europe are in  direct  competition with the successful industrial nations of East Asia.  North America has also formed itself into a strong economic bloc  in NAFTA. We must derive our strategy of adaptation from these  international developments. We cannot afford esoteric ideas  based on a national framework. Last December's report on  Germany as an industrial location and the action program for  more growth and jobs show us confronting international  developments. On the other hand, the SPD has nothing to offer  but tired slogans about redistribution of wealth and the 10th  edition of their standard jobs program dating back to the 1970s.    We will only move forward on the narrow path of growth by  setting the right course on tax policy. In the view of the  research institutes there must be no additional burdening of  those who make a special contribution to added value. We mean by  this the so-called higher earners, whom the SPD see as belonging  to an annual income bracket as low as 40,000 to 50,000 German  marks. [passage omitted]    The report of the institutes and the most recent  international meetings underline that we are on the right path.  The initial criticism with regard to an alleged burden on the  world economy arising from reunification is being transformed  more and more into an astonished recognition of what we are  achieving in economic and financial policy in spite of the  unique historic tasks. We can already clearly see the process  of normalization reflected in the statistics. Public sector  deficits, the level of borrowing, growth, the rate of inflation,  and unemployment are at least following the international  average. Often we can show better results that other comparable  industrial nations. [passage omitted]    All the efforts and all the difficult decisions have proven  worthwhile. This is no wishful thinking. The clear figures and  facts of the experts at home and abroad show we are right and  the decision at the federal elections in October will be  determined by these facts.</p>

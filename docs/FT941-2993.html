			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels forced to revise silk quota The European Commission has demonstrated its misjudgement of the scale of European textiles trade with China by changing its quota system governing silk imports only days after it came into force. On Monday a new European Union-wide quota of 20,000 tonnes for Chinese silk, linen and rami was imposed, provoking an immediate uproar from importers who regarded the quota as way below their expectations. The Commission arrived at the 20,000-tonne figure by taking the 1992 trade level of 12,000 tonnes and adding 8,000 tonnes to accommodate growth in the product and newcomers to the market. The quota was originally to be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. But following a meeting this week, past performance will also be taken into account. The first 12,000 tonnes will be granted to companies that were trading in 1992; they will be given a share identical to their 1992 level of imports. The remaining 8,000 tonnes will be shared between companies that have already paid for goods not covered by quota and newcomers. The UK Department of Trade and Industry's import licensing division yesterday began contacting all silk importing companies on its books requiring them to file by 5pm tomorrow returns certifying flows of imported textiles from China.</p>

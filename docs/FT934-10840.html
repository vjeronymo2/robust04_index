			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Futures trade in Europe beats records THE EXPANSION of European futures trading shows no sign of abating, with Europe's leading futures exchanges continuing to set new volume records. Both Liffe in London and the Matif in Paris, Europe's two largest futures exchanges, have already traded more contracts than for the whole of last year. Liffe traded nearly 83m contracts in the first 10 months of 1993, compared with around 72m for 1992 as a whole. The Matif, meanwhile, has traded more than 60m contracts so far, compared with 55m last year. Last month, Liffe traded more than 10m contracts in a single month for the first time, and open interest reached a record level of more than 4m contracts. While the two largest US exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, continue to dominate the market, European exchanges are narrowing the gap.</p>

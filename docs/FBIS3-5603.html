			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans and his wife  will soon visit Vietnam at the invitation of the Vietnamese  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. We bring you a review of  recent development in relations between Vietnam and Holland.    It is the first visit to Vietnam by the Dutch foreign  minister. His visit will contribute to strengthening cooperative  relations between the two countries in all areas. The leaders  can consider future cooperation.    Vietnam and Holland have had established diplomatic  relations  since 1973, but with some interruptions. However, by late of  1993, Holland decided to reopen its embassy in Vietnam. Many  delegations from the two countries have exchanged visits over  the past few years. Holland has developed many goodwill  attitude to Vietnam [as heard]. At the Paris Conference, Holland  was one of the countries which agreed to prolong the time for  Vietnam to pay its debt over a 30 year period. The two  countries have initiated an agreement on investment  encouragement and protection. Vietnam and Holland have also  concluded agreements on air transport and on river and sea  dredging. Holland has a number of projects in Vietnam involving  cooperation and investment. They have effectively cooperated in  the field of health care. Now, they are hoping to cooperate in  infrastructure building. Although Holland ranks the ninth among  the investors in Vietnam, by now it has the 10 investment  projects in Vietnam capitalized at $218 million, including the  joint venture in oil and gas exploration, and another joint  venture in producing Heineken Beer.    With existing relations, the visit to Vietnam this time of  the Dutch foreign minister will surely be a landmark in  relations between the two countries that help bring bilateral  relations to a new level.    The Vietnamese people want to welcome this visit to Vietnam  of the Dutch foreign minister and his wife, and wish it a  success.</p>

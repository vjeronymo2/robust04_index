			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez and Antonio Torres] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- In an  unprecedented action in modern Mexican history, the Army today  held a news conference in which it spoke out for a political  solution that may reestablish peace in Chiapas State.    General Miguel Angel Godinez, commander of the 7th Military  Region, said the Mexican Army is closely following the contacts  between Commissioner [for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas]  Manuel Camacho Solis and the armed groups to find a peaceful  solution to the problem. Godinez asserted that the so-called  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] cannot be called an  "Army" because an army must be an institution and in each  country there is only one.    He criticized the fact that the armed groups cover their  faces with ski masks, "they have no reason to cover up; no  matter how covered up he may be, a soldier will not commit a  crime, therefore, for us, (the EZLN members) are criminals and  transgressors of the law."    Godinez denied that Mexico is at war: "We do not recognize  nor do we accept that the country is in a state of war, because  we are fighting a group that has dedicated itself to committing  armed crimes." He defined the Mexican Army position: "Our  position is for legality, stability, peace, and work; and  their's (of the EZLN) is for breaking the law." "In spite of  the foregoing, we have not persecuted them in the jungle, even  though we more or less know where they are, very close to  Ocosingo, as we prefer that the government handle this problem  politically," he said.    The commander explained that in light of the cease-fire  decreed by the president of the Republic "we remain in the  outskirts of the cities, after having turned over the municipal  palaces and the government offices to the corresponding  authorities." "The instructions from President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari are that the troops leave the cities so the  inhabitants may recover their peace and return as soon as  possible to their normal lives," he said.    However, "we will remain quartered near the cities of Las  Margaritas, Altamirano, Ocosingo, Oxchuc, and San Cristobal de  Las Casas," he advised.    When asked about the alleged human rights violations  committed by the Army, Godinez challenged the accusers to name  the places where they claim there have been "indiscriminate"  bombings against the civilian population. In this respect, he  encouraged all nongovernment organizations to refrain from  criticizing and attacking the Mexican Army given the fact "the  only thing the soldiers have done is to defend themselves from  an aggression against them by a group that has clearly broken  the law."    With respect to those individuals who were supposedly  beaten,  the military officer disclosed that those persons arrested  during the conflict were immediately handed over to agents of  the federal and state Attorney General's Office in order to  avoid any problems with any human rights organizations.  "Therefore, we are quite concerned about such indiscriminate  and inaccurate criticism of the Army and that we fired against  individuals who were only carrying weapons made out of wood, yet  no one condemns those who sent those persons as human shields,"  he lamented. "Now, it would seem that everything bad about  these events has been caused by the Armed Forces."    He immediately referred to the "alleged" death blow [tiro de  gracia] found on some bodies after clashes against the rebel  groups and explained that "when someone is in a trench, the head  is the part of the body that sticks out and that's why helmets  are worn." "Nowadays, any head wound caused by a bullet is being  taken as a death blow," he pointed out.    With respect to the amnesty law benefiting the armed groups,  the military officer indicated the "it is another benefit which  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to implement in  order to reestablish peace and legal order in the region." This  "is evidence of the president's interest in finding and  achieving solutions to this problem by every possible means and  with the least possible cost of human lives."    With respect to the EZLN strategy, the 7th Military Region  commander believes that within this group there are individuals  "who are professionals recruited to train other persons, they  are up to date on guerrilla warfare, and have access to modern  weapons." He explained that "there is another group that has  received military training every weekend, every week, and every  15 days in communities near the jungle region." Another group  includes "supporters responsible for supplying food and  intelligence as well as handling radios," commander Godinez  explained.    Moreover, he explained, there is also another group opposed  to these "outlaws" who are "fortunately a majority. This  group's members were expelled from their communities for  refusing to support criminal activities by donating food of  money."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Clark -- President Ramos yesterday issued a  directive designation the former American military base in  Pampanga as the future site of the country's premier  international airport. [sentence as published]    But the actual development of Clark Air Base, the former  headquarters of the U.S. 13th Air Force, into a commercial  aviation complex will have to wait until 1998 when the effects  of Mount Pinatubo have completely been swept away.    The president said the executive order creating a special  economic zone in Clark came after he approved a masterplan  prepared by a Japanese group for the development of a civilian  commercial aviation complex in the former American military base.    Apart form an airport, the aviation complex will have space  for aircraft maintenance and service facilities, an aircraft  assembly and parts manufacturing plant, and other  aviation-related industries.    To make the airport accessible, the president also revealed  plans for a construction of expressways linking Clark and Subic  as well as Clark and Metro Manila.    The Philippine National Railways (PNR) is also  rehabilitating  its tracks to access Clark which will become the nucleus of a  rail network linking Metro Manila with the northern Luzon areas  particularly the planned Northern Luzon Quadrangle which is  composed of Pangasinan, La Union, the two Ilocos provinces and  Baguio City in Benguet.    The president said the development of Clark as a aviation  complex will help ease congestion at the Ninoy Aquino  International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila.</p>

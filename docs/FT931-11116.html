			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Spring holds out olive branch to unionists MR DICK Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, yesterday said he wanted to meet Northern Ireland's unionist leaders about demands for constitutional change in the republic. But he failed to dispel the belief that formal talks on the province will not re-start for some time. Speaking after an Anglo-Irish conference in London, Mr Spring appeared to offer an olive branch to unionists who insist as a pre-condition for talks that Ireland would, if necessary, amend its territorial claim to Ulster. 'I believe that constitutional change will be necessary,' Mr Spring said. He stopped short of promising that changes would be put to an Irish referendum if agreement was reached on political arrangements in the north. 'At this stage I don't think we want to get bogged down over 'could be' or 'would be'.' He said it was important for dialogue to open but his invitations are unlikely to be accepted by the unionist leaders. Mr Spring also emphasised setting out a lengthy programme of work for the regular Anglo-Irish conferences, held under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement and opposed by unionists because of the role they give Dublin in the affairs of the north. That probably reflected an expectation in London and Dublin that talks will not resume until after May's local elections in the province, which have begun to provoke inter-party rivalries. No proposals have been discussed for a break in the conference meetings  - almost certainly needed if talks were to resume. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the absence of a planned suspension would not be an obstacle if there was a desire for talks to resume. He is likely to meet nationalist and unionist leaders in the province shortly.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Two Signet directors get share options at 32.5p SIGNET GROUP, the jewellery retailing group formerly known as Ratners, yesterday granted two of its directors options on 2.45m shares in the company at 32.5p. Mr James McAdam, executive chairman, was granted 1.48m options, while Mr Lawrence Cooklin, chief executive of the UK jewellery operations, received 970,000. The options can be taken up in 3-10 years, only under certain conditions. The group, which earlier this month reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26.9m for the first half, must have returned to profit. In addition the share price, which yesterday closed up 1 3/4 p at 30 3/4 p, must have averaged 60p for a minimum period of three months. At no time during the three months must the price drop below 50p. However, since preference share dividends are not currently being paid, many analysts believe Signet will need a capital reconstruction. The terms of the options would allow the exercise price of the options and the performance targets to be changed in that eventuality, if the auditors and non-executive directors agreed. The managers might then profit from the share options, even though ordinary shareholders had seen their investment heavily diluted. Signet undertook to grant no further options to existing shareholders for 12 months.</p>

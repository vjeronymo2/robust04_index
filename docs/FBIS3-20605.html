On 17 March, EASTERN EXPRESS reports on page 26 that a new  study by realtor Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) points to further rent  rises and rising capital values in all areas of the Hong Kong  real estate market. The report states that with chronic  shortages of Grade-A office space, especially in Central  district, and an equally serious supply crunch in terms of  high-end accommodation to house incoming executives, office and  residential rents are set to surpass Tokyo. The JLW study says  commercial and office rents rose 40 percent in 1993 and rose  another 10 percent in the first two months of 1994. Residential  rents also surged, with rents rising by between 30 and 70  percent depending on the quality and location of the  accommodation. JLW credits mainland-backed investors with a  23.2-percent share of the HK$57.5 billion of identifiable real  estate transactions in 1993.    The role of PRC-funded firms in stoking the Hong Kong real  estate market has attracted the scrutiny of Chen Yuan, vice  president of the People's Bank of China and son of elder leader  Chen Yun. A report by the Beijing-based press agency ZHONGGUO  XINWEN SHE at 1442 GMT on 17 March cites Chen Yuan declaring his  opposition to speculative activities in the market by PRC-funded  organizations. Highlighting concerns that badly needed capital  is being diverted from China to earn quick profits in Hong Kong,  Chen Yuan stated that China faced a shortage of foreign exchange  and construction capital, and he had a "disapproving attitude"  towards PRC-funded entities speculating in the Hong Kong real  estate market. However, Chen Yuan said that it was normal for  PRC-funded enterprises in Hong Kong to buy office buildings and  residences for their staff, adding that the Bank of China ran  its banking business in Hong Kong independently, determining its  scale of mortgage lending according to the market situation.  Chen Yuan also noted that the People's Bank of China was not  paying any special attention to the issue.    Meanwhile, Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong  Kong  and Macao Affairs Office, has also commented on the role of  PRC-funded companies in the real estate market. Speaking to a  group of Hong Kong delegates to the National People's Congress,  ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese at 1400 GMT on 17 March reported  Lu Ping saying that China-funded enterprises should refrain from  actions detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.  Expanding on this, Lu said that these firms should not engage  in real estate trading activities and that, as they were using  state funds, they had an unfair advantage over other market  players.  <H5>  OTHER ISSUES: </H5>   Golden Resources Sets Up Rice Processing Venture in Vietnam    Golden Resources Development has taken a 55 percent stake in  a $10 million joint venture in Vietnam to process and trade  rice. Hong Kong's biggest rice distributor has signed a 50-year  joint venture agreement with the four major rice producing  provinces in Vietnam: Long An, Dong Thap, Tien Giang, and An  Giang, which together account for 40 percent of the country's  production. Vietnam's trade representative in Hong Kong, Huynh  Minh Hue, said the venture was the largest of its kind so far.  Golden Resources' share of the investment would be used to  build a processing plant and to provide working capital. The  managing director of Golden Resources, David Lam, said the  company hoped to raise the quality of Vietnamese rice, so  achieving higher prices on the world market.

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Hindus defy temple court order HINDU militants last night defied a court order to stop building a Hindu temple at the disputed site of Ayodhya, hours after the Indian government had survived its first no-confidence motion. Mr Narasimha Rao's government yesterday survived the no-confidence vote by a comfortable margin of 52 votes. However, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, president of the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accused the government of adopting a 'confrontational attitude' and announced that Monday would be observed nation-wide as 'Ayodhya Day', to agitate for the completion of the temple.</p>

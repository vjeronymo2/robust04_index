			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fedway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  court was concerned that ATF enforcement actions could hinder legitimate competitive activities. Consequently, the opinion states that if ATF suspects a particular practice places retailer independence at risk then the agency must provide substantial support backing up its suspicion. This substantial support is especially necessary where the anticompetitive nature of the means to induce is ``nowhere apparent on its face.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factual or substantive proof is necessary, the court stated, to ensure that the Government does not take an overly-broad enforcement posture in its efforts to prevent potential threats to retailer independence and risk outlawing conduct that fosters a competitive alcohol market. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fedway <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proceeding, the court held this factual basis was not met because the only datum or evidence presented was the fact that certain retailers purchased less of a rival product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the court offered the following guidance about this statutory element: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Congress, we are satisfied, used ``exclusion'' to indicate placement of retailer independence at risk by means of a ``tie'' or ``link'' between the wholesaler and the retailer or by any other means of wholesaler control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [We demand] a factual showing that retailer independence is potentially threatened. .&blank;.&blank;. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [ATF should] take reasonable account of both policy interests underlying the [trade practice] provisions. .&blank;.&blank;. that the alcohol industry requires special oversight and regulation. .&blank;.&blank;. and the value of pro-competitive wholesale promotions. This value derives not only from the traditional benefits of competition in terms of lower prices and improved quality, but also .&blank;.&blank;. from the fact that a competitive alcohol market helps deter the formation of a corrupt black market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in arriving at a reasonable interpretation of ``exclusion''.&blank;.&blank;. the Bureau must take care to distinguish rationally between those promotions it decides are lawful and those it decides are not. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

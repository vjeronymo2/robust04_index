			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BIG I' COMPLAINT  </P> <P> I'm sure the architect of downtown's First Interstate World Center is shocked  that this landmark architectural achievement has been so irresponsibly  cheapened by First Interestate's corporate ego and greed displayed ever so  bluntly by the four "Big I" logos recently stuck on the crown of the building.  </P> <P> I think it's safe to assume that by now the public knows that the tallest  building on the West Coast, is recognized internationally as Los Angeles' first  major contribution to contemporary architecture.  </P> <P> It is obvious to anyone that the seemingly arbitrarily placed "Big I" signs  don't belong on this building.  </P> <P> First Interstate had an opportunity to present itself with class. Instead, it  overstated itself, cheapened a beautiful building, and has angered many in the  community. If First Interstate truly wants to make a contribution to Los  Angeles, it should begin by removing the four "Big I's."  </P> <P> DAVID WALKER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

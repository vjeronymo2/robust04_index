			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / German road users braced for new taxes GERMANY'S car-centred, road-ruled society is working itself up into a state of acute alarm over the prospect of some swingeing new taxes and tolls on road users - regardless of denials by the government. Shares of all the large motor manufacturers lost ground on the Frankfurt stock exchange yesterday, as the rumour mill was kept working by newspaper and television reports on the impending oil products tax increase, and a national road toll. Porsche lost DM14.50 (Pounds 5), Daimler-Benz DM11.50, BMW DM9.50 and VW DM8.20. The speculation has been brought to a head by the imminent decision in the German cabinet on reform of the ailing railway system - the Bundesbahn in the west and the Reichsbahn in the east - and the need to find an important new source of finance to pay off its past debts and current losses. In spite of the insistence by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, that no new tax increases are planned before the next election, press speculation is rife that a big increase in the oil products tax is inevitable. What is rather more likely is the re-introduction of a road toll, and an autobahn permit for road users, following the rejection by the European Court of Justice this year of a first draft to penalise foreign road hauliers. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, insisted yesterday no proposals for tax reform were on the agenda for the cabinet meeting tomorrow, when rail reform plans are due to be decided. He underlined that Mr Gunther Krause, the minister of transport, was personally opposed to any general oil tax. That was supposed to scotch speculation about an oil tax increase, which would put 10 pfennig on the price of a litre of petrol, according to the mass circulation Bild am Sonntag newspaper. That would be the equivalent of a 14 per cent rise in the price of the lowest cost grade of petrol. Mr Krause is on the record, however, as being in favour of re-introducing some form of general road toll. He said in a weekend interview with Der Spiegel, the news magazine, that an autobahn toll for domestic and foreign lorries would probably be introduced by 1993, and for cars by around 1995-96. He said that the annual toll for lorries would cost up to a maximum DM9,000 as was already intended in the original 1990 proposal outlawed by the EC. Other reports suggest a car tax of between DM200 and DM400. The question is whether such proposals will come near to meeting the extraordinary needs of the German Bundesbahn, which is this year expected to show a loss of around DM11bn, much of it in interest payments on accumulated debts of around DM45bn. The backlog amounts to twice the Bundesbahn's DM20bn annual turnover. The reform plan before the cabinet would turn the railways into an independent shareholding company, Deutsche Eisenbahn AG, although not with private shareholders to begin with. As a result, its accounts would be more transparent, and its staff would cease to be classified as civil servants. World stock markets, Page 33</p>

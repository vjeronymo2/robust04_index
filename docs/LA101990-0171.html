			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> 23 HURT IN COLLEGE DORM BLAZE  </P> <P> Two students were in critical condition with burns after an early morning fire  today that injured at least 23 students in a dormitory at San Jose State  University.  </P> <P> Four students were in serious condition, including one who suffered a broken  back jumping from a third-story window.  </P> <P> At least seven were treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries in the  blaze that forced more than 160 students out of Andrew Moulder Hall.  </P> <P> "I opened the door, and fumes and smoke entered the room, and people started  shouting 'Fire! Fire!' It was very wild," said Jorg Stoka, a bathrobe-clad  German exchange student who lives on the second floor of the three-story brick  dormitory downtown.  </P> <P> The fire was reported shortly before 6 a.m. and put out within an hour. The  cause was unknown but it was believed to have started on the third floor of the  east wing.  </P> <P> Most Moulder Hall students, many wearing bathrobes and slippers, had no time to  grab any possessions as they fled their building.  </P> <P> "You just get out of there. You don't think," said junior Jana Garrett.  </P></p>

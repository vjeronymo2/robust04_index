			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Statement of intent: Pretoria's ambitious economic programme A Pounds 2bn bid for a military helicopter contract; a recipe for vitamin-enriched bread; and a trade union federation's development fund: all are part of a new national mission in South Africa, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). With the death of both apartheid and the socialist vision of the African National Congress, the RDP is being promoted as the country's path to political stability and economic growth. It is now so powerful and pervasive a feature of South African life, that scarcely any large initiative, in the private or public sector, is launched without ritual reference to the plan. International donors talk of promoting the programme, the corporate sector spells out how its plans gel with the RDP's goals, and educational institutions frame their mission in terms of developing the necessary human capital to implement the RDP. However, behind this enthusiasm lies widespread confusion over exactly what the programme involves. Most people would probably say the RDP was primarily a state-sponsored initiative to provide jobs and houses for the very poor - casting an eye at the R37.5bn over five years that the government has budgeted to promote everything from school feeding schemes to new water plants in rural areas. But important though these high-profile initiatives are, they are only part of a much larger programme. The white paper on the RDP, recently presented to parliament, sets out the programme's five broad goals as meeting basic needs, such as jobs, land and housing; developing human resources through education and training; promoting economic growth; completing the democratisation process; and establishing the government structure and capacity to implement these aims. As Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister without portfolio who has the task of overseeing the programme, is fond of pointing out, the RDP is intended to do more than build a few extra schools and clinics. 'It is not a set of ad hoc projects on the ground,' he said last month. 'It is not about government centralising power in its own hands. It is about the fundamental transformation of government and society.' The economic policies that are being adopted to meet these aims have been widely applauded both domestically and abroad. Although the programme includes several state-led initiatives, the bulk of the RDP will be driven by the private sector. The commitments to nationalisation and socialist policies that infused earlier drafts of the programme, when it was part of the ANC's electoral campaign, have been jettisoned. So, too, have the references, side-by-side, to free enterprise, frugality and high-spending, inflationary policies. The ANC-led administration has instead committed itself to cutting the budget deficit, is pushing ahead with privatisation, and has proven highly supportive of the Reserve Bank's unpopular policy of high interest rates - aimed at keeping a rein on inflation. Indeed, the new government has become so staunch a defender of economic discipline that it has been charged by some of its constituents with being too right wing. Deputy Finance Minister Alec Erwin's response to these charges has been that 'fiscal and monetary discipline as an instrument to achieve objectives may mean that, like (former UK prime minister) Mrs Thatcher, we use a stove to cook a meal, but ours is a very different meal: it is one that we all will share and enjoy the quality of the cooking.' While such high hopes for the gains from economic discipline are thought to be realistic by many observers, they worry that other elements of the RDP may not be. The white paper's commitment to increasing civil service productivity and cutting the number of state employees appears Herculean. A recent analysis by the Johannesburg-based Centre for Policy Studies concludes that, given the pressure on the government to deliver improved conditions and the difficulty of retrenching white bureau-crats, meeting these goals is likely to prove impossible. Even more problematic is the question of project implementation, dealt with only briefly in the white paper. Local authorities are to be given a management role in everything from the provision of houses to new schools. In practice, however, local government remains chaotic in much of the country as a result of widespread rent and service boycotts; establishing effective local government structures could take years. 'The RDP at this stage is very abstract. It deals with the framework but not delivery,' said Mr Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, responsible for the running of local government elections planned for next year. It is the idealism that underlies the programme that seems to have generated this weakness, as well as the programme's strengths. The RDP is essentially a revolutionary plan drawn up by a new government with a burning vision of the country it wants to build, and a strong desire to deliver tangible results from the destruction of apartheid: hence the broad scope of the RDP, and its adoption as a national crusade by all the political parties in government. Rather than being a policy document over which political opponents disagree, the RDP has become a statement of aims within which most policy disputes are taking place. Thus the debate on interest rates is framed as a discussion over whether higher interest rates will promote the RDP. The same is true in business. During a recent car industry strike, employers defended their low wage offers as necessary to free funds for capital expenditure in support of the RDP, while workers' organisations argued that under the RDP they should be receiving improved training and better conditions. The programme's elevation to national mission has also raised the prospect that those who stray from its premises will be purged. There have already been calls for various senior civil servants to be dismissed for being 'anti-RDP'; an official at the Development Bank of South Africa was fired following charges that he tried to sabotage the programme. However, the government seems under no illusions about what will ultimately determine the success of the RDP. It is economic growth that will make or break the programme. The danger will lie in trying to deliver too much too soon.</p>

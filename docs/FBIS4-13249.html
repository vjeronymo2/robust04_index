			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and  minister of state for cabinet affairs, received in his office  this morning the Lebanese media delegation accompanying Nabih  Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies.    At the outset of the meeting, Dr. al-'Anani welcomed the  delegation members and reviewed with them the distinguished  Jordanian-Lebanese relations on various levels as well as the  recent developments aimed at putting pressure on Jordan and  weakening its position.    Al-'Anani stressed Jordan's constant principles of not  concluding separate deals or violating the Arab consensus. He  reasserted that Jordan will not seek any gains at the expense of  any other Arab state. He also reviewed the economic pressures  being put on Jordan, particularly the continued siege on the  port of al-'Aqabah.    Al-'Anani emphasized that Jordan will not budge from its  consistent and principled position, and that Jordan's  participation in the peace talks is contingent upon finding a  solution to the method of searches concerning the port of  al-'Aqabah. He stressed Jordan's eagerness to coordinate with  all parties concerned with the peace process in order to adopt a  firm Arab position, so a just and comprehensive peace settlement  would be achieved. Such a settlement would guarantee the rights  of all, he added.</p>

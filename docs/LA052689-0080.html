			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> You know how it is with celebrities: The bigger they get, the more they must be  isolated from the curious public.  </P> <P> So it is with Grunt, the 800-pound porker who received nationwide attention  last month when it was revealed that he faced death because his owners had  abandoned him in Rolling Hills Estates. More than 400 people, including an  Australian man, subsequently offered to take in the big swine.  </P> <P> The county eventually sent him to the 193-acre ranch of Ozzie Osborn (no  relation to the singer) in Santa Paula. Santa Paula isn't known for excitement,  but since the pig's arrival, there have been so many gawkers that the family  has been forced to place Grunt temporarily in a large coop.  </P> <P> "You never know what could happen with some stranger," said Osborn's wife,  Rhonda. "We'll turn him loose when all the hubbub dies down. But in the  meantime, he has a nice mudhole in there."  </P> <P> She said Grunt pays no attention to visitors unless they "have something to  feed him."  </P> <P> Oh, maybe one other thing would put Grunt in hog heaven.  </P> <P> "My husband," said Osborn, "is thinking of buying a female for him."  </P> <P> Looks as though strike negotiators for the Los Angeles City Board of Education  ignored the advice of astrologer Joyce Jillson, whose at-large forecast to the  world on Wednesday said in part:  </P> <P> "Don't try to negotiate unless you have all the strength. Students and  employees may get the better of their supervisors."  </P> <P> It was Ditch Day at Caltech Thursday, the annual opportunity for underclassmen  to show off their skills in such games as the old  Assemble-the-Automobile-Parts-on-My-Doorstep-Into-a-Functioning-Chevrolet-Engine  trick.  </P> <P> Combining the best (and worst) of "Star Wars" and "Animal House," the event  also enables seniors to let off steam from the pressure of academics. What they  do is lock up their rooms in imaginative ways and challenge their inferiors to  unravel the secret of gaining entry.  </P> <P> The engine, for instance, had to be assembled because only when it was turned  on could exhaust be directed into a tube that would trigger the opening  mechanism on the dormitory door.  </P> <P> Not all the puzzles required complex thinking.  </P> <P> Students at Page Hall dormitory were challenged to break through a front door  covered on the outside with layers of plaster, plywood, and steel plating, and  on the inside with layers of concrete, wood and steel -- by 5 p.m.  </P> <P> "Apparently," Caltech spokesman Bob Finn said, "no one had lived in the room  for the last few weeks."  </P> <P> Using such scientific instruments as blow torches, the students bore in only as  far as the concrete, which contained a shaving cream can that blew up in their  faces.  </P> <P> A flag flap looms in a Lakewood development.  </P> <P> Real estate agent Becky Turner, who places miniature American flags on the  front lawn of Lakewood Gardens residences each Memorial Day, sent out a note to  the inhabitants declaring that she would repeat the custom even though "I have  been asked by another Realtor not to do the Memorial Day flags . . . as he  plans to do them." She questioned whether others were trying to "commercialize"  Memorial Day.  </P> <P> However, Dave Emerson, the other agent who plans to plant flags there, contends  that he made no such request of Turner, adding, "I don't think you can have too  many flags."  </P> <P> Residents will have no trouble figuring out who their benefactors are, since  the agents attach their names to the flags.  </P> <P> If Malibu does become an incorporated city, will the beach colony change its  name so as to break with its past? Perhaps to erase the memory of such recent  jokes as Johnny Carson's observation that residents were offering to pay for  valet parking for the homeless and provide free sun block?  </P> <P> Well, the marquee at the Malibu Inn and Restaurant on Thursday suggested a new  dateline:  </P> <P> "Hullabaloo, Calif."  </P></p>

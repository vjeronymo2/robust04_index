			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Tarmac to promote pioneering scheme TARMAC intends to train unemployed people in building skills while constructing a training advice centre at Middlesbrough. The centre is designed expressly to teach new trades to people who are out of work. The commitment to take people from the dole queue and to retrain them to work in the building industry is a condition of the Pounds 3.5m contract awarded to Tarmac Construction. The build-and-train scheme has been agreed between Tarmac and a consortium of the Department of Employment's Job Match, Middlesbrough City Challenge and Middlesbrough Borough Council using 'inner city' regeneration funds from the Government and Enterprise Commission. The year-long building programme, taking up to 30 trainees, starts this month. The training advice development centre at Berwick Hills, Middlesbrough, will be built for TAD, a company which has been formed by the Borough Council and Middlesbrough Training Economic Council. People without jobs and who live within the regeneration area of the city, which covers a five mile radius, will be selected by Job Match, and trained in such skills as bricklaying, plumbing, painting, electrical installation, and clerical administration as the centre is built. Under the scheme, which has the character of a pilot scheme, trainees will be paid out of public funds. The expectation is that course members will be trained up to national vocation qualification part two standard. The hope is that after the scheme they will be fully qualified to work on other construction projects. The three-storey centre will boast training and advisory facilities, as well as a restaurant, creche, conference hall and administrative offices at ground level. Hotel-style en suite rooms will provide residential accommodation on the upper two floors.</p>

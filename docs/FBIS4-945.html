			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Full-page advertisments by the National Party accompanied </F> by large photos of the people being quoted]    [Text][First advertisement] I'm a car mechanic and I'm  voting National Party [NP].    My name is Darius Mokori, I am a car mechanic and I am going  to vote for the National Party.    So are hundreds of other young, self-employed people like  me,  who are struggling to keep their small businesses going.    I work with my brother Aron, who is also going to vote NP --  and we specialise in panel beating and respray jobs.    I worked for other people for 14 years -- mostly in big  garages -- and I saw the damage that the ANC and their friends  do to businesses, particularly the car business. There were  strikes and stay aways and sanctions -- and now hardly any cars  are made in this country, and many good repairing firms have  gone out of business.    Finally I was made redundant last year and I decided to set  up on my own. It is a struggle -- but I know it will be easier  for me if the NP win, than if the ANC do.    You see, the NP believe in business -- the ANC do not.    The NP want people to succeed -- because that way they will  make money and jobs for people and then we can all afford the  things this country needs -- like schools and hospitals.    The ANC do not want people to be successful -- they want  strikes and stay-aways. If you make any money, they will want  try to take it away from you with heavy taxes. They will be  corrupt like the rest of Africa.    The fact is they are not ready for power. They are promising  too much -- and they know they can't deliver. And they are  trying to bully people and force everyone into line. Step out  of line and they persecute you and threaten you and beat you up.    I know hundreds of people who are going to vote for the NP,  but are just too scared to say so. As soon as the comrades find  out, they approach you in the street and say they will necklace  you.    But the vote is secret -- so threats won't stop us voting  for  the NP.    I have big dreams for the future. I want to educate myself  more. I want to study more about paint technology. I want to  build up my business. These are the sort of dreams many young  men have for the future.    So I ask myself: Who is best for education -- the NP who  will build it up, or the ANC who have destroyed it for black  people?    And I ask myself: Who is best for business -- the NP who  will build it up, or the ANC who have destroyed it?    The only answer I can come up with to help me make my dreams  come true -- is the NP.    BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE    Vote for F.W. De Klerk and the new National Party    We've made the change    [Second advertisement]I am a teacher and I'm voting National  Party.    My name is Winnie and I'm going to vote for the National  Party. So are hundreds of other black teachers like me. We  will not be intimidated.    Now we have the vote, we must put aside the past, and vote  on  one thing: Who will give us -- all of us -- the best future?    The answer is the NP.    I am a mother of two young boys; and like all mothers, I  wonder what the future will bring for them.    I know for certain that their future will be a lot better  under the National Party, than it ever would be under the ANC.    Only the NP has the strength and experience to run the  country. The ANC can't. They just don't have the experience.    I have been teaching in a High School in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region for 17 years and, in that  time I have seen the ANC and their friends destroy the education  of a whole generation of township children.    It makes me so angry, because children are the future of  this  country.    The ANC are promising that everyone will have free education  -- but how on earth are they going to afford it? They have no  hope of delivering on their promises.    The NP has a proper plan to get the money to build factories  and businesses, so that the jobs will come -- and then we will  be able to build the schools and hospitals we need.    That way ALL our children will get the best affordable  education, and we will be able to make the most of their gifts.    Also the ANC don't understand democracy -- to them there is  only their point of view. No one else is allowed an opinion.  They are autocrats.    I try to teach my children to think for themselves. This is  vital if we are to have a proper democracy in this country.    A lot of people say that their hearts are telling them to  vote for the ANC. I tell them that their hearts are for  emotion. This election is not about emotion. It is about the  future, our future. Our children's future.    And only one party can deliver that: The NP.    BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE    Vote for F.W. De Klerk and the new National Party    We've made the change.</p>

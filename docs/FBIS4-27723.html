			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Russian  scientists are keen to serve Malaysia in various fields of  advanced technology, Minister of Science, Technology and  Environment Law Hieng Ding said Monday.    The fields involved would be those in which Malaysia has  vacancies or lacked expertise such as in bio-technology,  information technology, electronics, advanced manufacturing and  aerospace, he told reporters after talks with visiting Russian  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets.    Due to the good response from the Russian scientists, the  ministry would discuss and verify their qualifications with  their Ministry of Science before accepting them, said Law.  Malaysian and Russian research institutions had also been  co-operating well and six Malaysian research officers were now  in Moscow, he said.    On the desludging activities of ships and tankers in the  Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea which endangered the  livelihood of Malaysian fishermen and spoilt the country's  beaches, Law said his ministry had expressed its concern over  this at the recent meeting of the commission on sustainable  development.    As more than 360 vessels ply the Straits of Malacca and the  South China Sea daily, there is an urgent need to take all  necessary measures regarding the disposal of tanker sludge, he  said.    Detailed discussions had been held with the International  Maritime Organisation (IMO) Director William O'Neil so that IMO  could address the problem, he said.    In this way, the IMO could help safeguard the interests of  littoral states like Malaysia, Law added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. HUD may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procurement Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.40  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose of procurement standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 84.41 through 84.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by HUD upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.41  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Recipient responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to HUD, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.42  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Codes of conduct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.43  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. The other factors shall include the bidder's or offeror's compliance with Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), hereafter referred to as ``Section 3.'' Section 3 provides that, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws, and regulations, economic opportunities generated by certain HUD financial assistance shall be directed to low- and very low-income persons. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.44  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Procurement procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

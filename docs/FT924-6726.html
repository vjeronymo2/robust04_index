			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Clinton meets Bush in White House PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday arrived in Washington for a private White House meeting with President George Bush and what Mr Clinton described as 'a candid assessment of world affairs'. Particularly at issue is the degree of co-operation that Mr Clinton can expect from President Bush in the run-up to the presidential inauguration in January. In fact, Bush has promised the full cooperation of his administration, and Clinton has praised the president's helpfulness. Nonetheless, Mr Clinton planned to spend just 55 minutes with the president. Republican congressional leaders have served notice on Governor Bill Clinton that they intend to act as his chaperons on his presidential honeymoon. But although Mr Clinton says he prefers to 'dance with the one that brung you', he may be tempted from time to time to flirt with his escorts. Party divisions are rarely clear in the US, and many presidents have governed with shifting congressional coalitions. Many Republicans are now hinting that they could be receptive to President-elect Clinton on some issues, especially if he sticks to the centrist views that he has espoused as governor, rather than the more liberal doctrines of his presidential campaign. That is particularly so of some of his fellow-governors, many of whom have worked with him during his years running Arkansas. 'We will be as supportive as we can with the new president. He can be assured that this group will not take any cheap shots,' said Governor George Voinovich, president of the Republican Governors' Association. Mr Voinovich says the number one problem most governors face is the federal government's habit of issuing new mandates to the states without giving them any additional money. 'We take consolation from the fact that he is a governor. He certainly understands our concern about mandates without money.' Governor Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who co-chaired a governors' taskforce on education with Mr Clinton but who has fought him tooth and nail over the last six months as head of Mr Bush's re-election campaign in the South, also takes a conciliatory line. 'Everybody likes Bill. . . There are areas where we can get out there and support him, and we should,' Mr Campbell said. But Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, warns that he has no plans to give Mr Clinton an easy ride. 'The American people want him to succeed, but I have never thought as a Republican that it was our obligation just to give up. Don't expect Bob Dole to hand over the keys of the place without a fight,' he said this week.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Kirin chiefs on charges of paying gangsters JAPANESE police yesterday arrested four executives of Kirin Brewery, the country's leading beer and food maker, on charges of making illegal payments to gangsters. Kirin is alleged to have paid about Y33m (Pounds 203,700) to gangsters to ensure order at their shareholders' meeting held last March. It is common for gangsters to appear at shareholders' meetings to ask awkward questions and embarrass a company's board. Corporate payments to stop disruption of shareholders' meetings are seen as an easy source of income. However, the police have been tightening their grip over such violations of the commercial code. Last October, Mr Masatoshi Ito, the president of Ito-Yokado, a leading retailer which also controls Southland of the US, was forced to resign following arrests of company executives who had allegedly made illegal payments of over Y27m to gangsters. The police yesterday also arrested eight members of Rondan Doyukai, a gangster group also linked to the Ito-Yokado case. They said the payments to Rondan allowed Kirin to conclude its most recent shareholders' meeting in March within 24 minutes. The arrests come ahead of the government's scheduled reform of the commercial code in October aimed at providing more information to shareholders and making it easier for shareholders to sue corporate management. Many companies fear that the changes could encourage gangsters to threaten corporations.</p>

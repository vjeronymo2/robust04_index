			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.K., Ma.S., and K.B.: "Officially, Nothing </F> Happened"]    [Text] Contrary to earlier statements by politicians of  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak did not forward on Wednesday [23 March] a motion to the  president requesting the appointment of Dariusz Rosati to the  post of deputy prime minister and finance minister. In a  morning radio program, the prime minister stated that he must  meet with the candidate once again.    "One or two days are not a problem," he said.    "The agreements reached on Tuesday with the prime minister  are still binding, and they will be acted upon until the end of  the week." This was how Zbigniew Siemiatkowski summed up the  events of the entire day. "The issue is very serious, and haste  is not very advisable."    According to the prime minister, it should be explained once  again "whether Mr. Rosati shares our views on structural  issues." Since Professor Rosati is in Geneva, the organization  of such a meeting will take some time, stated the Prime  Minister's Press Secretary, Ewa Wachowicz.    After the evening meeting of coalition authorities on  Tuesday, Aleksander Kwasniewski reported that the prime minister  had given assurances to the participants of the meeting that he  would forward the motion concerning Rosati to the Belweder on  Wednesday.    "Some people tell me what I should do, as well as what I say  and what I should say," the prime minister commented on this on  Wednesday morning.    He also added that the procedure of the appointment of  Rosati  had been complicated by some statements of politicians; the  advancing of the date of forwarding the appointment motion was  termed "slightly humorous" by him.    SLD leaders, obviously taken aback and angry, tried to  minimize in their official statements the absence of a decision  by the prime minister.    "Well, just a slight delay that will soon be explained,"  said  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski in the afternoon. The situation was  similarly assessed by Speaker Jozef Oleksy. The issue of  forwarding the appointment motion was discussed at a session of  the SLD Club, which was closed to the press (the date of the  session was agreed upon earlier; the deputies were supposed to  sum up the activities of the government and the coalition).    "The decision has already been made, and there is no reason  that there should be any delay in forwarding the motion to the  Belweder," said Aleksander Kwasniewski before the session of the  club, thus maintaining his earlier stand. He added that  "everything in this issue will be explained." During that time,  Jerzy Szmajdzinski tried to reach the prime minister on the  phone. At a break in the session, at approximately 1900,  Kwasniewski began phoning the prime minister; he refused to make  any comments until that talk. As Siemiatkowski said, in the  evening, Kwasniewski was in constant contact with the government  leadership. The SLD leader, however, still refused to issue any  information.    The press spokesman gave assurances that the motion  requesting Rosati's appointment was a matter of days. He said  that the prime minister's delay had been caused by the desire to  meet the president personally. However, SLD politicians do not  see a reason that any further talks with the SLD candidate  should be conducted.    Yesterday's reactions by SLD politicians and the atmosphere  in the club were very similar to the days of the greatest  government crisis and the Borowski-Pawlak dispute.   <H5>    Strak: Decision After Easter </H5>   Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers  [URM], stated at a meeting with journalists of the regional  press that there is no need to turn the appointment of Dariusz  Rosati into a sensation. "There is no reason for taking any  violent steps," he argued and added that the delay in appointing  the new finance minister does not threaten the Polish economy  with any catastrophe. "We have not had the head of this ministry  for a few weeks now, and there is nothing bad happening with the  economy."    The statement by Minister Strak suggested that Dariusz  Rosati  will be appointed finance minister, but it will be after Easter.  "It is better to wait a while than make hasty decisions," the  URM head explained. Asked by RZECZPOSPOLITA whether he believes  there are reasons to believe that the president will reject  Rosati's candidacy, he gave a negative answer.    Finance Deputy Minister Henryk Chmielak stated that "the  main  theses and directions of the program presented by Prof. Rosati  are in accordance with what the present government is doing."  However, there are no details concerning the rate of the  changes, and this is where differences of opinions may appear.    Even though he was awaited by journalists of the regional  press on Wednesday, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak did not show  up at the meeting. He stayed longer than expected in Siedlce,  where he took part in the funeral of his office chief, Andrzej  Piwowarczyk. On the previous day, at the session of the  coalition, he announced, however, that he would organize a press  conference on Wednesday. This was the only piece of information  he passed to journalists after the coalition talks on the  candidacy of Rosati.  <H5>  What Does the Candidate Say? </H5>   A few Wednesday statements concerning the candidacy of Prof.  Dariusz Rosati: Prime Minister Pawlak for "Sygnaly Dnia" ["The  Signals of the Day"]--about the need of several days for  additional contact; by representatives of voivodship authorities  of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who are afraid of the  continuation of the state's financial policy that has been  conducted so far; and by Acting Finance Minister Henryk  Chmielak, who stated that the program presented by Rosati does  not contain any details and methods of implementation of its  goals--suggest that the candidate is still controversial,  despite the PSL-SLD coalition meeting. Therefore,  RZECZPOSPOLITA asked the candidate himself whether he still  wants to become deputy prime minister and finance minister.    "Prime Minister Pawlak and I have agreed that I will receive  the final answer by the end of last week. I treat this  situation quietly, even though I am considering various  possibilities, including the one that I may resign. I am  waiting for a signal because that was the agreement," we were  told by Prof. Rosati.    As of Wednesday afternoon, no one from the prime minister's  entourage had gotten in touch with the candidate. The question  whether the delaying of the decision may be related to the  Senate debate over the budget, in which also the issue of  financing the Food Industry Bank and the restructurization of  the sugar industry are discussed, were left by Prof. Rosati  without a comment. "However, there is certainly some reason for  the delay," he said.</p>

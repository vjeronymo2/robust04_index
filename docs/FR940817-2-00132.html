			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, he has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David E. Trawick, D.D.S.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Docket No. 88&hyph;69, 53 FR 5326 (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this proceeding factors, two, four and five apply. Respondent allowed an unauthorized person to use his DEA number to order controlled substances for dispensing and administering controlled substances at an unregistered location. Respondent allowed the clinic's owner to acquire and dispense controlled substances through the use of Respondent's DEA registration number. Under the circumstances, Respondent knew or should have known that the clinic's owner would use his DEA number, not only for ordering, dispensing and issuing prescriptions for controlled substances, but also for administering during unauthorized abortions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By allowing an unregistered and unauthorized person to use his DEA number, Respondent was responsible for any use and misuse of that number. Moreover, such a violation is aggravated by the fact that Respondent allowed a non-practitioner to use his DEA number at an unregistered location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BC2901230, previously issued to Anthony L. Cappelli, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they are, denied. This order is effective September 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 11, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

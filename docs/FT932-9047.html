			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Weak krona lifts Sandvik sales by 27% SANDVIK, the Swedish speciality steel and engineering group, stands by a prediction of improved results for 1993 following a 3 per cent rise in first-quarter profits to SKr486m (USDollars 65.76m). The company said the downturn in European demand was more severe than expected but this was offset by a further weakening of the krona. Sales rose 27 per cent to SKr5.27bn, thanks to the weak krona, but were down 3 per cent excluding exchange rate movements. Group orders rose to SKr5.66bn from SKr4.48bn. Last year Sandvik reported a SKr1.53bn profit, down 20 per cent on 1991's SKr1.92bn.</p>

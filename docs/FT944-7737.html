			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Appld Holographics The postponement of orders from some Japanese customers contributed to increased losses at Applied Holographics in the six months to September 30. In addition CFC AH, the US joint venture, failed to achieve its planned profits. The shares lost 15p to close at 83p. On turnover up 12 per cent from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 3.39m pre-tax losses were Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 60,000) after taking a share of Pounds 125,000 (Pounds 71,000) of the joint venture loss. Losses per share came out at 1.4p (0.29p). The USM-quoted company, which supplies holographic film, hoped the deferred business would benefit the second half. The joint venture arrangement had been reorganised so the US partner would be fully responsible for funding and bear any losses after October 1 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Over the past few days security agencies have  released a considerable number of detainees in response to  pressure from Islamic Action Front [IAF] desputies. The IAF  deputies met Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali more than a  week ago and presented him with a memorandum that spelled out  the IAF's view on the recent wave of arrests, and including a  list of the detainees. The exact number of those that were  released is not known.    Deputy Hamzah Mansur told AL-BILAD that two al-Ahliyah  [National] University students were released, as well as  'Abd-al-Majid Diyah, an IAF leader in Amman's fifth electoral  district. An al-Rysayfah youth and a University of Jordan  student were also released.    Asked by AL-BILAD whether the Islamic Resistance Movement,  Hamas, in Jordan, or other Islamic groups, were officially asked  by the government to keep a low profile in light of the recent  U.S. and Israeli escalation, Hamzah Mansur said he had not met  any Hamas representatives in Jordan over the past few days and  had no idea about any government demand in this connection.  [passage omitted]    Regarding the recent U.S.-Israeli threats, Mansur said U.S.  decision making is linked with the decisions of the Israeli  Foreign Ministry. The Zionist administration in Palestine is  confused and does not know how to act. Imagine its reaction if  the 'Afula and Hadera operations been launched via the Jordan  River.    Mansur added: If the government wants to say that Hamas has  no organization on Jordanian territory, this is acceptable.  However, if our government wants to bridle those who speak  about our people's suffering and the operations in Palestine,  then it is wrong, because each Jordanian citizen talks about the  operations inside Palestine and the suffering of its people.    Mansur added: With all due respect to the government, the  current situation might warrant the government's reconsideration  of its program and formation. Until this happens, I demand that  the government think primarily of how to be a truthful image of  this people, which has a great measure of pride and self-esteem.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of  the National Unification Board, said that the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks are likely to be held next week when the  International Atomic Energy Agency begins additional inspections  of North Korea.    In a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors today, Deputy  Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku predicted that positive progress  [kungjongjogin chinjon] will be made in resolving the nuclear  issue in the coming week and stressed: Although the replacement  of fuel rods has been postponed, the sampling [sonjong],  preservation [pogwan], and special measurement [tuksu kyechuk]  of samples must be conducted without fail.    Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: The government will no longer  emphasize the importance of holding South-North dialogue ahead  of U.S.-North Korean talks [sonhu kwangye-e chipchakhaji anul  kosimyo], and is now focusing on North Korea's guarantee of  nuclear transparency in resolving the issue.    He stressed: The ROK and the United States firmly share the  view that if North Korea possesses even half a nuclear weapon,  it would be regarded as an act of nullifying the joint  declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Arts: The Power behind the clubs - Garry Booth talks to the new owner of the Jazz Cafe Powerhaus and Mean Fiddler - both descriptions have been applied to Vincent Power in his short time as London's leading rock impresario. They are, in fact, names of two of his clubs and one-third of the formidable Mean Fiddler Organisation. Power house he is. The stubbly and artfully dishevelled 45-year-old Irishman established the North West London honky tonk which heads the organisation exactly ten years ago. Two weeks ago he added Camden's Jazz Cafe, bought from the receivers, to a music empire which now turns over Pounds 6m a year - not counting his hugely successful open air festivals which add Pounds 3m a year. A visitor to London interested in contemporary music would be hard pushed not to visit one of the 15 bands playing Power's five (and now six) clubs on any given night of the week. He publishes a 24pp magazine, Feedback, which lists and reviews the gigs he stages, from bluesman Albert Collins to college circuit heroes Kitchens of Distinction, via hideous noise merchants with names like Bum or Headbirth. Power had been 15 years in the furniture business when he bought his first nightclub in North West London's Harlesden from boxer Terry Downes for Pounds 250,000. He turned it into the sort of good ol' boys' country honky tonk he liked and spent thousands booking his favourite C&amp;W acts. 'I was pigheaded, I ran it how I wanted to and I lost a fortune. The venue was right and the staff were great. I realised in time it was my booking policy that was sending it down.' By making a shift sideways to more fashionable Tex Mex and blues, the Mean Fiddler was established as a popular and profitable medium-sized venue. By 1987 it was full every night and Power was looking for a new outlet. He found it in the heart of hip Islington, opposite the refurbished Angel tube. The Pied Bull, a dilapidated pub with a room on the end of it, as Power describes it, was already known for its militant lesbian nights, free jazz extemporisations and sticky carpet. At a total cost of Pounds 275,000, Power bought it from the brewery owner, put in a stage and lavatories, and extended capacity to accommodate the city's enthusiastic 'thrash' rock aficionados. Renamed the Powerhaus, the club now serves as a springboard for indie outfits (amateurish but fashionable young groups without big contracts). Power had refined the art of booking: 'You must have iron costings,' he says, 'and although we still pay bands too much and then not enough people turn up, those occasions are rarer.' His 'iron costings' have led to discord with the Musician's Union, who object to what they perceive as a 'pay to play' scheme for young hopefuls. Power saysthe MU is unrealistic: 'We charge for the pa and we charge for an engineer, as an incentive. If the band draws more than 50 we will refund that fee. 'The MU does nothing to help young bands; it doesn't understand that a gig is impossible to put on without the equipment and there must be an incentive to keep out the timewasters.' After a year in the Powerhaus, its expansive owner was ready to buy again, this time in North Kensington, under the Westway motorway. The North Kensington Amenity Trust had been set up in the 1960s to operate the commercial spaces created by the building of the new road to Oxford. One of these was a dance hall called the Acklam Hall. Dogged by its reputation as a narcotics cash and carry, Westminster wanted rid of the place. 'I bought with a view to turning the place around quickly and ended up shutting it for a year, tearing it down to the ground and spending Pounds 0.75m on a rebuild,' says Power smiling. Subterania opened late in 1988 amid controversy over admittance and a tough stance on security: 'We had to make it clear to one or two of the local lads that things had changed,' Power explains in a soft Dublin brogue. Undeterred by the hidden problems encountered in Ladbroke Grove, Power went on the acquisition trail again, this time south of the river. In late 1989, at the peak of the property boom, he spent Pounds 1.2m on acquiring and refurbishing a Grade 2 listed music hall in Clapham, The Grand. The biggest, most comfortable of his clubs, it turned out to be the riskiest of his ventures to date: 'I didn't realise there would be such opposition from local residents'. It took an appeal to the High Court to award him a music and dance licence, with the club dark for a year. The Grand opened at the close of 1991, downstairs only, until 11 pm, with tough caveats on parking. 'It is the best music venue in London - but I think Wandsworth would have preferred a Lloyd Weber production,' Power says coolly. Sitting at a dining table on the balcony of London's brightest but shortlived jazz venue, the Jazz Cafe, 'I'll enjoy the challenge of turning this place around', he says. Power reflects on the work to be done. He is flushed with the success of his 'Fleadh', the annual Gaelic-flavoured music festival held in Finsbury Park, and last month's Madness reunion gig in the same place which attracted 66,000 fans during two days.</p>

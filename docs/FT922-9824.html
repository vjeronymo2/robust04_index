			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: By Jupiter The play from which this musical was taken featured the young Katharine Hepburn making an eye-catching entrance running down stairs dressed in an armoured breastplate and short skirt and carrying a dead stag over her shoulder. No wonder Rodgers and Hart thought they had a winner. The musical that they made was By Jupiter. On Sundays between now and mid-October in the Barbican's Cinema 1 a series of 'lost musicals' is being given in concert performance and By Jupiter at the weekend was the first. Four other shows by Schwartz, Porter, Weill and Rodgers again (Do I hear a Waltz?) will follow, each hopefully with the same musical zest, even if there is only a near honky-tonk piano for accompaniment. Written in 1942, By Jupiter was the last collaboration of the Rodgers and Hart partnership. It was completed while Hart was in hospital, with Rodgers at his bedside whistling tunes until the lyricist had no option but to find some words to fit them. It ran for 427 performances and, although a war-time show, is a comedy with few serious political overtones, except perhaps the scene where the Amazonians are exhorted to 'give, give, give' to raise money for arms. The scene is set in ancient times, but the point is to mock modern attitudes. With the Greek army of men facing the Amazonian women across the battlefield there is also plenty of scope for jokes on the reversal of the sexes - men who knit socks for their women at war, and so on. Rodgers's music is mostly rhythmic, snappy, not especially memorable. The most humable number is a sentimental waltz, 'Wait till you see her', sung by Theseus, who has come to claim the goddess Diana's girdle, but ends up with rather more. The Greek camp also includes a cowardly Hercules and Homer, a 'war correspondent and writer of travel books', just two from a cast-list that relishes a good classical caricature when it sees one. In this workshop performance the show went with a zing, the women taking the honours over the men, Louise Gold and Briony Glassco as the ruling Amazonian sisters in particular. Further performances of By Jupiter follow on Sundays in May. Discover the Lost Musicals 1992 season runs most Sunday afternoons until mid-October at Barbican Cinema 1 (071-638 8891)</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> THE NAME GAME: When it came time for Precious Metal to name its new album, the  all-gal hard-rock band were totally stumped. The group put together a list of  nearly 30 possible titles -- which Pop Eye obtained the other day.  </P> <P> In the end, the marketing wizards at the group's label, Chameleon Records,  decided to simply call the record Precious Metal (boo!). But consider the  alternatives. Potential titles included: Hard as Nails, Assault and Flattery,  Survival of the Loudest, Rub This, Girl's World, Ore, Big Stuff and Put the  Hammer Down. In addition to a killer cover of Jean Knight's "Mr. Big Stuff,"  the group's new record features guest performances by Heart's Nancy Wilson and  Cheap Trick's Tom Petersson. . . . The venerable rock club Madame Wong's West  is undergoing a major face-lift, with a splashy reopening scheduled for  mid-October. Rechristened West 2900, the club will be aiming for bigger-name  bands and will have new management and a new look, including a game room with  billiards and a kitchen serving Italian food. If you can't wait till then, stop  by Sept. 28, when a new Friday-night club debuts there. Dubbed Route 66 and run  by a trio of veteran club hands, it will no doubt serve as a Westside haven for  L.A.'s burgeoning Rubbie (rich urban biker) crowd.  </P></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial agents will retain advantages Sir, I was most interested in the article 'Agents lose jobs ahead of EU laws' (November 15) summarising some of the difficulties for principals in dealing with commercial agents after the new regulations come into force in the UK on January 1 1994. Like many law firms, we have been working on providing advice on the impact of the regulations. In particular, I agree that companies should re-examine the implications of using commercial agents and consider the alternative of appointing distributors. However I think it is important in making this assessment to recognise that there are fundamental differences between commercial agents and distributors which will have an impact upon this choice. In particular, it is of course possible to set the price at which commercial agents will sell goods on behalf of a principal. Distributors, on the other hand, must be free to sell at whatever price they think appropriate. It would be illegal under resale price maintenance laws to provide otherwise. Other factors which need to be taken into account are the impact of general competition law, which in the UK treats agents and distributors very differently, and the credit worthiness of a distributor responsible for buying and paying for goods in its own right. The new agency rules will certainly make life more difficult for principals, and in some ways remind one of the laws regulating employees. However agents do have advantages and there are a number of factors which need to be weighed in the balance before moving to distribution arrangements.

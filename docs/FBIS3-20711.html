			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] At the end of the week, the August national service  intake was discharged prematurely. The President of the  Republic, who as supreme commander of the armed forces decides  on the early release, taking into consideration the national  security conditions and the combat readiness of the armed  forces, had not been informed beforehand. Compulsory military  service in Slovenia lasts seven months. So far the President has  signed the early discharge of recruits from May, October and  December 1992, and from April, June, October and November last  year. This time the release took place without the knowledge of  President Kucan. Defence Minister Jansa pointed to the legal  vagueness concerning jurisdiction resulting from the  contradictions between the Law on Defence and existing  Constitution, as well as the Constitutional Court resolution of  December 13, which took the position that the competences of the  former state president do not transfer automatically to the  current President. It is true that the President decides on  early discharge, claims Jansa, but nowhere is it stipulated at  whose proposal. To avoid such confusion in the future, the  Defence Minister suggests that the government decide on the  adoption of a necessary military legislation, after receiving  the opinion of the President of the Republic. The President's  Office said that the President was in favour of early discharge  if the legal conditions existed. Recognising his  responsibilities to this generation of soldiers too, he had been  expecting the Defence Minister to propose their early discharge.  Since the Minister failed to do so and discharged the recruits  of his own accord, the Office judges the action of the Defence  Minister to be evidently unlawful and arbitrary.</p>

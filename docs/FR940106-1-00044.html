In order to help it determine whether rulemaking is needed and the scope of the issues involved, the Coast Guard conducted a public meeting on November 16, 1993. At the meeting, attendees discussed problems encountered under existing procedures and possible solutions, and whether use of a negotiated rulemaking would be appropriate. The meeting attendees requested that the Coast Guard conduct a second meeting to further discuss the issues. This notice announces the date, time, and place of the second meeting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Under 46 U.S.C. 12106, a vessel not eligible for the coastwise trade cannot receive a Great Lakes endorsement on its Certificate of Documentation. In addition, under 46 U.S.C. 12108, a fishing vessel which has been rebuilt outside the United States and which does not qualify for the rebuild savings provision of the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act of 1987, is not eligible for a fishery endorsement on its Certificate of Documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Effective January 1, 1994, the Coast Guard's regulatory standard for rebuild determinations will be found in 46 CFR &sect;67.177. (See final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  issue of Monday, November 15, 1993, page 60256.) In accordance with that standard, a vessel is rebuilt when ``any considerable part of its hull or superstructure is built upon or is substantially altered.'' A determination that a vessel has been rebuilt, if the rebuilding was done outside the U.S., results in a permanent loss of the eligibility of the vessel to engage in the restricted trades, with a commensurate loss in value. At the present time none of the problematic terms contained in the regulatory standard are defined. As a result, the Coast Guard frequently receives requests for advisory opinions that certain work to be performed on a vessel does not constitute a rebuilding. In support of a request for a rebuild determination, the submitter will generally enclose extensive documentation addressing the character and scope of the work to be performed including plans, drawings, contracts, work orders, and materials lists. Then the submitter will attempt to show that the work will not build upon or ``substantially'' alter ``any considerable part'' of the vessel's hull or superstructure. Often, the submitter will make comparisons between the before and after area of the hull and superstructure; the weight and area of steel plate to be replaced or added; or the comparative cost of the planned work to the value of the vessel. Unfortunately, the vessel representative sometimes does not submit any documentation until after the work is performed only to have the Coast Guard determine that the vessel has been rebuilt, with the disastrous consequence of loss of trading entitlements. In other cases, the work actually done on the vessel differs from or exceeds the planned work, with possible adverse effects on the final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard is considering initiating rulemaking to develop standards for determining when work on a vessel constitutes a rebuilding and to define the terms involved in rebuild determinations. However, to assist it to determine the scope of the issues involved in the project and to receive suggested definitions and standards for consideration, the Coast Guard conducted a public meeting before proceeding with the rulemaking process. At the meeting held on November 16, 1993, the attendees requested time to consider the information and ideas shared at the meeting and the opportunity to submit written materials to the Coast Guard. In addition, the attendees requested that the Coast Guard schedule a second meeting to further discuss the issues involved, including whether the use of negotiated rulemaking would be appropriate. The Coast Guard agreed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to have sufficient time to review written submissions prior to the meeting, all materials should be received by the Coast Guard on or before January 31, 1994. Attendees are encouraged to share written submissions with other attendees.

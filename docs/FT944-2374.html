			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Observer: Humble pie Some good news at last from BTR, the giant conglomerate which has lost its premium rating after underperforming the stock market by around a quarter over the past six months. It has just won a ProShare award for its success in attracting private shareholders. ProShare singled out BTR for attracting over 500 new shareholders a week despite its falling share price. Were the company to expend as much effort explaining itself to the City, its shares might be trading at rather less humble levels.</p>

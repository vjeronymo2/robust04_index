			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle Tate &amp; Lyle's share price is now back to within spitting distance of where it was when the company issued its profits warning in September. In the light of worries elsewhere in the food sector that is a doubly commendable performance, so there are grounds for wondering whether the warning was necessary in the first place. Doubtless companies should not allow expectations to stray too far out of line. But it also helps to massage expectations. On that basis, incidentally, it is hard to see many being willing to correct assumptions that are too low. The important thing is to pre-empt disappointment on the day. Attention yesterday focused less on Tate's mere 17 per cent increase in profits than on the thought that its prospects are slowly improving. Last year, currency movements accounted for nearly two thirds of the increase in profits. This year the emphasis should be more on underlying growth, with improvement in the US stemming both from higher sugar prices and from cost cutting at Staley. There should also be some recovery of the European sweetener market. Together with Tate's strong cashflow and its own estimate that changes in the last budget defer the onset of an ACT problem till 1996, this leaves scope for continued dividend progression. Tate will doubtless hope that this pushes its share price high enough to encourage conversion of its preference shares. Interest cover of 5.7 times leaves little to fear in gearing of 78 per cent. A lower figure would provide more flexibility for expansion nevertheless.</p>

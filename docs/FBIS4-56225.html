			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hilda Quijano from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Legislative Assembly has approved the Armed  Forces Administrative Law that establishes the constitutional  mandate the Armed Forces must fulfill under the country's new  conditions. The legislative decree, which contains nearly 100  articles, outlines the Army's new doctrine. The Administrative  Law establishes a framework from which the Army must not waver.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The most basic aspect  of this law, although this is not new in terms of our  constitutional legislation, is the clear and absolute separation  of the security corps from the control of the Armed Forces,  which I believe is good for the country. Another important  aspect of the doctrine is that the Armed Forces will serve the  people and, in turn, will become a guarantor of human rights.  The Armed Forces must think of civilians not as their enemies  but as the focal point of their duty. [end recording]    The Constitution mandates that the Armed Forces defend  national sovereignty and territorial integrity, thereby taking  away their responsibility for public security. Some deputies  say this mandate has always been the same, but there were times  when it was not followed.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] The Army has always  had specific functions; however, what has happened is that the  Army has been used for actions that are not part of its  constitutional duties. [end recording]    The Armed Forces Administrative Law creates the post of  inspector general, who will be a member of the military and will  check into the behavior of Army members. The inspector general  is answerable to the defense minister. The decree also places  all of the Army's work and administrative organization under a  constitutional mandate in accordance with the peace agreements.</p>

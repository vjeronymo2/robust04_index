			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT IS ENOUGH TO GIVE WITT FITS;  </P> <P> FORMER ACE STRUGGLES AGAIN AS BREWERS BEAT ANGELS, 5-2  </P> <P> The Angels lead the American League in team earned-run average, despite the  somewhat bloated 4.35 ERA put up by their one-time ace, Mike Witt, who has  allowed fewer than six hits in just one outing this year and is yielding an  average of eight hits a start.  </P> <P> Saturday night, Witt stepped up on the mound again, and again an Angel winning  streak came to an end as the Brewers slapped him around for 10 hits en route to  a 5-2 victory before a crowd of 42,324 at Milwaukee County Stadium.  </P> <P> The Angels, who had won their previous three, have now won 13 of their last 18  games, and Witt has been the starting pitcher in three of the five losses. In  fact, just about every time he gets a start these days, something bad happens .  . . even when he pitches well.  </P> <P> In his last start, the bullpen blew a 5-0 lead to Seattle. The time before  that, Oakland won, 9-5, and cut the Angels' lead in the American League West to  one game.  </P> <P> Two starts before that, Baltimore beat the Angels, 3-2, in 11 innings. Saturday  night, the Angels lost but managed to hang on to first place because the  Seattle Mariners beat the Athletics, 11-5.  </P> <P> "If you pitch well most of the time, you're going to win often," Witt said. "If  you pitch well two out of five times, you're not going to win too much.  </P> <P> "I threw decent tonight. I had good stuff. But getting out of tough situations  is part of this game, and I had two tough situations and gave up two runs in  each. So I don't think I pitched very well tonight."  </P> <P> Witt held the Brewers hitless in three of the six innings he pitched, but he  gave up four hits and two runs in two others.  </P> <P> In the fourth inning, Rob Deer led off with a single, and one out later, Greg  Brock doubled. Glenn Braggs and B.J. Surhoff followed with run-scoring singles,  and the Brewers had a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> Robin Yount and Brock singled to lead off the sixth. Then, with one out,  Surhoff laid down a bunt on a squeeze play, but Witt made an acrobatic,  sprawling snatch-and-toss to get Yount at the plate.  </P> <P> Instead of being buoyed by a fine defensive effort, Witt promptly surrendered a  run-scoring single to Meyer on the next pitch. Bill Spiers followed with an RBI  double, and Milwaukee went ahead, 4-1.  </P> <P> "That was the ballgame right there," Witt said. "If I get (Meyer) out, it's a  2-1 game and who knows what happens after that. I don't want to downplay his  hit, but I didn't exactly make a great pitch.  </P> <P> "I guess I've given up a lot of runs with two outs this season."  </P> <P> The Angels didn't provide Witt (7-9) with much offense, scoring only on solo  homers by Lance Parrish and Wally Joyner. And they squandered some early  chances against Ted Higuera (7-4), who pitched his first complete game of the  year and improved his record since the All-Star break to 4-1.  </P> <P> "We had a chance to get him early," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "We could've  had four or five runs early, and that would have made a big difference. But we  didn't do it, and (Higuera) pitched very well after that.  </P> <P> "You have to give Teddy credit. He threw the ball over the plate, and we made  out. And when he started locating the ball, he got through some innings without  making a lot of pitches, which allowed him to finish strong."  </P> <P> The Angels left runners in scoring position with less than one out in the  first, second and third innings.  </P> <P> Devon White singled to center field and stole second base in the first, but  Johnny Ray flied out, Chili Davis struck out and Joyner flied out to the wall  in right.  </P> <P> Claudell Washington followed Parrish's second-inning homer with a double to  right, but Dick Schofield flied to center, and Jack Howell lined out to right.  </P> <P> And White walked, leading off the third, eventually stealing his way around to  third, before Joyner flied deep to right to end the inning.  </P> <P> So, the Angels didn't capitalize on their chances, and the Brewers made the  most of theirs. But the Angels haven't risen to the top of the standings on  explosive offense alone. They have a league-leading 15 shutouts, and Witt has  been involved in just one. But reliever Bob McClure got the victory that night.  </P> <P> "I thought Mike made some tremendous pitches tonight," Rader said. "He had some  really good innings. He makes a helluva play on the squeeze and then he makes  that pitch to Meyer . . . you've got to make a quality pitch there."  </P> <P> But Witt, the Angels' best-paid pitcher, just can't seem to make the right  pitch at the right time these days.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Catcher Lance Parrish left Saturday night's game with bruises on his right knee  and rib cage after a collision at home plate with Brewer left fielder Glenn  Braggs. Milwaukee had runners on first and second with two out in the second  inning when designated hitter Joey Meyer hit a ground ball into the hole at  shortstop. Dick Schofield ranged onto the grass to backhand the ball, and  Braggs apparently thought Schofield would attempt to get the slow-footed Meyer  at first, so he continued around third and headed home. Schofield's throw to  Parrish was there in plenty of time, and the surprised Braggs didn't slide or  try to run over Parrish. Instead, he sort of stumbled and dived headlong into  Parrish, who collapsed, but held onto the ball. "My knee's fine, but my side is  a little stiff," Parrish said. "I knew once the throw was coming he was set on  contact, so I just tried to hold onto the ball. If wasn't a cheap shot. It's  just part of the game." Parrish was examined by Brewer team physician Dr. Paul  Jacobs and will be available on a day-to-day basis.  </P> <P> The slumping Brian Downing got his third day off in four games, and Devon  White, who was out Friday night with a throat and sinus infection, was back in  the lineup and batting leadoff for the first time this season. "Brian  volunteered to play yesterday because Devo was sick," Rader said, "but he has  more trouble with left-handers than right-handers so it would have been a  disservice to put him in there against (left-handed) Teddy Higuera. He just  hasn't found stroke yet, and the best thing to do is get away from it. More  often than not, these things are more emotional than physical." . . . Catcher  Bill Schroeder's five-year-old daughter, Lindsey, who had been hospitalized  with an ear infection, returned home Saturday, and Schroeder said he can  finally get some sleep and enjoy baseball again. "She's much better now," he  said. "It's a relief. Now, if I go 0 for 4, I'll give a (damn)." . . . A ball  autographed by Jim Abbott went for $220 in a charity auction sponsored by the  Brewer wives.  </P></p>

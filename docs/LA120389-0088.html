			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCOMPLICES TO A NEW GENOCIDE;  </P> <P> CAMBODIA: OUR DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WHICH ACQUIESCED IN THE HOLOCAUST, HAS  CULTIVATED ANOTHER MONSTROSITY IN BACKING THE KHMER ROUGE.  </P> <P> Once upon a time, in Europe, Jews were being slaughtered.  </P> <P> The United States was at war with the murderers, the government of Nazi  Germany. As one might expect, the United States maintained that its policy was  to work out programs to save those European Jews who could be saved.  </P> <P> History now records that this was not true. On the contrary, during half the  war the Department of State actually used the machinery of government to  sabotage the rescue of Jews. Only in early 1944, when Treasury Secretary Henry  J. Morgenthau, himself a Jew, went to President Franklin D. Roosevelt with a  memo describing the Department of State's actions, was the situation reversed.  The memo was titled "On the Acquiescence of This Government in the Murder of  the Jews." By then, it was too late.  </P> <P> How come? It was an amalgam of racism, bureaucratic inertia and geopolitics  that produced this situation.  </P> <P> And it is happening again today. Not to the Jews but to the Cambodians. The  Cambodian nazis, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, are coming back after one holocaust  with a second in mind if they can overthrow the Hun Sen government. Pol Pot's  Defense Minister, Son Sen, has a little list, which he has already read to some  people. Those to be slaughtered include not just ethnic Vietnamese among the 6  million people living in Cambodia, but also Cambodian "fellow-travelers" of the  Vietnamese. This would cover everyone who, now or later, is deemed to disagree  with Pol Pot, who is still in command and who usd this tactic in his earlier  genocide, in the period 1975-78, when more than 2 million Cambodians died.  </P> <P> Today, the Department of State is not only acquiescing in the repeat of  genocide but is helping to make to happen. Anti-Semitism has been replaced by  anti-Vietnamese sentiment. Bureaucratic inertia is unchanged. And the  geopolitics is one of support for the government of China, currently the  largest suppressor of freedom on Earth today.  </P> <P> Here is the indictment.  </P> <P> 1) Not only has the Department of State made no substantial effort to prevent  the return of the Khmer Rouge but it has worked actively and energetically to  force the Vietnamese Army out of Cambodia, thus removing the main bulwark of  the Cambodian people against the return of the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> 2) Not only has the Department of State failed to oppose Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge  but it has strengthened it politically by working to combine the non-communist  resistance in Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge in a so-called Coalition Government  of Democratic Kampuchea. Meanwhile, militarily, it has worked secretly, in  conjunction with the CIA, to help the Khmer Rouge's two allies, Son Sann and  Prince Norodom Sihanouk, in their three-way combined effort to stretch Hun  Sen's forces ever thinner in the ongoing fighting.  </P> <P> 3) Not only has the Department of State failed to support peaceful initiatives  of the Thai government to end the conflict but it has actively tried to  sabotage those initiatives by intervening in Thai politics against the prime  minister.  </P> <P> 4) Not only has the Department of State failed to support Hun Sen's government  against the Khmer Rouge but it is the main element in an economic embargo that  denies Cambodia help from the West.  </P> <P> 5) Not only has the Department of State failed to prevent Pol Pot's government  of Democratic Kampuchea from holding Cambodia's U.N. seat, it has -- for 10  years and still today -- supported the Khmer Rouge's retaining U.N.  representation.  </P> <P> 6) Not only has the Department of State failed to protest China's support of  the Khmer Rouge publicly, but it has worked closely with China's ally in  Southeast Asia, Singapore, in advancing China's insidious campaign to insert  the Khmer Rouge into a new government coalition in Cambodia.  </P> <P> 7) Not only has the Department of State failed to implement the U.S. signature  on the genocide convention by moving to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice but it  has used its vote at international conferences to prevent this charge from  being leveled against them.  </P> <P> 8) The Department of State has hidden its knowledge that Sihanouk is far too  unstable to be the "indispensable leader" of Cambodia that the department  represents him to be. And it has smeared, by action and inaction, the present  government of Cambodia and, in particular, prevented its representatives from  traveling here to make their case, even to private U.S. groups.  </P> <P> 9) Not least, Department of State representatives avoid exchanges of views with  their critics so as to maintain a more defensible "low profile" than discussion  would permit.  </P> <P> At at recent meeting on Capitol Hill, a senior department representative had  this to say to some who disagreed: "You only want a win for the Vietnamese."  This statement reveals quite a bit. America's actions are caught up in a  geopolitical hostility toward Vietnam that is every bit as tangible as the  racism that embarrassed, for all time, the Department of State of Secretary  Cordell Hull.  </P></p>

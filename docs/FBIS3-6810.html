With the failure, Korea has no choice but to revise part of  its agricultural country schedule if ongoing bilateral  negotiations with the United States and other interested parties  fail to reach a settlement.    At the second verification, the ministry said, the United  States and other countries took issue with Seoul's plan to keep  tariff rates on farming imports at higher levels than it offered  in the country schedule submitted to GATT in April 1992.    They also raised objections to the number of farm products  which are subject to Seoul's import markups through state  trading enterprises.    Under the country schedule, Seoul seeks to slap import  markups on 118 agricultural products, compared with 10-odd items  contained in the previous country schedule.    The other nations also expressed dissatisfaction with  Seoul's  plan to impose specific tariffs on 97 farm imports, at levels  higher than those in the previous schedule in April 1992 when  Korea included the ad valorem tariffs, according to the ministry.    Of 48 countries which underwent the second round of  verification Sunday, about 20, including the United States, the  European Union, Switzerland, Indonesia, Sweden, Malaysia, Israel  and Korea, failed to get their country schedules endorsed.    The GATT secretariat is asking the countries which had their  schedules rejected to settle their disputes through bilateral  negotiations and then inform GATT of the results by Monday night.    The Korean Government, in a move to help settle the farming  issues, dispatched Pak Sang-su, first assistant agriculture  minister, to Geneva yesterday.    Korea has been conducting bilateral negotiations with the  United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada on farming  issues since Friday, according to the ministry.</p>

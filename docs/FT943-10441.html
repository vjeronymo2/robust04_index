			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / SPD calls for speed limit on autobahns Spurred on by fears of smog in the current heatwave, Germany's opposition Social Democrats have executed a complete U-turn on environmental policy by calling for a strict national speed limit on the roads. The issue, always regarded as a red rag to speeding road-hogs on the country's unrestricted autobahns, has immediately been taken up as the top theme in the current general election campaign. The decision to reverse SPD policy was taken at a meeting of state environment ministers with the party leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, barely two months after he had vetoed an earlier move as electoral dynamite. In the meantime, the heatwave has caused a series of 'ozone alarms' in several federal states because of rising levels of summer smog pollution, and several are planning local speed restrictions to counter the danger. The SPD is calling for a universal 130km per hour (80mph) maximum speed on all autobahns and country roads, and a limit of just 30km per hour (18mph) in built-up areas. 'We need a speed limit 365 days of the year,' Mr Scharping said after his meeting with the SPD environment experts in the Bavarian mountain resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where the temperature topped 30 degrees Celsius. Any other policy would be a 'petty patchwork solution'. His personal U-turn caused consternation and amazement among his conservative and liberal opponents, fierce defenders of the theory that the German motor industry produces the best fast cars in the world thanks to their own motorway speed fanatics. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the liberal Free Democrats, called the decision an over-reaction. The SPD was using the ozone issue as an excuse to promote 'total regulation on German roads', he said. Mr Klaus Topfer, the Christian Democrat environment minister, said speed limits did not have a significant effect on ozone levels. Yet the indication that German opposition to any form of speed limit on the autobahns is weakening will certainly be welcomed in Brussels, and among other EU member states. They have long been baffled by Germany's ability to demand tough limits on exhaust emissions, and yet refuse flatly to impose any speed limits on the autobahns, which the European Commission says would make a big contribution to cutting car pollution.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Letter: Smokescreen surrounds UK's objective of resuming nuclear tests Sir, All indications are that President Bill Clinton will shortly announce an extension of the US moratorium on nuclear testing. Britain uses the US site in Nevada, and cannot test unless the Americans lift their ban. The decision the president looks set to make would be a heavy defeat for the British government, which has been lobbying fiercely for a resumption of tests. There is a widespread misconception that Britain wants to test to make sure that its existing nuclear weapons are safe and reliable. This misconception has been deliberately fostered by British officials in Washington. However, if parliamentary answers by government ministers are to be believed, Britain does not need to test Polaris, the WE177 free-fall bomb or Trident for safety or reliability. On November 30 1992 Viscount Cranborne said: 'We are concerned purely with the safety of future systems.' On October 23 1992, armed forces minister Archie Hamilton, asked what the moratorium would mean for Trident, stated: 'There are no implications for the Trident warhead programme, the tests for which have been completed.' In fact, there are safety worries about British nuclear weapons, but they could all be rectified without a single nuclear test, by changing operational procedures. Safety is used as a smokescreen to obscure the real purpose of tests. Recent reports in Washington suggest that Britain wanted to test a replacement warhead for the WE177. British weapons development tests would have caused a storm of protest on Capitol Hill, in this country and elsewhere. It seems that once it became clear that its safety and reliability cover had been blown, the government concluded that the game was up and withdrew its plans to test. The government will doubtless now proclaim itself as world leader in the fight against nuclear proliferation.

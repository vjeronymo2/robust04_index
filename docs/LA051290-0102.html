			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS $3.6-BILLION CITY BUDGET  </P> <P> Wrapping up debate on a budget restrained by lack of funds, the Los Angeles  City Council on Friday sent Mayor Tom Bradley a $3.6-billion 1990-91 spending  plan that suspends a buildup of the Police Department, trims a wide range of  services and raises fees and taxes.  </P> <P> "We've made some painful decisions," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said as the  budget deliberations closed Friday evening. "But we have done what needs to be  done to avoid a much more severe problem next year."  </P> <P> City and private analysts had warned that because of sluggish revenues, past  overspending and borrowing to pay for equipment, the city was headed for a  $100-million deficit next year. Yaroslavsky said the budget sent to Bradley  remains "precarious," but significantly reduces the chances of a major crisis  next year.  </P> <P> But the council did not significantly alter the total spending amount proposed  by the mayor, though it did make some funding shifts.  </P> <P> The budget crunch dampened the spirit of Friday's debate, a process usually  marked by heated struggles by various council members to win money for pet  projects. As one indication of the reduced activity, the number of special  funding motions by council members was down by more than 50% from last year.  </P> <P> Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor would have no immediate comment  on the budget, but several City Hall observers said it seemed unlikely there  would be the kind of veto fight that has marked other budgets.  </P> <P> The council earlier had approved the most controversial element of Bradley's  budget: a package of tax increases that includes a first-ever 10% surcharge on  most city parking.  </P> <P> Key among the council actions Friday was a budget juggling maneuver that  restored $3.8 million to the Police Department to help offset cuts in overtime  accounts. But the council did not come up with additional money to pay for 400  new officers that both Bradley and the council initially endorsed.  </P> <P> Council members on Friday also scrounged around for additional income by  proposing -- for later approval -- new fees, including a 50-cent monthly  utility bill surcharge to raise $9.7 million for an expanded graffiti cleanup  campaign.  </P> <P> The council agreed to sharply boost fees for residents of other cities who use  Los Angeles' golf courses and tennis courts.  </P></p>

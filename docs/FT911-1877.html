			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Observer: Who's on next? It is bad enough that the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland have virtually indistinguishable names. But must they confuse everybody by announcing their results on the same day? 'We have always announced our results on this day,' sniffs George Younger, Royal's new chairman. Bank of Scotland, the more senior of the two, admits it was the guilty party because it changed its own date. But by the time it spotted the clash there was no time to switch, since it had decided on its Pounds 200m rights issue and booked a place in the Bank of England queue. An official apology has been lodged.</p>

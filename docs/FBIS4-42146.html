			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Kerbler] </F>   [Text] For the past 11 years a war has been going on in  Sudan between non-Muslim rebels and the Muslim government. Over  1.3 million people have died in this war, more than 3.3 million  refugees have left the country. Some 300,000 have found refuge  in Uganda. For [Ugandan] President Museveni this is a reason to  work out a peace solution for Sudan together with Djibouti,  Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The bilateral talks in Muerzsteg  [Austria] might have given a new impetus to the IGADD  [Inter-Governmental Authority on Draught and Development] peace  initiative. President Museveni did not release any details  about the talks, probably so as not to endanger the dialogue  with Sudan.    [Begin Museveni recording, in English with superimposed  German translation] We have worked out a method to clarify open  questions, including a peace settlement for southern Sudan.  [end recording]    And Sudan's head of state 'Umar al-Bashir adds:    [Begin al-Bashir recording, in Arabic with superimposed  German translation] In our talks we have agreed to improve  relations between Sudan and Uganda and to remove all the  obstacles to a peace settlement for southern Sudan. [end  recording]    On 18 July in Nairobi, the African IGADD states, Sudan, and  the warring factions of the southern Sudanese resistance want to  meet for fresh negotiations.    [Austrian] President Klestil expressed satisfaction with the  talks and he said that this proves that in spite of  concentrating on the European Union, Austria has maintained a  global outlook.</p>

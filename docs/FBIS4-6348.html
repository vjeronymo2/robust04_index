			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Chinese nationals will now find it easier to  enter the country as President Ramos yesterday granted them  easier access to multiple entry visas.    Executive Order 168 authorizes the issuance of multiple  entry  visas valid for six months to Chinese nationals coming to the  Philippines for business or pleasure.    Under the law, Chinese nationals are defined as persons who  hold passports from the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong  Kong and Macao.    The president said granting this type of visa to Chinese  nationals is in line with government's policy to attract and  promote trade, investment and tourism as instruments of the  country's economic growth and national development.    The new law allows the issuance of multi-entry visas to  Chinese nationals by Philippine Foreign Service establishments  without prior authorization from the DFA [Department of Foreign  Affairs], provided the applicant meets the following requirement:  -- duly accomplished visa application form;    -- passport valid for six months beyond the period of  authorized stay in the Philippines;    -- valid entry visa to the next port of destination or  reentry to the country of origin;    -- confirmed return or onward package ticket; and,    -- proof of bona fide status as tourist or businessman.    The visa fees are $1OO for a multiple entry visa valid for  six months; $50 for multiple entry visas valid for three months  and $25 for single entry visas valid for three months.

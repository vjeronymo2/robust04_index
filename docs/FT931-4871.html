			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Fairey to Pounds 17.3m FAIREY GROUP, the specialist electronics and engineering company, reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year, helped by recent acquisitions and a strong performance by its core electronics and electrical power division. Pre-tax profits increased by slightly more than expected from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 17.3m on sales which expanded 17 per cent to Pounds 104.3m (Pounds 88.8m). Earnings per share climbed 16 per cent to 32.5p (28.1p) out of which an increased final dividend of 6.9p is proposed, making a total of 10.2p (9p) for the year. Mr John Poulter, chief executive, acknowledged that '1992 was a good year for Fairey, despite the indifferent economic climate'. Overall operating profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 13.2m). Operating profits in the electronics and electrical division jumped almost 42 per cent to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 7.56m) including an initial contribution of about Pounds 1m from the acquisitions. Turnover was Pounds 56.1m (Pounds 39.5m). In contrast the aerospace and defence division, which has been a shrinking business over the past five years, reported lower operating profits of Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.45m) on turnover which slipped to Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 24.2m). The filtration and specialised ceramics division managed to hold steady in difficult markets with operating profits of Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 3.17m) on turnover which edged ahead to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 25.1m). Despite spending Pounds 15.6m in cash on acquisitions during the year the underlying positive cash flow still enabled the group to end the year with net cash of Pounds 2.1m, down from Pounds 12.7m. a year earlier. COMMENT Fairey continues to delight its shareholders. Since coming to market in November 1988 at 155p the stock has climbed steadily to close up 10p at a new high of 590p last night. So far the steady performance has been built on highly selective and well integrated acquisitions, organic growth and a timely restructuring of the aerospace and defence business. The balance sheet remains robust and assuming the management is not now tempted to go for a big acquisition, which would be rather out of character, further cautious small purchases look likely. If nothing else changes Fairey's recent acquisitions in the electronics field would add another Pounds 1m to profits this year, and with more than a third of its business in the US, it stands to be a beneficiary of both the stronger dollar and any US-led recovery. Full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 19.5m look possible producing earnings per share of 34.5p. The stock is trading on a prospective p/e of 17. It is not not cheap, but it is a quality stock which may not have reached the top yet.</p>

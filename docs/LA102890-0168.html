			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ZEALAND VOTERS DEAL RULING LABOR PARTY A RESOUNDING DEFEAT  </P> <P> Voters booted out New Zealand's Labor Party on Saturday, humiliating Prime  Minister Mike Moore and giving the opposition National Party the biggest  election victory in more than half a century.  </P> <P> Labor's rout after six turbulent years in power was just the disaster that  Moore had promised to avert when he took the party leadership from Geoffrey  Palmer only eight weeks ago.  </P> <P> "It was a very short honeymoon. Not even a one-night stand, was it?" a  crestfallen Moore said after conceding defeat.  </P> <P> Provisional results brought sweet revenge for National Party leader Jim Bolger,  long portrayed by Labor as a bumbling farmer unfit to lead the nation.  </P> <P> Both Labor and the National Party had pledged to continue the country's  anti-nuclear policy, adopted in 1984 under former Prime Minister David Lange.  It bars nuclear-powered ships and ships with nuclear weapons from making port  calls, and it led to an estrangement in ties with Washington.  </P> <P> The United States in 1986 cut high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped  the country from the ANZUS military alliance, which also includes Australia.  </P> <P> The National Party, however, promised to seek some sort of reconciliation with  Washington.  </P> <P> Nine of the 18 Labor Cabinet ministers lost their seats in Parliament as voters  showed their frustration over record unemployment, high interest rates and an  economy mired in recession.  </P> <P> The center-right National Party took 68 of the 97 seats while Labor's  representation was halved, to just 28.  </P></p>

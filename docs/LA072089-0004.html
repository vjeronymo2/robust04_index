			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-J. DAVID AIDE SAYS HUNTER HAD ACCESS TO DATA ON FIRM'S WOES  </P> <P> A former financial officer for the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm testified  Wednesday that he prepared statements for J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and Nancy  Hoover Hunter indicating the dismal financial shape of some J. David  subsidiaries.  </P> <P> Chris Kalabokes, who worked in the La Jolla offices of J. David &amp; Co. just  before the firm's collapse in 1984, said the statements were prepared at  Hunter's and Dominelli's request and for their eyes only.  </P> <P> The testimony appeared to undercut Hunter's contention that she was unaware of  the illegal activities that led to the downfall of the apparently profitable  investment firm.  </P> <P> Hunter is charged with 234 counts of fraud, conspiracy and income-tax evasion  stemming from her alleged role as a key executive in the firm. After the firm  was forced into bankruptcy court in 1984, it became clear that the operation  was huge Ponzi scheme, where money from new investors was used to pay off old  clients and little successful trading was done.  </P> <P> Hunter actively participated in "all facets of the operations," especially  personnel matters, Kalabokes testified.  </P> <P> Kalabokes said reports he prepared for about seven months, beginning in June,  1983, indicated that all of the J. David subsidiaries under his control lost  money every month, particularly J. David Securities, which "showed significant  losses."  </P> <P> Although Kalabokes oversaw a number of J. David entities, he was denied access  to documents and other information related to some of the major subsidiaries  and several checking accounts, he said.  </P> <P> "With a smile on his face, (Dominelli) told me it was none of my business,"  Kalabokes said.  </P> <P> Kalabokes, who is now president of a Northern California winery, is expected to  take the stand again this morning.  </P></p>

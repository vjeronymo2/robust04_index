			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori today ended his three-day visit to Japan with the hope  that Peru's economic and political stabilization will help get  more aid for development, investment, and tourism in his country.    Before leaving for Beijing, Fujimori told EFE he was  satisfied with the result of his visit, while Council of  Ministers President Efrain Goldenberg added that "the Japanese  officials are gradually getting more enthusiastic" in their  economic relations with Peru.    Upon arriving in Tokyo, Fujimori said the trip's top  objective was to inform the Japanese Government and private  business about Peruvian economic reforms and the pacification  program in order to expedite aid for development and attract  private investors.    Peru did not get any donation or credit this time but  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was willing to help Peru  with three projects: a drinking water treatment and sewer  system for Lima, improvement of the Callao port infrastructure,  and irrigation with Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF)  financing.    Regarding an Eximbank credit for Peru for a hydroelectric  project, Hata told Fujimori on 6 June that the project depends  on sending a mission to Peru to study its cost and feasibility.    According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry source, Japan is  considering donations of food and hospital equipment to Peru. No  details of concrete projects were disclosed until the requests  are made through diplomatic channels.    Fujimori insisted to Hata that Japan support Peru to join  the  Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), although new  memberships have been frozen.    Fujimori's agenda, which was much lighter than other times,  included an audience with Emperor Akihito, a meeting with 120  Tokyo Chamber of Commerce businessmen, meetings with top  Eximbank and OECF executives, and a visit to the multinational  electronic NEC Corporation plant in Yokohama to request  technological cooperation on telecommunications.    At the end of his stay in Tokyo, Fujimori was given an  "honorary degree" by the University of Keio in recognition of  his work for Peruvian development and stability.    At the cultural level, President Fujimori dedicated a  traveling exhibition in Japan about the Shikan culture sponsored  by the private television network Tokyo Broadcasting Systems  (TBS) and another exhibition on Inca art at the University of  Tokyo.    Negotiations for the payment of the Peruvian debt to Japan,  pending since Tokyo accepted its renegotiation with the Paris  Club in 1993, have not been resumed.    During his visit Fujimori wanted to promote the image of "a  Peru in peace" and in rapid economic growth to attract not only  capital and trade but also restore tourism in Peru's historic  areas.</p>

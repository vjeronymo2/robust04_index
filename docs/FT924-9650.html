			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: TIP Europe up 26% as interest charges fall TIP EUROPE, the trailer rental company which was forced to refinance last year after breaching banking covenants, yesterday reported a 26 per cent profits increase thanks to lower interest charges and higher rental rates. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.01m to Pounds 7.54m in the year to July 31 while turnover rose 3.3 per cent to Pounds 106.5m. At the interim stage profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 3.72m. Mr Jim Davis, chairman, said the results showed 'steady progress'. He added: 'We're feeling much better than we did this time last year.' Interest costs fell more than Pounds 2m to Pounds 14m as last year's Pounds 29m rights issue repaid debt. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 149.6m to Pounds 118.4m, taking gearing from 3.53 times to 1.62 times enlarged shareholders funds. Interest cover improved from 1.37 times to 1.54 times. Operating profits fell from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 22.1m because of slower growth in continental markets, especially Germany. Benelux failed to recover from a bad first quarter while profits in Denmark were wiped out by losses in Finland and Sweden. The average fleet was reduced by over 1,000 units to 17,900 to reflect lower demand. This helped maintain utilisation rates close to 75 per cent, while the company achieved price rises of 7 per cent. In the UK, rates increased 10 per cent to Pounds 11.83 a day. In the general leasing division, falling used vehicle sales were more than made up by a Pounds 1m increase in profits from Mobiel, which supplies temporary buildings. Exceptional reorganisation and refinancing costs totalled Pounds 558,000 (Pounds 1.68m). The April sale of the group's truck rental division led to extraordinary charges of Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 683,000). Earnings fell 7.4 per cent to 3.9p, even after last year's figure was restated from 5.05p to 4.21p to reflect the rights issue. TIP is proposing to cut its final dividend in line with the fall in earnings. A final of 0.76p is proposed, to make total dividends for the year of 1.4p, against 1.82p. The shares fell 1 1/2 p to 31p. COMMENT TIP deserves credit for squeezing profits from a business as hard hit as most, especially since the company's survival was in question less than a year ago. A new management team, a more cautious approach and reduced borrowings have all won applause in the City. But TIP is being forced to sell trailers to control costs. It will therefore benefit less when recovery comes - it will have to buy new trailers which are less profitable in the first few years of operation. With the German economy apparently slowing, analysts have scaled back forecasts for this year to Pounds 8.8m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 8. Without evidence of recovery in the UK, or resistance to a weaker Europe, that rating looks about right.</p>

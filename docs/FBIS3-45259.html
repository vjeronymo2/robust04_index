The ministry has already decided upon four areas in  Mexico to assist Taiwan manufacturers in setting up investment  and factories. The NAFTA formally went into effect at the  beginning of this year. Due to the advantageous position of  Mexico, the ministry has decided to put focus on developing  markets in that country. The ministry's Investment Commission,  the China External Trade Development Council, and the Chinese  Chamber of Commerce in Mexico jointly held the fact- finding  mission and selected the areas most suited to the needs of local  manufacturers. The ministry will hold forums explaining the  investment targets in Taipei and Taichung over the next several  days, as well as introducing the NAFTA and the effects of it on  Taiwan.</p>

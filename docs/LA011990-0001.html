			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPORTING MORALS TO EAST EUROPE  </P> <P> "No Place for Raging Capitalism," by Lucy Komisar (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 2)  articulated my own sentiments regarding the political evolution in Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> It seems to be a forgone conclusion among many Americans that the collapse of  totalitarian communism in Eastern Europe will invite full-blown American-style  capitalism.  </P> <P> I doubt it. Our glaring economic, health and educational inequality, coupled  with violent crime, is not envied by a majority of Eastern Europeans. Despite  America's proclivity for furious flag waving, it is now evident not all  Europeans are wholly impressed.  </P> <P> However, social democracy (i.e., Sweden) can provide Eastern Europeans  political and personal freedoms while maintaining a responsible level of social  benefits. The general consensus now seems to indicate gravitation toward social  democracy among Eastern Europe's new leaders. A possible result could be the  potential assimilation of these countries into an economically unified Europe.  </P> <P> KEVIN E. HULL  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

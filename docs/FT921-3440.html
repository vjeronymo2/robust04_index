			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Call for no change in A-levels A-LEVELS should remain largely unchanged but with strict limits on non-examined coursework, the School Examinations and Assessment Council said yesterday. The council, which is the government's advisory body on examinations, published principles for the development of A-levels, which are the main exams taken by 18-year-olds for entry into higher education in England and Wales. The principles include an obligation to limit coursework to no more than 20 per cent of each A-level course. Lord Griffiths, the council's chairman, said: 'The implementation of these principles will increase the acceptability of AS examinations and lead to an increasing breadth in the programmes of A-level students.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has indicated support for the principles. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are committed to abolishing the council and replacing the A-level with a broader post-16 examination.</p>

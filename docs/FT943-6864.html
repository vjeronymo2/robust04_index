			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Sharp drop in sales of life and pension policies: Fall blamed partly on concern over mis-selling Sales of new life assurance and pension products fell sharply in the first half of this year, according to figures published yesterday by the Association of British Insurers. The trade association attributed the decline to public concern about the mis-selling of personal pensions, the flat condition of the mortgage market and low UK interest rates. The ABI figures showed sharp falls in the regular premium life and pensions policies sold in the second quarter compared with the same period of 1993. The number of regular premium life policies fell below 1m, while the number of regular premium pensions slipped to 264,000 - both at their lowest quarterly levels for well over two years. Figures for single premium pensions confirmed the impact on sales of the decision by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator, last December to set up a review of the selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of an occupational scheme. The number of single premium pensions sold in the first half of this year, 265,000, was 30 per cent below the number sold in the first half of last year, and 40 per cent below the total sold in the first six months of 1992. The ABI said if the uncertainties relating to the SIB review were resolved 'swiftly and satisfactorily' and the economy continued to improve, new premium income from pensions for the full year would exceed Pounds 4.5bn and could be closer to the Pounds 6.2bn generated last year. The prospect of a speedy conclusion to work arising from the SIB review is, however, unlikely. The SIB's report on how to compensate people who have suffered from having followed poor advice has already been delayed until October. Compensating them is likely to take many months. Overall, life insurance was hit harder than pensions business, with the low interest rates reflected in low rates available on annuities causing a drop of more than half in the new premium income from annuity business, the ABI said. Alongside consumers' reluctance to make a long-term commitment to a savings plan, regular premium life policies had been affected by the relatively flat state of the housing market and the impact of this on the sale of mortgage-related endowment policies. But the falls in the numbers of policies taken out have not had such a marked impact on new premium income because of larger amounts being invested. Mr Tony Baker, the ABI's deputy director-general, also highlighted the development of more flexible policies to meet customers' changing demands, and the steady sales of policies linked to equity investments.</p>

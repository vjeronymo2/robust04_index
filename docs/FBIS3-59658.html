Compared to the  near infrared type (wavelength 780 nm) that is currently in use,  this laser will be able to record 30&percnt; more data on an  optical  disk. Two kinds of samples of this device will be shipped from  January 1994: a joint record and playback device and a playback  only device. The price of the joint record and playback sample  (optical output 35 mW) will be &yen;70,000, and the price of the  playback only sample (optical output 5 mW) will be &yen;10,000.    Optical disks use a semiconductor laser to record and play  back, but semiconductor lasers which output infrared light  (wavelength 680 nm) have not been commercially available thus  far. The light which is reflected off the optical disk and  returned produces noise, and it has been difficult to reduce  this noise enough to make a practical device.    The interference of light, which has been the source of the  noise for joint record and playback devices, is controlled by  making the fluxes of reflected light into multiple beams  (multi-mode) by allowing high frequency current (500 MHz before  and after) to flow in the laser light. Meanwhile, a multi-mode  was realized for the playback only device by using the technique  of an activated layer by which light is actually put out  (self-excitation oscillation). It is a small package size with a  diameter of 5.6mm.</p>

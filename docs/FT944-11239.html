			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (4): Zooming in on the threat of inflation - China's economic prospects Inflation is the Achilles heel of Chinese economic reform. High inflation helped cause the conditions for the Tiananmen Square demonstration in 1989, partly because of disgust over the associated corruption. Defeating the political opposition then did grave damage to the credibility of the Chinese government, while lowering inflation led to two years of real economic growth at 4 per cent, virtual stagnation by recent Chinese standards. Failure to rein in inflation this year might prove as damaging. Yet over-zealous efforts to slow the economy could also prove destabilising. The observer should examine the dilemma confronting the authorities as though through a zoom lens, starting with the close-up. According to China's State Statistical Bureau (SSB), the cost of living nationwide was 27.4 per cent higher in September than in the same month last year. In response to such pressures, argues vice-premier Li Lanqing, the authorities have to rely on a wide range of economic, legal and administrative means. Accordingly, price controls were imposed on staple foodstuffs in September, even though reformers realise that such measures are at best short term and can seriously endanger longer-term reforms. Concern about the sharp rise in food prices over the past year is understandable: food makes up more than half of the total weight in the consumer price index; food prices also rose 35.3 per cent in the year to August, while grain prices rose 54.6 per cent. Food prices may have soared, but those of machinery and electronic products fell slightly over the same period. Producer price inflation has disappeared in response to the tightening of credit that initially followed the 16-point programme of July 1993, masterminded by Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy. This picture seems inconsistent with the hypothesis of general excess demand. Mr Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the SSB, blames recent inflation on supply shocks, pointing to drought in northern China and flooding in the south. Also important has been long-needed administrative price rises for grain and other commodities this year. Mr Lou Jiwei, director of the macroeconomic department of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, points also to higher prices of oil. Such analyses offer support to the economists who question government policy. Mr Dong Fureng, vice-chairman of the financial and economic committee of the People's National Congress, argues that 'if cost is pushing up prices, demand is not the best way to control inflation.' Mr Li Yining, vice-chairman of the law committee of the PNC, insists that credit control even aggravates underlying difficulties. With supply the main problem, he argues that China needs more investment, not less. Mr Li has a point. But what is required is more investment in efficient distribution and marketing systems, which is not what current distorted incentives would secure. Zooming out to a wider angle, the observer can see that the government's efforts to control credit expansion are indeed justified, for two main reasons. First, so-called cost-push inflation is usually a lagged response to previous excess demand. In China, for example, administered increases in food prices are a consequence of past failure to adjust prices in line with inflation. Second and most important, uncontrolled growth of credit and money has become a serious threat to China's stability. Recently published monetary statistics show that the broader M2 monetary aggregate grew by 37.1 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1994, compared with 29.7 per cent in the year to the second quarter. Yet the target for 1994 had been set at only 24 per cent. Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC), attributed the excessive monetary growth to higher than planned capital spending by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), lack of budgetary restraint, large rises in wages and salaries for government employees and the increases in payments to farmers. By revealing the figures so promptly, the PBC is trying to strengthen its hand in the fight against inflation. Yet even the PBC may be too complacent about the prospects. In 1992 the ratio of M2 to gross domestic product in China was 105.7 per cent, far higher than in other developing countries (see chart). Between 1984 and 1992, broad money's velocity of circulation fell from 1.56 to 0.95  -a decline of around 6 per cent a year, (see chart). As inflation rose in 1993, however, velocity increased by 5 per cent, the harbinger of likely embarrassment to come. Mr Lou argues that the money supply can expand at 20 per cent a year without danger. If real economic growth were to be 10 per cent a year and velocity were to stabilise, this would indeed be consistent with inflation of 10 per cent. Unfortunately, recent growth of the money supply has been much faster than 20 per cent. In addition, the velocity of circulation could start to rise on a sustained basis. One reason might be the effects of inflation, particularly since real interest rates are currently negative (see chart). Another would be an understandable desire on the part of the Chinese to diversify away from money. Any flight from money could destroy economic stability. China's past monetary expansion has created a delayed-action bomb. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to halt further increases in its explosive power, let alone defuse it. One reason for the difficulty is the monetary effects of the accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves. These reached US Dollars 39.8bn by the end of September, an 87 per cent increase on 1993 (see chart). The expansion reflects attempts to keep down the exchange rate (unified at the beginning of this year) in the presence of a trade surplus of US Dollars 1.4bn in the first nine months of 1993, plus a large capital inflow (Dollars 14.7bn in the first eight months). Financial liberalisation has also created new sources of monetary growth. The assets of non-bank financial institutions - Urban Credit Co-operatives (UCCs) and Trust and Investment Companies (TICs) - have grown explosively, from 6.5 per cent of those of the state banks in 1987 to 12.5 per cent in 1992. These institutions offer state banks and local governments a way to evade central control over lending. Consequently, 'augmented' broad money, which includes deposits at UCCs and TICs, has grown faster even than M2. The most important causes of persistently rapid monetary growth are, however, those alluded to by Mr Dai. The consolidated budget deficit, which includes the directed policy lending of the PBC, has been running at an average of around 5-6 per cent of GDP over the past seven years, reaching 7-9 per cent in 1993 (see report: Reform of the central bank, page seven). If it were financed through bonds or asset sales, such a deficit need not be that dangerous in the medium term for an economy as dynamic as China's. But virtually all of it has been financed by the printing press. Seignorage - revenue derived from the government's access to the central bank, via expansion of money as a share of GDP - is estimated to have varied from 6 to 9 per cent of Chinese GDP between 1988 and 1992, an exceptionally high figure by international standards. A little over two-thirds of the seignorage came from real money expansion and the rest from the inflation tax. As inflation rises, however, these proportions will alter. But the monetary basis for seignorage would also start to collapse. The significance of such a shift for public finance can hardly be exaggerated. In 1992, for example, seignorage from reserve money creation, at some 6 per cent of GDP, amounted to just under 40 per cent of total budgetary revenues. Similarly, direct and indirect government borrowing from the PBC was just under 30 per cent of those revenues. The Chinese government is, it appears, addicted to the printing press. Now zoom to the widest angle: behind the monetary threat lies the political frailty of central government vis a vis the interconnected interests of local government and larger SOEs. Beijing has transferred control over SOEs that generate 80 per cent of total SOE output to local governments, so loosening central control over their investment. The fiscal autonomy of local government, plus its leverage over local branches of the PBC, has exacerbated this loss of influence. The resulting 'investment hunger' is revealed in the fact that nominal capital spending was more than 54 per cent higher in July and August 1994 than in the same period of last year, despite supposedly tight central control. Government economists estimate that of the 11,000 large and medium state-enterprises, one-third are in the red, while another third barely breaks even. According to the SSB, in the first nine months of this year, 44.5 per cent of SOEs have made losses. One reason is the growing competition they face from township and village enterprises (TVEs), joint ventures and imports. Nevertheless, 61 per cent of total fixed investment (and 23 per cent of GDP) went into SOEs in 1993. Much of this may not be investment at all, but rather means of disguising losses. Even where it was indeed investment, the absence of a bankruptcy constraint means that much may be wasted. An indication of this is that the share of SOEs in gross industrial output fell from 65 per cent in 1985 to 48 per cent in 1992, even though their share in gross fixed capital formation appears constant. Beijing feeds the SOEs because they offer employment and social welfare to more than 100m people. Whenever tightening of credit leads to an expansion of inter-enterprise debt, the pressure to loosen control over credit becomes formidable. This explains the relaxation of credit in late spring and summer of 1994. The inability of Beijing to control investment spending, combined with growing SOE losses, is the main reason for weak discipline over public spending. Meanwhile, political decentralisation reduced revenue, as SOEs appropriated the profits they made and local governments took control over fiscal revenue (see reforming the tax system, page seven). Despite all this, most observers assume that the Chinese path of incremental reform is stable. Hitherto, however, the contradiction between macro-economic stability and decentralised SOE investment in the absence of bankruptcy has been resolved by the willingness of the Chinese to hold extraordinary amounts of money. It would be foolhardy to assume this will last, particularly if inflation is high. The big question is whether Beijing can make the alternatives work. Funding fiscal deficits through borrowing on foreign and domestic markets - now being started on a substantial scale, with issuance of more than Yn100bn (US Dollars 12bn) in domestic securities this year - will produce an increase in future fiscal deficits, as the interest bill rises. Positive real interest rates on deposits, to persuade people to hold money, would undermine weaker borrowers or increase the subsidy bill. Raising more revenue at the centre means recentralisation of government. Last but not least, curbing credit expansion necessitates either bankruptcy for many SOEs, or greater central control over their activities. The issue is, at bottom, one of re-imposing discipline, while sustaining the impulse towards liberalisation. Further reform - to push the SOEs into the market and bring local government within a more orderly political system - is urgently required. The big question is political, not economic. It is whether the Chinese government has the will and the capacity to do what is needed.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: 'Cornet Rilke' arrives - Andrew Clark admires the music of Siegfried Matthus ASKED ABOUT artistic freedom in East Berlin during the Communist era, Siegfried Matthus quotes a saying about how the city was divided into three sectors - east, west and the Komische Oper. Matthus should know: he has spent most of his working life as the Komische Oper's resident composer. The popular opera company founded by Walter Felsenstein after the war had a privileged existence under the Communists. It promoted concerts of avant-garde music which was officially banned. It taught Matthus much of what he knows about music theatre and premiered several of his operas. But only now, as he approaches his 60th birthday, is he winning the international recognition that is his due. On Monday, Glyndebourne Touring Opera will give the British premiere of Cornet Christoph Rilke's Song of Love and Death, the most widely-performed of Matthus's eight operas and the first to be staged in the UK. Although Matthus has written a large body of instrumental music, he has made a much bigger impact with his operas. Like 18th century court composers who were part of a working ensemble, tailoring their music to available resources, Matthus has operated within clear boundaries - unwritten but understood by artist and patron - and has always made sure his operas communicated directly. Here is a composer who is modern but approachable, who understands the theatre intimately and uses his own voice to build on German operatic tradition. Matthus was born in 1934 in East Prussia. As a child he played the piano and accordion in his father's dance band. When the Red Army swept across eastern Europe in 1944, the Matthus family fled west in a horse-cart, ending up at Rheinsberg north of Berlin. Another day's journey and they would have reached Allied territory. Instead, Matthus grew up in the newly-created German Democratic Republic. As a composition student in East Berlin, his most influential teacher was Hanns Eisler - disciple of Schoenberg, friend of Brecht and advocate of the 'social' function of music. Matthus gained valuable experience composing for radio plays and television, learning how to assign specific sound colours to each role and situation. Foreign travel may have been out of the question, but unlike colleagues in the capitalist west, Matthus developed within a system that proclaimed a utopian view of art, protecting those with talent from the need to sell it. When he was 30, he had his first opera premiered at Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz). Felsenstein heard it, and promptly engaged him at the Komische Oper. Matthus had learned from Eisler how to strip a text to the bone before setting it to music; Felsenstein taught him 'how to analyse an opera from the bottom up, from a standpoint not of knowledge but of ignorance  - like a child, every detail questioned and researched. It was marvellous to discover day by day how a work came into being, to see it take theatrical form on stage'. The Komische Oper taught him what worked and did not work, and made him realise that 'true operatic music must provoke theatre by characterising situations and personalities'. Therein lies the key to Matthus's art. His operas are neither experimental nor philosophical - they are concise, singable and immediate in dramatic impact. With few exceptions, they also have a strong political viewpoint. The Final Shot (1967), a story about the Russian revolution, examines the conflict between love and ideology. Count Mirabeau (1989), a portrait of one of the more colourful French revolutionaries, is about the way individuals fashion history - not the other way round, as Matthus's Marxist teachers would have had him believe. Desdemona and her Sisters (1991) has a strong feminist message. Cornet Rilke, written for the reopening of Dresden's Semper Oper in 1985, has an anti-war theme. The text is the composer's arrangement of Rainer Maria Rilke's early novella, recounting the brief life of a 17th century ancestor who was killed defending Europe against the heathen Turkish hordes. Cornet, or standard-bearer, was the title given to the youngest officer in a cavalry division. A special knapsack edition of the poem accompanied young Germans to the 1914-18 front, inspiring them with visions of glorious death in defence of the Fatherland. Without destroying the dream-like mood of romance, Matthus interprets it as 'the tragedy of a young man caught up in the frightful events of war, who overcomes the crisis of puberty by a great love experience . . . and goes blindly to his death'. Subtitled an 'operatic vision', Cornet Rilke offers little in the way of conventional dialogue or narrative. What it does provide is a 90-minute sequence of thoughts, feelings and impressions, clothed in music of lyrical power and dramatic sensibility. Here are all Matthus's mature hallmarks - the undogmatic serialism, the dense tone-clusters, the writing of vocal and instrumental parts in similar or identical lines at narrow intervals, sometimes in canon. Another typical device is the thought-voice, a 'double' for both the Cornet and the mysterious Countess who provides his night of love. The Cornet is a trouser role for mezzo, suggesting a Cherubino-like gallantry. With only 11 instrumentalists, Cornet Rilke has the air of a chamber opera, but conjures grander visions when the chorus - in effect, Matthus's main orchestra - is in full cry. Despite one or two over-extended scenes, the opera succeeds in matching the emotional power of the poem. Glyndebourne Touring Opera's London season at Sadler's Wells Theatre continues till October 9, followed by visits to Norwich, Plymouth, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton</p>

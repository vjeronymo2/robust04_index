			<p>BFN     [Text] A reception in honor of graduates of Russia's  military academies was held in the Kremlin today. The Russian  president spoke at it. Touching upon problems of the military  reform, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin said the following:    [Begin Yeltsin recording] The main area of our military  policy is reform of the armed forces. They should meet the  actual requirements needed for sufficient national defene.  Gradually, and I stress here, gradually, the strength of the  army will be reduced and brought down to 1.5 million servicemen.  The mechanism for building the army up to its required strength  will also undergo gradual changes. There is talk about  increasing the share of servicemen undergoing military service  on contracts. We will continue to devote much attention to  developing the new military infrastructure in Russia and  providing it with everything necessary as quickly as possible.  We need to learn how to implement a balanced military-technical  policy. The root of the problem is that tasks we tackle should  correspond to the actual possibilities of the country's economy.    It is no secret that today our funds are limited and that  this is sharply reflected on the army. This is why it is even  more important to allocate these funds wisely. We will have to  reduce the number of various types of weapons and their  modifications, material support for them, the range of  ammunition, supplies, and spare parts. Multiplicity is an  unacceptable luxury right now. We need unification. At the  same time, it is also categorically unacceptable to waste in the  name of arms reduction a unique scientific and technical  potential created by the armed forces. There are international  treaties and agreements, and we will honestly fulfill the  responsibilities which we had taken upon ourselves. But any  so-called overdoing on our part is totally out of question.  This is a clear position taken by the president, and the  supreme commander in chief, and this is a demand of principle  to the leadership of the armed forces. [end recording]</p>

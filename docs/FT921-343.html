			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Letter: A different revolution Sir, The current debate in the Conservative party about the legacy of Thatcherism - reflected in the columns of Joe Rogaly and Samuel Brittan and in the letter from Amstrad's Alan Sugar (March 19) - misses the point that fundamental economic and social change has come about because of the technological revolution we have experienced over the past 15 years, not the Thatcherite revolution, which is a pale imitation of it. The provision of wider choice has been made possible by the redistribution of both control and information systems provided by microtechnology away from central command points to city dealing rooms, car production plants, supermarket checkouts and building society offices, or, indeed, to doctors' surgeries, hospitals and schools. Thatcherism aided this process by destroying the old institutional framework which would have put a brake on the implementation of the new microcomputer technology - neatly encapsulated by the Wapping dispute. But as soon as Thatcherism became in itself a brake on the process, through its inability to organise investment in human capital and infrastructure, it too had to go. The inability of free market institutions to deliver this essential prerequisite of the information age has now been recognised by all parties, although as yet only fitfully and partially by the new model Conservatism. John Smith's alternative budget - which so enraged Samuel Brittan - has neatly teased out the constricting self-interest of much of the City and business community. The majority no longer believes that what is good for Stanley Kalms, and his 'promise' of an investment freeze by Dixons if Labour is elected - or Alan Sugar, bemoaning his miserly Pounds 170,000 salary - is necessarily good for the country as a whole. Amstrad may have done well by packaging and marketing essentially foreign technology and Dixons by selling it, but in the meanwhile genuinely innovative companies such as ICL, Apricot, Acorn and Inmos have all had to find foreign owners to survive.

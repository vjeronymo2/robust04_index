			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES market ran out of steam yesterday, recording a dull session following the strong buying seen on Monday, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the FT-SE contract for March delivery opened at 2,868 and was squeezed forward in the first half-hour of trading to 2,873. However, the early enthusiasm dried up, leaving the contract to drift lower. The downward slide briefly gathered momentum when an erroneous news agency report suggested that base rates were to be lifted to 7 per cent today. The poor performance of short sterling and initial weakness in gilts dampened the mood further. The afternoon was dull, with a poor performance on Wall Street serving only to encourage the usual buyers to remain on the sidelines. March ended at 2,837, a fall of 33 from Monday's close and at a two-point premium to the underlying cash market, which it had earlier helped to pull lower. Traders said the closing turnover of 13,297 lots mainly reflected basket trading. The traded options sector was equally lacklustre, with turnover reaching a meagre 24,923 contracts, against Monday's 51,866. The FT-SE 100 option traded 6,746 lots, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option saw business of only 425 contracts. Among the stock options, British Steel was the busiest at 2,955, with the October 60 puts the most active. It was followed by Dixons at 2,343 lots.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> The world premiere of an unpublished musical satire secretly composed nearly 30  years ago by Dimitri Shostakovich to express his contempt for the Stalinist  regime will be conducted tonight in Washington by Mstislav Rostropovich, the  Soviet-born conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra. Rostropovich acquired  a copy of the score and libretto for the 15-minute "Rayok" ("Little Eden") only  recently, but will not reveal how it fell into his hands. "There are a lot of  counterfeits around," he says, "but I'm willing to put my life on the line that  this is Shostakovich's music." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

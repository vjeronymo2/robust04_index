			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMD-INTEL BATTLE NOW TANGLED IN 2 'WEBBS';  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: A MIS-ROUTED PACKAGE LANDED IN THE HANDS OF INTEL. THE CONTENTS  PROMPTED A SUIT OVER THE TRADEMARK FOR THE 386 MICROPROCESSOR.  </P> <P> An incredible sequence of events involving a mis-routed express package has led  to a new round of lawsuits in the heated dispute between arch-rivals Intel  Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices over the rights to build an advanced  microprocessor.  </P> <P> Intel and AMD are already fighting it out in several courts over licensing of  the technology for Intel's 80386 microprocessor, the brain inside many advanced  personal computers. And the resolution of the dispute could have major  implications not only for AMD and Intel but also for personal computer  companies that use the chips and for other chip makers that hope to clone it.  </P> <P> As the sole supplier of the popular chip -- often just called the 386 -- Intel  is expected to generate nearly $1 billion in revenue from it, with profit  margins in the 80% to 90% range. Not surprisingly, several companies, including  AMD, have been eager to build 386 clones, and personal computer vendors have  encouraged their efforts because they cannot get enough of the chips from  Intel.  </P> <P> With two major legal decisions pending, AMD has been coy about its plans to  come to market with a 386 clone, although it is widely expected to introduce  one soon.  </P> <P> And now, Intel has revealed that it is no longer in doubt about AMD's 386  efforts: It said it had come into possession of AMD literature about a product  line called the AM386, and on the basis of that filed suit Wednesday against  AMD for trademark infringement.  </P> <P> Intel says the documents had been sent by express delivery to the Sunnyvale  Hilton hotel, intended for an AMD employee named Mike Webb. But it seems that  an Intel employee named Mike Webb had also been staying at the hotel, and since  both Mike Webbs had already checked out, the hotel forwarded the material -- to  the wrong Mike Webb.  </P> <P> Intel's Mike Webb, in turn, passed the documents on to his boss, who turned it  over to the Intel legal department, who looked at the first page and found  logos and references to the AM386. An Intel spokesman said the package was then  sealed, and no one looked through the rest of the material. Intel filed suit  against AMD, citing the cover sheet as proof that AMD would use what it claimed  as a trademark, the 386 numbers.  </P> <P> AMD spokesman John Greenagel said, however, that it was not clear that the two  Mike Webbs had been in the hotel at the same time. "We think there has been  some impropriety," he said, and AMD plans to file a countersuit today charging  Intel with "misappropriation and conversion" of AMD property and asking for $10  million in damages.  </P> <P> The latest dispute borders on farce, but there's nothing funny about the  broader legal battle between the two firms. AMD was the authorized second  source for the previous generations of Intel microprocessors, the 80286 and the  8086, and it claims that a broad technology-sharing deal with Intel signed in  1982 gives it the rights to the 386 as well.  </P> <P> But Intel, which broke with industry practice when it decided to make the 386  alone without a second source, says AMD did not come up with the comparable  products required under the technology deal, and thus Intel has no obligation  to share the 386. An arbitrator who is hearing the dispute issued preliminary  findings that appear to favor AMD, and a final ruling is expected any day.  Intel could be forced to allow AMD to make exact copies of the 386, although  few expect that outcome.  </P> <P> In a related action, AMD last year began producing a copy of a different Intel  chip that uses Intel's copyrighted microcode, the instructions written into a  microprocessor. Intel sued AMD, maintaining that it had given AMD access to its  microcode only for internal purposes, but AMD says that claim is absurd. And  analysts say AMD deliberately introduced the chip to resolve the microcode  dispute so that it could make the 386.  </P> <P> Making a legal copy of the 386 will be far easier if AMD can use the Intel  microcode. A trial in that lawsuit is set for February.  </P> <P> Other chip makers, meanwhile, are trying to figure out ways of making a 386  that isn't protected by microcode copyrights, patents or the special provisions  against copying chip layouts that are contained in the federal Chip Protection  Act. Several companies, including Chips &amp; Technologies and two Silicon  Valley start-ups -- Nextgen Microsystems and Integrated Information  Technologies -- are expected to soon introduce 386 clones that use several  chips to perform the same functions, thus avoiding some of the intellectual  property problems.  </P> <P> Analysts say it will be almost impossible for Intel to avoid some kind of clone  competition. Eli A. Sayegh, an analyst with S. G. Warburg in San Francisco,  says Intel will certainly be hurt, "assuming the clone chips are indeed fully  compatible." He estimates that they could take 20% of the market within two  years.  </P> <P> But Intel officials note that the company "is not standing still," and will  continue to improve what is now a 5-year-old product to stay ahead of the  competition. "Intel is not nearly as vulnerable as people think," said Dean  McCarron, an analyst with the chip research firm In-Stat Inc.  </P></p>

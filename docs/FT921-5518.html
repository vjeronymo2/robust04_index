			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Kenyan police club protesters RIOT police clubbed four women unconscious and fired shots into the air in Nairobi's central Uhuru (Independence) Park to disperse a group of women hunger-strikers and several hundred supporters, Reuter reports from the Kenyan capital. Witnesses said police waded into the group of about 50 women - many of them mothers of prisoners - who had begun their hunger strike on Friday with an appeal to Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, to release all 52 people they say are in jail for politically related offences. Mr Wako has promised to review the cases but said he could not guarantee all the prisoners would be released Witnesses said that four women, including a leading member of the political opposition, Wangari Maathai, were clubbed unconscious and taken to hospital in supporters' cars. Police fired tear gas repeatedly and fired several shots in the air after some demonstrators threw stones at passing vehicles, including a bus belonging to a state transport company identified with President Daniel arap Moi. The government had ordered the women to end their protest, saying that it had been taken over by opposition supporters who were using it to cause unrest in the city. A spokesman said: 'The opposition has hijacked the mothers' strike to promote their own selfish political interests, resulting in rapid deterioration of security.' AP adds: The US has halted all new development aid to Kenya and suspended a small military training programme, a US Embassy official said in Nairobi yesterday. He said the cut-off was forced by the legislation under which the US Congress mandated a halt to all but food aid to countries six months in arrears on loan repayments. He said Kenya was six months in arrears on repayment of housing loan guarantees and the arrears would reach Dollars 4m on April 1.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / More hands on the steering wheel: John Ridding assesses Renault's prospects as the government prepares to sell some of its shares Renault's formula one racing team cruised to victory in last Sunday's Grand Prix at Monza. Yesterday, the French state-owned automobile group recorded a more significant achievement, edging ahead of rivals to be the next issue in the government's sale of public sector assets. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, said yesterday that France's centre-right government planned to float about 28 per cent of the shares in the company, one of the stars of the state sector. The sale, which could raise about FFr10bn (Pounds 1.2bn) for the government, marks a significant step in its policy of expanding public share ownership. But as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur emphasised, the majority of the company's equity would remain parked in the public sector for the time being. The decision to leave Renault under state control clarifies the scale and timing of its privatisation after several months of speculation. But it raises several important questions concerning the government's strategy and the implications of that for the company's long-term future. Mr Balladur said the government had decided to limit the sale to a partial privatisation because of the lack of a powerful industrial partner for Renault in the wake of the collapse of merger plans with Volvo of Sweden in December last year. 'I have always said that I thought Renault could not be privatised if at the same time an industrial alliance was not being created to ensure Renault's future,' said the prime minister. What is odd about this argument is that Renault's public sector status was one of the principal reasons behind the revolt by Volvo shareholders which scuppered the merger. At least as important a consideration for the French premier, it seems, was the political sensitivity of Renault. A powerful symbol of union power in postwar France, Renault has become the rallying point of the country's political left and of unions in their campaign against privatisation. 'We will fight with all the means at our disposal to prevent the sale of Renault,' declared Mr Robert Hue, general secretary of the French Communist party, outside the now-disused site in western Paris where the first Renaults were built almost 100 years ago. Union membership at Renault has dwindled since the 1970s to little more than 10 per cent of the workforce. But with presidential elections due next spring, the ever-cautious Mr Balladur - who has the candidacy of the Gaullist RPR party in his sights - is anxious to avoid a potentially damaging labour dispute. The risk of labour unrest has not been eliminated by the decision to maintain majority state control. The communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail said yesterday it would oppose even a partial privatisation. But for the workforce as a whole, the limited nature of the share issue and Mr Balladur's pledges to 'Francify' the company through extending public and employee share ownership should make a mobilisation more difficult. Apart from the risk of union disruption, the issue of Renault shares should be relatively smooth. It will involve several steps, including a FFr2bn capital increase for the automobile group, the sale by Volvo of about half of its 20 per cent stake in the French company, and the formation of a core of long-term stable investors. This means that individual and institutional investors couldbe offered more than 30 per cent of the company's shares. In most of these areas the details are already falling into place. Negotiations with Volvo have been finalised, and members of the noyau dur, or core, of stable investors have been lined up. Mr Philippe Jaffre chairman of Elf Aquitaine, for example, has said he is prepared to invest FFr1bn in Renault, which he describes as a close industrial partner. Banque Nationale de Paris and Groupe Lagardere, the defence and media company, may also join the core shareholding group. Interest from individuals and institutional investors is expected to be strong. 'Renault is one of the most attractive assets in the public sector and is one of the most profitable international automobile groups,' said Mr Eric Michelis, automobiles analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Paris. Unlike most of its international rivals, the French group weathered the downturn in the industry over the past few years without falling into loss. Earlier this month, Renault reported first-half profits of FFr1.7bn, more than double the figure in the same period in 1993. The first-half results were flattered by exceptional gains from the disposal of shares in Volvo. But Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, expects significant progress in full-year results, partly because of an improved performance by RVI, the company's trucks and buses division, and improved sales of new products including the Laguna, the upper range saloon, and the innovative Twingo mini-car. For international investors, however, the operation may prove frustrating. Mr Balladur's desire to maintain tight French control of the group suggests that few shares will be made available to foreign investors. Some investors have also expressed broader concerns about the retention of majority state control. 'We have concerns that commercial considerations may take a back seat to political questions and social factors such as promoting employment,' said one US fund manager. Most industry observers argue that such concerns should not be exaggerated. 'Renault has been managed like a private sector company for a long time,' said Mr Michelis of Kleinwort Benson. Others add that moves towards full privatisation are likely to follow. Previous privatisations such as Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals company, have been conducted through a step-by-step process, providing a probable model for Renault. 'It is too sensitive to discuss full privatisation now, but I think this operation should be seen as the first stage in a process,' said one merchant banker in Paris, although he added that full privatisation could be a protracted process. In the longer term, Renault and potential investors are faced with important strategic questions. The collapse of the merger with Volvo has deprived the French company of important economies of scale and without a partner, in an industry which has consolidated significantly over recent years in the face of intensified competition. The improvement in automobile markets this year has masked rather than resolved the threat of increased competition, maintaining the vulnerability of the smaller manufacturers. 'With Volvo, Renault would have been the world's sixth largest vehicle maker,' said one industry analyst in Paris. 'Alone it is tenth, and that may not be big enough,' he added, referring to the efficiency gains in production and vehicle development enjoyed by larger groups. Such a consideration loomed large in the rationale for the merger with Volvo, which would have yielded cost savings of FFr30bn by the year 2000 according to the erstwhile partners. The problem for Renault is that attractive partners are few and far between. 'Volvo was an ideal fit, partly because of its strong presence in the truck sector,' said one official at the industry ministry, who admitted that similar matches would be hard to find. The risk is that, as in the case of the Volvo alliance, a protracted dominance of the French state on the shareholder register could deter the potential allies which Mr Balladur believes are needed to secure Renault's future.</p>

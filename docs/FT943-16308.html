			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wembley involved in refinancing talks Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond, the City entrepreneurs, yesterday said they were discussing a refinancing package with Wembley, the debt-burdened stadium and greyhound track operator. The pair have drawn up plans for a recapitalisation that would wipe out Wembley's Pounds 152m net borrowing and could include a debt-for-equity swap. Their previous deals include the successful reverse takeover of PizzaExpress and a discounted Pounds 1.8m rescue rights issue and debt-for-equity swap at Cupid, the bridalwear group now known as Brackenbridge. Wembley, however, is understood to be discussing possible deals with other groups, and Charterhouse Bank, its adviser, said the board had not decided on a particular route. Separate talks are thought to be continuing with Live Entertainments, the promotions business controlled by Mr Harvey Goldsmith, and Apollo Advisors, the US investment group led by Mr Leon Black. Wembley has faced pressure for a substantial refinancing following mounting losses, which almost doubled from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 65.7m in the year to December 31. The company, which repaid Pounds 40m to its lenders earlier this year and is committed to a further debt reduction of up to Pounds 39.5m by the year end, has blamed large property write-downs and over-expansion for its problems.</p>

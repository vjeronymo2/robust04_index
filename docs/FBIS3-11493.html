			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Friday after five hours of negotiations between the  leader of the 3-80 Northern Front and the Government Ministry,  it was agreed that as of today the demobilization process would  resume. This process should conclude by 25 March. The final  disarmament will take place on 8 April taking into account, as  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta and rebel leader Jose Angel  Talavera have reported, the gradual demobilization because some  details, like acquiring land and implementing emergency  employment programs for Talavera's demobilized men, have yet to  be worked out.    Government Minister Mendieta reported that a member of the  Northern Front will join the Interinstitutional Commission  supervising the rebels disarmament in the country's north.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report: "Russia's New Armaments Under </F> Threat"]    [Text] In the opinion of First Deputy Defense Minister  Andrey Kokoshin, in 1993 the Defense Ministry managed, despite  the difficult financial situation, to make headway in  implementing a number of very important priorities in  military-political policy endorsed by the president and the  Russian Security Council.    This applies first and foremost to the qualitative  improvement of a number of elements of the strategic nuclear  forces, including battle management systems, communications  systems and automated command-and-control systems at the  tactical level, several types of precision weapons, electronic  warfare systems, servicemen's personal gear and equipment, and  the creation of a multirole fighter-bomber.    However, the results of all this work are under threat in  1994 because of the drastically deteriorating situation as  regards the financing of defense needs. As your IZVESTIYA  correspondent was told in conversation by specialists from the  Defense Ministry Committee for Military-Political Policy, if  current financial trends are maintained a complete stoppage of  work on creating new armaments systems can be expected.  Resources today no longer suffice even to pay the wages in  scientific research institutes and design bureaus carrying out  defense orders.</p>

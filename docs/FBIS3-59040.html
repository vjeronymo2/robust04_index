			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed NI, SH: "The President of the Chinese </F> Parliament Received in Bern; Human Rights on the Menu"; as  released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Excerpts] Bern, 24 Jan (ATSA) -- Human rights dominated  the conversations Qiao Shi, chairman of the Chinese National  People's Congress, held in Bern on Monday [24 January]. Federal  Councillor Flavio Cotti and National Council President Gret  Haller expressed their concern about the human rights situation  in China, particularly in Tibet. Confederation President Otto  Stich promised China his country's support in case it seeks  reintegration into GATT.    Mr. Cotti underlined that the human rights question  particularly preoccupies Swiss public opinion. According to  Franz Egle, his spokesman, the chief of the Foreign Affairs  Department deplored the fact that China has not yet ratified the  two 1966 conventions on human rights, which amend the 1948  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For his part, Mr. Qiao  said the human rights situation had to be considered in light of  China's development.  <H5>  Reintegration in GATT </H5>   The Chinese official's conversation with Otto Stich focused  on Beijing's wish to rejoin the GATT, Federal Department of  Finances spokesman Mario Carrera said. The Confederation  president assured Qiao of Swiss support whenever China  officially requests reintegration, once its commercial system  has been modernized. Mr. Stich and Qiao also agreed that  China's growth should keep pace with the development of social  well-being.    Aside from the human rights question, Gret Haller, president  of the National Council, raised the environmental problem, which  often is neglected when a country such as China undergoes  important economic and industrial changes. Qiao mentioned  several laws that have been adopted in this field, but admitted  that there sometimes is large distance between theory and  practice.  <H5>  Dalai Lama "Welcome" </H5>   During his conversations, Qiao Shi called attention to Tibet  and to the fact that the Dalai Lama would be welcome there for  talks with the Chinese Government. The only thing "out of the  question" would be independence. He also pointed out that the  rights of minorities are written in the Chinese Constitution,  and that freedom of worship also is guaranteed. However, up to  a certain limit: The third most important Chinese explained that  his country would accept no religious extremism whatsoever.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  Challenged Visit </H5>   The Chinese official's visit to Switzerland already has  caused protests. Some 30 Tibetans loudly protested his presence  outside the Federal Palace, which was under the protection of  grenadeers and dogs. [passage omitted]</p>

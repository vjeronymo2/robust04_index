			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.410&blank;Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The administrative wage garnishment requirements are taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide an alternative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed collection requirements in &sect;682.410(b) if a guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency uses collection agencies and administrative wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garnishment. Through these regulations, the Secretary expects to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize default collections by the Department of Education,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations implement the national wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garnishment provision in section 488A of the HEA, under which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agencies or the Secretary may garnish up to 10 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the wages of a borrower who has defaulted on an FFEL Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan or who is not making required payments under a repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Under the proposed regulations, at least 30 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before garnishment proceedings are initiated the borrower must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given written notice informing him or her of the nature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the loan obligation to be collected, the intention of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the guaranty agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights regarding the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide the borrower with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the debt,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a new repayment agreement, and receive a hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment schedule. In addition, no withholding of a debtor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wages may occur in the case of an individual who has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involuntarily separated from employment until that individual has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations would replace current regulatory provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that authorize wage garnishment by guaranty agencies in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 488A of the HEA protects borrowers by prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers from taking disciplinary action against an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the fact that the individual's wages are subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garnishment. The statute permits a borrower to sue an employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who takes such an action, and authorizes the court to award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attorneys' fees, punitive damages, back pay, reinstatement, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other remedies the court believes reasonably necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary particularly requests comments on whether there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other state laws that might frustrate the purpose of section 488A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and should be preempted. The Secretary asks commenters to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide specific information on those laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.411&blank;Due Diligence by Lenders in the Collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guaranty Agency Loans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA by requiring lenders to warn borrowers and endorsers about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the possibility that their wages may be garnished by the guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency if they default on their repayment obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

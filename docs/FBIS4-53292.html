			<p>BFN     [Text] Felimon Lagman, chief of the Alex Boncayao Brigade,  today challenged CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the  Philippines- New People's Army-National Democratic Front] Chief  Jose Maria Sison [Joma] to reveal the terms of the conflict if  it does not want a peaceful breakup of their group.    In an interview with the Probe Team [GMA-7's weekly  program],  Lagman, alias Carlos Forte, said that the conditions of the  conflict should be laid out.    [Begin Lagman recording] If he [Sison] truly rejects the  peaceful disengagement, then we will be obliged to speak out.  Let us define now the terms of engagement. If you [Sison] do  not want a peaceful breakup, let us clarify the terms of  engagement.    As what I have said, so that the military cannot sow bloody  intrigues, let us clarify the target. If you want to target me,  just say so publicly that it is Popoy [Lagman], and only Popoy.  I will also declare openly that it is only him. So that if  someone falls, it is the work of the military. [end recording]    In this regard, Lagman also said that the Ramos  administration scored anew against Joma Sison through the  government's release of Tiamzon.    [Begin Lagman recording] The Ramos regime really set up Joma  for an intense wallop. The government will get the so-called  high moral ground. If Joma continues his stubbornness, he will  get an real intense wallop.    As we said, the movement has to pursue the peace discussion  on substantial questions, not to argue on venue, and about  whatever demands. The talks should be started. That is the  solution.

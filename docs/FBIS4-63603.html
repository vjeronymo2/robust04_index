			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Federation" rubric: </F> "Duma To `Check' Regional Constitutions. Deputies Mistrust  Post-Soviet Laws"]    [Text] Today, the State Duma is scheduled to hold hearings  on the consistency of the constitutions and charters of the  Federation components with the Constitution of the Russian  Federation. According to the hearings' sponsors -- members of  the State Duma committee on the affairs of the federation and  regional policy -- the presidents of Kalmykia, Tuva, and North  Ossetia agreed to attend the hearings. The other regions will  be represented by "the authors of local constitutions and  charters." The staff of the Russian president will apparently  be represented by Sergey Filatov, who "promised to come to open  the hearings if he can." The sponsors have said that Sergey  Shakhray, who, although removed from the post of minister for  the affairs of nationalities and regional policy, evidently is  not going to weaken his contacts with the regional leaders, also  plans to be present at the hearings. Federation Council Speaker  Vladimir Shumeyko will not attend because he is currently in  Latin America, so the Senate will be represented by his deputy,  Ramazan Abdulatipov.    Aleksandr Arinin, member of the Federation Committee, said  that "the Treaty on Social Accord is designed to speed up the  process of bringing regional constitutions in line with the  federal one." A total of 17 out of 21 republics that are part  of the Russian Federation have their own constitutions.  According to Mr. Arinin, territorial constitutions "can be  divided into three types:" old constitutions of Soviet  socialist republics (in Mordovia, Chuvashia, Udmurtia, Mari-El,  Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, and Dagestan); new  constitutions adopted before 12 December 1993 (Tatarstan,  Sakha-Yakutia, Chechnya, and Tuva); and constitutions adopted  after the new Russian Fundamental Law went into force  (Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Ingushetia, Komi, and Karelia).    Activists of the State Duma committee have told your  SEGODNYA  correspondent that, in their view, "republican constitutions  adopted after 1992 are most inconsistent with the Russian  Fundamental Law." As for the "Soviet-type" constitutions, Deputy  Valentin Mikhaylov thinks, "they have minor deviations that can  be eliminated fairly easily."    To all appearances, an entirely different view will be held  by an expert commission of the Central Electoral Commission and  the executive authorities, which has recently "studied the  Mordovian Constitution as to its consistency." Even according  to the experts' preliminary impressions, Mordovian laws are  inconsistent with the new Russian Constitution precisely because  "they effectively recreate the Soviet system." Duma deputies  were not certain, however, that the commission's findings would  be made public during the parliamentary hearings.    Interestingly, at yesterday's news conference State Duma  Deputy Yegor Zhirkov, an author of the Sakha-Yakutia  Constitution, protested against the Federation Committee  members' using unlawful terms, such as "the violation of and  inconsistency with the Russian Constitution," regarding his  republic's fundamental law. "Our Constitution was checked by  expert commissions from Moscow; in particular, Boris Topornin  noted its full consistency with the fundamentals of the  constitutional order," Deputy Zhirkov assured.    The committee members promised that they would insist on  setting up "a joint commission on constitutional reform" to  include representatives of executive and legislative authorities  of the center and the regions so as "to devise a single approach  to making on a contract basis possible changes to both regional  constitutions and the new Russian Constitution."    However, the deputies themselves conceded that reaching "a  common approach" would be nearly impossible even during today's  hearings, because some influential State Duma factions think  that republics may only be formed according to the territorial  principle, while Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, for instance, even  demands that all republics be reduced "to the level of  governorates."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We realize that commenters, in many cases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feel it is preferable to have unannounced surveys for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> welfare of residents in nursing homes. However, after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> careful consideration, we have concluded that requiring all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys to be unannounced is not mandated by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, doing so would, in some cases, undermine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency of the survey process in which, for example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only thing necessary to verify compliance is a request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation or an interview with a particular part time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee who may, otherwise, not be at the facility if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey is not announced. We are, therefore, revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.307(a) to require that only standard surveys be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unannounced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree that survey schedules should be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpredictable and have made this more possible at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.308(a) by allowing the flexibility of conducting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard surveys no later than 15 months after the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey. We disagree with the recommendation that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be more unannounced inspections than presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by HCFA. The States are responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining which facilities need to be surveyed and when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surveys should be scheduled, subject to the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;488.307. The States already have the obligation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct extended surveys and complaint surveys as the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arises. Moreover, because of time and money constraints and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the difficulty of scheduling the surveys already required,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it would be unfair to place an additional burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States for conducting more surveys than required by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree that complete randomness of surveys has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been achieved but we believe that complete randomness should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be our goal. Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act provide for a flexible survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle. While the law does not specify the criteria to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to determine intervals between consecutive surveys,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States will undoubtedly use past performance as a primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion. If past performance is considered in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how frequently to survey specific facilities, the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle can not be completely random.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our intention is to strive to have surveys conducted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as random a basis as possible consistent with effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement. We are aware that annual licensure cycles may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compromise unannounced surveys. However, we believe that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over time, State licensure cycles will not be a factor in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey predictability since licensure and certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys are generally conducted concurrently. In the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that States do not move to a more flexible licensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule, this will not create a problem because licensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules will not substitute for certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. We believe that it is unnecessary to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to provide a randomization plan for the timing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys because we are already stating at &sect;488.307(b) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we will review States' procedures on at least an annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. In addition, the law does not require States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that substandard facilities have been targeted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but in examining the States' scheduling practices annually,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we will look for logical scheduling criteria and past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance will undoubtedly be one of the reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria States can use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that it is unfair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for surveyors to come into a facility without any advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice. Another commenter stated that unannounced surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not more beneficial than announced ones. This commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the Joint Commission on Accreditation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) announces its surveys and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this practice is less stressful and avoids placing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary mystique on the process since it is known that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey must occur 90 days before the license expires. (We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume the commenter is referring to the expiration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accreditation.) This commenter feels that the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective is achieved. Another commenter stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities should always be given a warning that a survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will occur and ample time to correct whatever is wrong.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We cannot accept the comments advocating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announced standard surveys. To do so would be inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with sections 1819(g)(2)(A) and 1919(g)(2)(A) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, warning facilities in all cases of an upcoming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey can undermine the accuracy of survey findings which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sometimes is predicated on the element of surprise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters proposed that paragraph (a) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.307 be revised as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``(a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basic rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All surveys must be unannounced and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their timing should be unpredictable. State survey agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must adopt survey schedules that maximize the element of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surprise. Scheduling procedures and practices must not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effect of giving facilities notice of inspections. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, inspections should not occur around the same time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each year nor be conducted in a predictable sequential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that the timing of surveys should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made as unpredictable to long term care facilities as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. However, at this point, it does not seem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical or even possible to mandate, or enforce the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unpredictability of surveys by States or to require that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys be unannounced, as explained in the response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior comments in this section. We will be looking into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of incorporating some guidance on ways in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to maximize unpredictability into manual instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Tables set for a king - Susan Moore sits down to dine at Versailles At dinner the young Louis XIV had some 154lbs of gold plate at his disposal, yet he ate with his fingers and rented his napkins. Increasing research into the use of the decorative arts in historic houses and palaces has led to new interest in the art and ritual of dining. The catalyst was the restoration of Het Loo in Holland in the late 1980s. Henry VIII's kitchen has been recreated at Hampton Court and William III's private dining room opened to the public last year. There were elaborate exercises in historic table laying at Amalienberg in Copenhagen and at Kensington Palace in London, where a display of Danish royal silver was set as for Christian V11's 21st birthday banquet in 1770. The latest and most ambitious manifestation of this table-mania is a spectacular exhibition at Versailles. Versailles and the Royal Tables of Europe presents a sequence of sumptuous displays of French gold and silver plate and Sevres porcelain, supplemented by paintings, prints, table plans and menus. Loans have come from museums and private collections from St Petersburg to Lisbon. The repatriation is all the more poignant because virtually no 17th or 18th century plate survives in France. Louis XIV transformed dining at court into a highly ritualised public display to demonstrate the wealth, status and absolute power of the monarchy. What was not claimed by successive royal smeltings to finance war was dispersed in the Revolutionary sales, as were the royal Sevres services. The greatest testament to the art of the 18th century French goldsmith is now to be found in the Palace of Ajuda and the Museum of Ancient Art in Lisbon. Joao V of Portugual was a fervent admirer of Louis XIV. His ambassador to France was asked to provide precise information on la service a la francaise. The silver he ordered from French goldsmiths Thomas and Francois-Thomas Germain is one of the glories of the show. The table is set for 48 guests; over 300 plates, dishes, tureens, candlesticks and the like adorn its snow white cloth. Dominating the whole setting is a grand surtout or centrepiece complete with finely modelled hounds, hunting horn and dead game. A snail slithers out from under the canopy of oak leaves, tortoises emerge from the feet below. The only pity is that the opportunity of presenting the table exactly as it should have been was wasted. The table is far too wide and the effect is spoilt by the rakish angles of the candles and the harsh spotlights. Pier Luigi Pizzi's design is more atmospheric elsewhere. The first room of the exhibition plunges us into near darkness and a moment of pure theatre. In the centre is a reconstruction of the 10m high column of candles, the table decoration for the marble courtyard at Versailles for a supper to celebrate the conquest of the Franche-Comte in 1674. The use of porcelain on the royal table, and the role of the royal factory at Sevres, is neatly dovetailed into the story. These brilliantly enamelled and costly wares were alternated, or used simultaneously, with gold and silver plate. Louis XV's first, 'celestial blue' service from the Vincennes manufactory (which moved to Sevres in 1756) comprised only dishes for the first course and dessert, as did the most magnificent service ever produced at Sevres, commissioned by Louis XVI in 1783. The king himself drew up the production schedule, which was intended to extend to 362 pieces. Only 162 were produced - and they were soon the property of George IV. Dessert was the apotheosis of the meal, served in a different room on a splendidly decorated table. The most successful table here displays 288 pieces of the Greek Revival dessert service commissioned by Catherine the Great, along with the silver-gilt cutlery ordered from Paris to accompany it. Its specially developed ground imitates turquoise, its borders cameos of antique hardstones. Even the vessels took their form from antiquities. Ice-cream cups came in the form of kraters, plates appeared like antique paterae. More extraordinary still is the dessert service commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate the success of the Egyptian Campaign. Its centrepiece is a sequence of biscuit-ware Egyptian temples and pylons, flanked by statues, obelisks and ceremonial rows of rams. Plate, porcelain and still-lifes are witness to changing eating habits, from the pot a oille round tureens, specifically used for the Spanish-style stews introduced by Louis XIV, to sauce boats for new butter-based sauces and porcelain tureens whose decoration alludes to the food within. Content, as well as form, was important. The exhibition, sponsored by Moet &amp; Chandon to celebrate its 250th anniversary, continues at Versailles until February 27.</p>

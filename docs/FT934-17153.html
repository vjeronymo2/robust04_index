			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Something for everyone at the party's stall - Kevin Brown watches as the conference papers over its disagreements IT WAS the admission everyone had been waiting for, and it came from the most unexpected source. 'Today,' said Mrs Margaret Beckett, 'no-one feels secure; there is no such thing as a safe job.' Mrs Beckett was not, of course, talking specifically about her chances of keeping her job as Labour's deputy leader. But she might as well have been. Everyone else was. The last morning of Labour's annual conference is always a rather unsatisfying affair: a ragbag of debates which failed to make the agenda earlier; a few points of order; the ritual singing of the Red Flag and Auld Lang Syne. This year the departing delegates had something more substantial on their minds. How serious is the threat to Mrs Beckett's job after her apparent disloyalty to Mr John Smith, the party leader, in the run up to Wednesday's debate on one-member-one-vote. In itself, Mrs Beckett's offence was trivial. She made some equivocal comments about her support for Mr Smith's plans, and she was one of the last to join a standing ovation for the leader after he opened the debate. The whole thing would have been a storm in a teacup but for the intervention of Mr John Prescott, Labour's rough-diamond transport spokesman, whose rabble-rousing speech may well have won the debate for Mr Smith. The speech transformed Mr Prescott into the darling of conference, and established him as a potential threat to Mrs Beckett only 15 months after she defeated him in the last deputy leadership election. Plenty of senior Labour figures were saying privately that the game was up for Mrs Beckett. Mr Smith was said to be furious, and Mr Prescott determined to cash in on the debt owed him by the leadership. But time is on Mrs Beckett's side. She has a full year to consolidate her position before any challenge can be mounted. Even then, any challenger would risk being blamed for the damage which would be caused by a divisive election campaign. She also has the support of key union leaders. One, a leading player in the one-member-one-vote drama, said yesterday a deputy leadership election was the last thing Labour needed. Mrs Beckett knows all this. And she took her chance in the traditional deputy leader's speech yesterday to make it clear that she has no intention of going quietly. Flanked by a glum-looking Mr Smith, she recalled her record as a successful campaign organiser, and blamed outsiders for the speculation over her job. 'We did not ask for (their) advice, nor did we need it,' she told delegates. It was not a good speech, but it was a clever one. It gave delegates the chance to blame the deputy leadership muddle on the media, and they took it. Mrs Beckett got a standing ovation, and another Labour leadership split was papered over, at least for the time being. In the end, almost everyone went home reasonably happy. The party's leading modernisers - Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown - suffered a fall in their share of the vote in the National Executive Committee elections, but performed fairly well in their set-piece debates. The left lost the battle over one-member-one-vote, but won a consolation victory on defence which allows it to claim that the socialist flame has not yet been snuffed out by the modernist wind of change. Mr Smith got the victory he needed over the trade unions, Mr Prescott put himself in line for promotion, and Mrs Beckett kept her job. For them all, it could have been much worse.</p>

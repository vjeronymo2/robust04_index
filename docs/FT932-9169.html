			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region sets more records as Nikkei declines again GOVERNMENT buying through public funds failed to spark a sustained rally and profit-taking took the Nikkei average into a third consecutive decline, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 82.42 easier at 20,532.78, after a day's high of 20,780.14 and low of 20,457.38. The broader Topix index of all first section shares gained 2.12 at 1,611,06. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 3.94 firmer at 1,246.29. Volume was estimated at 550m shares, compared with Wednesday's final 572m. Rises led declines by 548 to 494, with 144 issues unchanged. Brokers attributed the decline in the Nikkei to dealer positioning before today's special quotation for May Nikkei options contracts, which is computed from the opening prices of all 225 Nikkei index stocks. However, the expiry is expected to have a limited effect on the cash market. The surge in trading volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange during the past three months has the capacity to absorb erratic price swings. The broader indices, which ended the session in positive territory, indicated an overall firmness in the stock market, brokers said. The Nikkei's most recent downturn, they added, has resulted primarily from selling led by the futures markets, rather than from a reduction in cash market holdings. Further declines are expected in the absence of compelling incentives on the buy side; but few brokers yesterday anticipated that this would bring the Nikkei below the 20,000 level. Investors are awaiting the release of Japanese corporate earnings reports later this month, hoping to capitalise on any surprises. Foreign exchange and economic considerations, meanwhile, should remain the focus of attention. The rise in the gold price generated interest in the mining sector. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the day's most active issue, rose Y80 to Y1,110, a new peak for the year. Reports that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone will file for government approval to increase domestic telephone charges, possibly by the end of this month, pushed its shares Y19,000 higher to Y963,000. The banking sector lost ground: Mitsubishi Bank slipped Y50 to Y2,480, Fuji Bank Y30 to Y2,000 and Sumitomo Bank Y10 to Y1,990. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 115.96 higher at 22,888.58 in volume of 22.3m shares. Roundup RECORD-BREAKING performances were again seen in some Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG registered a second consecutive all-time high, with the Sino-British agreement on land sales encouraging renewed buying by local and foreign investors. The Hang Seng index was up 106.16, or 1.5 per cent, at 7,108.76 after a record intraday high of 7,130.37. Turnover increased to HKDollars 7.47bn, second only to the HKDollars 7.7bn record set in April. HSBC Holdings, recently weak, topped the actives list and jumped HKDollars 2, or 2.8 per cent, to HKDollars 71.50. Hongkong Land rose 80 cents, or 5.4 per cent, to HKDollars 15.50 on rumours that it is selling one of its prime office towers to Chinese interests. SINGAPORE saw continued strong foreign demand for blue chips, which took the Straits Times Industrial index up 30.13 to 1,858.71, its high for the day and a new record. SEOUL moved higher on late buying of large-capitalisation shares by institutional and foreign investors, taking the view that the market's recent correction was coming to an end. The composite index put on 10.53 at 610.61 in turnover of Won497.4bn (Won336.4bn). MANILA continued its slide into a fourth day, as blue chips fell further in the absence of foreign demand and the market paused to consolidate after last week's steep climb. The composite index shed 9.52 to 1,596.19. AUSTRALIA began strongly but was undermined by poor jobs data which left the All Ordinaries index 1.3 down at 1,694.4. NEW ZEALAND followed a similar pattern and the NZSE-40 index settled just 0.62 up at 1,582.4. TAIWAN ended lower ahead of a central bank board meeting to discuss monetary policy. The weighted index lost 53.65, or 1.1 per cent, at 4,664.58.</p>

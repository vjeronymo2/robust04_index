			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Because of a back injury, Australian Ballet principal dancer David McAllister  will not dance in "Giselle" tonight; David Ashmole will take his place. Anna  deCardi will appear in the title role. It was not immediately known whether the  injury would prevent McAllister from appearing in the company's mixed-repertory  programs on Saturday and Sunday.  </P></p>

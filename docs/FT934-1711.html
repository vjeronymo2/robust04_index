			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Profit not the main factor in Thorp go-ahead: Bronwen Maddox examines the government's reasons for granting a licence to the reprocessing plant Ministers have made clear that Thorp's profitability was not a central concern in their decision to give the nuclear reprocessing plant the go-ahead, even though British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, is a state-owned company. That is one of the most startling admissions in the 73-page document, published on Wednesday, setting out the government's reasons for granting BNF its licence. The report's analysis of the economic case for Thorp, one of the central questions raised in this autumn's public consultation, is particularly flimsy. It says many of the 42,500 responses to the consultation - 63 per cent of which opposed Thorp - criticised BNF's claim that Thorp would earn Pounds 900m for the UK in its first 10 years. One of the critics' main concerns is that Thorp's customers may try to pull out of their contracts, undermining the plant's profitability. Reprocessing extracts re-usable uranium and plutonium from used nuclear-reactor fuel. Since construction of Thorp was given the go-ahead in 1977, the price of uranium has fallen and fears about proliferation of plutonium weapons capability have risen. Ministers say they accept 'circumstances have changed' but say 'the contractual arrangements between BNF and its customers are the best and clearest evidence of the utility of reprocessing and Thorp'. In a phrase which may prove a hostage to fortune, ministers say they 'are not persuaded that so much weight should be placed on calculations relating to BNF's profitability'. Instead they conclude: 'While it is important that BNF should have the resources to be able to fulfil its financial and environmental obligations, this does not depend on any part-icular level of profitability'. Ministers have also noted, however, that BNF's shareholder is the state. The report does not examine whether, even if Thorp is profitable, alternative disposal methods might be more profitable when considered from the UK's perspective, including that of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, its UK customers. Wider diplomatic questions have also been dismissed. Ministers say they are convinced that agreed procedures for guarding plutonium at every stage are 'satisfactory'. The document gives the impression that ministers found that to license the Pounds 2.8bn plant was less politically troublesome than to scrap it, almost regardless of the merits of the economic arguments. The granting of the licence does not jeopardise relations with foreign governments, particularly the Japanese, and it provides jobs in a depressed part of the UK. Perhaps most important, it avoids the embarrassment of making Thorp, in environmentalists' words, 'Britain's biggest white elephant'.</p>

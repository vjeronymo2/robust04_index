			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Some stability returned to ZINC after last week's sharp price declines on the LME. The cash premium over three-month metal narrowed to Dollars 89.50 a tonne. This helped three-month metal to hold above Dollars 1,200, although the likelihood of further inventory increases in the short term will keep the market under downward pressure, with Dollars 1,180 the objective. ALUMINIUM continued to weaken, with fund selling and liquidation pushing prices to a 4 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,259 a tonne during the day. Support was seen around the lows, but a rise in IPAI production rates for May and expectations of stock increases will limit the extent of advances, dealers said. GOLD eased on the London bullion market. Precious metals remained unaffected by the escalation of violence in South Africa, which has threatened to upset political reform in the world's largest producer of gold and platinum. Dealers believe that gold now looks like trading in a range between Dollars 341 and Dollars 344. London's robusta COFFEE futures closed with small losses on key positions, but the market continued to lack any clear trend while news was awaited from this week's talks on a new pact at the ICO.</p>

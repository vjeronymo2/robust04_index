			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Hungary shows signs of recovery Hungarian industry is showing the first signs of recovery after four years of recession and stagnation, according to government figures published this week, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Industrial production grew 5.5 per cent in the year to June, taking activity back up to the levels of two years ago. There was a 5.3 per cent leap in the month to June. However, industrial production remains more than 30 per cent down on the late 1980s and disappointing export statistics clash with the latest indications of stronger economic activity.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL PLANNERS PLEASED BY IMPACT REPORT  </P> <P> A proposed luxury hotel for the site of the private Sand and Sea Club on Santa  Monica beach would create air-quality problems during construction and add to  traffic congestion on Pacific Coast Highway, according to a draft environmental  impact report released recently for public comment.  </P> <P> But the developers don't expect either problem to create a major roadblock for  the 160-room hotel and community center proposed by restaurateur Michael  McCarty, managing general partner of the Santa Monica Beach Development  Partnership.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy with it," McCarty said of the report. "This is great. You  always hope you get something like this."  </P> <P> Public comments on the two-volume, 770-page report -- which is available for  review at the main branch library and at City Hall and for purchase at the  Santa Monica Planning Department -- will be accepted by the Planning Department  until Feb. 6. A final report, including responses to the public comments, is  scheduled for release in late February or early March, according to Liz Casey,  associate city planner.  </P> <P> The project is expected to go before the Planning Commission in late March and  then before the City Council in April.  </P> <P> The project must also receive approval from the state Coastal Commission before  construction can begin.  </P> <P> Even if the developers obtain all the approvals, however, the project could be  blocked by an initiative that will go before Santa Monica voters in November.  If adopted by voters, the measure, designed to restrict hotel construction near  the coast, would block McCarty's hotel unless construction is already in  progress. A competing initiative that would exempt the project is also on the  same city ballot.  </P> <P> McCarty's proposal was selected by the city from among 11 received in 1987 in  response to a call for proposals to develop the 4.9-acre parcel of beach  property, which is owned by the state and managed by the city. The state and  the city wanted a project that would generate at least $500,000 annually in  revenues and increase public access to the site.  </P> <P> The Sand and Sea Club has leased the site since the early 1960s and had been  paying the city about $125,000 a year until recently, when the amount was  doubled.  </P> <P> McCarty's proposal guaranteed a minimum of $1 million a year in rent to the  city and as much as $1.9 million in taxes -- a total of about $2.9 million per  year after completion in 1993. The proposed hotel would have 160 rooms in a  central building and a cluster of bungalows, each with a fireplace and private  balcony or patio. There would also be two 200-seat restaurants, a  5,646-square-foot conference center with six meeting rooms, a 8,555-square-foot  banquet room and a 2,151-square-foot multipurpose room, which, for example,  could be used by the Westside Arts Center for musical or theatrical  performances.  </P> <P> The project would include a community center complex, including public changing  rooms and showers, a children's park, and an arts and environmental center. The  three-story community center would incorporate the two-story Marion Davies  North House, which has been designated as a historical landmark. It would be  the only existing structure on the site that would be saved and would become  part of the second and third floors of the community center.  </P> <P> Two levels of subterranean parking would provide 527 spaces for hotel and  public use.  </P> <P> The project would generate 2,495 total vehicle trips per day on weekdays, and  2,240 trips per day on summer weekends, numbers large enough to significantly  aggravate congestion during peak hours, according to the report. The worst  traffic effects would occur on the coast highway and on the California Incline  leading up the Palisades Park bluffs, the report states.  </P> <P> The report recommends installing a traffic signal on PCH at the entrance to the  project as a way to lessen the impact.  </P> <P> The report also recommends that the hotel building nearest to the coast highway  be built so that it steps backs as the building height increases and that the  main hotel building be broken up into three or four structures similar to the  cluster of bungalows proposed along the beachfront of the project.  </P> <P> McCarty said both recommendations are acceptable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Restaurateur Michael McCarty's plan was selected from among 11 received in 1987  in response to a call for proposals to develop a 4.9-acre parcel of beach  property that is owned by the state and managed by the city.

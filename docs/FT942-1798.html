			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Exxon credit outlook reviewed Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, put a further question mark over the top credit rating of Exxon after last week's jury verdict that the company had acted recklessly in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989. The agency affirmed Exxon's triple-A rating, but changed the outlook to negative. This echoed an earlier move by Moody's, the other leading US rating agency. The jury verdict leaves Exxon open to an assessment for punitive damages of up to Dollars 15bn, in addition to actual damages claimed of Dollars 1.5bn. The company has argued it should not pay any punitive damages. Alongside Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon has long been seen as one of the strongest credits in the international energy industry. S&amp;P also accords its top triple-A rating to Amoco. Exxon had total debt outstanding of Dollars 12.6bn at the end of last year. With cashflow of Dollars 10bn, it has a strong financial structure, said Mr Bob Weiss, an analyst at S&amp;P. Even if the jury applied a large damages award against the company, it would not lose its triple-A rating immediately. The case would probably take another two years in the appeals court, and could then find its way to the US supreme court, giving Exxon plenty of time to build up its cash reserves to pay any penalty, said Mr Weiss. However, the uncertainty could add to the company's costs, he said.</p>

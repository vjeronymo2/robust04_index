			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Dinosaurs on the runway: Small no-frills airlines are forcing the bigger, lossmaking US carriers to rethink their strategy Something is badly wrong with the US airline industry. Deregulated 15 years ago and run entirely by the private sector, it should be a shining beacon of enterprise and profitability in a global industry otherwise characterised by state-owned monopolies, inefficiency and heavy losses. Instead, it is on the ropes. US airlines carried a record number of passengers last year: they also lost more than Dollars 4bn. In the past three years, the industry has lost nearly Dollars 10bn - in nominal terms more than all the profits it has made since the Wright brothers achieved the world's first powered flight in 1903. Despite windfall gains from a recent fall in jet fuel prices, the industry is heading for more heavy losses this year. The big carriers are in retreat, hacking away at their domestic networks in the hope of discovering a profitable core. Older aircraft are being retired and orders for new ones deferred, hitting Boeing and the other manufacturers. The airlines are shedding jobs by the thousand, and asking remaining employees to work harder for less, as they struggle to cut costs. Now the industry's plight is starting to intrude into the public consciousness as labour unions fight the job losses and changes in working practices. A strike by American Airlines' flight attendants disrupted tens of thousands of passenger journeys in the run-up to last month's Thanksgiving holiday, before President Bill Clinton leaned on management to accept a union demand for binding arbitration. So what has gone wrong? The obvious explanation is that too many aircraft are chasing too few passengers. That argument appears to be contradicted by last year's record passenger numbers. But load factors can be misleading: in reality, the airlines found themselves faced with such a large surplus of capacity that they filled the empty seats by launching a ruinous price war, hence the record losses. Recession is part of the reason why overcapacity arose in the first place. The relatively prosperous years of the 1980s encouraged airlines to order new aircraft, but long lead times meant these started to arrive just as the economy was turning down. Apart from last year's upward blip, passenger numbers have been stagnant (or worse) for five years. US bankruptcy law must also share the blame. Normally, company failures might be expected to rectify the imbalance between supply and demand by putting the worst-hit carriers out of business. Sure enough, some famous names have gone - Pan Am and Eastern, for example - but chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code has given companies such as Continental Airlines, Trans World Airlines and America West protection from creditors, enabling them to go on flying, when they would otherwise have failed. More important, however, than either of these factors is the structural change being wrought in the industry by the arrival of a new wave of carriers typified by the Texas-based Southwest Airlines (see below). These have eaten heavily into the big carriers' domestic markets by offering services at bargain prices. Their fares are often a third of those of the bigger carriers. Passengers who fly with these smaller carriers enjoy few frills. The aircraft are one-class, seats are not assigned and the service is rudimentary. But the secret of the smaller carriers' low fares is behind the scenes, in the much higher levels of productivity they achieve from their workforces. For years, the strategy of the big US carriers has been based on the hub-and-spoke system - that is, flying passengers from feeder cities on the spokes of the system into a big central hub, then redistributing them on to other flights to their destination. The system is seen as the most efficient way of offering the widest choice of destinations to the largest number of customers, and has been copied around the world. The hub-and-spoke concept, however, suffers at least one big disadvantage. In order to provide for all the flights to connect with one another, they all have to converge on the hub at about the same time. That means employing the staff and resources necessary to cope with high levels of activity at the peak, only to have them standing idle during the troughs that occupy the rest of the day. The small carriers do not have to suffer this waste of resources because they do not have hub-and-spoke operations. Instead, they run highly intensive shuttle services on busy routes between pairs of cities. Staff are kept fully employed because aircraft follow one another in and out of the airport all day, and turnround times are cut to the bone because the aircraft do not have to wait for connections. Surprisingly, perhaps, the smaller carriers' staff are often paid at much the same rates as their colleagues working for the bigger carriers. Many belong to unions, too. But they work much more flexibly and productively than the big carriers' staff. Pilots spend less time waiting around and more time flying, and get paid only when they are in the cockpit. Flight attendants clean the passenger cabin in the few minutes' interval between the aircraft's arrival and departure. The result of the small carriers' high productivity levels is that the big carriers - though counting themselves among the leanest, fittest and most competitive operators in the world - have taken on the appearance of dinosaurs in their home territory, and have been forced into a drastic reappraisal. One strand of the reappraisal common to all carriers is their desperate need to cut costs - particularly labour costs, which typically account for at least 35 per cent of the total. Some airlines have shown themselves willing to trade massive equity stakes in return for concessions from their employees, as a result of which the labour unions now own 37.5 per cent of Northwest Airlines, 45 per cent of Trans World Airlines, and are negotiating for 60 per cent of United Airlines. Too often, the alternative has seemed to be a crippling strike that few are prepared to face - though American Airlines was ready for a fight, until President Clinton intervened. Meanwhile the airlines have also had to reassess the fundamental structure of their operations, even to the extent of questioning whether the hub-and-spoke concept is valid any more. At the very least, they are withdrawing from short-haul feeder routes and handing them over to smaller operators - either wholly-owned subsidiaries, as with the American Airline companies flying under the American Eagle name, or more often to partially owned or independent regional carriers. But perhaps the most significant sign of the times is the move by the non-union Continental Airlines to set up a low-cost shuttle service called CALite, which mimics the no-frills carriers by providing frequent direct flights between cities instead of requiring people to change flights at a hub. CALite also does it cheaply: it invites passengers to combine ultra-low 'Peanuts Fares' to some destinations with another offer called 'Add A Penny, Add A Pal', under which the passenger's companion flies for 1c each way. CALite is still in its early days, but its evolution demonstrates a growing acceptance among the big carriers that domestic air travel in the US has been transformed once and for all by the no-frills carriers into a commodity business - low-cost, high-volume and with little added value. Each is responding in its own way. American is pulling out of routes where it cannot compete. United is trying to negotiate a deal with its unions which would result in the setting up of a low-cost operation, like CALite, to handle short-haul domestic flights. Delta is also thinking of following the Continental example. The fact that the airlines are prepared to contemplate such radical action indicates that, although they have made some progress in adjusting to the new era, they still have a long way to go. With or without economic recovery, the turmoil looks set to worsen.</p>

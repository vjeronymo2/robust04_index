			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Henderson Land rises 15% at mid-term Henderson Land Development Company, one of Hong Kong's biggest property developers, reported a 15 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 2.3bn (USDollars 298m) for the six months to December 31, up from HKDollars 2bn the previous year. The group, which has a land bank in Hong Kong of some 18.5m sq ft in attributable floor area plus agricultural land holdings, reaped the benefit of rising property prices and rentals which many analysts believe are close to the peak. Mr William Wong, company secretary, said property transactions had started to slow in recent weeks following the government's announcement that it would increase land supply for residential use and bring in measures to curb price rises. Further tightening by mortgage lenders, introduced in February, had taken its toll, he said. Associated companies turned in healthy performances - namely Hong Kong and China Gas Company, Hong Kong Ferry and Miramar Hotel and Investment Company, which was snatched from under the nose of Mr Li Ka-shing, the property tycoon, in a contested takeover battle last June. The hotel group reported a 41 per cent rise in profits.</p>

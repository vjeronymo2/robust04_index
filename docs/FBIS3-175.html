In a  statement delivered to ANC [African National Congress] President  Nelson Mandela at their meeting in Durban on Tuesday [1 March],  the IFP president repeated the interim constitution was a  "prescription for disaster". Mr Buthelezi said however he  remained totally committed to a negotiated settlement.  "Together we could relieve the prohibitive pressure of time  and create a space to salvage failed negotiations. This would  mean extending the election period and providing for mediation  regarding the problems that are separating us."    Mr Buthelezi's memorandum, presented to Mr Mandela at the  beginning of their Durban summit, was leaked to the media. Mr  Buthelezi said that the failure to reach a comprehensive  constitutional settlement "will have disastrous consequences,  and no amount of talks in advance of tanks rolling down on  Ulundi, or of white rightwing resistance being crushed, will  justify the retention of the 1993 constitution as a [word  indistinct] of the promise to come".    The IFP president said it was glib of some leaders to say  that only elections would curb violence, adding: "There will not  be stability, and democracy will not flow from what the ANC has  done in an unholy alliance with the National Party and the  government."    "The 1993 constitution...is fatally flawed. No amount of  political dressage and no amount of constitutional rephrasing of  the text around the fatal flaws can hide them."    In addition, there was the question of the transition  process, said the IFP leader. "We reject the TEC (transitional  executive council) and we reject the decisions it makes, and we  will not be willing accomplices in implementing them."    He said there was a "very substantial" number of South  Africans who rejected the constitution and the TEC. "How, Mr  Mandela, do you think there can be fair and free elections when  millions of South Africans reject the constitution under which  it will be held? We are democrats, Mr Mandela, and we will  exercise our democratic right to oppose a constitution we reject  and to oppose the election under it."    On the issue of the Zulu monarchy, Mr Buthelezi said King  Goodwill Zwelithini had noted the failure of negotiations to  deliver a federal dispensation. "Zulus want their land back,  and they now lay claim to it and they will not listen to any ANC  talk about anything to the contrary."    Mr Buthelezi said the king's demand for a sovereign kingdom  had made recent constitutional concessions "irrelevant". "They  can only be seen to be treating the symptoms of the  constitutional malady even within the drive for federalism.  They do not address the concerns of his majesty." The Zulu  people would not put themselves and their kingdom and ultimately  their destiny in the hands of central government rule, said Mr  Buthelezi.    He added that he would stand with his ANC counterpart in an  attempt to end violence, adding that social reconstruction was  an absolute prerequisite for addressing township and rural  fighting.</p>

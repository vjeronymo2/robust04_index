			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Think ahead on gilts - What to do as redemption time nears Most gilt-edged securities have set redemption dates when the government pays back investors. This week, for instance, Treasury 10 per cent 1994 was repaid. In August, Pounds 1.24bn of Exchequer 12.5 per cent 1994 (issued in 1977) will be repaid, followed in November by Pounds 1.9bn of Treasury 9 per cent 1994 (issued in 1969). If you have either, you should be thinking already of what to do. You can either hold them to redemption and seek a new home for the money, or sell in the market now and re-invest while gilt yields are high and prices depressed. If you hold to redemption, you will get the Pounds 100 face value of the stock with no brokerage costs. But if you sell in the market now, you might well get slightly more; at mid-week, the bid price (what a seller receives) was Pounds 101.5. The extra 1.5 per cent should more than compensate for the fact that selling through the market means investors have to pay a dealing commission. The table includes some suggestions of stocks which might be suitable replacements. All have pros and cons. Gilts normally offer lower yields, as the payments are guaranteed. The stock suggested here, Treasury 6 per cent 1999, has a relatively low income yield but the return is good if held to redemption, with the net yields particularly attractive. The 8 per cent 2003 is a good all-rounder. The snag with Eurosterling bonds is that dealings are only in bearer form. Royal offers a good yield if held to maturity. Alliance &amp; Leicester also has a good yield but can be traded only in multiples of 10,000. The Fleming bond is particularly suitable for offshore or gross income-seekers. Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) have one major drawback: they do not have a redemption date. So, the only way you can get your money back is by selling in the market, with no assurance of a good price. The yield on the Britannia Pibs is good, and deals are possible in multiples of Pounds 1,000. Zero dividend preference shares offer no income as such but are highly tax-efficient, with a good total return. TR Technology is well covered with less than four years to run, while the Fleming zero offers an excellent balance of low risk and reasonable reward - but, of course, only if you hold it to maturity.

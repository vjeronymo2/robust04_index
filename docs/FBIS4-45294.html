			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wesley Gibbings: "Dollar Laundering Law Coming, </F> Says Huggins"]    [Text] Government is considering the introduction of  banking regulations which will make deposit declarations for  large sums of money mandatory.    National Security Minister Russel Huggins made the  revelation  yesterday, saying the measure would be one instrument in the  campaign against money laundering.    The matter arose while Huggins steered a motion on the  granting of diplomatic immunity to the Caribbean Financial  Action Task Force through the Senate.    Huggins was responding to a query from Opposition Senator  Wade Mark who said commercial banks should not be left on their  own to monitor a situation that provided vital clues to the  scale of money laundering activities in the country.    "Don't leave it up to commercial banks," Mark said. "One  important area of money laundering is the commercial banking  sector."    Mark described the current arrangement as a "gentleman's  agreement." Bankers have however reported some success with the  system and a number of depositors, according to banking sources,  have reportedly been turned away as a result. Huggins said  regulations would be taken to Parliament on the matter "soon."    He also defended the country's invitation to the Task Force  to set up office here, saying it offered a range of resources to  enable this country to battle money laundering more effectively.    He told Senators that the body was not a policing agency and  that it was established to offer technical advice and expertise  to counter the incidence of money laundering in Latin America  and the Caribbean.    Independent Senator Martin Daly expressed scepticism about  the institution and said a trial period of two years should be  built into the motion granting it diplomatic immunities and  privileges. He however refused to pursue the amendment when the  vote was taken.    Huggins also addressed fears by Mark that the industrial  relations climate of certain regional institutions left much to  be desired.    The Opposition Senator contended that the managers of some  institutions often hid under the cover of diplomatic immunity in  order to commit serious breaches of the constitutional rights of  workers.    Huggins however said the terms of such diplomatic  arrangements were dictated by international conventions and  practices. The motion was passed unanimously. Last Friday, it  gained similar consent from the Lower House.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, March 28 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations  Security Council held a closed-door meeting Monday but failed to  make any decisions on resolving the North Korean nuclear problem.    China strongly opposed the adoption of a resolution tabled  by  the United States and demanded a statement in the name of the  council president instead.    In addition, China requested that the statement be far  milder  in content than the draft resolution.    In view of this position, the United States, Britain,  France,  Russia and China held consultations after the plenary session to  adjust their differences on the form and content of the  council's future action.    The United States, Britain and France upheld their support  for adoption of the resolution in principle, but might consent  to the council president's statement as China demanded if it is  similar to the draft resolution in content, a diplomatic source  here said.    According to the source, China demanded that the fifth  provision of the U.S.-drafted resolution -- "the UN Security  Council will consider additional measures if necessary" -- be  removed in the statement.    Chen Jian, deputy chief of the Chinese Mission to the United  Nations, told reporters after the meeting that China favors the  council president's statement which does not include any  threatening terms.    A source here said the United States may concede to China in  adopting the statement to ensure Beijing's participation in  further UN steps on the North Korean issue.    Washington will likely compromise by referring to additional  council measures in a roundabout way in the statement.    The Security Council plans to hold a permanent members'  meeting and a closed-door plenary session on Tuesday to continue  discussions on the form and content of measures.    Meanwhile, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu may  express his support for a statement by the council president  rather than the U.S.-drafted resolution.    Han is scheduled to arrive at UN headquarters in New York on  Thursday.</p>

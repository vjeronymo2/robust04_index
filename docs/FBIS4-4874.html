			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chit Estella] </F>   [Text] The New People's Army (NPA) has resumed its small  tactical offensives and has succeeded in getting back under its  control large areas that were previously wrested from it by  government forces.    In a statement issued on the NPA's 25th anniversary, the  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) admitted that the  leftist underground movement has suffered reverses because of  errors which it attributed to those who were subsequently  expelled from the party.    But Gregorio "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal, CPP spokesman, said  yesterday, "Kasabay ng Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas at  National Democratic Front, and Bagong Hukbong Bayan ay  nagpapatupad ngayon ng kilusang pagwawasto upang puspusang  maiwaksi ang mga kamalian sa maaga at di masustening pagpapataas  ng antas ng gera at paglalaro sa insureksyon, at upang  mapangibabawan ang mga pinsalang dulot ng mga kamaliang iyon  [Alongside the Communist Party of the Philippines and the  National Democratic Front, the New People's Army is implementing  rectifications in order to correct errors as early as possible  and to avoid elevating a war that we cannot sustain to a higher  level and mocking insurrection; it is also to indemnify the  havoc brought about by these errors."    As a result of its rectification efforts, Rosal said, "Sa  iba't ibang dako muling sumisigla ang mga taktikal na opensiba  na isinasagawa ng mga relatibong maliliit na yunit ng Bagong  Hukbong Bayan na umaasikaso kapwa sa gawaing masa at gawaing  militar. Malalawak na erya ang muling nababawi sa pamamagitang  puspusang gawaing masa [In different areas, tactical offensives  launched by smaller units of the New People's Army which have  charge of both military and civic activities are gaining  momentum. We have regained wide areas through intensified civic  activities]."    He did not say which areas have returned to rebel control  but  indicated that the Ramos government has not been successful in  crushing the rebellion as it claims.</p>

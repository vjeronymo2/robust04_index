			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (16): Networks under strain - Indonesia: Infrastructure INDONESIA has experienced an investment surge in export-oriented manufacturing over the past four years, but with the increase in industry and trade its infrastructure has come under strain. The government, supported by foreign donors, has made infrastructural development a priority, but the problems of providing cohesive power, communication and transport networks in a nation of more than 13,500 islands are immense. The pace of development is also limited by a public and private external debt of Dollars 75bn, and a debt-service ratio for public debt of 31 per cent of export earnings. The government has ambitious plans for PLN, the state-owned electricity utility, to double its capacity to more than 18,000MW by the end of the decade. The current expansion programme includes 11 projects totalling more than Dollars 7bn, although not all are certain of completion. Concern over the cost of the expansion programme has led the government to seek private sector participation, but initial negotiations with private consortiums have been problematic. For the near future, there is likely to be an electricity shortfall, with PLN continuing to urge companies to shift production to weekends to ease demand during weekday peak hours. There will also be long-term constraints on the telecommunications system. In 1988, Indonesia began a Dollars 4.5bn programme to upgrade to a digital network and double its capacity, but the number of lines per head remains critically low after years of neglect. Fierce competition for contracts, and disagreement over the use of soft credits to 'sweeten' tenders, has led to unnecessary delays in project implementation. In the transport sector, Indonesia's railway network is limited to the islands of Java, Madura and Sumatra with a total track length of 6,326km. There is a continuing, but not very far-reaching, plan to rehabilitate and develop the network. The nation's port network, however, is extensive with 127 ports open to ocean-going ships and a further 222 which can cater for inter-island shipping. Tanjung Priok, which serves Jakarta, is the largest port. A development programme will expand its handling capacity to 1.2m Twenty Equivalent Unit (TEU) containers a year by 1995; twice its current capacity. The port at Tanjung Perak at Surabaya, East Java, is also being expanded, from 300,000 to 500,000 TEU containers a year, and a modernisation programme, financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, is under way at 16 other ports. Indonesia's international airline, Garuda, is planning an extensive modernisation and expansion of its fleet to keep in line with a rise in the number of its passengers which reached 8.3m in 1990. Its management has announced plans to buy 48 new passenger craft worth Dollars 4bn from Boeing of the US and Airbus, the European consortium. Whether the finance will be forthcoming for all the proposed purchases is not yet clear, but Garuda is scheduled to take delivery of the first of six Boeing 747-400s in 1994 and nine Airbus A-330s in 1996. Last year, Garuda took delivery of eight Airbus A-300-600s and four McDonnell Douglas MD-11s. Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta airport, capable of handling 9m passengers a year, is completing a Dollars 500m expansion to double its capacity.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Inflation culture limiting projects says BoS chief Bruce Pattullo, governor of the Bank of Scotland, said yesterday that the 'slow change in Britain's inflation prone culture' was limiting the number of new investment projects being launched by large UK companies. They were still seeking high investment despite low inflation. At the annual meeting in Edinburgh Mr Pattullo said 'the reluctance by management to adjust downwards the returns which they seek on new projects means that the new jobs which would be created by new investment announcements will be delayed'.</p>

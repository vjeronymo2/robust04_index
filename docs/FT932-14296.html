			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Stevens warns on media excess LORD STEVENS, chairman of United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Express, warned yesterday that the media had over-stepped the mark in recent years, Raymond Snoddy writes. The chairman of the group, which includes the Daily Star, said in the company's annual report that it was not so much the content that was objectionable but the tone. He said: 'Clearly public opinion is now telling us that we need to improve our standards. That we shall seek to continue to do.' Lord Stevens argued that the Press Complaints Commission had made a good start in improving standards although much more needed to be done. He welcomed the fact that the commission had come out against telephone bugging or tapping and said he hoped a method could be found to control the use of long-range photography on private property. Statutory regulation of the press, Lord Stevens added, would be a very blunt instrument and should be strongly resisted. There was no doubt, however, 'that the media - and in this should be included television - have overstepped the mark in recent years', he added.</p>

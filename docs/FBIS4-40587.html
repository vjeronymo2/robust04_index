			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Yuriy Kozlov]    [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev has refuted claims that Russia will not prolong  the treaty on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with  the DPRK whose validity term expires in two years. No decisions  to the effect have been taken, the minister told Duma deputies  here today.    "The question of treaty prolongation will be raised in fall  1995," said the minister. In his words, the Russian president  will take a decision after possible consultations with the  parliament.    A more updated interpretation of the treaty, including  Article 1, with due account of today's realities is being  discussed, he added. The thing is that some document wordings  "reflected political thinking of two socialist states and  include terms of that period -- on protection of common  socialist values and so on. That is why, we certainly have a  modern interpretation of the treaty text," said the minister.</p>

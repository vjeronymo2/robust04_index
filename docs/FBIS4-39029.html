			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandr Kondratyev] </F>   [Text] Talks have taken place in Moscow between Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and ROK President Kim Yong-sam. Station  reporter Aleksandr Kondratyev assesses the results of the ROK-  Russian high-level talks:    The Russian-ROK joint communique is the most important among  the documents signed as a result of these meetings. The  communique contains the two leaders' principled view on the  development of bilateral cooperation and global and regional  problems.    The Russian and ROK presidents declared that they would  develop their bilateral relations into a constructive and  reciprocal partnership based on the universal values of freedom,  democracy, lawfulness, and human rights.    I must point out, however, that all the potential to build  relations between the countries was not utilized. However, as  President Boris Yeltsin has stated, Russia has every reason to  be optimistic about the prospects of relations between Russia  and the ROK. President Yeltsin described the bilateral  relations as constructive, good-neighborly relations.    Kim yong-sam stated that his visit to Moscow and the talks  during the visit will make relations between Russia and the ROK  friendlier.    The presidents of the two countries paid particular  attention  to the situation on the Korean peninsula and, in particular, the  Korean nuclear crisis. This is very appropriate. This is  because it has been said that nuclear weapons may appear on the  Korean peninsula.    The joint communique stresses that any attempt to produce  nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would seriously threaten  security in Northeast Asia and the world.    Boris Yeltsin said that Russia is very much worried about  the  unresolved nuclear issue in this region and insists that the  DPRK remain a complete signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and completely fulfill its commitment on the safeguards  accord which it had signed with the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA].    The ROK president supported Moscow's initiative on convening  a multinational conference on achieving security and  establishing a nuclear-free region on the Korean peninsula.    The Russian president thinks that unless a decision is made  on convening this conference, it will be too early to talk about  sanctions against North Korea. He pointed out the issue of  imposing sanctions against Pyongyang may be raised only when the  DPRK tries to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Generally speaking, the two presidents highly assessed the  high- level talks in Moscow.</p>

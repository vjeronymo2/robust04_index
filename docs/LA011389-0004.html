			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HAPPILY EVER AFTER . . . THE SEQUEL  </P> <P> Stephen Sondheim doesn't finish a show; he relinquishes it. As in San Diego, as  on Broadway, "Into the Woods" (at the Ahmanson through March 5) plays like a  brilliant notion still waiting to fall into place, a riddle unconsummated.  </P> <P> But if ever a witch there was, it's Cleo Laine.  </P> <P> "Brilliant" applies to the central notion here. Sondheim and librettist James  Lapine have kidnaped some of the Grimm Brothers' favorite characters --  Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Jack and his cow, Rapunzel and her witch -- and  put them into a kind of mega fairy tale, for interesting purposes.  </P> <P> The aim isn't to spoof them. Sondheim and Lapine do take a skeptical view of  Prince Charming -- this show has duplicate Prince Charmings (Chuck Wagner,  Douglas Sills), both womanizers -- and they are a little snide about Red Riding  Hood (the wonderful Tracy Katz). Perhaps they are getting back at "Annie."  </P> <P> But Cinderella (Kathleen Rowe McAllen) is seen as being just as sweet and  blameless as in the original. All she wants to do is to go to the "festival."  Sondheim and Lapine have no problem with that.  </P> <P> And why shouldn't Jack and his Mother (Robert Duncan McNeill and Charlotte Rae)  get some nutrition out of that old cow of theirs? And why shouldn't the Baker  and his Wife (characters you won't find in Grimm -- Ray Gill and Mary Gordon  Murray) have a child?  </P> <P> These are the "three wishes" that start out the story. Innocent as they are,  they can't be achieved without a certain amount of deception, even on  Cinderella's part. This leads to the show's central question: Does the end  justify the beans?  </P> <P> At intermission, it seems so. But when a Sondheim character sings the words  "happily ever after," you know that something is afoot. Here, it's the Giant's  wife, who takes very large steps.  </P> <P> Laine's Witch is mixed up in this, too, both before and after her  transformation. But enough of the plot. It is thicker than the thorns around  Sleeping Beauty's castle, and this creates a problem. The comings and goings  are ingeniously linked; no clue is planted that doesn't pay off later; but the  show can't be watched with the mind-set that prevails at ordinary musicals.  </P> <P> We have to keep constantly on our guard. Sondheim's jumpy, motivic score and  intricate lyrics -- rendered with more clarity than either the San Diego or  Broadway company commanded -- reinforce the mood. Without being breathless, the  show rarely gets a chance to breathe, and the viewer rarely gets a chance to  share something with a character, as opposed to learning something from her.  </P> <P> This is part of the show's strategy. Act II is supposed to be the place where  the conniving stops and our friends have to face the place that they have come  to -- the end of the maze. This puts an enormous burden on the last half-hour  of the show to come through emotionally.  </P> <P> Sondheim's anthem "No One Is Alone" -- for Cinderella, Jack, the Baker and Red  Riding Hood, all very much alone at that point -- will provide this  breakthrough for some listeners, but it struck me as being an example of  opportunistic inspiration, after an evening where almost every transaction has  been seen as rooted in self-interest or stupidity. And what's this business  about giants being human, too, at a moment when you're about to kill one?  </P> <P> Laine's "Children Will Listen" seems less out of left field. This is rooted in  something that the show has actually been considering, which is the  relationship between parents and children, always either too close (Rapunzel  and the Witch) or too distant (Cinderella and her Father).  </P> <P> Forgive, forget and stop blaming: Life is everybody's fault. Those are  wonderful things for a musical to say, and one wishes that "Into the Woods"  were as wise and deep at its conclusion as it is amusing when it's skipping  through the trees.  </P> <P> Let's not scant the journey, though. There are lines in this show that make you  whoop for joy -- and not just Sondheim's lines. The bad guys are always fun,  particularly when they're congratulating themselves. Chuck Wagner's Wolf, for  instance, a gourmet wolf who enjoys interviewing his meal first.  </P> <P> The show is full of such witty and perverse conceits (no more perverse, by the  way, than in the original). And Lapine's cast is wonderfully on the mark. One  guesses that some of them -- Ray Gill's Baker, for instance -- were chosen for  musical reasons first, but they're as nimble and likable as any company that  has tripped through Sondheim's forest.  </P> <P> And this touring version has Laine, whose witch is so smashing (in or out of  uniform) that you're sorry to see her resign from the story in a snit, rather  than resolve it. I wish, I wish . . . that "Into the Woods" were perfect. But  there's much to admire, all the same.  </P> <P> Plays Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., with matinees Thursdays, Saturdays and  Sundays at 2 p.m. Closes March 5.

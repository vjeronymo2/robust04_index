			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / An uncivilised, unpleasant degree of hypocrisy: David Mellor is the victim of cant and envy from MPs and the press 'A CERTAIN amount of hypocrisy is necessary in any civilised society,' pronounced the writer Michael Wharton in his autobiography published - to insufficient acclaim - last year. Wharton - better known as the Daily Telegraph columnist Peter Simple - is undoubtedly right. However the key to Wharton's wisdom lies in the qualifying phrase 'a certain amount'. A generous amount of hypocrisy is certainly not necessary to any civilised society and in the case of David Mellor we have endured an excessive amount of hypocrisy. I am not sure how the former Secretary of State for National Heritage felt in the House of Commons yesterday as his colleagues on the Tory back benches hear-heared in sympathy. I should have felt nauseated, knowing that the same voices in less public rooms in the Palace of Westminster had sounded the death-knell of my ministerial career. There will be a lot of muttering among Conservative MPs in the next few days about how a good man was bought down by the tabloid press. That is double-barrelled Home Counties cant. If a large number of Tory backwoodsmen had not, of, their own volition, decided that the parvenu ex-grammar schoolboy from Dorset should go, he would not have gone. This is not to say that the press itself is free of hypocrisy in the sad case of David Mellor. As has been written elsewhere there are some journalists who have managed happily to combine a highly colourful lifestyle with a very demanding job, and who have nonetheless found it quite impossible to concede that Mellor should be allowed to share the same combination of private and public pleasures. Then there are those who have not enjoyed such a potent mixture of experiences. This is envy, rather than hypocrisy, and much the worse for that. In so far as the affair with the actress was concerned, it was completely self-serving for the newspapers, either tabloid or broadsheet, to pretend that the matter was one of public interest. It was claimed by the newspaper which broke the story that the public interest consisted in the fact that Mellor was unable to do his job properly. That could only have been demonstrated by an analysis of his output as a minister. Tape-recorded conversations of lovers' conversations demonstrate nothing except possibly a man's suitability as a lover. It must, I suppose, be stated wearily yet again that the overriding motive of the down-market tabloid press was to see which could titillate its readers the most as part of a brutal circulation war in a declining market. Then there is the question of Mellor's free holiday , or rather the free holiday of the Mellor family. The allegation of the newspapers is that Mellor had somehow been 'bought', that he would in some unspecified way have returned some ministerial favour to the provider of the holiday. Do you ever wonder why the travel sections of the newspapers are always so full of uncritical crooning descriptions of exotic holidays which few can afford? Because the journalist, and sometimes his immediate family, has been paid for by the travel company involved. This is absolutely common practice among our national newspapers. Indeed I would not be overwhelmed with surprise if it turned out that one or two of the leader writers who condemned Mellor for his free holiday, had in the past, themselves been the recipient of one of these professional gifts. The only difference is that Mellor did not subsequently take the opportunity to write that others should consider going to the same place for their holiday, and but pay for it. But my gold award for hypocrisy must go to Bryan Gould, who rejoices in the title of Shadow Heritage secretary. On Wednesday Gould pronounced that Mellor was a disgrace to his office and should be dismissed. On Thursday, once his wish had been granted, Gould sanctimoniously declared that Mellor was a great loss to his ministry and would be impossible adequately to replace. A certain amount of hypocrisy is indeed necessary in any civilised society. But how much is necessary to render society uncivilised? Dominic Lawson is the editor of The Spectator</p>

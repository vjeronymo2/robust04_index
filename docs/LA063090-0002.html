			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPEDIMENTS? NO PROBLEM ;  </P> <P> TRICKY TOKYO-WASHINGTON TRADE PACT  </P> <P> The proposed trade agreement between Japan and the United States will be a  stunning success if it helps reduce the $49-billion trade imbalance between the  two nations. But a future healthy relationship between the two economic giants  dictates that the political will to make the agreement work must be found  first.  </P> <P> That's the hard part.  </P> <P> Indeed, it took the personal intervention by phone of President George Bush and  Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu before four days of marathon trade talks  yielded the unusual trade pact. The agreement, concluded after a year of  contentious negotiations, calls for the United States to take stronger action  to reduce its federal budget deficit, increase savings, promote exports,  improve education and encourage competition. In turn, Japan agreed to increase  its public works spending sharply to $2.7 trillion over the next 10 years,  simplify its import process and strengthen its anti-monopoly laws.  </P> <P> The two nations have finally conceded to bilateral commitments that could have  profound effects on their domestic policies. Given political realities,  initiating fundamental changes in the economic, legal and social structures of  each nation is necessary, but difficult.  </P> <P> So it's no surprise that some skepticism has greeted the first full agreement  under the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative, the Administration's  mechanism to address touchy U.S.-Japan trade relations in order to shield it  from a protectionist backlash in Congress.  </P> <P> Some experts question the validity of economic assumptions behind this pact;  others doubt that Bush and Kaifu and their respective governments will mount  the politically unpopular domestic political offensives needed to meld their  international agendas.  </P> <P> Perhaps not coincidentally, Bush's big turnabout on his campaign pledge of no  new taxes came during an impasse in the SII talks. The next day, Japanese trade  negotiators agreed to raise Japan's public works spending, citing the  President's willingness to increase U.S. tax revenues to tackle the budget  problem.  </P> <P> Bush's careful nurturing of telephone diplomacy with Kaifu has helped the prime  minister politically. He comes from a weak faction of the Liberal Democratic  Party, the ruling party of Japan.  </P> <P> The LDP, as well as all of Japan, is groping for a new vision for the 1990s. In  the past, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has painted pictures  of 10-year cycles of economic and industry-specific development. Its latest  preliminary policy report, though vague in parts, pointedly encourages consumer  spending. That means at least they're listening.  </P> <P> What happens now?  </P> <P> Bush has to curb spending, Kaifu has to increase it. Their agendas are no  longer mutually exclusive. In fact, they will be assessed by the same  yardstick: a decline in the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance.  </P></p>

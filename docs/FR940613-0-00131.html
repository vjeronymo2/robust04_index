			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Response: Because current program funding is limited, the Department is concentrating on PHAs that are required to participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) In the definition of ``vacant unit,'' the proposed rule does not specify a timeframe for determining the existence of a vacancy. Similarly, in calculating a PHA's vacancy rate for purposes of determining program eligibility, the proposed rule does not recognize any normal turnover time, such as the 20-day transition period allowed under PHMAP Indicator 5. (LACHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department recognizes that the vacancy rate of a PHA is fluid. However, for the purpose of determining eligibility for the program, the Department has decided to use a snapshot approach, i.e., the number of units vacant at the PHA on the appropriate date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Development of the Vacancy Reduction Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The proposed rule provides a number of examples of project-specific activities to eliminate vacancies that a PHA might include in its vacancy reduction plan. The number of examples should be expanded to include such activities as unit redesign or conversion, site reconfiguration, security improvements, and density reductions. These additional examples will serve to give a better idea of the range of acceptable activities. (CLPHA, CHA) Similarly, examples of specific management improvements that should be encouraged include tenant screening, evictions, and marketing and leasing efforts. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of these examples have been included in &sect;968.407(b)(3)(i) of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If demolition or disposition are selected activities, HUD's review and approval process and replacement housing requirements will make it very difficult for a PHA to provide the required schedule that forecasts when the selected activities would be accomplished. (CLPHA, PHADA (similar comment for other HUD actions)) In addition, participating PHAs need to be able to change their schedules for eliminating vacancies to reflect actual funding. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 968.407(b)(3)(ii) and 968.407(b)(8) have been revised to include language providing that, in developing the required schedule, PHAs should specify action within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  days from HUD approval or other action, when progress is dependent on HUD action. In addition, a schedule may be revised to reflect the adequacy of funding for proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If a PHA needs help in preparing the vacancy reduction plan, the assessment team should be required to assist in the plan development, if requested by the PHA. The proposed rule does not make this assistance mandatory. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 968.410(d) has been changed to clarify that, if requested by the PHA, HUD will assist a PHA in preparing its vacancy reduction plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The final rule should clarify that participating PHAs do not have to address each single vacant unit separately, but should be permitted to group together vacant units by the cause of vacancy. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the statutory requirements, each vacant dwelling unit must be identified. However, vacant units may be grouped together for purposes of explaining the reasons for the vacancies and proposed actions for eliminating the vacancies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The vacancy reduction plan should include information on turnover problems. (PHADA, AHA) The information should include the number of units vacated and reoccupied during a defined period and any indication of whether the turnover rate is changing. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new paragraph has been added to &sect;968.407(b) to require that a vacancy reduction plan include certain information on a PHA's turnover rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A complete strategy needs to be developed that includes not just rehabilitation work, but tenant screening, eviction, property management, and security measures, as well. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department and the statute contemplate a complete strategy. A PHA's vacancy reduction plan should include any action to remove the unit from the PHA's inventory of vacant units, including management improvements in each of the specific areas mentioned by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Assessments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) If funding will be on a ``first-come, first served'' basis, the sequence of assessment team visits should be by public drawing in order to avoid charges of favoritism. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the NOFA published today, the Department has decided upon an approach that should provide some funding to all PHAs that meet the eligibility criteria. Each eligible PHA that is a Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) agency will be funded fully for all eligible units and approved activities, because smaller PHAs dependent on CIAP funding often have fewer resources to solve a vacancy problem. If sufficient funds are available, each PHA that is a Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) agency will be funded fully; however, if there are not sufficient funds remaining, each CGP agency will be awarded a pro rata share of the available funding. This pro rata share will be calculated by a method, to be determined by HUD and announced in the NOFA, that will provide funding equitably to those agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When the PHA already is required under PHMAP to have developed a plan to address its vacancy problem, the primary purpose of the Vacancy Reduction Program assessment team should be a validation or critique of the PHA's existing plan, rather than an independent assessment. The intent of the program is to encourage action, not further studies. (PHADA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute requires an on-site assessment of the vacancy situation of each participating PHA, and specifies what is to be included in the PHA's vacancy reduction plan. To the extent that a PHA is able, the Department encourages the PHA to use work that has been done in accordance with PHMAP requirements to comply with the requirements of this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

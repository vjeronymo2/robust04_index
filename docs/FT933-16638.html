			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / City leaders back checkpoint cordon BANKING and business leaders yesterday backed the decision to ring the City of London with police checkpoints from midnight tonight in an attempt to combat terrorism. They had warned that without greater security London's reputation as an international financial centre could be damaged. 'We welcome these proposals,' the Stock Exchange said. 'We have been wanting improved security for some time.' Under the scheme, unveiled by the City of London police yesterday as the first stage in a package of measures, 18 access roads leading into the Square Mile - the financial centre which surrounds the Bank of England - will be closed to traffic. Twenty-four hour police check points, with powers to stop and search suspicious vehicles, will be mounted on seven other entry points. An eighth, on the edge of London Wall and Moorgate, will be limited to buses and taxis. The Treasury yesterday denied that the cordon would undermine London's reputation as a financial centre. 'This can only be good for London. The fact is that terrorism is an international threat,' it said. Mr Owen Kelly, the City of London police commissioner, said the scheme had government backing and shrugged off charges that the measures might be playing into the hands of the IRA. 'If we allow the terrorists to plant another large bomb just think what a propaganda coup that would be,' he said. In addition to the checkpoints, other security measures will include the deployment of powerful video cameras, the use of new electronic sniffers and increased numbers of sniffer dogs, the experimental use of X-ray systems to examine the contents of vans and the deployment of more police across the city. Mr Kelly said the measures were planned for a 12 month period, pending a public inquiry into a tougher set of security schemes currently being drawn up by the Corporation of London.

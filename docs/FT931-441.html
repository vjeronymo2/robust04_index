			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Observer: Smart cards Have you got Mr Figgures, the treasury mandarin? No, but I have got Mr Trend, Mr Forecast and Mr Fudge. Veterans of Whitehall in the 1950s and 1960s fondly remember the days when they could play Happy Families. Sir Frank Figgures, second permanent secretary to the treasury in the late 1960s, headed the pack. Completing the numerically-inclined family were Kenneth Forecast, director of statistics at the board of trade from 1958-66, and Burke St John Trend. Last, but not least, was Edward Fudge listed in Who Was Who as undersecretary at the ministry of fuel in 1947. Contemporaries, however, remember him at the treasury; when the phone rang, he used to bark 'Fudge' into the mouthpiece. Wouldn't sound too out of place today.</p>

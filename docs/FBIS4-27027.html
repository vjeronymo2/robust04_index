			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese Vice  Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stressed here today  that China is ready to expand friendly and cooperative relations  with Russia.    Speaking at the Moscow State University, Qian said  establishing and developing good-neighborly and friendly  relations with neighboring countries has occupied a significant  position in China's foreign policy.    Furthering good relations with Russia, China's largest  neighbor, has a special significance for the Chinese foreign  activities, he said.    China and Russia, two of the powers in the world, may  contribute to world peace, stability and development if they  strengthen their bilateral cooperation, said the Chinese vice  premier.    Since the end of 1992, when Russian President Boris Yeltsin  visited China, bilateral relations have developed quickly in  various spheres covering politics, economy, science and  technology, education and culture, Qian said.    Trade volumes between the two countries have hit the highest  level in history, he added.    However, Qian admitted there have emerged some problems in  bilateral expanded contacts, mainly in the trade sphere  involving individual businessmen, because of a lack of timely  laws and regulations.    The Chinese Government is against illegal trade activities  and illegal immigration, Qian stated, stressing the need for  both governments to strengthen cooperation in protecting  organized and normal trade between citizens of the two countries.    China and Russia, with huge economic potentials  respectively,  may complement each other in economy, and have big prospects for  developing friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of  equality and mutual benefits, the Chinese vice premier said.    He underlined the need for both nations to make big efforts  to expand bilateral cooperation in the fields of economic-trade,  science and technology, raise level and quality of cooperation  and and create conditions to bring bilateral trade step by step  into internationally-normal way.    While visiting China, Russian leaders including President  Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and parliament's  lower house chairman Ivan Rybkin have reaffirmed that Russia  sees its relations with China as one of priorities in its  foreign policy, Qian said.    During his upcoming visit to Russia in autumn, Chinese  leader  Jiang Zemin is expected to discuss the future of bilateral  relations between China and Russia with Yeltsin, procced from  the view of the next century, the Chinese vice premier noted.    Faced with the complicated international situation, he said,  China will firmly continue to pursue an independent peaceful  foreign policy and develop friendly and cooperative relations  with foreign countries on the basis of the five principles of  peaceful co- existence.    China, which is concentrating its efforts on economic  development, will not join any arms race, will not join any  military bloc, will never seek hegemony and will always stand  firm as a strong safeguard of world peace, Qian stated.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Clinton acts on gays in military PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday announced a compromise approach to the controversial issue of ending the 50-year ban on homosexuals serving in the US military. He announced that the military would immediately stop screening recruits for sexual orientation. He directed Mr Les Aspin, secretary of defence, to prepare by July 15 an executive order ending the proscription on homosexual service but including a strict new code of conduct covering sexual behaviour. Meanwhile, all legal actions seeking the discharge of gays from the armed services are to be suspended. Also in the interim, Congress will hold its own hearings on the issue. Senator Sam Nunn from Georgia, Democratic chairman of the armed service committee and the most potent congressional critic of Mr Clinton's initiative, said that he was satisfied with this approach, the essence of which was hammered out by the president and himself, along with Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, in the White House on Thursday night. Mr Clinton's hand had been temporarily strengthened on Thursday when a federal judge in California declared the ban unconstitutional. However his ruling only applied to the parts of the state in his jurisdiction. Making the announcement in person at the White House, the president emphasised again that he was standing on principle. 'I believe that American citizens who want to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualifies them from doing so,' he said. But he conceded that 'military life is fundamentally different' and might well impose 'necessary restrictions on behaviour, many of which would be intolerable in civilian society.' This is a clear invitation to Mr Nunn and the chiefs of staff under General Colin Powell to revise the military code of conduct so as to meet some, if not all, of their fundamental objections to admitting homosexuals. These have centred on the implied threats to morale, efficiency and privacy. 'I agree with the joint chiefs that the highest standards of conduct must be required,' Mr Clinton said. 'This cannot be accomplished overnight.' Some Republicans continued yesterday to threaten to frustrate the president's initiative, the fulfilment of a campaign promise as well as a question of principle. But Sen Mitchell was confident he had the votes to stop any legislative trickery and Mr Clinton urged the opposition not to 'play politics' by tagging amendments on to the family leave bill. Mr Clinton said he hoped the agreed approach would now leave his new administration free to concentrate on his promised economic reforms.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Development of the European fighter aircraft, the  Eurofighter, is running behind schedule and the costs are  escalating accordingly. The Defense Ministry is currently  examining calls from the industry for several hundred million  German marks [DM] occasioned by sluggish development, technical  modifications, and the usual price increases. It is understood  that a sum of up to DM670 million is at stake, only DM300  million of which are regarded as justified in Defense Ministry  circles. However, the ministry does not intend to give an  official assessment of the industry's demands until the  Eurofighter has undertaken a successful maiden flight. This is  not expected to take place until next spring.    The fighter's maiden flight has already been postponed  several times because considerable technical problems have  arisen in the flight control system. After Gripen-type test  aircraft crashed in Sweden, the industry decided to proceed with  extreme caution. The Defense Ministry now expects the maiden  flight to take place in April 1994. Only when a test flight has  been successfully accomplished will the ministry enter into  negotiations over the increased development cost. The industry  is, of course, prepared to bear part of the extra cost, because  it is itself responsible for the delay in development.    At the Defense Ministry they say that the negotiations on  the  new development price will be extremely difficult and could take  months, because the economic situation has hardly put industry  in a mood for compromise. The industry's demand is referred to  as mere figure-work that can only serve as a basis for an  initial position. If the extra development costs were accepted,  they could only be billed on completion of the development work,  thus not affecting the Bundeswehr's current budget.    The technical and military requirements that the aircraft  will have to meet so that the sale price can be reduced will  also be decided by next spring. The heads of the air forces of  the four countries involved (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy,  and Spain) will decide in January on the new performance  specification. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe had referred to  DM90 million as an ideal price, but the industry has so far  scaled its calculations down from DM123 to 102 million.  According to a Defense Ministry report, preparations for  production are now scheduled to begin in 1996 owing to the  development delay, so Parliament could vote whether or not to  purchase the aircraft in 1995.    Daimler-Benz group subsidiary German Aerospace AG (DASA),  which is based in Munich, does not rule out a withdrawal from  the defense sector if the defense budget suffers further  reductions. DASA intends to cut 2,500 of its remaining 11,600  jobs in its defense and civil systems business division by the  end of 1996.</p>

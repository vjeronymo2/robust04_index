			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During the induction of Professor Hans-Juergen  Warnecke as the new chairman of the Fraunhofer Society (FhG),  Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger acknowledged the work  of the outgoing chairman, Professor Max Syrbe, in an address  given before leading representatives of the scientific,  industrial, and political spheres. His chairmanship had  consciously oriented the FhG toward entrepreneurial goals. The  FhG's mission as the link between science and industry was of  growing importance. In the FhG, Germany had a successful model  for breaking down barriers between its roles as a scientific  country and an industrial country.    The FhG was thus making a major contribution to raising the  productivity of the German economy. The rapid conversion of  outstanding basic research findings into products on markets was  a priority aspect of research and technology policy in the  Federal Republic for the coming years.    A glance at the FhG's business trend gives impressive  evidence of its success: The number of institutes rose from 15  in 1965 to the current figure of nearly 50. Its overall budget  rose from 20 million German marks [DM] in 1965 to the current  sum of nearly DM1 billion. The FhG now faces the task of  consolidating and building on this business success over the  coming years. This will mean raising the industrial earnings  share of the FhG's overall budget above the current figure of  about DM200 million.    The FhG has made a considerable contribution to the creation  of a unified research scene in Germany since 1989. The Federal  Government welcomes the decision that the FhG Senate took on 27  October 1993 to make 16 of the total of 22 Fraunhofer institutes  and regional branches in the new federal laender eligible for  funding on an indefinite basis at this early date, thus  safeguarding over 1,000 permanent research and development posts.    The FhG facilities in the new federal laender fully lived up  to the expectations placed in them in 1992. With 22 percent of  earnings, they exceeded the 15 percent target assigned to them  by a long chalk. The institutes scored a great success with the  acquisition of project funds totaling approximately DM24  million, primarily from the Federal Government but in part from  the governments of the new laender as well. Their high rate of  participation in joint projects shows that these facilities are  capable of holding their own against competition from their  western counterparts as well. The Fraunhofer facilities'  performance of DFG [German Research Association] projects and  participation in special research programs in particular also  provided proof of their scientific quality.    The Fraunhofer facilities were also successful in obtaining  contracts from private industry: Of their overall contract  earnings totaling DM14 million, two-thirds came from western  companies and one-third from firms in the new federal laender.  The Fraunhofer facilities have become a major factor in the  R&amp;D  infrastructure in the new laender, where they are contributing  to reconstruction.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOICES CONCERN ABOUT 'LATENT RACISM' AND WORKING HOMELESS;  </P> <P> QUAYLE PROMISES TO HELP GOP SHED UNCARING IMAGE  </P> <P> Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, insisting that his own image has been badly  distorted, has vowed to help reposition the Republican Party and "cast aside  this stereotype image that Republicans somehow don't care" about the inner-city  poor and minorities.  </P> <P> And last Friday, he demonstrated at least a rhetorical sensitivity that often  has been missing from the Reagan Administration, expressing concern about  "latent racism" in America and saying that he found it a "startling fact" and a  "sad comment" that 25% to 30% of the homeless "are working and can't afford a  home."  </P> <P> "It's not by choice, not by desire. A lot of these people work," he said of the  homeless. "It's hard to think . . . that in America someone that works can't  afford a home, can't afford housing, and that's something that has to be  changed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Part of GOP Strategy  </P> <P> Quayle's comments, in an interview Friday that was being released today, appear  to reflect a role he will play as vice president. Republican strategists hope  that as a young, energetic and attractive campaigner, he can serve as a party  leader for the next generation, broadening the GOP's current white, male,  Protestant base.  </P> <P> At the same time, Quayle's statements and background suggest that he has only  limited experience with the sorts of voters the party hopes he will be able to  reach.  </P> <P> Both President-elect Bush and Lee Atwater, Bush's choice for party chairman,  have warned that the GOP must either change with the changing demographics of  the nation or resign itself to permanent minority status.  </P> <P> In keeping with that goal, Quayle's sympathetic statements about the problems  of racism and the homeless were a marked contrast to those often made by Reagan  Administration officials, including the President. Reagan, for example, only  recently reiterated his view that many homeless people live on the streets as a  matter of choice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Confront Skepticism  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Quayle may face a measure of skepticism about his own credentials  as the Republican Party's ambassador to cities and minority groups.  </P> <P> To begin with, he is the product of a state that is overwhelmingly white,  Protestant and traditionally Republican. The Indiana electorate is about 8%  black. And Quayle said his own polls show that in his 1986 Senate race, when he  won 61% of the total vote, his approval rating among black voters was about  35%.  </P> <P> When asked if he had any black advisers, Quayle cited an advisory committee on  minority issues that he met with "once or twice a year" as a senator from  Indiana. But he could remember the name of only one member.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Listen to People  </P> <P> And after saying that the new Administration needs to "crusade on these issues"  -- drugs, homelessness, high school dropout rates -- he repeatedly declined to  offer any specific policy suggestions for such a crusade. His job, Quayle said,  will be to listen to what people say who are "out where these problems exist."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Than Money  </P> <P> Asked about the possibility of the Bush Administration seeking increased  federal resources for problem areas, a suggestion frequently made by big-city  mayors, Quayle said: "I hope we don't get into this situation of saying only  money counts."  </P> <P> And his public image -- an unfair perception, he insists -- remains that of a  sheltered scion of a wealthy family with little knowledge of the country's less  affluent sections. Even his vice presidential campaign manager, longtime  California political consultant Stuart K. Spencer, said during the campaign  that Quayle knew little about the people or problems of the inner cities.  </P> <P> Spencer's statement was "just flat-out wrong," Quayle said.  </P> <P> The truth, the vice president-elect said in the interview, is that he has  considerable expertise on such issues as education and unemployment.  </P> <P> Changing his negative image is the first task Quayle has taken on. After a  campaign in which he was shunted more and more out of the spotlight as Election  Day neared and a post-election period of avoiding all on-the-record interviews,  Quayle and his advisers have decided that the time has come to re-emerge  publicly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aims for New Profile  </P> <P> "I made a calculated decision" to avoid publicity after the end of a  "difficult" campaign, Quayle said. Now, with Inauguration Day approaching, "I  will have a different profile."  </P> <P> To build the new profile, Quayle has begun a blizzard of press and television  interviews all timed to run during the week of the inauguration.  </P> <P> Next, he says, will come speeches and some political events, including  fund-raisers for some of his House and Senate friends, some of which he said  already had been scheduled, although he declined to discuss details.  </P> <P> After that, Quayle said, he hopes to visit some cities, traveling to poor  neighborhoods to talk, particularly with children, about the problems they face  with drugs, poor schools and crime. He said that he hopes to be able to sit  down in small groups and ask such questions as "why is crime acceptable?" as a  way of life in some communities.  </P> <P> "I've got a good track record" on issues such as unemployment and urban  poverty, he insisted. The record, he said, is unknown to much of the public  because "they have not been told."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alludes to His Record  </P> <P> While he did not discuss such issues during the campaign and almost never  visited a major city, "the campaign was three months, and my legislative record  is eight years. You take your choice."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, both he and Bush's aides insist that Quayle will be included in the  decision-making of the Administration-to-be.  </P> <P> "The only Cabinet appointment that I did not give my prior advice on was  secretary of state," for which Bush chose his close friend and campaign manager  James A. Baker III, Quayle said. In addition, he said, he has been promised  full access both to Bush and to the paper work that flows through the Oval  Office, a pledge reiterated Friday by John H. Sununu, Bush's designee as chief  of staff.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 13 January (TANJUG) -- The President of  the Muslim Presidency in Sarajevo, Alija Izetbegovic, has spoken  of further armed struggle for a united Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the survival of Islam in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At a session late last night in Sarajevo, the Party of  Democratic Action [Stranka Demokratske Akcije--SDA] elected its  new organs and leadership. Addressing the session he said that  "everything is different now" because his forces number 200,000  soldiers. The SDA leader said that the war in Bosnia would  continue until the Serbs gave up all the territories which had  been predominantly populated by Muslims before the outbreak of  the conflict.    Advocating again an undivided Bosnia, Izetbegovic admitted  openly for the first time that the Muslims had organized  themselves for armed secession from Yugoslavia ten months before  the outbreak of war on 6 April 1992. "I would like to recall a  meeting in the Police Hall in Sarajevo on 10 June 1991 attended  by 380 people from the entire former Yugoslavia and the  declaration we issued then, ten months before the beginning of  the war. In that declaration we heralded the beginning of  Bosnia-Herzegovina's armed defense."    Izetbegovic said that the Muslims ought to continue along  this path while opening up the party to members of other  peoples. The SDA should admit all those who are willing to  fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. In his view the main  criterion for membership is "whether or not someone has remained  loyal to the people" referring obviously to the Muslim people he  leads.    Despite the fact that a vast majority of Serbs and Croats  have opted for their independent republics, Izetbegovic said for  the umpteenth time that they, too, ostensibly wanted a united  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "There is no united Bosnia without the Serbs and Croats as  all the Muslims, most of the Croats and a considerable number of  Serbs want a united Bosnia-Herzegovina", he said. "There are two  stages of struggle. The one phase of struggle for Bosnia's  integration is of a military nature, the other is political. I  used to quote that poet of ours who said: "By God we swear we  shall not be slaves."    At the same time Izetbegovic commented on the claims that he  wanted to create an Islamic republic.    "I am telling you clearly here that I am not in favor of an  Islamic republic. Yet, I do want Islam to survive in these  lands. We want to remain what we are. I do not know why we  should do this. We illustrate here, European Islam. We  illustrate a kind of modern Islam", he said.    "To this end we can do a great deal for both the East and  West," the leader of Muslims said in conclusion and added that  they would try to achieve this as democrats.</p>

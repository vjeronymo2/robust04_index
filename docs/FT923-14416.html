			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Surveys of business opinion seen as lacking credibility Sir, So the Institute of Directors has joined those whistling to keep their courage up about the continuing recession ('Confidence firm, says IoD', July 6), but how much can we credit these surveys of business opinion? We all remember the March Confederation of British Industry survey which declared on the eve of the general election that recovery was round the corner. Indeed, a story on the same page as the IoD story undermines its credibility. Here, you report the Ernst &amp; Young Item forecasting group envisaging 'a 0.6 per cent decline in output this year after a 2.4 per cent fall last year'. A week ago Dun &amp; Bradstreet reported that company failures in the first six months of this year rose to 30,722, 33 per cent up on the same period in 1991. Are any of the managers of these companies questioned about their 'confidence'? Many members of this union who have lost their jobs this year treat these management surveys with derision, and rightly so. They appear to be more concerned with giving aid and comfort to a failed government rather than reveal the truth about the economy. If one can give any credence to the IoD survey, then the fact that 'confidence' has continued to fall among manufacturing and distribution companies should ring the alarm bells. More jobs are going to be lost in this vital sector in the months to come - and that is going to make it even more difficult for Britain to emerge from recession through a manufacturing industry sector recovery.

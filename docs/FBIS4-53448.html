			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Wednesday [18 May] instructed his aides to freeze the hikes  in public service charges until the end of the year, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said.    The planned move is intended to stem the rate increases in  domestic telephone charges, the rent for public housing, taxi  fares, tolls for the nation's expressways and fire insurance  premiums, the top government spokesman told a news conference.    The government will also ask local autonomies to refrain  from  raising fees charged for their bus and subway services, Kumagai  said.    The premier ordered Kumagai and Economic Planning Agency  Director General Yoshio Terasawa on Tuesday to move quickly to  carry out the measure.    The cabinet will approve the scheme at its regular meeting  on  Friday, according to Kumagai.</p>

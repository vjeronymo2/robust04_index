			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Gunfire greets Pakistan leader in Kabul MR NAWAZ SHARIF, the Pakistani prime minister, yesterday became the first head of a foreign government to fly into Kabul after the assumption of power in Afghanistan by the two-day-old Islamic mujahideen government. Shells were fired at the aircraft carrying Mr Sharif. Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islam guerrilla faction, had threatened to shoot down any aircraft from Pakistan attempting to land at the airport. The capture of the interior ministry removed the last Hezb stronghold in the capital. Hezb fighters remained entrenched in three suburbs. In full view of foreign correspondents, Uzbek militiamen allied to the new defence minister, guerrilla leader Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, executed a suspected Hezb fighter. The militiamen battered the man before shooting him dead at the interior ministry. Relative calm returned to Kabul and the battered streets filled with Afghan shoppers who had not ventured outside during three days of fighting between followers of the rival Islamic leaders. Analysts still saw Hezb as a potent destabilising force. 'Most of the population want peace but this is difficult for the fighters who can do nothing else (but fight),' said a European diplomat. 'They are in the capital and the smallest spark can set them off.' Mujahideen and diplomatic officials said a Hezb leader was to be appointed prime minister of the new government under President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi. There was an apparent attempt to restrain the ethnic rift that Mr Hekmatyar attempted to exploit as a Pushtoun leader, as the prime minister-designate, Mr Ustad Fareed is - like Mr Masood - an ethnic Tajik. Mr Fareed, however, is in Mr Hekmatyar's camp. One diplomat said Mr Sharif's visit to Kabul - which coincided with Islamabad's formal recognition of the new government - had kicked off a scramble for influence in Afghanistan among its neighbours and other Islamic nations. Iran also recognised the interim council and said it hoped the ruling mujahideen would respect the rights of Shias excluded from power. Turkey pledged to 'continue to support the horourable struggle of the brotherly Afghan people and its efforts to rebuild their country'. Britain welcomed the transfer of power although diplomatic representation remained to be resolved. British staff were withdrawn in February 1989 because of security fears. There is a caretaker staff in the embassy building. France hoped the 'very wide concensus' already enjoyed by Mr Mojaddedi 'can extend even further'.</p>

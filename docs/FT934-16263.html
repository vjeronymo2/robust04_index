			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Accountancy: Portion of Cadbury may taste more bitter than sweet - Andrew Jack wonders whether proposals for internal controls are focused in the right direction THOUSANDS of copies of an unlikely bestseller are circulating in British boardrooms this month in a sale driven by fear. The text is one which could test executives' powers of imagination with words as much as accounting standards have, in the past, challenged their creative use of numbers. After a tortuous period of gestation through more than 17 drafts, the working group on internal control has produced a weighty document designed to provide directors with advice on developing and commenting on effective financial controls. Internal Controls and Financial Reporting runs to 70 pages of tightly-packed text, ranging over six chapters and six appendices. It was chaperoned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, with six chartered accountants drawn from business and the profession as members. Few can have expected all this work to have been spawned by a few almost throw-away lines in the report of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, issued last December. Cadbury recommended that 'the directors should report on the effectiveness of the company's system of internal controls', and called on the accountancy profession to develop the 'necessary guidance' to allow this to take place. Businesses would be foolish to ignore the document, however tempting that might be. If and when it is ever approved, it will become an essential part of the recommendations in the Cadbury code. Listed companies will be required to provide a statement on internal controls. Failure to comply could result in action by the Stock Exchange. On the whole, the guidelines manage to do an effective job of sketching out the background to the subject and highlighting issues to consider. The document defines internal controls as systems established to provide reasonable assurance of effective and efficient operations, reliable financial information and reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations. It says controls are needed in order to comply with the law, act as a mangement response to growing corporate size and complexity, and provide a means for boards to identify and evaluate risks for the prudent operations of the company on behalf of shareholders. It argues that internal control structures have four separate 'elements'. The first is the control environment, fostered by the board for all individuals in a company to take the subject seriously. The second is the identification of risks, control priorities and objectives. Third is control activities: the policies and procedures to ensure that the objectives are achieved. Fourth is monitoring and corrective action. All these points seems very logical, desirable and even patently obvious - on paper. They reflect an increasing focus on internal controls, not least that highlighted in a paper earlier this year by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which sees a far greater role for internal auditors in place of external auditors in the future. The most vocal, and effective, critic of the internal controls proposals has been the Hundred Group of leading finance directors. Following dire warnings of 'corporate overload' generated by a raft of new proposed guidelines issued in the last few months, the group recently gained agreement for greater consultation, co-ordination and delay. Partly as a result, the document, which was originally due in June, has only just been released, and is now out for consultation until the end of next February. That means if it ever finally appears, it is unlikely to be in place for reporting by companies with year-ends before the end of 1994. In a speech last week, Mr Nigel Stapleton of Reed Elsevier, chairman of the Hundred Group's technical committee, urged standards-setters to 'make haste, carefully', arguing there were too many peripheral issues under discussion, with guidelines often inadequately drafted. The danger is that companies - many already with good internal control systems - will be saddled with substantial additional costs to report on internal controls, while those without will still be able to slip through the net and avoid fairly reporting on the state of their systems. It is tempting to dismiss these criticisms as self-interested attempts by boards to save costs and evade efforts to make them more accountable. That would be far easier to do if those taking the alternative, working party line were entirely dispassionate. But they are not. The accountancy firms have been cashing in on Cadbury in a big way. It came as no surprise that publication of the document last week was immediately welcomed by KPMG Peat Marwick and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for instance. KPMG, Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross have all recently produced booklets on the topic. While calling for greater attention to internal controls, the firms have been aggressively marketing their advice to steer companies through the confusion caused by the fall-out from the corporate governance movement. In the longer term, some of the firms are estimating that ensuring companies are complying with the Cadbury code - notably on internal controls and whether it is a 'going concern' - will add between 10 per cent and 25 per cent to the annual audit fee. As the working party document says, most companies will need to review their internal control systems as part of the process of generating their statement of compliance with the code. For smaller companies, one accountant estimates that will typically cost several thousand pounds in consulting fees to write systems. What is unclear is how far this will be a paper exercise to satisfy the auditors rather than something which genuinely adds value. In a chapter on the statement that directors will be required to make, the working party urges that the wording should be free-ranging rather than adhering to a formulaic 'boiler plate', something which is sadly the norm in auditors' reports. It wants directors to list 'reportable weaknesses' which have been discovered, and describe remedial action being taken. If it worked, such text would provide wonderful information for readers of accounts, not least journalists. But it would also mark a remarkable change in the normally bullish texts available up till now, and leave boards feeling exposed and more vulnerable to legal action than a standardised form of words. Guidance is now being developed by the Auditing Practices Board on how auditors would verify the statement. But it is unclear how detailed this is likely to be and what would happen if there was disagreement between auditors and directors over the state of internal controls. Boards would clearly do everything possible to prevent a qualification in their accounts driven by disagreement on the topic. Yet the recommendations seem to leave little room for them to conceal the sins of the past, since they are being required to own up to weaknesses and say how they are making amends. That contrasts with accounting standards which allow for disputes to be resolved and policies changed following discussion with the auditors but without any public statement. This would suggest that boards will impose greater pressures on their auditors not to qualify their statements - on pain of loss of audit fee or job. And, unlike with the Financial Reporting Review Panel for accounting standards, auditors would not have the power of an external regulator party to the discussions with which to threaten compliance. As a result, the statement on internal controls runs the risk of being costly but worthless.

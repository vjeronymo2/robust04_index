			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blow dealt to prospects of US recovery: Across-the-board fall in industrial production much worse than expected by markets PROSPECTS of an early US economic recovery were dealt a blow yesterday by much worse than expected industrial production figures. The Federal Reserve said production fell 0.9 per cent last month, nearly twice the decline expected on Wall Street. The Fed also revised previous figures sharply downward to show declines of 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent in November and December. Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 0.3 per cent decline in producer prices - a further sign of ebbing inflationary pressures. Figures for business inventories, meanwhile, showed a sharp rise in December, indicating that corporate sales were falling short of projections. The production fall - the largest since last spring - was led by the motor industry, where output contracted 8 per cent relative to December. However, the report was a sea of minuses, with nearly every sector registering substantial declines. Manufacturing production was down 1 per cent, while the factory utilisation rate fell nearly a percentage point to 78 per cent, the lowest level for nearly a decade. On Thursday, hopes of recovery had been lifted by a 0.6 per cent rise in retail sales in January and a revival of car sales in the first 10 days of February. Analysts yesterday tried to make sense of the conflicting reports. Some saw the production fall as a lagged response to poor consumer demand at the end of last year. If the tentative signs of better sales were sustained, output might rise in coming months. However, Mr William Griggs, of the Wall Street firm Griggs and Santow, said too much had been made of a modest upturn in the highly volatile series for retail sales. The economy was 'certainly not on an upswing'. On Wall Street, share and bond markets were unsettled by the conflicting reports. Bond prices closed slightly higher, but failed to regain ground lost after a period of weakness. The market is fearful that Congress will vote to increase the budget deficit beyond the Dollars 400bn (Pounds 221bn) already expected in fiscal 1992 and remains convinced that the Federal Reserve will not ease policy in the near future.</p>

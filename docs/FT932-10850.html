			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (12): New casino lure for life's high-rollers - Change in gambling laws brings further attraction for wealthy international tourists WHEN Fedor Dostoevsky was forced to pawn his watch in Geneva in August, 1863, after a run of bad luck on the gaming tables, and returned to Russia to relate his experiences in a novel, The Gambler, the Swiss city enjoyed a small reputation for decadence and intrigue. It is no longer a wild town, but does play host to many international organisations, including the European headquarters of the United Nations, so at least the intrigue has survived. Ten years after Dostoevsky's retreat to St Petersburg, casinos were banned under the Swiss Constitution and the citizenry returned to its Calvinist way of life, largely free of moral contamination from Europe's dissolute aristocracy, travelling the social axes of Paris, Baden-Baden, and southern Europe. On March 7 this year the Swiss had a change of heart. They voted in a referendum for the roulette wheels to spin again and for the return of life's high-rollers. It was no coincidence that one of the main lobby groups, which campaigned for a law change, was the Swiss Tourist Federation, representing the interests of 650 tourism enterprises and local authorities. During the past 10 years the average number of overnight stays in Swiss hotels has stagnated. Any traces of complacency in the industry disappeared earlier this year after 1992's overnight stays declined 3.2 per cent. Switzerland's gross income from tourism last year was SFr21.4bn (Pounds 9.5bn) compared with SFr20.8bn in 1991. Due to price rises, the increase in income did not reflect the decline in bookings. Tourism is the country's third-largest contributor to the balance of payments, after engineering and chemicals. About 208,000 people are directly employed in the sector, amounting to 7 per cent of the workforce. Compared to Austria and France, Switzerland remains an expensive proposition for Europe's recession-hit tourists. One of the few areas of real growth have been camping, caravaning and youth hostels, where reasonable prices have been maintained. Unlike Austria, Switzerland may not easily attract the newly-affluent citizens of former communist countries, such as Hungary. The Swiss tourist industry is driven by quality and price, rather than scale. Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, there were 211,000 hotel beds in the country. Last year this figure was 267,000, so the number has not changed significantly in 80 years. While neighbouring countries race ahead in mass-market tourism, resorts in Switzerland are continually looking for improvements in quality. THE casino legislation is regarded, therefore, as another small addition to the country's formidable tourist assets of Alpine beauty, lakeside tranquillity and world-class service and efficiency. The Swiss Tourist Federation's spokeswoman, Ms Elizabeth Kaufmann, explained the reasoning behind the casinos campaign - 'we exist as a lobby group for the industry and we had been making representations at federal level for a change in the law for years, because that is what our members wanted.' As Switzerland is still perceived as the main European playground of the wealthy, there was some logic in the tourist federation's use in its campaign of the Swiss proverb - 'if money is growing in the streets, you only have to bend down to gather it in.' Casinos already exist in most Swiss cities and resorts as the ban was eased in 1956. But the maximum stake allowed is SFr5, less than the price of a beer in a Swiss hotel. Because of this, wealthy tourists seeking the thrill of the green baize have to make cross-border raids to take advantage of the many casinos specially built near Switzerland's frontiers by its neighbours. Indeed, Swiss themselves are not averse to driving across the border for a flutter. One sore point for the industry is that the government's support for the re-opening of real casinos was bolstered by its intention to take 80 per cent of gross revenues. A debate is still continuing over how the extra funds will be spent. The tourist federation would like some money set aside for tourism promotion and investment, while the government favours social spending perhaps to appease religious groups and others opposed to casinos. IN St Moritz, the centre of the country's most successful tourist area, the Grisons, there was jubilation at the outcome of the casino referendum. Deputy tourist director for the resort, Mrs Anne-Marie Meyer, says St Moritz and neighbouring villages voted heavily in favour for what is regards as an important improvement in facilities. Hotel occupancy was only 65 per cent in March, and St Moritz, with its Cresta Run toboggan ride and horse racing on ice, has obvious attractions for the sporting tourist. Only a maximum of seven licences are expected to be granted nationwide, and there will be fierce competition among the resorts and cities to be awarded one. Mrs Meyer was confident of the prospects for St Moritz - 'we definitely want a real casino here and I'm sure we'll get one. But the whole process of changing cantonal law could mean a delay of more than two years before it can be opened.' St Moritz and other Swiss resorts are unlikely to see a surge in business this year. A survey by the Union Bank of Switzerland, says hotels are prepared for the general downward trend in overnights to continue. Roughly 25 per cent of hoteliers forecast falls in sales and earnings. Germans were the most numerous foreign visitors last year, followed by Britons and Americans, then Italians and French. When the casinos open after the mid-1990s the government will be determined to keep a close check on the clientele to make sure the establishments do not become another Swiss institution upon which the world's money-launderers can test their ingenuity. Switzerland's new-found sensitivity about the wages of crime would please even Dostoevsky. Should the casinos attract the wrong sort of tourist, however, the authorities would have no hesitation in turning back the clock with a call of rien ne va plus ('no more bets').</p>

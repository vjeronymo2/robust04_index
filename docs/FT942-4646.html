			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Fed chief sees need for self-regulation Banks and other financial institutions will increasingly have to self-regulate their trading activities because of the growing complexity of financial markets, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, said yesterday. Mr Greenspan, who spoke after addressing the International Monetary Conference in London, said financial institutions would have to be increasingly 'self-regulated, largely because government regulators cannot do that job'. He said the primary means of preventing a bank collapsing because of losses was 'that individual institutions in their self-interest become extraordinarily knowledgeable about the counterparties with whom they are dealing'. His remarks indicate that regulators will in future place more stress on the skills of individuals and sophistication of technology in financial institutions, rather than insisting on examining their assets and liabilities in detail. Mr Greenspan said that central banks would gradually move from the direct supervision of banks' credit risk towards monitoring their internal processes and risk management systems. He was supported by other international central bankers in casting doubt on central banks' ability to contain volatility in bond and other financial markets by imposing further regulations. Mr Greenspan said that financial institutions would also have to 'create risk management systems that can take very considerable shocks'. There was 'no fundamental alternative' to financial supervision moving towards this model. His remarks follow an indication that supervisors may allow banks to use internal models to calculate what capital to hold against trading risks, rather than using a model devised by the Basle committee of international bank supervisors. Mr Greenspan also said that an integration of the views and policies of banking and securities regulators was 'inevitable' in spite of current disagreements on capital requirements for market risks between supervisors of the two industries. He said that it was 'very difficult to make a judgment' about whether central banks would intervene to support an investment bank or other financial institution in a crisis.

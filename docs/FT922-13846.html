			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Not so Bright - Ballot Box Graham Bright, John Major's portly parliamentary private secretary, has been having at least as difficult a campaign as his political master. As MP for Luton South since 1979, Bright is defending a 5,115 majority against Labour's Bill McKenzie, a former Price Waterhouse partner who gave up his accountancy job to fight the seat in 1987. Bright has already accused McKenzie's wife of organising a 'mob' of 'thugs' who barracked the prime minister when he visited the town. Under pressure from McKenzie's solicitors, he was forced to issue an embarrassing apology. Next Bright alleged that, if Labour wins today, councils would have 'compulsory powers' to repurchase homes bought by former tenants. Even Bright's agent has admitted in response to protests that the claim is overstated. A Conservative leaflet also charges that Labour would 'lower educational standards'. The section is headed 'Labour's disastrous programme'.</p>

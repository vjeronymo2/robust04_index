			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Arts: 'Oh What a Lovely War' revived There must a distinction between those who remember the original, explosive production of Joan Littlewood's Oh What a Lovely War at Stratford East just over 30 years ago and those seeing the piece for the first time in the revival by the National Youth Theatre. By comparison, the NYT performance understandably lacks fire-power. Yet there are compensations and even the odd improvement. One of the opening songs, 'We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go', is immensely moving precisely because it is played by such young people. The build-up of the songs is a reminder of what a musical masterpiece Ms Littlewood produced. They go from confidence to doubt to near despair. In 'A long way to Tipperary' there seems to be a new emphasis in the line 'but we're not downhearted yet'. In 'Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag', they are still trying to force a smile. It's a long from 1914 to 'I want to go home, Oh my, I don't want to die'. The dialogue scenes are generally less confident. The NYT cast cannot really pull off the generals and their ladies and perhaps the original text was not as strong as we recall. The exception remains Christmas Eve when the Tommies hear the Jerries singing 'Heilige Nacht' from across the trenches: they talk, fraternise, play football in no-man's land before the shelling resumes. This is as moving as ever. Direction is by Dean Byfield and the show is sponsored by Price Waterhouse. It runs at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London WC1 (071-388-8822) until September 10.</p>

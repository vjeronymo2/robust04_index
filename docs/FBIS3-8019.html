Jarcevic said that Croats and Muslims were for months  fighting in central Bosnia and that the Croatian forces  continuously bombarded Muslim positions.    "Therefore, the aircraft were most probably Croatian,  because  the Serbs do not fight there," Jarcevic added stressing that the  aircraft were downed above the area of the Croat-Muslim  conflicts.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPPLIER SAYS SAN CLEMENTE MUST CONSIDER RATIONING  </P> <P> San Clemente's water supplier, which earlier this summer faced severe  shortfalls, criticized the City Council on Wednesday for deferring action on  proposed water rationing.  </P> <P> Board members of the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, at their meeting  Wednesday, said the City Council had been shortsighted in its Aug. 30 decision  to put off a rationing proposal. The council concluded that an emergency no  longer existed.  </P> <P> The water board voted to send the City Council a letter urging it to "act upon  an emergency water conservation ordinance at the earliest opportunity in order  to ensure there will be sufficient water during peak demand periods."  </P> <P> Ray Woodside, general manager for Tri-Cities, told the board meeting: "We're in  pretty good shape now, but September and October are known for some hot Santa  Ana winds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indian Summer Use May Rise  </P> <P> Woodside said he worries about increased water use in that period.  </P> <P> In a separate action Wednesday, the water board voted to consider an allocation  system of its supplies. Under such a plan, San Clemente would get a set  percentage of available water. San Clemente uses about 66% of Tri-Cities' total  water supply, according to water officials. Tri-Cities now has no ceiling for  users.  </P> <P> The water board said it would discuss a possible allocation system at its  meeting next month.  </P> <P> Tri-Cities is a water wholesaler that also delivers to Capistrano Beach, which  is now a part of newly incorporated Dana Point, and to San Onofre State Park  and San Onofre Nuclear Power Generating Station, both in northern San Diego  County. Its five-person board of directors is independently elected.  </P> <P> A water shortfall in Tri-Cities' reservoir occurred in July and August because  more water was being used than the district could pump back in, the water  officials said. The shortfall began easing in mid-August after San Clemente  Mayor Brian J. Rice and other city officials began urging voluntary water  conservation.  </P> <P> Rice said Aug. 30 that it would be "a slap in the face" of city residents who  voluntarily conserved during the water emergency for the City Council to enact  mandatory rationing. The City Council unanimously agreed.  </P> <P> But Dennis A. Erdman, president of the Tri-Cities board, noted Wednesday that  the proposed ordinance would have gone into effect only if reservoir water  levels again dropped severely. Erdman said the city should have passed the law  Aug. 30 so it could act quickly in case of another water emergency.  </P> <P> "As the 'wholesale supplier' of water to this area, we (Tri-Cities) can only  encourage conservation to get through these shortfall periods," Erdman said.  "The city, however, has the authority to impose conservation measures which are  designed to limit consumption."  </P> <P> Former San Clemente mayor Karoline Koester attended the water board meeting and  told the panel that she supports both a water allocation system by Tri-Cities  and an emergency water-rationing law by the city. She said both are needed  because growth in San Clemente is outstripping the city's ability to provide  such basic services as water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth Controls Urged  </P> <P> A frequent critic of "uncontrolled growth," Koester said more and more homes  are being built in San Clemente, even as the water supply dwindles.  </P> <P> "We're coming to a turn in the road, gentlemen, we really are," Koester said.  "Water has finite limits. I think we're in an ongoing emergency because we're  using more water than the pipeline can supply.  </P> <P> "That was obvious during the crisis. . . . I think it is only fair to the users  to tell them how much water they can expect by having an allocation system.  We're really going to have to look in earnestness now about growth control."  </P></p>

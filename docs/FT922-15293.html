			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / People: Military precision for Docklands railway The military are to be drafted in to make the trains run on time on the troubled Docklands Light Railway. Ownership of the notoriously unre-liable DLR was yesterday transferred from London Transport to the London Docklands Development Corporation following lobbying by Olympia and York, the beleaguered developers of the huge Canary Wharf office complex. The new chairman of the DLR, Sir Peter Levene, has turned to the ministry of defence where he was chief of defence procurement from 1985-91 for three of four top managers. Major-General Malcolm Hutchinson becomes managing director, after a 'long and distinguished career in defence procurement'. Currently a member of the Defence Prospect Team, much of his career was spent in REME, the army's engineering corps. He was director of procurement strategy at the MoD from 1986-88 and vice master-general of the ordnance from 1988-90. President of the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers, Major-General Hutchinson is a member of the council of presidents steering group for the unification of the engineering profession. The new planning director also comes from the MoD; Stephen French is to be seconded from his work in project finance, public procurement and strategic planning. The third board member to be appointed yesterday comes from United Scientific Holdings which Sir Peter Levene headed before moving to the MoD. Anthony Jackson, finance director at USH, will be the new finance director. Another secondee from the defence department, Stephen Gibbs, will head the projects organisation. Gibbs is currently a scientific adviser to the army on research and technology programmes under the title of director science for land systems. His experience in radar, communications systems, guided weapons and 'stealth' bombers will no doubt be invaluable in sorting out the DLR's operating problems, which appear to be largely technical rather than manag-erial.</p>

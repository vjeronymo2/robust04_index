			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/3/1994 -- Romanian Premier  Nicolae Vacaroiu received Thursday, March 31, Hans Blix,  president of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  currently in Romania to make an inspection of the way in which  works are being carried out at unit one of the atomic station of  Cernavoda.    Hans Blix, voiced, on this occasion, the preoccupations of  the world body he works with for permanent surveillance of the  atomic stations in Eastern Europe, for support to be granted to  them to improve their protection systems. The IAEA president  showed interest in the creation in Romania of a unique authority  for surveillance and control of nuclear activities, under the  premier's direct subordination.    Premier Vacaroiu said that the government was interested  that  the Cernavoda atomic station start operation as soon as possible  with respect of all international duties in the domain.    The director general of the International Atomic Energy  Agency also met on Thursday with the Romanian Minister of the  Industries, Dumitru Popescu.    Appreciating Mr. Hans Blix's visit in a very important  moment  when Romania prepares for the actuation of the first unit of the  nuclear plant at Cernavoda, about 200 km east of Bucharest, the  Romanian minister said after the meeting that the two parties  agreed that the situation of the nuclear sector was vital for  Romania's energy system as the conventional energy resources --  methane gas, oil -- were shrinking while the water power  stations very expensive.    "Mr. Hans Blix's findings during the visit at the Cernavoda  plant, the second in four years, concerning the security and  quality standards of the works are encouraging us in speeding-up  the finalisation of the works and in trying to find, together  with the other cabinet members, the funds necessary for the  completion and actuation of the unit one during the current  year," said the Romanian minister.    The IAEA head and the Romanian minister approached also  issues concerning the cooperation between the IAEA and the  Romanian Ministry of Industries. The Vienna-based agency  provides yearly the financial means for the training of about  30-40 Romanian experts following specialization stages in  various countries, said Minister Popescu.    Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency, IAEA, was conferred, during a specific ceremony  on March 31, the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of the Bucharest  University.    During the laudatio, Professor Emil Constantinescu,  chancellor of the Bucharest University, referred, alongside  Blix's scientific merits, to his rich political and diplomatic  activity, to the particular stress he lays on legal guarantees  apt to prevent the use of atomic energy for purposes other than  peaceful.</p>

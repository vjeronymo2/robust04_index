Mr.  Mangope is on the line now confirming the arrest, which he says  is preventing him from taking part in the democratic process in  South Africa.    [Mangope] That's correct, yes.    [Daniels] In terms of what provisions or what law have they  done that?    [Mangope] I don't know really. That is what baffles me. My  own children are not to see me. My own children, my own family,  immediate family, are not allowed to see me. I just cannot  accept that. I'm not allowed, my wife is not allowed, my  children with me here, are not allowed to go to my son's house.  And I feel that is not right.    [Daniels] Have you been specifically told that you are not  allowed to campaign in the election?    [Mangope] Yes, Dr. Tjaart van der Walt said that.    [Daniels] Said that you will not be permitted to canvas?    [Mangope] Well, he said they are restricting me in the  interest of free political activity, whatever that means. In  the interest of free political activity they are imposing this  house arrest on me.    [Daniels] And would you have liked to have taken part in the  election? Were you planning to do so?    [Mangope] My people were meeting today to discuss that. I  have informed them what the position is, I mean, as it is, it is  impossible. In any case there are parties who have not  registered and who are therefore not going to take part in the  election. I was going to put the matter of registration to my  parliament yesterday. And if yesterday my parliament had  adopted the recommendation, I'd definitely take part in the  elections, but I was denied that.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Santander wins control of Banesto Banco Santander last night outbid its rivals to win control of Banco Espanol de Credito and create Spain's largest banking group. It will pay Pta281bn (Pounds 1.38bn) for a 60 per cent stake in the bank following a rescue operation conducted under the auspices of the Bank of Spain. In an atmosphere of acute suspense, the verdict was announced four and a half hours after the opening of sealed bids from three competing banks. The other bidders were Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and the state-controlled Argentaria. The winning bid of Pta762 per share was well above most analysts' forecasts and slightly higher than Banesto's closing share price yesterday of Pta755. Santander said yesterday it planned to retain Mr Alfredo Saenz, the caretaker Banesto chairman. The Bank of Spain, which stepped into Banesto four months ago and sacked its management board, opted for a rapid decision to help rebuild confidence after the country's largest ever bank crisis. Banesto is estimated to have lost Pta350bn in deposits - nearly 15 per cent  -following the intervention in December. Santander said its strategy for Banesto would centre on its retail banking strength and giving it 'an exclusively financial vocation'. This suggested that it planned to dispose of Banesto's extensive portfolio of industrial holdings. The bids from BBV and Argentaria came in below Santander's at Pta667 and Pta566 respectively. The contest, judged by an eight-member panel chaired by the Bank of Spain, was held solely on the basis of price.</p>

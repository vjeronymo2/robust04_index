Those Willing May Join In"]    [Text] The press conference by Yuriy Koptev, general  director of the Russian Space Agency; his Kazakhstani colleague  Tokhtar Aubakirov; and the republic's Deputy Prime Minister  Galym Abilsiitov was rather reminiscent of a public showdown, at  times turning into a squabble over the future fate of the  Baykonur space launching site.    Yet for all the disagreements, "none of us opposes this  space  launch site," Galym Abilsiitov said. "Everyone wants to  preserve it and moreover, develop it further and use it in our  interests."    These interests are in the area of joint defense and in  implementing a huge civil space program on which Russia is now  working.    Russian Space Agency Director Yuriy Koptev also believes  that  Baykonur occupies quite a definite place: it is irreplaceable.    "Any talk about leaving this site in the future," Koptev  noted, "is fraught with very big losses for Russia. I cannot  say that they cannot be made up, but these losses may affect  extremely badly all our current plans and all the services  within the CIS framework that can be rendered with the  assistance of space facilities."    According to the Kazakhstani side, however, at present  neither Russia nor Kazakhstan have sufficient funds to ensure  the viability of the immense technical, production, and social  complex. In the past everything was decided from Moscow fairly  quickly, using the power of the entire huge country. Now the  divided countries, which are incapable of fully ensuring the  operation of the space launching site, have decided to share all  costs.    "In spite of the fact that Kazakhstan does not have its own  space program or direct state interest in the launching site as  an object of scientific and technical or production activity,"  the Kazakhstani deputy prime minister specified, "we are  interested in Baykonur's existence and development if only  because it is our property. And we have agreed to share the  costs of maintaining the space launching center." Kazakhstan's  share in the overall spending constituted 6 percent, and  Russia's 94 percent. This does not involve space programs but  merely the maintenance and operation of the complex.    Today the complex is being worked past repair, rapidly  falling into decay. Almaty has expressed its discontent also  over the CIS Joint Strategic Forces Command's transfer of the  site to the jurisdiction of the Russian Defense Ministry as of  the middle of last year, without coordinating with the other CIS  participants.    There is now a 40 percent shortage of commissioned officer  specialists and a 57 percent shortage of noncommissioned staff.  Importantly, manpower is the responsibility of Kazakhstan, which  is already experiencing huge difficulties in raising its own  army.    The best possible option for organizing the operation of the  launching site, in the Kazakhstani leadership's opinion, would  be to create on its basis an international space company with  the participation of primarily Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and  possibly other countries. This, as is believed here, could  attract considerable foreign resources to the project and also  help demilitarize the complex.    "So far, however, this idea has not received support from  Russia," Kazakhstan's deputy prime minister stated. "But we are  also looking for other approaches and do not rule out that for  the sake of salvaging the site it may be put up for public  sale...."    True, Abelsiitov added that this option will undoubtedly be  coordinated with Russia, but he did not preclude such a scenario.    The Russian position was presented by Yuriy Koptev.  According to him, space activity in the world today is  maintained for the most part with state support. In talking  about a space company, therefore, it is necessary to establish  from the outset who will be supporting it financially.    "To hope that within the next five to six years the space  launching site will find such a form, allowing it to become  self- sufficient, is unjustified optimism," Koptev said.    If no state funds are invested in the business (and at  present it is possible to talk only about Russian money), what  can survive is a particular launch pad or a particular line of  activity in Baykonur, but nothing more. In addition, so far no  foreigners are forthcoming who would be willing to launch  rockets from the Kazakhstani site.    Furthermore, Koptev believes, at present it will be  practically impossible to attract quickly the 14,000 civilian  specialists needed to replace the military space officers.  Everyone agrees, however, that it is necessary to try to change  the situation and gradually demilitarize the site. Yet the  approaches to addressing this problem are fundamentally  different. Kazakhstan believes that the questions about the  viability of the launching site and of Leninsk city are  inseparable, and that Russia must assume responsibility for the  whole complex. Moscow for its part supposes that it is  impossible to replace the military specialists with civilians in  the near future, while operation may be ensured in the form of  an international space company but within the framework of state  financing, with some services being provided on a commercial  basis. It is planned to introduce a transitional period of  several years to carry through such changes but with a special  condition, namely to make sure that the complex remains part of  defense programs.</p>

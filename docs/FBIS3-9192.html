Our correspondent Jiri Bohacek reports:    [Bohacek] Pavel Hajek, CMCTUA deputy chairman, addressed the  rally at noon. The Old Town Square was 75-percent full. Labor  and Social Affairs Minister Jindrich Vodicka arrived at that  time, but the trade unionist crowd would not allow Vodicka to  join them. The speakers asked those present to make room so  that Mr. Minister could leave. Minister Vodicka was forced to  leave without being allowed to speak or defend himself.  According to unconfirmed information, a member of Mr.  Minister's entourage was injured. [passage omitted]    Distributors of leaflets published by the Association for  the  Republic appeared among the participants at the rally, but they  failed to hand out any of their literature.    It seems that the rally has just ended. The gathering sang  the anthem and people are leaving.</p>

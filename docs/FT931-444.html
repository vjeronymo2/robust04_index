			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Observer: Dunn roamin' If there are lucky and unlucky newspaper editors, then 38-year-old Martin Dunn, late of the Dudley Herald, falls into the former category. Less than two years after being made editor of Today, the weakest member of Rupert Murdoch's UK stable of dailies, he was tempted away by Mort Zuckerman, the New York Daily News publisher, with intriguing talk of a Dollars 500,000 package. However, no sooner had Dunn handed in his notice than Zuckerman began to get cold feet after journalists and advertisers reacted badly to the idea of the News being edited by a Brit. Lesser Fleet Street editors than Dunn might have taken to the bottle. But Murdoch took pity on his errant editor and offered him the lowly Boston Herald. Now it seems that Dunn's time in Boston may be the shortest on record. His proprietor seems to have fallen in love with the New York Post once again, and Dunn has been placed on standby to go to New York. Mort Zuckerman could yet live to regret sending the fax that could have destroyed Dunn's career.</p>

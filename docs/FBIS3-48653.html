			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sunkyong Business Group has emerged as a controlling  shareholder of Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) in fact by acquiring  the biggest equity stake in the nation's cellular-phone  monopoly. Three Sunkyong subsidiaries succeeded in buying a  total of 1.27 million KMT shares through competitive bidding  yesterday, securing the conglomerate a controlling 23-percent  stake in the cellular monopoly. State-funded Korea Telecom said  292 investors had competed for 2.44 million of its KMT shares  put up for sale Monday and Tuesday but no other bidders were  successful.    Korea Telecom said it will invite new tenders for the  remaining 1.17 million shares. After the sale, Korea Telecom,  left with a 20- percent stake in KMT, will hand over management  control to Sunkyong.    Sunkyong offered 427.1 billion won, paying an average  321,000  won per share, a Korea Telecom spokesman said.    Although long anticipated, the result of yesterday's bidding  gives Sunkyong, already the nation's fifth largest conglomerate,  a vital niche in the nation's potentially lucrative cellular  industry.    The nation's cellular-phone industry has been growing 80 to  100 percent a year and reached over 470,000 subscribers at the  end of last year. Since it was established in March 1984, KMT  has grown into a 498.3 billion-won cellular monopoly employing  2,000 people. The company generated 420 billion won in sales  last year. Its net profit that year was 71.9 billion won.    Given the business opportunities involved, it has long been  said that the successful bidder for KMT will likely emerge as a  major business empire.    KMT is currently the nation's only cellular operator. A  second cellular network is to be formed later this year. The  Communications Ministry has timed the sale of KMT shares so as  to cool a fevered tug-of-war among major business conglomerates  currently bidding for the second network.    In December, the government gave the Federation of Korean  Industries, the nation's largest business organization, the task  of forming a single consortium to build and operate the new  cellular network. The federation's decision is due Feb. 28.    Yesterday's auction was a sweet victory for Sunkyong.  Although it won a cellular license in 1992, Sunkyong had to  relinquish its successful bid in the face of embarrassing  charges of nepotism. The son of Sunkyong chairman Choe  Chong-hyon is married to a daughter of then President No Tae-u.</p>

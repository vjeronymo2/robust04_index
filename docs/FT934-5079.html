			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Councils predict 'disastrous' cut in central funding - Local authorities Local authorities are to suffer a 'disastrous' cut in their central funding, in spite of the chancellor's claim of a 2.3 per cent increase in their total projected standard spending, according to local government associations. The Association of District Councils, the Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities yesterday said that this amount was merely an increase on last year's government estimate. Councillors said a more important figure was the actual level of local government expenditure for this financial year, estimated by local authority associations at Pounds 42.6bn. They also pointed out that the introduction of new responsibilities for implementing care in the community would cost around Pounds 736m. On this basis, the government's projected spending of Pounds 42.66bn for next year represented a cut of more than 1 per cent, the authorities said. They said the effects would involve the loss of jobs and cuts in services for 'the elderly, the infirm, and children'. Several groups of public-sector employees, including teachers and the police, are paid out of local authority funds, although councils do not have any control over setting their levels of pay. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, estimated that local government will sustain a cash cut of 1.2 per cent, and pre-dicted 30,000 job losses. No individual authority will be able to start forming a budget until the environment department announces its plans for distributing grants, probably tomorrow. Standard spending assessments for each authority have been subjected to a wide-ranging review this year, which means that it is possible some councils will receive significantly more grant next year in spite of the low total level. Those whose spending assessments are cut, and which try to avoid cuts in services, will probably have to increase council tax bills. Aggregate external funding - including business rates, the Revenue Support Grant (paid out of exchequer funds), and various grants - is planned to rise by only 1.7 per cent. Local authority finance officers suggested that the new 'capping' criteria, probably to be announced tomorrow, could be vital in determining how much actual budgets are cut. The government can 'cap' local authority budgets which it considers excessive. This power was introduced to prevent unsustainably high council tax bills, but can also be used to restrict total spending. The new arrangements for distributing standard spending grants are expected to involve a sharp reduction in funding for inner London authorities, because the new arrangements will take the 1991 census figures into account. Also, the formula for assessing local authorities' needs has been widely attacked for over-emphasising ethnicity. Deprived northern former mining communities with few immigrants claim that money is unfairly routed to areas such as Leicester and inner London. However, the local authority associations predicted that rural areas would suffer cuts as well as inner cities. Gross capital expenditure by local authorities in 1994-95 is assumed to be around Pounds 8bn. This is much lower than spending in 1993-94, which was boosted by the temporary relaxation of the rules barring spending of capital receipts raised from council house sales. Capital receipts in 1994-95 are projected to be around Pounds 2bn, giving net capital expenditure of Pounds 5bn.</p>

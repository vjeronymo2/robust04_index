			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (8): Hunt for a multiracial democracy blueprint - Patti Waldmeir at the talks with no name DAY after day, the ridiculous vies with the sublime at Johannesburg's World Trade Centre. At this soul-less venue, with its cavernous interior and garish carpet tiling, 26 political groups from lunatic left to racist right search for a blueprint to multiracial democracy. Too often, their search is side-tracked by politics, or mere political correctness: at one recent meeting, debate had to be suspended because two delegations had no female representation (each is meant to be a man-woman team). Debate could only resume once females had been found to warm the seats beside the delegation leaders from the Transkei black homeland and Solidarity, an Indian party. Few of the compulsory women seated at the horseshoe-shaped table of the 52-member 'negotiating council' actually participate in debate, because none is a political leader of substance. But woe betide the delegation which fails to ensure that its quota of females is filled. Delegates betray a preference for form over substance in far more serious areas as well. When questioned sceptically about progress at the talks, one participant replied boastfully (and without a trace of irony): 'We even got as far as appointing a technical committee'. Indeed, this has been the solution chosen for every thorny issue so far: refer it to a technical committee, and claim victory. The idea seems to be that the best way to solve political problems is to break them into bite-sized pieces, and turn them over to legal experts for further mastication. This approach has undoubtedly led to progress on some issues - especially the less controversial ones, susceptible of legalistic solutions. But where political decisions are required, science cannot cope. The report from the technical committee on constitutional matters, for example, is a triumph of evasion. After a worthy but vague treatise on how powers should be shared between national and regional governments (the crux of the constitutional debate), it concludes: 'Powers which are not specifically allocated in the constitution to national government or to an SPR (state, province or regional) government, shall vest in the national government, alternatively in the SPR government.' The committee's failure to decide whether South Africa should be comprised of states, provinces or regions - let alone what powers they should have - highlights the yawning gap still to be bridged. In the end, resolution will require a collective act of political will - not a piecemeal effort by legal experts. Yet the negotiations seem designed to avoid hard choices. Everything about the talks reflects indecision: they have no name, because participants could never decide whether to call them the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), after last year's talks, or something new. There is no permanent chairman, because delegates failed to choose one; instead, they rely on six revolving chairmen. The negotiating council's legendary capacity to avoid decisions reached the height of farce six weeks ago, when delegates spent three hours debating whether they had sufficient time to allow a 20-minute statement from the Inkatha Freedom Party. In the end, they agreed Inkatha could present the statement - to a technical committee. But for all the council's tendency to slip into farce, the vast majority of its time is taken up with the deadly serious business of shaping the post-apartheid future - and of forming the personal alliances which will determine the politics of the new South Africa. For the deliberations of the council, which meets once or twice weekly, are just the public face of negotiations. The toughest bargaining takes place in the 10-man planning committee, a sort of steering committee for the council - and at the tea table and the delegates' canteen between sessions. That is where the peculiar chemistry of the conference is at its most powerful: the centripetal force which has kept conference participants at the table through the trauma of African National Congress leader Chris Hani's assassination, and the bungled government raid on the Pan Africanist Congress. Indeed, many would argue that the biggest achievement of the talks is the fact that they are taking place at all - with no deserters so far, even from the ranks of those whose demands (for an Afrikaner homeland, or for total black hegemony) must in the end prove incompatible with a multiracial solution. Vital alliances have been cemented at the World Trade Centre - between the ANC's charismatic chief negotiator, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the disarming Roelf Meyer, lead government negotiator; and between the two men who run the negotiations secretariat, which effectively directs talks from the sidelines: Mr Mac Maharaj from the ANC and Mr Fanie van der Merwe from the government, a former terrorist and a Pretoria bureaucrat who share a rare relationship based on mutual respect and humour. But bonhomie at the tea table also has its dangers: it can lull delegates into thinking that theirs is the only show in town - and that the nation will wait on their tortuous progress. It will not. Indeed, delegates have even shown signs of wanting to act as an ad-hoc parliament to replace the white-dominated house in Cape Town: late last month they summoned a government minister to explain a raid on the PAC, and eventually forced him to back down. It was a striking indicator of the political changes in South Africa - but the delegates might do better to concentrate on agreeing a constitution under which a truly representative parliament can be elected.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Negotiating forum 208 members, meets only to approve more crucial decisions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Negotiating council 52 delegates, plus 52 advisors, meets once or twice weekly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Planning committee 10 members, meets almost daily to prepare debates, and draft agreements for the Negotiating Council  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical committees on  -Constitutional matters  -Fundamental rights in the transition to democracy  -An independent elections commission  -An independent media commission  -Repeal of discriminatory legislation  -Transitional executive council  -Violence  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Participants 26 groups, including the main political organisations (government and the ruling National Party, which have separate delegations, the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party), political parties from the black homelands, ethnic groups such as the Natal Indian Congress and the Afrikaner Volksunie (Afrikaner People's Union), and radical groups such as the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress and the ultra-right Conservative Party.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Venue World Trade Centre, outside Johannesburg  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

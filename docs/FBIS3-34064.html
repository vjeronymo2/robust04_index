He praised the Congress for approving his proposals for  reducing the budgetary deficit, adopting legislation relating to  the ownership of guns, and approving the NAFTA trade accord.  President Clinton took these measures after assuming office.  But the question remains as to how successful has he been in  implementing his election promises, which included ensuring the  welfare of the people, increasing health care facilities,  creating new job opportunities, and developing the economy. In  this regard there is mixed opinion. The opponents of President  Clinton say that he has not be able to achieve any remarkable  success in fulfilling his election promises. On the other hand,  his party and supporters are more or less satisfied with his  actions and and successes. The Clinton administration has been  successful to some extent in increasing employment  opportunities. The President has stated that the rise in  employment opportunities during his term of office was much more  in comparison with the past four years. The health reform  measures taken by President Clinton have been criticized by  members of both parties. People are not very optimistic about  the success of his moves to improve social welfare services and  develop the economy.    In his speech, President Clinton gave special emphasis to  issues relating to the improvement of health care facilities,  reforming social welfare services, reducing crime, and  developing the economy. He acknowledged that a lot more has to  be done for the welfare of the people. The President said that  the employment level is still unsatisfactory, a lot of violence  took place during this period, and there is a lack of optimism  in many areas. He further said that social welfare measures  will be reformed to reduce the dependence of people on  government allowances and to find jobs for them. The President  reiterated his pledge to guarantee health care. He also pledged  to formulate stringent laws to curb crime and added that more  police will be deployed. Life imprisonment will be sentenced for  persons involved in more than one crime. He also reiterated his  pledge to boost the economy and said that he will present a  tough budget next year. Dwelling on foreign policy, President  Clinton emphasized the need to further strengthen ties with the  allies of the United States. He further stated that support for  the new democratic states and the economic reforms in Russia  will continue.    The U.S. citizens voted for Bill Clinton with great  expectations for changes for a better life. Such large-scale  changes cannot be expected within the short span of one year.  It is not difficult to initiate the process of change. At this  moment, it is not possible to ascertain how much successl  Clinton has had in changing the fortunes of the American people  during his one year in office. This much can be said: Clinton  is making efforts to abide by his pledges. He has successes and  failures. During this period, the United States faced disaster  and crisis on various fronts. Repeated natural disasters have  become a cause of concern. In these natural calamities,  property worth several thousand dollars has been destroyed.  This will have an adverse effect on the economy. The setbacks  suffered by President Clinton in foreign policy cannot be  overlooked. U.S. policy failed in various countries, including  Bosnia, Somalia, North Korea, Pakistan, and China. It is  natural that the effects of these failures will be reflected on  the domestic front. If all factors are taken into  consideration, it could be said that the United States will face  harder days ahead. Hence, President Clinton, the U.S.  Administration, and the people should display more patience,  tolerance, farsightedness, and judiciousness.</p>

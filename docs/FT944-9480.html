			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (1): The figures paint a bright picture - With an anticipated doubling in passenger traffic and increased cargo activity in the next five to 10 years, most European airports are undertaking modernisation and expansion Air travel has always been regarded as a barometer of overall economic activity. One has only to visit any airport in Europe, or study the statistics, to be convinced that the recession of recent years is on the wane. The Association of European Airlines (AEA), representing 24 airlines, reports that the boom in demand so far this year continues. It expects traffic growth for the year as a whole, in terms of revenue passenger/kilometres flown, will be up between 8.5 and 9 per cent, with freight gaining about 13 per cent in revenue tonne/kilometres flown, 'marking 1994 as one of the best growth years of the last 15 years'. BAA, owner of seven UK airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in the London area, recently reported that in the 12 months to end-September it handled more than 74.2m passengers at those three airports, up 7 per cent on the previous 12 months. Heathrow alone handled 50.3m, a gain of 7.1 per cent. For cargo, the picture was even brighter, with total air freight handled at the three airports in the year to end- September up by 16.2 per cent to 1.14m metric tonnes, with Heathrow handling 945,417 metric tonnes, up 15.8 per cent. This is being repeated throughout Europe: almost every airport is crowded, and not just at peak periods. ACI Europe (the European regional section of the global Airports Council International), representing 261 airports in 43 countries throughout the region, reports passenger traffic up 7.9 per cent in the first half of 1994 at 278.5m with cargo up 11.7 per cent at 4.22m metric tonnes. Aircraft movements were up 2.4 per cent at more than 5m. Many airlines report strong business. The pattern of travel, too, appears to be well-spread, with a strong element of business travellers mixed in with leisure passengers. Not only are European airports becoming busier, but most of them are also undergoing modernisation and expansion. It has been estimated - by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) - that the cost of worldwide aviation infrastructure modernisation could run as high as Dollars 350bn from 1991 to 2010, with airport development alone accounting for Dollars 250bn of that, the rest being largely for air traffic control facilities. The figure, however, covers basic development costs, such as terminals, runways, aprons and the necessary equipment for operations. It does not cover the cost of associated infrastructure developments, such as external road and rail links and other facilities, which are often separately funded developments. If these outlays are included, the overall cost of world airport development could be much higher, perhaps about Dollars 400bn. The precise share of that required by Europe's airports is difficult to guage, for many development plans are still in process of formulation. But ACI Europe estimates that between 1993 and 1997 alone, its members throughout the region will be spending Dollars 22bn on modernisation and expansion programmes. These airports have combined annual revenues of about Dollars 13bn, employ more than 1m people and handle more than 520m passengers a year (both domestic and international), together with 8m tonnes of freight and 10m aircraft movements. These figures will rise as traffic grows. The Air Transport Action Group (a global coalition of aviation organisations) forecasts that European air traffic of more than 500m passengers in 1994-95 will rise to about 650m by 2000, and thereafter to 820m by 2005, and more than 1bn by 2010. In a further study on the economic benefits of air transport, ATAG points out that for every 1m passengers passing through an airport, between 2,500 and 8,000 jobs are created both directly and indirectly, with an annual economic impact of between Dollars 130m and Dollars 1.6bn. ATAG adds that airports also act as magnets for a wide range of industrial and commercial enterprises, often followed by the development of other urban infrastructures such as housing, schools, shops, road and rail transport. This creates further employment and economic growth. BAA says that Heathrow alone generates 70,000 jobs, and that another 6,000 will be generated if its proposed Pounds 900m Terminal 5 goes ahead. But the growing volume of traffic at Europe's airports has generated its own problems, operationally through congestion on the ground and in the air, and environmentally through the effects of noise and pollution on surrounding communities. Air congestion is being eased steadily by the sheer weight of increased terminal, runway and air traffic control infrastructures. In many places, road and rail access are also being improved, but at slower rates, so ground traffic congestion is often a serious problem, especially at peak hours. Earlier fears of strangulation of the air transport system because of infrastructure constraints are now lessened. ATAG points out that the estimated cost of congestion to the European economy will be about Dollars 6bn annually by the year 2000 against Dollars 10bn estimated earlier, with traffic lost due to congestion down to 27m passengers a year against an earlier estimate of 50m. But the problems are still there: ATAG says airport and ATC capacity improvements have barely kept up with increased demand. Continued spending on infrastructure will be necessary to keep pace with further traffic growth. There is also a growing feeling that governments and the EU tend to focus more on road and rail than on air transport, and that in the latter the emphasis is more on airlines than on airports. The AEA argues that the emphasis in the EU's plans for Trans European Networks is heavily biased towards road and rail. In the 34 transport projects which may qualify for EU financial support under this policy 'only three air transport projects - airport development at Milan, Berlin and Athens - are included', says the AEA, adding that most are national projects. 'None would have the pan-European dimension that the air traffic control project offers,' it says, a reference to the AEA's campaign for a unified 'Single Sky For Europe' in terms of air traffic control. ACI Europe, in turn, believes that in the air transport sector, the emphasis is biased in favour of airlines, with airports being largely neglected. In particular, there is a tendency to ignore the smaller regional airports when governments negotiate international air services agreements. As Philippe Hamon, director-general of ACI Europe, points out, in such matters national flag carriers are consulted, but neither the airports nor the regions they serve receive the same attention. Environmental issues are inextricably entwined with infrastructure development. No one likes an airport in his backyard, or even nearby, and the problem of finding where to put future additional runways and terminals will be compounded by the need to meet increasingly formidable environmental constraints. This is already difficult in the over-crowded London and south-east England region, and the solution may well require innovative thinking - perhaps even a return to the concept of an offshore airport in the Thames Estuary. Elsewhere on continental Europe, Paris Charles de Gaulle has more space avilable for new developments than most others, but there may well be problems elsewhere. Plans for a fifth runway at Amsterdam's Schiphol have already led to a site being selected further away from the city than the present airport. In the meantime, as a result of the massive rise in traffic over recent years and the potential further growth, airports as individual entities are substantially changing their character. The daily presence of thousands of people with time and money on their hands has seen the evolution of airports as important retail centres. BAA is actively exploiting this. As Mr Hamon has said: 'In the past 50 years airports have undergone major transformations. 'They have developed from aerodrome to airport. From public utility to commercial entity. From administration of a simple function to management of a complex enterprise. From providers of services to airlines to enterprises marketing to passengers. From primary facility to intermodal transportation centre, indeed a platform for many commercial activities and a partner in economic development.' He adds that today, as an essential part of the national and regional economy, this new role of airports 'must be acknowledged by regulators at both national and European level.'</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INDIGENT MEDICAL CARE AS A GIFT  </P> <P> I am writing in response to a letter from Dr. Arthur Silk. Dr. Silk states the  poor have no powerful citizens groups to lobby for them, "no Gray Panthers  battling for the destitute."  </P> <P> Dr. Silk does not have his facts straight.  </P> <P> The Gray Panthers, National Council of Senior Citizens, AARP and the Society to  Protect Social Security and Preserve Medicare have been actively advocating a  National Health Program that would provide access to all for years.  </P> <P> On the local scene, the California Gray Panthers, California Congress of  Seniors, the California Senior Legislature and the Senior Citizens Advisory  Council of Orange County all actively advocated California SB 2668, which would  have provided affordable health care to all Californians. They did not support  SB 2505, written by the California Medical Assn., which had no cost controls  and would have been administered by a board dominated by health-care providers,  doctors and hospitals.  </P> <P> Further, he bashes Proposition 13 for causing the crisis. Orange County spends  less per capita for health care for the needy than any other county in the  state.  </P> <P> ROBERT SHAFFER  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

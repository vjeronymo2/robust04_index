			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gerard Gahima] </F>   [Excerpts] Following the recent death of the Rwandan head  of state, President Habyarimana, our country has witnessed  sectarian violence unprecedented in history. That violence  erupted following the death of President Habyarimana was itself  not surprising. Gross human rights violations have marked the  whole of the post- independence period. Indeed thousands,  perhaps tens of thousands of lives, have perished in Rwanda over  the past few years. International human rights organizations  such as Africa Watch, Amnesty International, and others have  accurately documented the atrocities which President  Habyarimana, the Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development, his party, and associates have committed in recent  times. [passage omitted]    Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, the health minister, is in Kinshasa.  Many others are already in Europe. The world cannot and should  not forget the genocide which is being perpetrated in Rwanda  today by the surviving associates and allies of the late  President Habyarimana. No effort should be spared in ensuring  that the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are all brought to  justice. The leaders of the evil forces which are carrying out  the genocide who are escaping or may in the coming days escape  from the country, should not be permitted by the Rwandan people  to get away. Neither should foreign countries grant them  asylum. Our criminals who are directly and personally  responsible for causing the death of tens of thousands of their  fellow citizens, they should be promptly apprehended in the  countries to which they may flee so that arrangements can be  made to bring them to justice. We call upon the international  community, especially governments, the United Nations, the OAU,  and international human rights organizations to spare no effort  in helping to highlight the extent of the current genocide and  to assist in bringing the war criminals in question to book.    We also call upon all Rwandan people, diplomatic personnel,  nongovernmental organizations, and other well-wishers who have  been witnesses of the atrocities which have been committed in  Rwanda over the past week, to render every assistance possible  towards exposing the culprits so that they may be ostracized,  isolated, and adequately punished for their war crimes. The  complete apprehension, incarceration, and punishment of every  one of the war criminals involved in the atrocities which are  being committed would be a prerequisite for the restoration of  peace, law and order, and in the long-term democracy in our  country. Last but not least, we call upon the community of  nations to come to the assistance of the surviving victims of  the genocide and to assist the RPF in its efforts to liberate  our country from the grip of the murderous regime responsible  for the genocide.</p>

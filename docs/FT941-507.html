			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Hebron security talks held in secret Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met secretly in Cairo last night, in a continuing effort to finalise security arrangements for Palestinians in Hebron, which the PLO has insisted are the precondition for returning to full peace talks. PLO officials said before the talks they did not expect to announce any agreement before today. They refused to call the talks 'negotiations', saying their delegates were simply 'receiving answers from the Israeli government'. The PLO and Israel agreed last week in principle to the deployment of international observers and Palestinian police in Hebron but were at odds over the number to be deployed and rules of deployment. Israel has said it will permit only 60 international observers and a few dozen Palestinian police; the PLO insisted on 150 observers and 400 police. PLO negotiators kept their Israeli counterparts waiting for over an hour before the talks started. They were awaiting clearance from Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman based in Tunis, who had convened senior officials to discuss whether to stall the talks in protest at the shooting of six members of his own Fatah faction in Gaza on Tuesday. The two sides are likely to proceed as quickly as possible on resolving the Hebron issue before moving directly to a resumption of full talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. These talks have been suspended since an Israeli settler killed over 30 Palestinians in Hebron on February 25. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, seemed downhearted yesterday, speaking of the 'many obstacles' to be overcome before talks could resume, and ruling out any prospect of an early summit between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, and Mr Arafat. The Israeli team, last night briefing Mr Rabin on the Tunis talks, ruled out PLO calls for the removal of Jewish settlers from Hebron. Most Israeli ministers favour evacuation of the settlers, but Mr Rabin has been adamant that, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington last September, the issue of settlements remains off the agenda for at least two years.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MATH, READING SCORES MIXED  </P> <P> California's 12th-graders scored slightly lower in reading and slightly higher  in mathematics this year, results of the 1988-89 California Assessment Program  test show.  </P> <P> Statewide, the average score rose six points to 256 in mathematics but dropped  two points to 248 in reading.  </P> <P> In Ventura County, the county superintendent of schools' office had not had  time to analyze the results, according to a spokesman. However, a number of  school districts reflected the statewide pattern.  </P> <P> The Conejo Valley Unified School District, which has 1,510 12th-graders, showed  increased scores in math and decreased scores in reading. Among the nine school  districts in the county, Conejo Valley scored highest in math, a district  official said.  </P> <P> Only one of the three high schools in the district, Westlake, showed a decrease  in math scores, dropping two points. That school also showed a significant  decrease in reading, plunging 54 points over the 1987-88 scores.  </P> <P> "We are still above the state average in both math and reading," said Sylvia  Michael, associate director of research and assessment, "but are looking at the  scores and trying to analyze them."  </P> <P> Oxnard Union High School District, with 2,024 12th-grade students tested, also  showed the same statewide trend, with scores higher in math and lower in  reading, according to a district official.  </P> <P> State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig offered an upbeat appraisal of the  state's scores, saying that although some of this year's results are  disappointing, "the long-term trend is more impressive."  </P> <P> For example, Honig said, an analysis of test results shows that the average  12th-grade student today is performing nearly a full grade level higher in math  and half a grade level higher in reading than five years ago.  </P> <P> "That is the fastest spurt of growth in this state ever," he said.  </P> <P> The statewide decline in reading scores occurred mainly among girls, whose  average score fell six points to 251.  </P> <P> "I don't understand it," Honig said of the reading slump among girls. "I don't  know if it's an anomaly or if this particular class is different or if  something we're doing is wrong."  </P> <P> A recent College Board study showed a narrowing of the gender gap over the last  20 years on tests of verbal ability, and "this could be part of it," Honig  said.  </P> <P> Historically, women have scored significantly higher than men on tests of  language skill. But the College Board study found that women's verbal scores  have been falling and men's scores rising on such tests as the Scholastic  Aptitude Test (SAT), the American College Testing Program Examination (ACT) and  advanced placement exams.  </P> <P> Among California's 12th-grade boys, reading test results showed a one-point  gain to an average of 245.  </P> <P> Improvement in math was found across-the-board, with gains made by male and  female students and all major ethnic groups, Honig said.  </P> <P> Pat McCabe, a California Assessment Program consultant for the state Department  of Education, noted that the number of limited-English-speaking students rose  1% statewide to 6.3% in 1988-89. But those students as a group scored 12 points  higher in math and one point higher in reading than did last year's  limited-English group, McCabe said.  </P> <P> Limited-English students still performed considerably lower than most students  statewide, however, with an average reading score of 132 and average math score  of 187.  </P> <P> Statewide, 95% of all 12th-graders, or 226,000 students, took the California  Assessment Program test in December, 2% more than in 1987-88.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW TO READ THE SCORES  </P> <P> * Districts are in boldface (the first entry on each table); individual schools  are in lighter face. Two years of test results are given. The first line of  numbers contains 1988-89 test results, while the second line refers to 1987-88  results. Scores for magnet programs, continuation schools and other schools  with small enrollments have been omitted.  </P> <P> * The scores are reported on a scale from 100 to about 400. The average score  statewide in 1988-89 was 248 in reading and 256 in math.  </P> <P> * The "rank" which follows each score allows comparisons to all other districts  or schools statewide. All schools and districts are ranked on a scale of 1 to  99 with a median rank of 50. Thus, for example, the Los Angeles County High  School for the Arts has a rank of 98 in reading and 78 in math, which means it  scored considerably higher than other high schools in the state in both areas.  </P> <P> * "SES" is a measure of a school's or a district's socioeconomic status. It is  based on student reports of parents' education level. Each school and district  is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating parents who did not  complete high school and 5 indicating those with advanced degrees. A 3 would  mean that most parents in the school or district attended some college.  </P> <P> * "% LEP" is the percentage of students who are limited-English-proficient,  which means they are not native English speakers and are not yet fluent in  English. The average California school has 6.3% LEP students.  </P> <P> * In some districts in which only one school is listed, the district and school  averages may be different. The reason is that the district average included the  scores of a large number of continuation school students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sample Reading Questions  </P> <P> Read the following autobiographical selection by Ernesto Galarza, and then  answer the questions that follow it. You may look back at the passage as you  answer the questions.  </P> <P>  Boyhood in a Sacramento Barrio  </P> <P> Our family conversations always occurred on our own kitchen porch, away from  the gringos. One or the other of the adults would begin: Se han fijado? Had we  noticed -- that the Americans do not ask permission to leave the room; that  they had no respectful way of addressing an elderly person; that they spit  brown over the railing of the porch into the yard; that when they laughed they  roared; that they never brought saludos to everyone in your family from  everyone in their family when they visited; that General Delibree was only a  clerk; that zopilotes were not allowed on the streets to collect garbage; that  the policemen did not carry lanterns at night; that Americans didn't keep their  feet on the floor when they were sitting; that there was a special automobile  for going to jail; that a rancho was not a rancho at all but a very small  hacienda; that the saloons served their customers free eggs, pickles, and  sandwiches; that instead of bullfighting, the gringos for sport tried to kill  each other with gloves?  </P> <P> I did not have nearly the strong feelings on these matters that Dona Henriqueta  expressed. I felt a vague admiration for the way Mr. Brien could spit brown.  Wayne, my classmate, laughed much better than the Mexicans,because he opened  his big mouth wide and brayed like a donkey so he could be heard a block away.  But it was the kind of laughter that made my mother tremble, and it was not  permitted in our house.  </P> <P> Rules were laid down to keep me, as far as possible, un muchacho bien educado.  If I had to spit, I was to do it privately, or if in public, by the curb, with  my head down and my back to people. I was never to wear my cap in the house and  I was to take it off even on the porch if ladies or elderly gentlemen were  sitting. If I wanted to scratch, under no circumstances was I to do it right  then and there, in company, like the Americans, but I was to excuse myself. If  Catfish or Russell yelled to me from across the street, I was not to shout  back. I was never to ask for tips for my errands or other services to the  tenants of 418L, for these were atenciones expected of me.  </P> <P> Above all I was never to fail in respeto to grownups, no matter who they were.  It was an inflexible rule; I addressed myself to Senor Big Singh, Senor Big  Ernie, Senora Dodson, Senor Choree Lopez.  </P> <P> We could have hung on the door of our apartment a sign like those we read in  some store windows -- Aqui se habla espanol. We not only spoke Spanish, we read  it. From the Libreria Espanola, two blocks up the street, Gustavo and I brought  novels for my mother, like Genoveva de Brabante, a paperback with the poems of  Amado Nervo and a handbook of the history of Mexico. The novels were never read  aloud; the poems and the handbook were. Nervo was the famous poet from Tepic,  close enough to Jalcocotan to make him our own. And in the history book I  learned to read for myself, after many repetitions by my mother, about the  deeds of the great Mexicans Don Salvador had recited so vividly to the class in  Mazatlan. She refused to decide for me whether Abraham Lincoln was as great as  Benito Juarez, or George Washington braver than the priest Don Miguel Hidalgo.  At school there was no opportunity to settle these questions because nobody  seemed to know about Juarez or Hidalgo; at least they were never mentioned and  there were no pictures of them on the walls.  </P> <P>  -- Ernesto Galarza  </P> <P> QUESTIONS:  </P> <P> The central focus of the first paragraph shows:  </P> <P> A. difficulties the author had in adjusting to life in America.  </P> <P> B. rules that Mexican-American children were encouraged to obey.  </P> <P> C. differences between American and Mexican customs and habits.  </P> <P> D. several Mexican heroes who are unknown in America.  </P> <P> The underlined statement in the second paragraph is an example of:  </P> <P> A. a fact.  </P> <P> B. a hypothesis.  </P> <P> C. an opinion.  </P> <P> D. a contradiction.  </P> <P> You can conclude from the last paragraph that the author's teachers:  </P> <P> A. encouraged him to learn his country's history through reading and discussion  with his mother.  </P> <P> B. did not teach their students about important leaders of other countries.  </P> <P> C. were familiar with the bookstore near his apartment.  </P> <P> D. did not encourage discussions initiated by students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sample Math Question  </P> <P> The area of a square plot of land is 3/4 of a square mile. What is the  approximate length of one side?  </P> <P>  -- less than .8 mile  </P> <P>  -- between .8 mile and .9 mile  </P> <P>  -- between .9 mile and 1 mile  </P> <P>  -- greater than 1 mile  </P>

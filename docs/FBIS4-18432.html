			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The true mark of great political leaders  is their willingness to speak seriously to the people and  provide them with correct information, writes Spiros Linardhatos  in the 20 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TTS KIRIAKIS. In contrast,  the "Macedonian" issue is an example of demagoguery and  delusion, with political leaders "saying one thing and doing  another," Linardhatos continues. To illustrate, he quotes a  letter from former Prime Minister Mitsotakis to the Athens  weekly OIKONOMIKOS TAKHIDHROMOS, in which Mitsotakis admitted  that the "Skopje problem" should heve been settled by his  government through an advantageous compromise based on a  "composite name" and the fulfillment of conditions on "the  symbol, the constitution, and propaganda." However, Mitsotakis  continued, a settlement did not occur because "until the New  Democracy (ND) government fell, the required parliamentary  majority to solve the issue was lacking." The former prime  minister failed to explain why the people were not told a  compromise with Skopje was necessary and that continuing  confrontation over the name issue was harmful to Greece's  national interests, Linardhatos comments. The present  Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government doubtlessly  knows that such an "advantageous "--or at least "not  harmful"--compromise will allow the country to face important  domestic and foreign problems, on which Greece's place in the  world and the people's welfare depend, Linardhatos notes.  Dialogue and international support could produce satisfactory  results, for the Greek "countermeasures" adopted against Skopje  have caused problems, notably in the Greek European Union (EU)  presidency. More importantly, the continuing crisis strengthens  Balkan countries inimical to Greece and fosters domestic  antidemocratic tendencies by intensifying nationalistic  sentiment and expressions of "intolerance and ideological  terrorism" like the demand by three deputies for punitive  measures against academics calling for a compromise, Linardhatos  concludes.    Calling Greece's position in the Balkans "problematic," K.I.  Angelopoulos notes in the 20 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI  that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou interrupted the UN  process on Skopje and "spectacularly" imposed an embargo on that  country. At the same time, Papandreou is attempting to start a  dialogue that would omit the name issue despite the resulting  difficulties. According to Angelopoulos, the prime minister  believes that even if the name is a "lost cause," he lacks the  requisite strength to give up his rejection of "Macedonia or a  byproduct" and prefers to set the issue aside. It should be  noted, Angelopoulos adds, that the prime minister does not wish  to link any development in the Skopje affair with his official  April visit to Washington, in the belief that a "pending issue"  will not affect Greek-American talks. Angelopoulos cites  unidentified Papandreou aides as saying that the prime minister  will only ask President Clinton to exert more pressure on Skopje  President Kiro Gligorov. According to the same sources,  Papandreou is more interested in promoting Greek-American  cooperation in the Balkans and will go for the "best possible"  contacts in this regard during his U.S. visit. However,  Angelopoulos comments that it may be difficult to fulfill Greek  ambitions for a central role in the Balkans if Greece persists  in not recognizing the Skopje republic, given the demonstrated  interest in that country by its Balkan neighbors, Europe, and  the United States. The problem is not only diplomatic,  Angelopoulos continues. While Skopje is affected by the Greek  embargo, Greek economic and political losses are becoming  increasingly obvious and Athens is watching Balkan developments  from the sidelines. While Papandreou "hears" Washington  extolling the advantages of a Greek intervention in the area, he  remains "trapped" in the Skopje issue, as did his predecessors  in the past two years, Angelopoulos concludes.</p>

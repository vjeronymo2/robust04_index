			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SEGERSTROM HONORED FOR HIS ARTS SERVICE  </P> <P> Henry T. Segerstrom, who is stepping down as chairman of the Orange County  Performing Arts Center board of directors, was honored Friday night at a  black-tie dinner held on the stage in the center's 3,000-seat theater in Costa  Mesa.  </P> <P> Segerstrom, 67, a managing partner of the Costa Mesa-based development firm  C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons Inc., announced plans to retire from the 52-member  board in April.  </P> <P> Replacing him as president is William Lyon, head of the William Lyon Co., a  Newport Beach-based development firm that is Southern California's largest home  builder.  </P> <P> "After having been president since the inception of the Performing Arts Center,  he wanted to step down and give someone else a chance," said Hal Segerstrom,  Henry Segerstrom's cousin and another managing partner in the family-owned  company.  </P> <P> Bylaws of the Performing Arts Center board prevented Segerstrom from serving  more than three consecutive one-year terms.  </P> <P> The gala was attended by prominent supporters of the Performing Arts Center,  which opened in September, 1986.  </P> <P> "This is for all the people wanting to thank Henry for the leadership he's  given over the years," said Thomas H. Nielsen, vice chairman of the Irvine Co.  and a member of the gala organizing committee. "Since the land-use was approved  for the Performing Arts Center, he has been the leader of all the efforts to  design and build it."  </P> <P> Segerstrom headed fund-raising efforts in the mid-1980s that garnered $73.3  million to build the Center's Segerstrom Hall theater complex.  </P> <P> The Segerstrom family donated the land and pledged $6 million toward the  construction.  </P> <P> Plans are under way to expand the Center with a symphony concert hall and a  small, multipurpose theater.

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY, DEVELOPER SEEK $5.5-MILLION LOAN FOR MALL  </P> <P> The city's Community Redevelopment Agency and developer Alexander Haagen are  negotiating a deal that could provide a loan of up to $5.5 million for  improvements to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza to entice stores to locate  there.  </P> <P> The agency and the Alexander Haagen Co., joint developers of the  800,000-square-foot mall, opened talks this month in an effort to attract shoe  stores, card and gift shops, sporting goods outlets and women's clothing  stores.  </P> <P> The mall is the first regional shopping center in the nation to be built in a  predominantly black community. It opened more than a year ago amid much  celebration from the residents of the largely middle- and upper-middle-class  communities of Baldwin Hills, View Park, Crenshaw and Leimert Park.  </P></p>

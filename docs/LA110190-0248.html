			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. FIRMS AID MOSCOW EXCHANGE  </P> <P> The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed today to  provide training and technical advice to help the fledgling Moscow Commodities  Exchange grow from "one step above barter" into a Western-style market.  </P> <P> The agreement with the two American organizations is designed to help the  entrepreneurs who set up the five-month-old Moscow exchange as they struggle to  break away from 70 years of central planning and set up a free market for  materials.  </P> <P> Currently, just about anything from construction materials to radios can be  directly traded and sold at the exchange's small monthly sessions in a corner  of a Moscow exhibition hall -- if someone has the materials to trade.  </P> <P> The exchange plans to expand to two sessions a month by the end of the year,  and organizers hope eventually to deal in contracts and establish a futures  market as well as set up a currency exchange as the ruble moves toward  convertibility.  </P></p>

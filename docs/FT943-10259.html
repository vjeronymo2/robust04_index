			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Ozone alarms bring autobahn miracle: For German drivers hurtling towards the next jam, times are changing It may be merely midsummer madness, a by-product of the heatwave sweltering over the European continent, but something seems to have snapped in the German soul. That ultimate symbol of German success, the motorway maniac with his halogen headlights scorching down the autobahn at 220kph, appears to have slowed down - voluntarily. In the state of Hesse, home of the Bundesbank and the Frankfurt financiers, a few fluttering banners strung yesterday across the six-lane highways leading to the hills said: 'Ozone alarm: 80 kph'. To universal amazement, four out of five drivers obeyed. Environmentalists have seized on this extraordinary success to demand the ultimate heresy: a universal speed limit on the German roads. The opposition Social Democrats have U-turned party policy, overruling fears of a backlash from the voters, and calling for a maximum 130kph. The country is torn. For two of the touchstones of the German identity have been thrown into open conflict: panic about the environment, and the absolute determination to drive down the autobahn as fast as one physically can. The irony is that half the time one physically can't. For the wonderful German autobahn system is grinding to a halt in interminable traffic jams every weekend, as the population indulges in the national religion of heading for the hills, the sea, or the woods - anywhere but home. 'That's part of the problem,' says Paul Schumacher, political editor of RTL television, who drives a large Mercedes to work and a convertible Rolls Royce for pleasure. 'If the German motorist has to spend half his life in a jam, he demands the right to spend the rest of his time driving flat out.' He admits to speeding up the unregulated autobahn from Bonn to Cologne at around 200 kph and being regularly overtaken by five or six drivers going faster. 'At 180, you had better drive in the slow lane,' he says. That was before this summer's ozone alarms. Parents are refusing to let their children play in the playgrounds. The city of Cologne has banned its schools from organising outdoor sports. Hesse is only the first of a string of states expected to impose autobahn speed limits whenever ozone levels rise over 180 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Predictably, the motoring lobby is up in arms. 'Short- term speed limits have no, or very marginal, effects on ozone levels,' says the ADAC motorists' club. Yet even the ADAC admits that its own members are split 50:50 for and against a national speed limit. So why do half of them want to drive so fast? 'I think you will have to ask a traffic psychologist,' says Mr Maximilian Maurer, a spokesman for the ADAC in Munich. 'If people have a car that goes at 200, and the open autobahn in front of them, they can't see why they shouldn't drive that fast. But the real reason is more deep-seated. It is something emotional for us.' But German motorists don't only love speeding. They appear to love their traffic jams, too. And they last not just for hours but, at peak holiday periods, for days. The ADAC has a team of so-called 'traffic jam consultants' touring the autobahns on motorcycles, bringing succour to the benighted motorist. 'Most motorists are much better equipped for jams these days than when I started,' one of the old hands said on TV yesterday. 'They bring enough bottles of water, and cool-bags of food, too. They bring games for their children to play. 'There's also a problem if you need to go to the lavatory. We advise every motorist to carry a folding spade, for emergencies.' It is all an admirable example of Germany's extraordinary thoroughness. And that, says the ADAC, is also why Germany doesn't need any universal speed limit. 'They have them in other countries, like Italy,' says Mr Maurer, 'but they simply don't obey them. We would be very law abiding.' There is something called a 'recommended maximum speed' on German autobahns of 130 kph, but it has no penal provisions. A recent court ruling said it should be taken into account when assessing liability in accidents. Has it had any effect on the speed merchants? 'Absolutely none, as far as we can tell,' says Mr Maurer. Only the ozone alarm can do that.</p>

The Russian elections have shown a real situation in society  and possible scenarios of its development. It is obvious that  the fledgling dictatorial tendencies must be resolutely opposed.  One should not stand aside at a time when society is threatened  with turmoil. The deputies' club will keep to the following  principles in its activities: Rejection of violent actions,  accord and equality of nationalities, intolerance to  totalitarianism in all its manifestations, equality of all types  of ownerships, including private ownership of land.    The first meeting of the deputies with common sense,  concerned with the fate of their people, will take place on 5  January.</p>

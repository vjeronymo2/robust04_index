			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa sees gains from Thai deal Lufthansa, the newly-privatised German airline, said its profits should start to benefit next year from the cargo and passenger freight deal signed yesterday with Thai Airways International. At a time when Lufthansa is returning to the black - it posted its first profit for five years in the first half of 1994 - analysts said the alliance with Thai, foreshadowed earlier this month, should bring considerable cost savings. It also showed the strength of Lufthansa's ambitions in south-east Asia, with more deals expected. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, said the link with Thai should lead to an improvement of at least DM10m (Dollars 6.4m) in net profits in the first full year of co-operation. The tie-up begins next spring. Mr Michael Broeker, head of German equity research at Nomura International, said the figure could be about DM20m. First-half pre-tax profits totalled DM105m against a DM221m loss in the same period of 1993. Mr Weber did not rule out the possibility of a share exchange between the airlines. 'If this (the co-operation deal) is successful, then such an exchange of equity is possible.' However, Lufthansa said it was not the airline's usual policy to take stakes in airlines with which it was co-operating. Both Lufthansa and Thai are linked with United Airlines of the US through co-operation agreements, and the German company said the three carriers would be running what it called 'the world's largest international network of air services'. Mr Weber said the Thai deal would enable both companies to offer new destinations, with joint flight bookings, increased flight frequencies and new connecting services. 'Given the importance of Asia, I think it's a very important strategic move by Lufthansa,' said Mr Julius Maldutis, airlines analyst at Salomon Brothers. 'The big savings are in cost-avoidance.' Both he and Mr Broeker saw potential in the fast-growing freight market, with Lufthansa saying the intention was to make Bangkok the leading cargo hub for the Asia-Pacific region. Lufthansa would not comment on speculation that further deals were likely in Asia, possibly in China or with Garuda of Indonesia. But Mr Broeker said: 'The next step is definitely coming in this market.' Lufthansa has limited co-operation deals with Cathay Pacific on freight, Japan Air Lines on passengers and Garuda on technical support.</p>

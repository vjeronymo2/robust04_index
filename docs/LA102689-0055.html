			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FALL SPORTS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL NO MATCH FOR CLAREMONT  </P> <P> Last month, the Occidental men's soccer team played one of its best matches of  the season against conference-rival Claremont, losing in double overtime to the  Stags, ranked No. 2 in Division III.  </P> <P> Wednesday's rematch at Claremont, however, was a different story as Claremont  raced to a three-goal lead at halftime en route to a 5-0 win in a Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference match.  </P> <P> "We couldn't generate any offense at all and we didn't play defense well,  either," Occidental Coach Lowell Thomas said. "You can't afford to play sloppy  against a team that good and expect to do very well."  </P> <P> Occidental fell to 6-8-2, 5-4-2 in conference play.  </P> <P> In another soccer match:  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran 3, Caltech 2 -- Casey Pirih and Ricky Meyers hooked up on both the  giving and receiving end to lead Cal Lutheran in a nonconference match at  Caltech.  </P> <P> Myers scored unassisted at the 14-minute mark to give CLU (11-5-1) a 1-0 lead.  Pirih scored six minutes later on an assist from Jesse Gallegos for a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Myers scored Cal Lutheran's final goal on an assist from Pirih at the 48-minute  mark.  </P> <P> College Wrestling  </P> <P> Moorpark 22, Bakersfield 21 -- Bakersfield needed a pin in the final match to  secure a tie, but Moorpark heavyweight David Mitchell managed to hold off  George Anderson, 20-5, to keep the Raiders unbeaten in Western State Conference  competition.  </P> <P> Moorpark (6-1-1, 2-0) won several lopsided matches in building a big lead. In  the 188-pound class, Moorpark's Delfino Ochoa defeated Steve Ward, 21-6. At 190  pounds, Moorpark's Carson Wollert beat Steve Sherr, 16-4. Tony Flores of  Moorpark defeated Jim Frolic, 14-5, at 177 pounds.  </P> <P> Robbie Cook (134 pounds), Doug Roberts (142) and Serge Mezheritsky (150) also  secured wins.  </P> <P> High School Volleyball  </P> <P> Taft d. Kennedy, 15-3, 15-12, 15-8 -- Lynn Pinkus had 14 kills for Taft in a  West Valley League match at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Chris Veeck had six kills and three stuff blocks for Taft (3-5 in league play).  Ali Pickett had eight kills for Kennedy.  </P> <P> Cleveland d. Canoga Park, 15-2, 15-13, 10-15, 15-10 -- Freshman middle blocker  Michele Diana had a season-high 17 kills to lead Cleveland in a North Valley  League match at Canoga Park.  </P> <P> Cleveland is 9-3, 5-3.  </P> <P> High School Tennis  </P> <P> Agoura 10, La Reina 8 -- Tricia Silverman won three sets at No. 1 singles to  propel Agoura to a nonleague win at home.  </P></p>

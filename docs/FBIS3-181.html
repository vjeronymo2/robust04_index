			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Housing Issue Becomes Political Football -- Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 2 March in a page-14 editorial notes that the  African National Congress (ANC) is "irritated that the Minister  of National Housing, Louis Shill, should try to gain the  political initiative by announcing a 10-year housing plan just  weeks before the election." The Transitional Executive Council  has resolved that the plan "should be suspended until the  controversy is settled." Shill disclaims "ulterior motives" in  unveiling the plan. "Whatever the rights and wrongs, those with  the interests of the homeless at heart will want a start made.  Housing has been a political football far too long."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Warning Against Jeopardizing Housing Plan -- Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 March in a page-8 editorial also  refers to Housing Minister Shill's announcement of the 10-year  housing plan, saying "such an important project should not be  jeopardised by politicking or an individual's ego." In calling  for Shill's resignation ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa  "accused Shill of trying to hijack the project for the benefit  of the National Party, in spite of an appeal by the National  Housing Forum that he should wait until a few sticking points  had been cleared up." The plan "clearly has the general  approval of the forum, and putting it into operation will be the  task of the new government." The forum will have to "smooth out  remaining problems at its plenary session on March 14, and then  get on with the job of building houses. It should not be  distracted by the pleasure of taking parting shots at Shill."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Call for Government To Address Election `Anxiety' -- "Too  many things seem to be falling apart as we near the magical date  for the first one man, one vote elections," declares a page-10  editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 2 March. "There  are political disruptions and violence at the macro level while  things are not exactly rosy at the local level." The editorial  refers to the strikes at various hospitals, and the strikes by  railway employees, as well as the "uncertainties" in the taxi  industry. "There is too much uncertainty and anxiety. If the  Government is serious about having proper elections, they must  put their house in order. They must give those they hope will  vote for them the confidence that the situation will improve  after the elections."</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: A God for all seasons - The concept of deity is forever versatile A HISTORY OF GOD by Karen Armstrong Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 511 pages A NICE temerity attaches to the title of Karen Armstrong's book, for God allegedly exists outside time and therefore, like the virtuous woman of parable, has no history. But Armstrong has not attempted a history of God, but of mankind's idea of God; or rather of mankind's many ideas of God. For the concept of deity is protean, and readily assumes the shapes into which history's pressures squeeze humanity's needs. Armstrong was once a Roman Catholic nun, and wrote a bestselling account of her loss of faith and return to secular life. Since then she has made a profession of her somewhat ambiguous agnosticism, as an eloquent journalist of religion who is sympathetic to its attractions but sceptical of its claims. The ambiguity of her agnosticism arises from her preparedness to give house-room to thinkers as different as the medieval Meister Eckhart and the modern Ivan Tillich, who cannot accept literal God-with-a-white-beard theologies, but who believe there is some sort of Absolute nevertheless; and who hide its indescribability behind a fig-leaf of paradox. In this ambitious book Armstrong traces the history of Jewish, Christian and Islamic concepts of God from their beginnings to the present. This is a vast subject, demanding a wide range of scholarly skills. Only a tome compiled by specialists would be truly adequate, and Armstrong's single-handed attempt cannot claim to be so. She ventures Old Testament scholarship, classical philology, Islamic history, modern philosophy, and much besides; but by the end her exposition has become a series of vignettes, a couple of pages each to this thinker or that topic, betraying heavy reliance on second-hand material, and exposing Armstrong in waters beyond her depth. But this is a commendable book nevertheless, and an interesting one, and I would rather it were widely read than not, for it says something important. Drawing on her own experience, Armstrong remarks that most people acquire confused ideas about religion in childhood, and thereafter neither modify nor develop them. But as soon as we realise that theologies are the product of history, during which barely recognisable versions of our own culture's beliefs have variously flourished and failed, we come to see religion in a markedly different light. It must, for example, strike even desultory readers of the Old Testament that the tribal god it depicts is a bully and a tyrant. The contrast with the New Testament's avuncular deity is striking. But what readers might not know is that some biblical texts have a decidedly questionable history. Consider Deuteronomy, which, in the midst of yet another doctrinal quarrel within Israel, was suddenly and conveniently 'found' by workmen refurbishing the Temple - and of course gave unequivocal support to one side of the argument. Yahweh often entered on cue like this, apparently unable to resist politics; and invariably on the winning side. Jesus's divinity affords another example. In Mark's Gospel he is a man; in the theology of St Paul he is the medium of the New Covenant; in the fourth century AD, after the Arian 'heresy' controversy - Arius of Alexandria had argued that Jesus must be less divine than the Father - he becomes very God in human form. One of the book's most fascinating chapters concerns the rise of Islam, which Armstrong tells us resulted from an Arabic sense of inferiority. Arabs, she says, felt 'mingled resentment and respect' for Jews and Christians because they had enjoyed direct communication with God. Leaders like Zayd ibn Amr longed for their own people to receive a divine revelation. It came at last to Muhammad ibn Abdallah in a terrifying experience on Mount Hira outside Mecca, in which the angel Gabriel instructed him to 'Recite]' The result, produced at laborious intervals over the following two decades, was the Koran, the 'Recitation', whose sheer beauty of language is reputed to have been a frequent instrument of conversion in its own right. But, as with Christianity, splits and controversies followed, and Islam's early tolerance towards other religions soon vanished, as did the early freedoms enjoyed by its women. And again as with Christianity, the long-term legacy includes the familiar horrors of intolerance, bigotry and persecution which characterise all organised religion. The concept of God, Armstrong shows, is a gerrymandered affair. But she insists nevertheless that humans are spiritual creatures, and tentatively wonders whether the new theologies of Tillich, Martin Buber and others might meet our cravings for something ultimate. She is right to say that spirituality matters; but some of us would argue that only art and affection can appease its hungers. Her book therefore suggests a different solution. Rather than seek another new definition of God, we might do better to dispense with theologies altogether and place our hopes in the best of things human instead.</p>

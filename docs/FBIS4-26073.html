			<p>BFN     [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party  committee, went to the municipal kinescope plant on 5 June to  conduct investigation and study on the enterprise's effort to  deepen reform, end deficit and increase profit, and improve  efficiency and the life of its staff members and workers. He  emphasized: Reform is the only way out. We must take reform as  a driving force; add impetus to enterprise reform, to the work  to end deficit and increase profit, and to the effort to do  practical work for enterprises; mobilize and rely on the vast  number of staff members and workers to participate in and carry  out reform successfully; improve enterprises' economic  efficiency; and facilitate faster and better economic  development in Tianjin.    In the morning, Gao Dezhan, secretary; and Zheng Zhiying,  standing committee member and secretary general of the municipal  party committee, arrived at the kinescope plant, a state  second-level enterprise established 20 years ago. Gao Dezhan  and others inspected production lines at workshops and talked  cordially with workers at their posts to learn about the  situation. They also held a discussion with members of the  plant's leading body to hear reports on relevant conditions.    The Tianjin Municipal Kinescope Plant is a large state-owned  enterprise, which used to be a large tax payer and whose  products have been named as quality products of the state and  the ministry on many occasions. Due to the failure in timely  transformation of its internal mechanisms and other reasons, the  plant began to experience a decline in economic efficiency and  suffer losses ever since 1990 and became a large loss maker of  Tianjin. Since June last year when the newly adjusted leading  body assumed office, it extensively mobilized staff members and  workers of the entire plant to offer suggestions to rationalize  production and adopted a series of reform measures to pull the  enterprise out of the predicament, thus enabling it to reduce  its losses by 50 percent in the same year. In the first five  months of this year, an increase of over 30 percent was  registered in the output, output value, sales income of its  products when compared with the same period last year. The  plant ended deficit and made a profit of over 1 million yuan in  May. By deepening reform, it has regained vigor.    Gao Dezhan affirmed the plant's achievements in deepening  reform, ending deficit, and increasing profit. He said: The  kinescope plant achieved marked results in ending deficit and  increasing profit thanks to deepened reform. This proved that  reform is the only way out and the driving force. The key to  deepening reform lies in determination, boldness, and earnest  effort in performing work. Large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises have made great contributions to the state, and  their quality if good. There are many factors for their current  difficulties. As has been proven in practice, enterprises can  be invigorated and can stimulate the enthusiasm of its staff  members and workers as long as they pay close attention to  enterprise reform, their own mechanisms, and the market;  decentralize the accounting procedures; establish the market  mechanism within their plants; and successfully conduct the  reform of the three systems. The very reason for the kinescope  plant to achieve substantial results within a short time is its  effort to add impetus to reform and to the work of ending  deficit and increasing profit.    Gao Dezhan said: To succeed in the internal reform of  enterprises, a good leading body is needed, which is diligent  and honest in performing duties and brave in pioneering new  causes, and which wholeheartedly rely on the working class and  give full play to its role as the major force.    Gao Dezhan said: As an old industrial base, Tianjin will  have no hope if it fails to improve enterprises. Only when  enterprises are improved and invigorated can Tianjin become  prosperous. In doing practical work to benefit the masses, we  should not only address current problems, but we should also  keep the fundamental interest of the masses in mind, which, in  the final analysis, means to promote the economy. To be  specific, we should enhance Tianjin's economic strength, improve  the efficiency of enterprises, increase the revenues of the  municipality as well as districts and counties, increase the  income of urban and rural staff members and workers, and  continuously upgrade the living standard. As far as enterprises  are concerned, they should achieve success in deepening reform,  opening wider to the outside world, adjusting the structure,  conducting technical transformation, strengthening management,  developing new products, improving leading bodies, training  staff members and workers, improving work teams, and building  the spiritual civilization, which should all be focused on  reform. Enterprises must make arduous efforts to improve their  skills, and other units must provide favorable conditions to  improve service. Through the concerted efforts of all fields, we  should make good enterprises more prosperous and help difficult  enterprises seize the opportunity quickly to resolve the  difficulties of their staff members and workers, increase their  income, and stimulate their enthusiasm.    Gao Dezhan emphasized: It is no easy task for enterprises to  achieve good results in reform and in ending deficit and  increasing profit. Such good results must be consolidated and  developed. Pertinent municipal departments should earnestly  summarize and disseminate the good typical examples in deepening  enterprise reform, ending deficit, and increasing profit so that  greater breakthrough can be made throughout the municipality.</p>

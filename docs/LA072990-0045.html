			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGEWEEK: A MUM'S OCEANIC FANTASY AT OCEAN BEACH PARK  </P> <P> Nathan Stein's "Late Breaking Muse," is an "oceanic divertimento," an outdoor  fantasy piece for kids of all ages opening Saturday at Ocean Beach Park in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "We built the (set) in my backyard in Echo Park, being chased inside every  Thursday night by the malathion spraying," said Stein, who's also one-third of  a local juggling group, the Mums. Although the trio has been touted as  modern-day vaudevillians, Stein hungers for more political substance. "We  cannot just indulge in our own ascetic art bubble. So it's always more  compelling to put the work into that (societal) context. But this is not  agitprop."  </P> <P> Stein's tale begins with the discovery of trouble in paradise -- "the paradise  in peril here being Atlantis. Oil spills have begun to beat across the  aqua-ceiling. So Poseidon has dispatched his youngest daughter to handle the  situation; she arrives in a chariot, newly endowed with arms and legs."  </P> <P> It's a state of mind that Stein could well understand. Last year, he was the  victim of "a fight with a table saw" that mauled his left arm and forced him to  learn juggling all over again. "So I had an enforced sabbatical," he said. "I  learned how caring the theatrical community was. It's also when the visual poem  ("Muse") began emerging -- and with it, grants-writing fever. Now I've got what  makes all artists tick: funding and a deadline."  </P> <P> The piece, presented free of charge, was written for four performers ("partly  because of financial considerations, partly because it's the next step after  triohood") and does not feature his fellow Mums. "There were scheduling  conflicts," he says diplomatically. "Although I think the late hours and low  pay also factored in."  </P> <P> THEATER BUZZ: Don't accuse Brandon Maggart of falling into Hollywood's  type-casting trap. The actor, who played the homophobic Lou for five years on  Showtime's "Brothers" -- as well as Lynn Redgrave's anti-Semitic sibling in  ABC's "Chicken Soup" -- will don a milkman's cap as Tevye in "Fiddler on the  West Hollywood Roof" (opening Friday at the Harmony Gold Playhouse), a benefit  staging for the AIDS Hospice Foundation. Says a press rep, "He's a very Jewish  Tevye in a very gay spoof of 'Fiddler.' "  </P> <P> CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Christopher Durang's "Laughing Wild," a comedy on the  absurdities of modern life, is playing at the Tiffany Theatre. Dennis Erdman  ("The Marriage of Bette and Boo") directs.  </P> <P> Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: " 'Wild's' barbs are savagely, consistently on  target, though at some serious risk of self-defeat. (Its) references to figures  of such fleeting celebrity as Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Phil Donahue . . . may  not mean much 20 years from now."  </P> <P> The Daily News' Lawrence Enscoe found "a tight, tough little piece of monologue  work, nicely paced, achingly detailed and full of the kind of quotable lines  you want to use at dinner parties. That's the first act. The second finds  itself too mired in familiar Durang turf."  </P> <P> Wrote Kathleen O'Steen in Daily Variety: "From all of the irreverent images  comes a work that finds a good deal of laughter, but also echoes a strange  melancholy. The play itself is more commentary and characterization than  drama."  </P></p>

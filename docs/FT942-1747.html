			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: French consumption down French household consumption of manufactured goods fell 0.9 per cent in May, compared with April, but the trend for the current quarter is still upwards, the Economics Ministry said yesterday. The ministry said decline in household consumption reflected the sharp increase in spending in April. Household consumption in April grew by a revised 1.8 per cent, partly reflecting government incentives for car buyers. Economists in Paris said spending in May was still 0.6 per cent higher than March and 1.1 per cent higher than the average for the first quarter. Even with flat consumption in June, they said second-quarter consumption should still show an increase of 1.5 per cent over the first three months. John Ridding, Paris Dutch seasonally adjusted manufacturing production fell 2.0 per cent in April compared with March, but non-seasonally adjusted manufacturing production was up 1.9 per cent year-on-year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.

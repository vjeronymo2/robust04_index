			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Roxspur poised to buy Brearley Roxspur, the maker of steel furniture and playgroup equipment, yesterday announced plans to acquire Brearley Group, a Sheffield-based maker of temperature sensors, from a subsidiary of Anglo United for about Pounds 4.72m cash. The acquisition is to be funded via a placing and open offer of 25.7m shares at 21p to raise Pounds 5.04m. The placing is subject to clawback by shareholders on a 10-for-9 basis. Holders of 37.9 per cent of the capital have undertaken not to take up their entitlement, which has been placed conditionally with institutions. The exact purchase price is subject to adjustment if net assets of Brearley at completion fail to meet the warranted Pounds 1.57m. In the nine months to December 31, Brearley achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 334,000 on sales of Pounds 2.68m. Shareholders' approval for the deal and for a capital reduction will be sought at an extraordinary meeting on March 14. Mr Ian Orrock, Roxspur chairman, said yesterday that the purchase fitted 'perfectly in our strategy of building an electro-mechanical group.' Roxspur also announced increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 433,000 (Pounds 343,000) for the six months to November 30, which it attributed mainly to reduced gross margins due to price competition, lower sales and completion of certain works. Sales fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.95m) as bad weather delayed work. Operating loss on continuing operations came to Pounds 397,000 (Pounds 190,000) and interest charges took Pounds 36,000 (Pounds 59,000). Per share, the deficit came to 1.9p (6.7p).</p>

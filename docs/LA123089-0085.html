			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHWEST PLANNED TO DISCLOSE BOMB THREAT AT THE GATE  </P> <P> Northwest Airlines did not plan to notify passengers of a bomb threat against  its Paris-to-Detroit flight until they arrived at the boarding gate today,  airline officials said Friday. But after the threat was disclosed in a Swedish  newspaper, the airline made it public Thursday, two days in advance of today's  scheduled departure, officials said.  </P> <P> As many as 30 passengers are said to have asked for a different flight,  according to the Associated Press. However, many passengers are still unaware  of the threat and will only find out today when they arrive at the gate,  Northwest officials said.  </P> <P> The predicament of Northwest Flight 51 illustrates dilemmas facing all airlines  when terrorist threats are made. Most, including Northwest, say they will  inform passengers in advance as a matter of policy. However, such publicity  could hurt the ability of authorities to investigate the threats.  </P> <P> But in most cases, notification well in advance is often impossible because  threats usually come only moments before flights are scheduled to depart. Most  threats turn out to be hoaxes.  </P> <P> "If we get to the point where we felt there was a possibility of serious harm  toward a passenger or a plane, we would then make a public announcement," said  Donald Morrison, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines.  </P> <P> The controversy heated up about a year ago when Pan American World Airways  Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 passengers. The  Federal Aviation Administration had learned about a threat to a Pan Am flight  between West Germany and the United States based on a single phone call. But  the phone call was later termed a hoax by the airline, and Pan Am did not  inform passengers.  </P> <P> What makes the Northwest case somewhat different is that the threat was made so  much before flight time, giving authorities more time to investigate and beef  up security.  </P> <P> Northwest won't say when it got the threat. But when it did, the airline said,  it immediately notified authorities.  </P> <P> When a newspaper in Sweden ran a story that there had been a threat against the  flight, it triggered an agreement between the Minneapolis-based carrier and  U.S. and French government authorities. The agreement specified that if there  were any leaks about the threat, the airline could also make it public.  </P> <P> "We were working with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, the State Department and French law enforcement agencies," said  Bob Gibbons, a Northwest spokesman. "Their recommendation was to keep the  threat as private as possible for as long as possible. In their view it was  better to investigate in private than to have high public attention and we  agreed."  </P> <P> Most of the 130 people who have reservations on the DC-10 for Detroit and San  Francisco won't find out about the threat until they get to the airport anyway.  Gibbons said it is very difficult to reach people and that some passengers may  not be aware of news reports.  </P> <P> Northwest won't detail any of what it labeled as "heightened security  precautions" on all of its transatlantic flights.  </P> <P> "If the good guys want to catch the bad guys, then the good guys cannot tell  the bad guys everything they are doing," Gibbons said.  </P> <P> Northwest says the publicity has not affected other overseas or domestic  flights, because the threat was directed at a specific flight and because  attention has been drawn to additional security precautions being taken.  </P> <P> The final decision on whether the plane departs will be the pilot's, Gibbons  said.  </P> <P> Airlines willing to discuss security measures say they generally notify  passengers if threats are taken seriously.  </P> <P> American Airlines said it takes every bomb threat seriously and evaluates each  case. Delta Air Lines spokesman Jim Lundy said that "when we get a threat and  we consider it as being serious we make every attempt to keep the passengers  informed."  </P> <P> But the airlines say there are so many threats that each one must be analyzed.  FAA spokesman Robert Buckhorn said there are more than 300 bomb threats a year,  and most of them turn out to be hoaxes.  </P> <P> "When we get a threat we almost always unload the passengers, unload the bags,  we advise passengers of the security situation and allow them to choose an  alternative," Northwest's Gibbons said.  </P> <P> A Pan Am spokeswoman, Pam Hanlon, said late Friday that the airline always had  a policy of informing passengers of bomb threats when they are against specific  airlines and when they are considered serious. This, she insisted, has been the  airline's policy both before and after the Lockerbie tragedy on Dec. 21, 1988.  </P></p>

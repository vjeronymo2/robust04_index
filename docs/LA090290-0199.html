			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE PREVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW TEAMS, OLD FOES TRY TO END TRABUCO HILLS' DYNASTY  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast League opens the 1990 football season with a new look -- two  new teams and a new playoff division -- but coaches throughout the league  expect the same old story in November.  </P> <P> Another league championship for Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> Estancia, last season's Sea View League champions, and Century, fielding its  first varsity team, have been added to the Pacific Coast League. They replace  Orange, now in the Century League, and Woodbridge, now in the Sea View League.  </P> <P> The new teams, along with Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills and Costa Mesa, hope to  end Trabuco Hills' grip on the league championship. The Mustangs have won the  past two league titles and the Division VIII championships.  </P> <P> "Anyone who wins back to back championships has to be the favorite again,"  Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said. "You can't destroy a winning tradition  like that. The kids there want to keep that up. Trabuco has that now, and  they're in an area that's expanding."  </P> <P> Estancia Coach John Liebengood said he's excited about moving into the same  league as Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> "It's a challenge, especially playing the defending (state) champs from the  last two years," he said. "In the Sea View League, we played teams of the same  quality. I think Trabuco will be in (the same company) with El Toro and Mission  Viejo in years to come."  </P> <P> Some coaches think Trabuco Hills has a lock on the title. But you won't find  Trabuco Hills Coach Jim Barnett talking about "three-peating" as champs.  </P> <P> "The only pressure for that is pressure we put on ourselves," Barnett said. "If  the Lakers can't do it, we shouldn't feel any pressure. Hey, if Magic can't  handle it, what the heck?"  </P> <P> Should Trabuco Hills win another league title, the Mustangs won't advance to  the Division VIII playoffs, but to the Division VII playoffs instead.  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast League has moved up a division. The Division VII playoff  format has six leagues instead of the customary five, which means only the top  two teams from each league, instead of the top three, will be guaranteed  playoff berths.  </P> <P> It's a simple case of mathematics. But don't tell that to Baldwin.  </P> <P> "It's stupid," he said. "It's so unfair to do that. It's the most unfair  situation I've ever encountered. A team in the Sea View League (Division VI)  can finish third and get in while an 8-2 team that happens to finish third in  our league doesn't get in."  </P> <P> Said Laguna Beach Coach Lyman Olney: "It hurts the morale of the league a  little. We might have one or two teams that are a little stronger. While others  are almost ready, a third-place team won't make it."  </P> <P> CENTURY: Coach Bill Brown tries to keep some perspective when talking about his  all-underclassman lineup, which will play its first varsity game Friday against  El Dorado. "Our strength is that we don't graduate anyone," Brown said.  "Everyone will be back next year. We'll just see how we do. We have no  delusions of grandeur. We have to get some seniors to be good. We're  inexperienced at the skill positions, but we have good kids there. We're asking  sophomores to grow up a year right now."  </P> <P> COSTA MESA: The Mustangs return Quoc Pham, a three-year starter and two-year  all-league selection at defensive back, along with a trio of fine receivers --  tight end Josh Hill, wide receiver Duby Ospina and wide receiver David  Phillips, the team's most valuable player last year.  </P> <P> But it'll be up to Ryan McEvoy, an untested junior quarterback, to get them the  ball.  </P> <P> "He has had a good spring and summer," Baldwin said. "He's played only one game  on varsity, our last game against Woodbridge last season, but he has been  throwing the ball well so far."  </P> <P> Jermaine Jackson, a transfer from Saddleback, should boost the Mustangs'  running attack, Baldwin said.  </P> <P> "We're running a pro set this year and we'll need a back back there who can  gain a lot of yards for us," Baldwin said.  </P> <P> ESTANCIA: The player who has Liebengood talking is sophomore quarterback Matt  Johner, who has no varsity experience.  </P> <P> Johner, a 6-2, 175-pound left-hander, is challenging junior Richard Buday (6-0,  185) for the starting job. "Matt has one of the strongest arms I've seen on a  15-year-old," Liebengood said. "He and Rich are really going at it. Matt's a  great basketball player and a good baseball player. He gave up baseball to  concentrate on football, and now the baseball coaches are mad at me."  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH: The Artists won only one game last season, but Olney thinks this  year's team could surprise some people.  </P> <P> "We were competitive last year," he said. "For us, it's all a numbers game. We  have between 40 to 50 kids out for the varsity, less than most schools. We have  some good athletes, but not much speed. We have to work for more intensity and  execution.  </P> <P> "Our league is very, very competitive. We can all beat each other. We have  proven that."  </P> <P> Olney said the Artists will "have a balanced attack."  </P> <P> "Our running backs (Jason Levinson, Keith Perry, RB) are very versatile," Olney  said. "Our quarterback (Morgan Lanchantain) can give us more running ability  and our offensive line is pretty decent. Defensively, we will be real solid."  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS: Bresnahan credits the Hawks' weightlifting program for turning  one of the weakest teams in the league a few years ago into one of the  strongest.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, we didn't have an offensive lineman who could bench-press 150  pounds," Bresnahan said. "This year, Mark Maddux is at 350 on the bench, which  is competitive. I think the weight program has made our players not only  better, but also gave them confidence to play well. There's no compromise for  that.  </P> <P> "We're better, stronger and faster. We're committed to winning here."  </P> <P> TRABUCO HILLS: The Mustangs will be tested early and often. Their nonleague  schedule includes Corona del Mar, Woodbridge, Dana Hills and Villa Park.  </P> <P> "We have a tough preseason," Barnett said. "Estancia plays a tough preseason. I  think Laguna Hills will come into the league as the top preseason team."  </P> <P> Barnett said he'll miss Tim Manning, an all-league selection at quarterback and  defensive back. Senior Shane Weintraut and sophomore Pat Barnes are competing  for Manning's quarterback job.  </P> <P> "Any time you lose a quarterback, one you don't get in high school very often,  one with his character and intelligence, you're definitely going to miss him,"  Barnett said. "But Pat has a lot of potential and Shane was our junior varsity  quarterback. It's a dead heat between them right now."  </P> <P> Tomorrow: Sea View League.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE  </P> <P> </P> <P> DIVISION VII  </P> <P> Century  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Brown (first year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 4-6 (junior varsity)  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: none  </P> <P> Returning starters: none  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Karlo Balderrama, RB-LB, 5-11, 175, Jr.; Mario Chavarria, QB-CB,  5-7, 150, Jr.; Stacy de la Motte, RB-LB, 6-0, 210, Jr.; Juan Garcia, RB-LB,  5-9, 155, Jr.; Joe Loaiza, TE-S, 5-10, 175, Jr.; Alex Lopez, OL-DL, 5-8, 160,  Jr.; Carlos Lopez, OL-DL, 5-9, 180, Jr.; Joel Ramos, DE, 5-10, 175, So.  </P> <P> Outlook: Experience? What experience? Brown, a former coach at Brea-Olinda, is  hoping his all-underclassman roster will mature quickly. Century High, which is  in its second year, is fielding its first varsity team. The Centurions fielded  only junior varsity and freshman teams last year, with the junior varsity  finishing 4-6 and the freshmen 9-4. Brown will be counting on quarterback Mario  Chavarria, who didn't even play football last year, to learn the ropes. Last  year's junior varsity quarterback, Karlo Balderrama, was moved to running back  after undergoing surgery on his right throwing shoulder last season. "Mario has  looked pretty good so far," Brown said. "But we're not going to be any  offensive wizards."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Coach: Tom Baldwin (seventh year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: (0-10, 0-5)  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 21  </P> <P> Returning starters: five on offense; five on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Mike Cota, RB-LB, 5-8, 185, Jr.; David Fiduccia, OL-DL, 6-2,  235, Sr.; James Grant, OL-DL, 5-9, 210, Sr.; Josh Hill, TE-LB, 6-3, 225, Sr.;  Duby Ospina, WR-DB, 5-8, 165, Sr.; Ryan Park, OL-DL, 5-9, 190, Jr.; Quoc Pham,  RB-DB, 5-10, 175, Sr.; David Phillips, WR-LB, 6-3, 205, Sr.; Jesse Smith,  OL-DL, 6-1, 235, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Pete Broostrom, DB, 6-2, 180, Sr.; Matt Harber, QB, 6-2, 160,  So.; Jermaine Jackson, RB, 5-10, 190, Sr.; Matt Jaglowski, DB, 5-10, 160, Jr.;  David Krekel, OL, 6-4, 255, Sr.; Ryan McEvoy, QB, 6-0, 180, Jr.; Basel Nassar,  OL, 6-0, 220, Jr.; Fernando Ospina, DL, 5-8, 165, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: It can't get any worse than this. Baldwin will be the first to tell  you that he was upset with the winless season. "We need a win badly this year,"  he said. "Losing creates problems and winning solves them. It's soul-searching  time for us. I felt we should have won half our games last year, but we had  some chemistry problems, some injuries, lots of excuses. I guess you have to  eat some crow sometimes." The Mustangs return a solid nucleus, including David  Phillips, a two-way starter at wide receiver and linebacker and the team's most  valuable player last year.  </P> <P> Estancia  </P> <P> Coach: John Liebengood (fifth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 10-0, 5-0, Sea View League champions  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: three on offense; none on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Ricardo Aguilar, LB, 5-10, 185, Jr.; Will Bohuslavizki, SE-DB,  5-8, 150, Sr.; Richard Buday, QB-DB, 5-11, 185, Jr.; David Harrison, OL, 6-2,  198, Sr.; David Hong, RB-DE, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Brandon Johnson, 6-2, 210, TE-DE,  Jr.; Brian Oberreuter, OL, 6-2, 218, Jr.; Bill Sandro, RB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Ty  Sisler, TE, 6-4, 200, Jr.; Art Tovar, OL, 6-2, 195, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Pete Banjaga, FL-LB, 5-10, 190, Jr; Cody Charlie, DB, 6-2, 175,  So.; Carlos Cornejo, OL, 5-11, 230, So.; Matt Johner, QB, 6-2, 175, So.; Victor  Lomeli, LB, 5-10, 175, Jr.; Victor Mendez, SE-DB, 5-10, 170, Jr.; Tony Naranjo,  RB-LB, 6-0, 175, Jr.; Jessie Nuno, OL, 5-11, 215, Jr.; Fred Pajarito, LB, 5-7,  165, Jr.; Alberto Rojas, OL, 5-11, 218, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: "There's no doubt we're a junior-oriented team," Liebengood said. Most  of the juniors moved up from the 10-0 sophomore team. "It's hard to say if  we're a year away," he said, "but it's also hard to say if we're ready yet when  haven't seen them play in a game. But I do know that this group has worked  harder than any group I've had. Only one player has missed a day of two-a-days  (practices)."  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P> <P> Coach: Lyman Olney (fourth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 1-9, 1-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: six on offense; five on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Brian Beehan, OL-DL, 5-10, 205, Jr.; Mike Dennis, TE, 6-1, 170,  Sr.; Eric Fegraus, WR, 6-0, 170, Jr.; Morgan Lanchantain, QB, 5-9, 170, Sr.;  Vance Selin, OL-DL, 6-3, 240, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jason Levinson, RB, 6-1, 175, Sr.; Keith Perry, RB, 5-8, 165,  Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The season hasn't even started, and the Artists' secondary already has  suffered two major setbacks. Cornerback Steve Kiemer broke his leg in practice  and is out for the season. Safety Ted King suffered an injury unrelated to  football and is questionable for the season. Olney is confident the Artists can  rebound from one of their most disappointing seasons. "We're hoping to be right  up there contending for a playoff berth," he said. "No one is going to breeze  in here and say, 'We're playing Laguna Beach,' and just blow on by." Olney said  Lanchantain, who moved to quarterback from running back, will give the Artists  a double-threat as a passer and a rusher.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P> <P> Coach: Steve Bresnahan (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 6-6, 3-2  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: five on offense; three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Kirk Brown, TE-DE, 6-2, 225, Sr.; Ryan Brubacker, OL-DL, 6-1,  215, Jr.; David Childs, WR-DB, 5-8, 160, Sr.; Eric Davis, TE-DB, 6-4, 205, Sr.;  Greg DeFelice, WR-DB, 5-7, 175, WR-DB, Jr.; Roger Lance, LB, 6-3, 220, Sr.;  Mark Maddux, OL-DL, 6-1, 245, Sr.; Marwan Saba, RB-LB, 5-10, 190, Sr.; Roman  Vasquez, OL-LB, 5-11, 210, Jr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Andy Jacobs, OL-DL, 6-4, 235, Jr.; Mark Mitchell, DL, 5-9, 200,  Sr.; Casey Sullivan, QB, 6-2, 195, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Laguna Hills surprised many last year, slipping into the Division VIII  playoffs and upsetting top-seeded Yucaipa in the first round. "It was a  successful season, but we're still improving as a team," Bresnahan said.  Sullivan, a transfer quarterback from St. Monica, already has improved the  Hawks' passing attack. "I'm real impressed with Casey," Bresnahan said. "He was  all-league at St. Monica. He's a Division I (college) quarterback in size (6-2,  185) and in competitiveness and confidence. I coached for a couple of years at  Long Beach State (as an assistant), and Casey compares favorably with  quarterbacks I saw there."  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills  </P> <P> Coach: Jim Barnett (fifth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 13-1, 5-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 22  </P> <P> Returning starters: three on offense; three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Mark Florence, LB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Julian Ford, TE, 6-2, 215,  Sr.; Ben Rooker, RB, 6-3 , 225, Sr.; Al Sermeno, OL-DL, 6-3, 255, Sr.; Brett  Sutherland, S-WR, 6-0, 175, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Nick Pivaroff, TE-WR-S, 6-0, 185, Sr.; Jeff Clayton, RB, 5-10,  170, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Mustangs have some holes to fill, returning only six starters from  last year's team that won the Division VIII title for the second consecutive  year. The biggest losses are in the secondary and at quarterback. Tim Manning,  who earned a scholarship to California, was a threat as a passer and a runner  and, as a defensive back he set the county career interception record with 24.  Also missing from the secondary are Ricky Sparks (16 interceptions in the past  two seasons) and all-league selection Greg Hughes. But the Mustangs return some  solid players. Tight end Julian Ford has caught 17 touchdown passes in the last  two seasons and running back Ben Rooker had two 200-yard games last season  despite battling knee injuries. Tackle Al Sermeno, another returning starter,  is among the top 10 linemen in the county.  </P></p>

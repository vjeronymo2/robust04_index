			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Agreement near for Macdonald Publishing sale Agreement in principle concerning the sale of Macdonald Publishing, the loss-making publishing venture of Maxwell Communication Corporation, is imminent. Mr Anthony Lomas, of Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, is hoping to announce a potential purchaser later this week. Considerable interest has been shown in Macdonald since it was placed in administration by the High Court in January. All the signs point to Boston publisher Little Brown, Headline and Macmillan of the UK being among the serious contenders as the bidding reaches its final stages. Macdonald's publications take in Catherine Cookson, the Noddy books of Enid Blyton and literary biography. It owed MCC about Pounds 33m and had been losing some Pounds 1m a year. Mr Lomas denied reports yesterday that Macdonald had been losing authors because of the uncertainty and emphasised that it was unlikely that arrears of royalty payments to authors would not be met. Despite the disruption caused by the collapse of the Maxwell empire, Macdonald has been trading normally and was virtually up to date with its February printing schedule.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] Ukraine became a member of the Commonwealth of  Danube Lands [Spivdruzhnist Dunayskykh Zemel] on 23 June. A  session of the Commonwealth took place near Budapest on 23 June,  where Ukraine was represented by Odessa Oblast. The issues of  losses caused by UN sanctions against former Yugoslavia, the  economy, the environment, and joint action by Danube lands in  the areas of sport and tourism were examined at the session.  Delegations from Germany, Austria, the Czech and Slovak  Republics, Romania, and Bulgaria took part.    Ruslan Bodelan, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of  Odessa Oblast Council, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, said  at Budapest airport: "This is another step toward our state's  claim to the possibility of resolving issues jointly with our  counterparts, with other countries. This especially concerns  use of the Danube artery as a river, along which cargoes can and  should be transported with the help of our Danube Shipping  Company. It is about resolving problems of the ecological state  of the Danube, preserving our reservations and national parks,  and developing national culture and national traditions."</p>

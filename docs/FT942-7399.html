			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (10): From Graceland to the Smoky Mountains - Snapshots of some of Tennessee's tourist attractions It is smaller than you expect: a 1930s copy of an old Southern mansion, sitting behind iron gates on the outskirts of Memphis. A suburban home for a successful doctor, perhaps - which is what it was for many years. But Graceland looms large in the Elvis Presley myth. To the 22-year-old country boy, it must have seemed the pinnacle of success. He paid Dollars 100,000 for it in 1957 and proceeded to do with it what you would expect of a 22-year old with sudden wealth: build three television sets into a wall in the basement and buy a pool table. Anyone lured here by the tales of garishnesss - mirrors on the ceilings, carpets on the walls - will be disappointed. These are familiar remnants of 1970s interior decor to anyone who lived through the era. Fans of kitsch will get more fun across the road at the Elvis Presley car museum, with its famous convertible pink Cadillac, or the Elvis Presley aircraft, named after daughter Lisa Marie - or, better yet, just stop at the Elvis Presley souvenir shops. Graceland is an exercise in hagiography. But, strangely, there is no music. Hushed tour parties are ushered around in a reverential silence. There is also little at Graceland to remind visitors that the greatest career in rock and roll history disintegrated into farce. There is just one sign, placed in the glass cases alongside the 1970s sequinned jump suits: 'The image is one thing, and the human being is another: it is very hard to live up to an image.' Nashville may like to call itself Music City USA, but Memphis can lay claim to a musical history just as rich. It is the home of the blues, a musical strain that grew up in the Mississippi delta in the 1930s and now one of the city's biggest leisure industries. Downtown Memphis, like many other US downtowns, has been subjected to a succession of building sprees since the 1960s. Some relics remain - the great pile of the Peabody Hotel, for example - but it takes great imagination to conjure up the former cotton capital of the Mississippi. Paddle steamers still navigate the broad sweep of the river, Memphis' most distinctive feature. But the city is probably better known these days through the books - and the films of books - of thriller writer John Grisham, author of The Firm: a modern Southern city, with a giant glass pyramid sitting surreally on the river banks. The heart of the Memphis blues history nearly succumbed to the familiar urban devastation of the 1960s. But Beale Street, the place where the musical style was born, was given a last-minute reprieve from the developers. Today, it is a low-rise isolated strip of bars, clubs and souvenir shops which stands in stark contrast to the development that has gone on all around. The blues and rock and roll from open doorways fight it out on the street as bars compete for passers-by. This part of Memphis's musical history is very much alive. Old-style charm The evening sunshine is slanting across the rolling hills of south-eastern Tennessee. Hidden in the woods on the tops of these hills are more than a score of large tin sheds, each one housing a mountain of oak casks of whiskey. Yet you can't legally buy a drink here in Moore County. The Jack Daniels distillery is Lynchburg's biggest - indeed, its only - attraction. Its 'sourmash' whiskey - don't make the mistake of calling it bourbon, it doesn't go down well - was first made here more than a hundred years ago. Not much has changed at the distillery, which prides itself on its old-style Southern charm. The history of Jack Daniels reads like a battle against the non-drinking lobby. First, the distillery's Lynchburg saloon was closed, and in 1909 Tennessee got its first 'dry' law, before the rest of the US. The distillery was packed up and moved to St Louis. The prohibition era did not shut down the operation completely, but its output was kept in a bonded warehouse, and made available only for 'medicinal' purposes. It was a good time to be friends with a doctor. There have always been ways of getting a drink of whiskey in the South. The distillery's St Louis neighbours found a way in 1923: they fed a pipe through into the adjoining warehouse and sucked out 42,800 gallons of the stuff - replacing it with water, lest anyone should notice the barrels were running empty. Roger Brashears' porch is one place in Lynchburg where you can get a proper drink. The head of marketing and publicity for the distillery, he lives within a hundred yards of the site. Yet he drives to and from it in his battered Ford pick-up truck. That's how you can tell a Southern boy, he says  -only ever walks if it's to get in his pick-up. Brashears is the embodiment of the Southern charm that Jack Daniels exerts over its visitors: old-fashioned, laconic, warm. With his braces, his chain smoking, his steady drawl, perhaps Brashears - and, indeed, the distillery as a whole - is just a clever artifice constructed for tourists. But after a glass of his 'sippin' whiskey', you're convinced he's the genuine article. It doesn't cost anything to go on the tour of the distillery. Says Brashears: 'We don't charge. But after you've been through here, you'll be paying for the rest of your life.' Bus-loads of sightseers The desk clerk at the Opryland hotel advises you to drive round to another entrance to get to your room. He takes out a map and writes instructions on it, but you still manage to get lost. The complex to the north of the city has become one of Nashville's most-visited tourist attractions. At night, bus-loads of sightseers are brought out from town to gawp at the hotel's fountains which, improbably, dance to taped music. Walking back through the dense tropical undergrowth of one of the hotel's giant glasshouses, you get stuck behind columns of ageing sightseers. They are peering up into the trees trying to work out if the bird songs they can hear are from real birds, or just more recordings. The local youth population seems to have discovered that the artificial sub-tropical glades are a good place to hang out. The hotel - and Gaylord, the company that owns it - is riding high on the success of country music. In the centre of Nashville, two new shrines to music are nearing completion. The Ryman, a tabernacle pressed into service as a country music hall in the middle years of the century, is finally being fitted out properly for the purpose. The wooden floors and pews, and the stained glass windows, remain: but this time it will have air conditioning. Nearby, Gaylord is also putting the finishing touches to the Wildhorse Cafe  -a restaurant with a wide stage and wooden dance floor. This will provide more performance fodder for the cable television networks which the company also runs. If Country proves more than a passing fad, the Wildhorse could become the Hard Rock of the 1990s: it is a format that Dick Evans, Gaylord's chief operating officer, hopes to spin out both around the US and internationally. A powerful memory The resentment is still palpable in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains in east Tennessee. This has become the most-visited state park in the US. But the displacement caused by its creation is still a powerful memory in the communities that huddle outside the park gates. Cades Cove - an enclosed valley deep in the park - supported a large community in the 1930s. Then, buying up land piecemeal, the state gradually emptied its wide pastures. Recent structures were knocked down. All that remains now are the log cabins and white-plank churches of the pioneers who first settled here, scattered among the woods. The water-driven mill is being operated by an old man. He is a descendant of the man who built this mill, and was taught how to run it when still a boy. Now, in retirement, he is running it for tourists. He won't offer a view about the fate that has befallen the valley. But the woman at the door is more forthcoming. She went to school here in the 1930s  -until the school was torn down and she, like everyone else, was forced out. She is still bitter - although it is better that the land has been turned over to public use, rather than falling into private hands, she adds. Sarah Ball's father is also a refugee from the park. He sold more than 100 acres and used the money to buy land in the foothills outside the park gates, at Sevierville. An upright old man, he stops to tell you about it as you sit on the porch of the Blue Mountain Mist Country Inn. Sarah and her husband, Norman, have built the inn on part of that land. You can sit on its porch and muse at the hills while bullfrogs complain in the pond below. At the top of the mountains, on the border with North Carolina, a tower rises above the tree-tops. From here, you can gaze back on Tennessee - the steep slopes below giving way to the green wrinkles of hills and, far away, scattered towns. If it was only a little clearer, you feel, you could see clean across the state to the Mississippi.</p>

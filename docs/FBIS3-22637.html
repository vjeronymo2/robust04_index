According to a paper presented at the 18th biennial  conference of the Indian Association of Leprologists which  concluded here on Saturday, the study was conducted in two  phases among patients above 16 years of age belonging to both  sexes. In the first phase, out of the 463 patients screened, 14  were found to carry the virus. In the second phase 5 out of 709  patients tested positive.    Asked about the objective of the study, Dr. Gupte of ICMR  [Indian Council of Medical Research], President, Indian  Leprologists Association, said that many AIDS patients had been  found to be infected by bacterial diseases like tuberculosis in  the final stages of the disease. Hence such studies could  explore the possibility of their contracting leprosy, which also  was caused by bacteria.</p>

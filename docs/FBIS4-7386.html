			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Do </F> Muoi's address at 25 April national party conference of control  cadres]    [Text] During the last few years, the international  situation has become complicated, and domestically we have been  facing many difficulties. Our party has led well the  implementation of the resolutions of the seventh party congress,  the Central Committee, and the Midterm Party National Conference  [MPNC]. Our party has also been consistent in the renovation  undertaking by setting up many domestic and external relations  policies which were in good accordance with the development  rules, popular aspirations, and the trends of our time. Our  people at home and friends around the world have strongly  supported these policies. We have responded in a timely fashion  to all circumstances, maintained political stability, firmly  consolidated national defense, pushed socioeconomic development  forward, expanded democracy, diversified external relations, and  step by step nullified the blockade and embargo against us.    These achievements are the results of the strong political  acumen of our party, army and people. They also strongly proved  that our people are attached as flesh and blood with the party,  and are absolutely confident that with its efforts in  self-reform and self- rectification, the party is still  trustworthy as a true revolutionary party: the party that can  motivate unity, solidarity, intelligence, and the strength of  people, and the party that always cares for the people's  standard of living and the people's government, which is truly a  government of the people, by the people, and for the people.    It is obvious that the achievements of the past few years  are  closely related to the construction effort and rectification  work of the party, in which contributions by the cadres in  charge of party control must be highly appreciated.    The comrade general secretary also stressed that the aim of  party control work is to ensure that party lines and policies be  implemented correctly and innovatively to bring successes to the  revolution and benefits for the people. The party cadres  should always strive to achieve what is beneficial and avoid  what is harmful to the people. These are the basic principles  of party control work. Only through control work will we know  whether the party resolutions are implemented and whether they  are implemented well, and we would also know strong aspects of  our lines and policies so that we can further develop them, as  well as the weaknesses so that we can adjust and improve in time.    Being a ruling party where party cadres are entrusted by the  people with various positions in state agencies at different  echelons, all cadres should use this privileged environment to  develop their ability to serve the people. This privileged  environment can also turn easily into a source of corruption and  authoritativeness. On one hand, we should strive to educate  party cadres to improve and perfect themselves so that they will  always follow the just and correct objectives. On the other  hand, we have to carry out regular party control work in order  to encourage good deeds and prevent bad ones, and also to punish  offenders on a correct and timely basis. Control work will help  us screen out of the party the corrupt members and select the  loyal and enthusiastic ones, those with character and talents  who can assume the responsibility of making the party and its  cadres worthy of the people's trust.    In the situation where the market economy is being  implemented and external relations expanded, there would be  complicated issues in parallel with favorable conditions. These  issues require us to respond actively and positively, especially  in preventing the degradations; corrosion of confidence in the  revolutionary ideals; corruption; smuggling; bribery;  indications of depravation, degeneration, and decadence; all  acts of authoritativeness, bossiness, bureaucratism, and  coercion; and all opportunistic activities aiming at seizing  authority, houses and land, assets, and other properties of the  state and the people. These are the basic and urgent duties and  contents of tasks for control cadres in the new situation.    The party control work aims to develop strength and overcome  weakness, making the party more steadfast. In party control  work, the cadres need to highlight right and wrong in all  targeted activities, so that all loyal and active party cadres  will be protected and trusted, with wrong-doers and opportunists  punished according to the magnitude of their deeds. All party  members should be guaranteed equal treatment from party  discipline.    The objects of the party control work include organs and  member cadres, especially key cadres at all levels. These are  the two subjects that must be given equal importance.    We must conduct comprehensive control and pay special  attention to the implementation of the party line, policy, and  regulations as outlined in the MPNC resolution. That is the  most comprehensive content of control work. We need to pay  attention to the control of members and organs in their  observation of the Constitution and the state law. This is the  goal that must not be taken lightly in control work. Control  work requires every cadre to not avoid and protect individuals  and organizations that have violated party discipline, the  Constitution, and state law. At the same time, in the current  situation, we must clearly protect justice and righteousness by  not allowing anyone to take advantage of the control work to  disrupt party organizations and tarnish the cadres and members.  Our party welcomes and encourages everyone, including  non-members, to criticize party organizations and individual  members as long as their opinions are honest, constructive, and  responsible. That is our party's philosophy, which relies on  public opinion and is also an example of our people's civilized  attitude in human relations.    Control work is not only the work of the control committee  but also the task of the entire party, beginning with the  committees at all levels. We have to admit that the committees  have not been the first to discover troubled incidents in the  past few years, including problems among themselves. They only  find out problems through party members and the general public.  That is the thing that we must resolutely overcome in the  coming period. Making the party clean and strong must be the  task of the entire party, cadres, and members, beginning with  the committees. The important thing is to make the committees  themselves clean and strong to set good examples for their  cadres and members.    In order to achieve that, the entire party, beginning with  the committees, the control committees at all levels, and the  control cadres, must improve their sense of logic, enhance their  knowledge of the actual situation, thoroughly understand the  party line and conception, and follow our predecessors' good  examples to train ourselves for better political and  professional knowledge and working ability to actively  contribute to party reform and consolidation, making the party  cleaner and stronger.    Party control work requires us to heighten our  responsibility  to the party and the public and to demonstrate our party's  spirit of clearness and and straightforwardness, as our Uncle Ho  used to say: casualness and carelessness in party control work  will cause great damage to the political life of a party member,  but leaving his problem untouched will not only damage that  party member but also create more problems for the entire  organization.    Control work must be combined with organization work for the  correct and speedy evaluation of cadres and members. Many  incidents left untouched for too long in the party are the  result of poor coordination between control work and cadre  organization work at all levels.    The comrade general secretary concluded that the last target  that the control work needs to achieve is to make the party  organization and contingent of cadres and members cleaner and  stronger. The control work must ensure that after the  completion of the work, the party organization will become  stronger and the contingent of members become more united and  mature, not the other way around.    The control work and the contingent of the control cadres  are  enjoying a great honor in contributing their great share in the  successful implementation of the political duties set forth by  the party. They must satisfactorily serve the party building  work and actively contribute to the preparation of the eighth  national congress and party congresses at all levels in the  coming years.    Satisfactorily carrying out the control work is also  executing Uncle Ho's philosophy of building our party into an  exemplary political organization representing the intelligence,  morality, conscience, and honor of the entire nation, deserving  a leader and a very loyal servant of the people, as Uncle Ho  used to remind us.</p>

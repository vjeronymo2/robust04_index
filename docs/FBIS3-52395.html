In an informal chat with newsmen at the reception hosted in  her honour by the Rawalpindi Press Club here on Friday evening  she said "they do try to influence our policies but we must not  under rate ourselves."    "Despite all the pressure we will not let happen any thing  against the national interest as our sovereignty is very dear to  us," she added. She said many things which did not happen would  have taken place, had we succumb to the us pressure.    She expressed her ignorance when her attention was drawn  towards the reports that 500 US commandoes will come to Pakistan  for joint exercises. Asked what Pakistan can gain by allowing  the foes of Islam to use its territory for enhancing their  professonal skills, she said "this question should be posed to  the policy makers." She pointed out that the job of diplomats  is entirely different from the policy makers adding that the  diplomats are there to communicate and articulate policies  formulated by the policy makers.

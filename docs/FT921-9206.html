			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's rates Asda below investment grade THE LONG-TERM debt of Asda, the UK stores group, falls below investment grade, according to a report from Moody's, the US credit rating agency, writes Richard Waters. Moody's assessment of Asda, at Ba1, one notch below investment grade, places the company two notches below the BBB rating accorded it by IBCA, the UK credit rating agency. Moody's also rated Asda's convertible capital bond (issued by Asda Group Finance) at Ba3, three places below investment grade, and said the British group's commercial paper failed to qualify as Prime. Moody's said the ratings reflect 'on-going pressure on Asda's core earnings in the UK grocery market'. Asda refused to comment on the ratings, which were unsolicited. Moody's ratings affect Pounds 420m of long-term debt.</p>

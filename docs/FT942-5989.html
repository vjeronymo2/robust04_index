			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Manila GNP up 4.8% in quarter Philippine gross national product grew by 4.8 per cent in the first quarter over the comparable period last year, a leap from the previous 0.3 per cent rise, government data published yesterday show. The growth rate surpassed earlier estimates of 3 to 3.5 per cent, and gave rise to expectations of exceeding the 4.5 per cent target for all 1994. The report confirms recent observations of a revival in the Philippine economy, following enhanced political stability and an end to the electric power shortages that bedevilled industries last year. The policy-setting National Economic and Development Authority said a surge in industrial activity, along with increased remittances from Filipinos working overseas, spurred the first-quarter advance. The internal economy, as measured by gross domestic product, went up by 3.8 per cent, a turnround from a 0.01 per cent decline the year before. Industry output rose 7.6 per cent, behind brisker activity in construction and manufacturing. This is largely attributed to the restoration of normal electric power supply during the period, in contrast to the power disruptions of up to 10 hours a day last year. A number of new power stations were put up last year, mostly undertaken by private groups under build-operate-transfer schemes with the government to plug the supply shortages. The agriculture and fishery sector provided the dampener, declining by 0.9 per cent in the quarter as the effects of the typhoons that pummelled many parts of the country in late 1993 lingered in the first three months of 1994. Mr Cielito Habito, Socio-Economic Secretary, said with the early onset of the local rainy season the agriculture sector should be able to recover and help 'further accelerate GNP growth'.</p>

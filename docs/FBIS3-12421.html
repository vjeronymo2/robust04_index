			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu to the Knesset </F> plenum on the 25 February Hebron massacre -- live]    [Text] Mr. Speaker, Members of the Knesset: A despicable  crime was committed in Hebron last Friday [25 February]. In the  same place were Abraham announced to the world the belief in one  God, dozens of people were slain while praying to that same God.  Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed;  for God made man in his own image, the Bible says. In other  words, a murderer should be killed, but there is no mercy,  forgiveness, or redemption for bloodshed that does not  distinguish between a base murderer and innocent citizens.    On behalf of my colleagues, and I believe in the name of all  the members of this House, I utterly denounce this terrible act  and send condolences to the families of the victims.    I urge educators throughout the political spectrum and  rabbis  to close ranks around the sanctity of human life and the moral  use of arms which has always characterized us. Even a people  fighting for its survival, such as the Jewish people, must  uphold its moral standards in war.    Mr. Speaker, last Friday, all these rules were broken.  Consequently, the government decided to set up a state  commission of inquiry to thoroughly investigate the murder and  find the truth. I would like to discuss what this committee  must investigate and what should be included in its letter of  appointment. I would like to tell you that a few hours ago I  phoned the foreign minister, who heads the ministerial committee  assigned to formulate the commission's letter of appointment,  and asked him to add several points. First, we call for an  investigation of all the facts and factors related to the  horrendous act perpetrated in Hebron. The word factors may not  be clear to the members of the House and, indeed, it does not  appear in the letter of appointment as reported in the media.  According to reports, the government asks the commission of  inquiry to investigate and arrive at findings and conclusions  with regard to the facts and circumstances pertaining to the  massacre.    Mr. Speaker, I went back and looked up another commission of  inquiry, the Kahn Commission, set up to probe another tragic  affair, the killings in Sabra and Shatila. The letter of  appointment issued to it by another government stated as  follows: The government asks the commission of inquiry to  investigate all the facts and factors pertaining to the  horrendous acts -- the exact same words we are seeking.    I would like to tell you that the word factors was added at  the firm and resolute demand of then-Attorney General Mr.  Yitzhaq Zamir. After all, we are not just talking about facts  and circumstances; there are also factors and people  responsible. I do not know who is responsible and I would not  presume to say anything like that. However, when you formulated  the letter of appointment -- it was worded by well-known jurists  whose professionalism I greatly appreciate, including two former  justice ministers and the current attorney general -- did you  not have the letter of appointment of the Kahn Commission in  front of you? Is it just a coincidence that this specific word  is absent? Are there only facts and no factors? Has the  whitewashing already begun? Do not put the blame on the foot  soldier; in this case, Major Ilan, the commander at the Cave of  the Patriarchs. If anybody is responsible, the word factors --  as it pertains to responsibility -- should be included.  Although responsibility should not be determined at this point,  it should be stated that somebody is responsible. Otherwise,  what is the sense of the whole thing? Did you not foresee it?    Under the Likud government, a commission of inquiry set up  to investigate a horrendous slaughter saw fit to look into the  factors leading to it. Confronted with a no less horrendous  massacre, the Labor government does not see fit to look into the  factors.    Mr. Foreign Minister, it is not yet too late. The government  can meet and amend its decision. If you want the public to  perceive the mandate of the commission of inquiry as being  state-like rather than of a political or partisan nature, amend  the letter of appointment.    What else should the commission investigate? No doubt, it  must investigate the events pertaining to the tragic murder of  some 40 innocent Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs, but it  must also probe the no less abominable slaying of over 30  Israelis -- according to data in my possession, 33 Israelis were  killed; not all of them were Jews, some were Druze -- in the  last few months. Does only the murder of Arabs, however  despicable and abominable, merit a commission of inquiry,  whereas the slaying of dozens of Jews and Druze -- as well as  hundreds of Arabs in the territories who were considered  collaborators and were murdered by Arab terrorists -- does not?    Mr. Speaker, we listened attentively to the speech of the  prime minister, who made a series of remarks which were not to  our liking. The commission of inquiry must probe the whole  question of the deterioration of the security situation. These  events did not take place in a vacuum. Since 13 September, when  the Oslo agreement was signed, things have been happening in the  field, including a surge in the number of murders. Why is this  happening? It is not happening because of facts, but because of  the decisions and actions of the government. For example, you  allowed the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] deportees to  return although you were specifically warned that they had  undergone special terrorist training. You allowed them back  nevertheless, thus pouring boiling oil on the blazing bonfire of  terror. You pardoned dozens of wanted men, and threw them into  the bonfire as well. You released hundreds of terrorists.    Now, instead of coming to your senses and seeing the  situation for what it is, instead of regaining your  level-headedness and stopping this succession of capitulations  and gestures, what do you do? What do you have in store for us  now? What lies in store for us in the next few days is the  release of yet another 800 to 1,000 terrorists; more terrorists,  more boiling oil. What is worse, in the not too distant future,  if we approve the process you are now trying to accelerate with  all your might, you will bring into our midst another 8,000  murderers -- not potential murderers as the assassin in Hebron,  but certified ones.    That is why we demand to add a clause to the letter of  appointment. We want and demand that the commission of inquiry  investigate the serious deterioration in the security situation  since the signing of the agreement with the PLO, including the  murder of dozens of Israeli citizens throughout the country, as  well as the murder of dozens of Arab inhabitants of the  territories by Arab terrorists. I would like to add, Mr.  Speaker, that if these events are not investigated now they will  be probed by the next commission of inquiry which has yet to be  set up.    Mr. Speaker, Judaism does not uphold punishing an entire  community for the sins of one individual. We do not believe in  or accept the concept of collective responsibility, and we will  definitely not stigmatize the entire community of settlers in  Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; a community of law-abiding people and  pioneers; of people who have for six years been subjected to a  ceaseless onslaught of terror but behaved in a manner which only  arouses respect and should be an example to all of us; people  who drive in their cars with their children on roads where a  woman five-months pregnant is slaughtered and the father of nine  children is slain together with his son. These people have  displayed supreme heroism, and are for the most part -- and this  is an understatement -- law-abiding. We do not accept the  current notion of mentioning them in the same breath with a  handful of extremists who must be dealt with the utmost severity  within the confines of the law. The latter should be dealt  with, but not so the vast majority. We ought to watch over this  majority and not lend a hand to harming a community of people  who are the emissaries of the State of Israel and of generations  of the Jewish people.    However, that is exactly what you are trying to do. In the  last few days, the media has been waging a slanderous and  venomous campaign. Not just the media, but also cabinet  ministers have been describing the settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza as a hotbed of murderers. I hear talk about  separation -- a euphemism for uprooting the Jewish population  from Hebron, Bet El, Ari'el, and 'Imanu'el -- and I say: If the  answer to terror in Hebron is uprooting Jews from Hebron, the  solution to possible terror in Yafo is uprooting Jews from Yafo,  Nazareth, 'Akko, and any other place where Jews and Arabs live  side by side. There is no solution other than coexistence.  Those who demand our expulsion from Hebron as a solution are  doomed to flee other places as well.    Mr. Speaker, Hebron, the city of the common patriarchs of  the  Jewish and Arab peoples, must be the place where Jews and Arabs  learn to live and to pray side by side. However, the  coexistence we advocate cannot grow and develop on the basis of  an unfortunate policy which forsakes the security of both Jews  and Arabs. We call on the government to return to a sane,  responsible policy. Only in such a policy lies the chance of  curbing this horrendous bloodshed. A responsible policy will  ensure that we can continue to tread this arduous and tortuous  road -- albeit the only one we believe in -- of peaceful  coexistence between Arabs and Jews in Eretz Yisra'el.    I would like to conclude with a word to Israel's Arabs: You  are citizens of this country. Through great efforts, we built a  life together, a successful delicate fabric. I call on your  leaders not to lend a hand to its destruction, to calm tempers,  to put down the violence, and to come out against it, just as I  call on my colleagues in the left wing of the House to curb the  hatred and the venom. Let us argue to the point -- and we do  have an outstanding argument -- but not by resorting to  uncalled-for hatred. We have only one nation and only one  state, and let us maintain both of them.</p>

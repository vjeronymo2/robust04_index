			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Royal rallies on cash hope COMPOSITE insurance group Royal Insurance rallied towards the close on hints that the proposed joint venture with its two European partners will bring Royal a cash injection which could boost its solvency ratio by as much as 10 per cent. Last year, Royal announced a European insurance joint venture with Fondiaria, of Italy, and Aachener &amp; Munchener, of Germany. Stories circulating yesterday indicated that Royal will inject assets into the joint venture, called European Partners for Insurance Co-operation, or EPIC, in return for cash. Specialists said that to increase Royal's solvency ratio by some 10 per cent would require more than Pounds 300m. The Royal assets being injected into the joint venture, so the stories suggested, would involve its Dutch, Italian and Spanish businesses. Royal ended the day 3 cheaper at 260p, after 256p. Buyers for Glaxo Positive comment in a US business newspaper and a raised earnings estimate was said to be behind a rise against the trend for Glaxo yesterday. Buyers turned round an early 10 fall and the shares closed 18 up at 863p with 3.4m traded. The company was highlighted in an article raising the possibility of its rivalling Merck, the world's largest drugs company. Also, US investment bank Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette moved up its earnings estimate for Glaxo. Donaldson analyst Mr Kent Blair increased his forecast for 1992 to Dollars 1.25 per American Depositary Receipt (ADR) from Dollars 1.15 and held his buy rating. In early afternoon trading, in a lifeless New York market, Glaxo ADRs were up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 - a 52-week high - with 2.3m traded. Each Glaxo ADR is equivalent to two shares. Vodafone down Vodafone, the UK's biggest cellular telecoms group, was a major casualty in a telecoms sector that mostly escaped the general slide in share prices. Triggering a sharp fall in the shares was a profits downgrade by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and news that BZW, the investment bank, had removed the stock from its buy list. At the close, Vodafone was 15 lower at 360p, having touched 359p. Turnover was higher than usual at 2.3m shares. UBS reduced its 1992 profits estimate from Pounds 270m to Pounds 264m and its 1993 figure from Pounds 300m to Pounds 295m, with telecoms analyst Mr Adam Quinton citing increased losses at Orbitel, Vodafone's joint venture with Ericsson, the Swedish telecoms equipment manufacturing group. BZW said it had shifted Vodafone to a 'hold' because it viewed the stock's valuation as being 'up with events'. The investment bank spoke of disappointing figures for new Vodafone customers during December and also mentioned increasing concern about official regulation in the cellular radio business. 'We are seeing the first signs of regulation in the industry,' added BZW. Unilever sold Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever fell as dealers took the view that the shares had over-reached themselves in achieving an all-time high last week. The beginning of a turnround in one of the FT-SE 100's best performing stocks was prompted by a number of small currency-related forecast cuts. A large chunk of Unilever's business lies in the US, and a weaker dollar against sterling, as well as a weaker basket of Asian, African and Latin American currencies against the pound, underlay the change in profits estimates. Although most observers remain positive on the stock, there is some concern that there has been no pick-up in Unilever's third-quarter trading in the US and UK. Finally, because of the high premium of the UK-listed shares there was some switching into Dutch-listed Unilever NV. Unilever fell 16 to 883p with 1.7m traded. Worries resurfaced that a holiday price war may develop after Thomson, one of the industry leaders, trimmed some prices in its summer brochure. The move by Thomson, with a 35 per cent share of the market, follows similar tactics by its closest rivals, Owners Abroad and Airtours, before Christmas. Yesterday, Airtours dropped 48 to 827p and Owners slipped 3 1/2 to 103p. Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said: 'There is no price war yet. But it is a situation that is likely to get worse as Owners and Airtours battle for second place and Thomson refuses to stand idly by.' Ms Lisa Gordon at County NatWest was less bearish, saying that talk of a price war was overdone. 'It has been more of a story in the press than it has been in the markets. I do not think it will be long-lived.' Bank shares took another pounding after James Capel, the leading agency broker, confirmed it had downgraded the sector. NatWest shares were the worst affected, sliding to 259p at one point before stabilising and closing a net 7 off at 263p; turnover reached 4.1m shares. Lloyds and Midland dipped 4 each to 390p and 209p, while Barclays eased 3 to 361p. Commercial Union tumbled 15 to 485p in a generally weak composite insurance sector. Hillsdown, the food manufacturing group, fell sharply, closing 10 off at 152p, after 149p, with Cazenove, the London broker, reported as having downgraded the stock. Boots, first of the big retailing groups to reveal details of Christmas sales, eased 3 1/2 to 421p. Dixons, reporting today, lost 7 to 192p. Suggestions that UBS had cut its profits estimates upset Marks and Spencer, which settled 7 off at 274p, after 272p, and Argos, down 4 at 252p. Hints of a profits downgrade by County NatWest saw Body Shop retreat sharply to close 15 down at 337p, after 333p. The placing of a block of over 1m shares saw WH Smith dip 17 to 422p. News that the new Saudi Arabian budget contained an increased defence allocation helped lift British Aerospace 12 to 300p. BAe suffered weekend speculation that negotiations for a Pounds 2.5bn defence contract with the Saudis were not going well. An Pounds 8.1m rights issue at Whessoe, the project management, engineering services and instrumentation group, was not well received, the shares slipping 8 to 226p. Conglomerate Williams Holdings, which has had a dull time since the failure of its Racal bid, gained 15 to 311p as the market bought on consideration that the stock had become undervalued. The substantial weakness of the leading oil issues on Monday, primarily caused by James Capel's severe profits downgrades, continued yesterday, with Enterprise another 16 off at 418p after more cuts in earnings forecasts. The latest reduction was said to have been made by SG Warburg Securities. BP slipped a further 3 to 246p on heavy turnover of 6.9m shares, while Shell lost 6 more to 482p. The fall in the latter, which occurred in exceptionally heavy turnover of 5.7m, came after Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said the stock was 'poised on the edge of a cliff; there is substantial downside'. ICI weakened as marketmakers used a profits forecast from Hoare Govett as an excuse to sell. Hoare is a buyer despite cutting its 1991 profits estimate to Pounds 840m from Pounds 875m and its 1992 forecast to Pounds 1.06bn from Pounds 1.125bn. However, the stock has risen sharply since Christmas and some traders saw their opportunity to take profits. The shares fell 13 to 1181p. Pharmaceutical group Wellcome continued to lose ground it had gained on press reports that UK tests had shown the performance of Wellcome's anti-Aids drug Retrovir was boosted when used with its anti-herpes drug Zovirax. The stock weakened 44 to 1018p, with analysts saying it was still over-valued at current levels. Despite the weakness in Wall Street and the profit-taking in the pharmaceuticals sector, SmithKline Beecham maintained a rise of 5 to 905p. Group chairman Mr Jan Leschly announced that the firm would be introducing 10 products over the next five years that should generate strong sales growth. ECC Group, the building materials concern, moved up strongly to close 7 firmer at 490p, responding to a buy note issued by Robert Fleming Securities. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (54).

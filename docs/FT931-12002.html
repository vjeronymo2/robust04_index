			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Fall forecast in public investment PUBLIC SECTOR investment is set to fall in real terms in the 1993-94 financial year in spite of government pledges to protect capital spending, figures released by the Treasury showed yesterday. According to the Treasury's statistical supplement to last November's Autumn Statement, asset creation in the public sector - the broadest measure of public-sector investment - will fall by an inflation-adjusted 2.32 per cent in the coming financial year compared with 1992-93. In cash terms, public-asset creation is due to rise to Pounds 30.4bn this year from Pounds 30.31bn. The fall in real terms largely reflects a sharp increase of Pounds 898m in projected investment by the government this year compared with earlier plans following the announcement in the Autumn Statement of its Pounds 750m programme to buy houses. However, the figures brought a sharp response from Labour. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said they showed that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had not kept promises made in the autumn statement to protect public investment. The supplement revised upwards slightly the government forecast of the 1992-93 public-expenditure planning total to Pounds 226.5bn from Pounds 226.1bn in the Autumn Statement. It also showed that Britons living in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales gain more from government spending than those in England in spite of a narrowing of regional differences in economic activity and unemployment since the start of the recession. The government spent Pounds 4,191 per head of population in Northern Ireland in 1991-92 against Pounds 3,506 in Scotland and Pounds 3,268 in Wales. Expenditure per head in England was below the Pounds 3,060 national average at Pounds 2,963. England accounted for 81 per cent of identifiable general government expenditure, a reflection of its larger population and economic importance. Scotland had 10 per cent against 5 per cent for Wales and Ulster's 4 per cent. Tentative figures for government spending in the English regions showed that the north-west had the highest per head expenditure, followed by the north and south-east. East Anglia obtained less in government spending per head than other regions. Public Expenditure Analyses to 1995-96. Cmnd 2219, HMSO, Pounds 19.50.</p>

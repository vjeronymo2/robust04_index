			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Sarajevo may see UN aid UN relief workers yesterday were making a push to get aid through to Sarajevo, after Bosnian Serb leaders appeared to soften their position, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. A spokesman said two convoys, carrying 239 tonnes of food, were heading for Sarajevo, and 13 more were planned for other parts of Bosnia. Recent Bosnian Serb restrictions have virtually halted the delivery of humanitarian aid. But relief workers were hoping to take advantage after Serbs allowed the passage of a convoy to the Bosnian capital. Their efforts coincided with signals from Bosnian Serb leaders that they will rejoin the peace process if the international mediators negotiate directly with them rather than with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.</p>

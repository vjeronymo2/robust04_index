			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "One More Offer for Talks?"] </F>   [Text] According to a special report by a JANG  correspondent, India has invited Pakistan to hold talks at the  prime minister level. According to the report, the Foreign  Office received a proposal a few days ago that the next round of  India-Pakistan talks be held at the prime minister level instead  of at the foreign secretary level. Pakistan has welcomed this  proposal conditionally and said that it is ready for the  proposed dialogue provided the Kashmir issue is placed on the  top of the agenda. However, available report indicates that  India wishes to hold discussions only on the Siachen Glacier  issue. At the same time, New Delhi has also suggested that  Pakistan should not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at  the September session of the UN General Assembly.    Talking to the JANG, the Pakistan foreign secretary rightly  said that our stand on India-Pakistan dialogue is crystal clear.  We do not have any objection in principle to the talks, but  India will have to fulfill four preconditions to create a  conducive atmosphere for the dialogue. The preconditions are:  India should reduce the number of troops deployed in Kashmir,  dismantle all the bunkers built by the Indian forces around the  Hazratbal Shrine, release all the detained Kashmiri leaders, and  allow the representatives of the international human rights  organizations to visit occupied Kashmir. The conditions set by  Pakistan are very appropriate and practicable and any high-level  dialogue will be useless if these conditions are not met.    In the past, Pakistan accepted many Indian proposals and  held  negotiations in a spirit of goodwill, but, as everybody knows,  all those rounds of discussions remained fruitless solely  because of India's refusal to create even the slightest  flexibility in its stand on the Kashmir question. Six rounds of  foreign minister-level talks were held on the Kashmir issue in  1962. At that time, India agreed to enter into negotiations on  Kashmir because it was facing enormous pressure due to its  border war with China and all the Western countries had also  asked Pakistan not to create more difficulties for India, which,  as a quid pro quo, would hold talks with Islamabad to resolve  the Kashmir dispute. The eyes of the entire Western world were  set on the rounds of discussions that were being held between  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Sardar Swaran Singh, and there was  pressure on India to make those talks successful and meaningful.  Even then, India could not adopt the path of justice and  propriety. Seven more rounds of foreign secretary-level talks  have been held in the recent past, but all of them have been  meaningless. After the three-day talks in January 1994, India  invited Pakistan to hold another round of dialogue, but Pakistan  had made it clear that, in spite of being a principled supporter  of negotiations, it could not go on holding fruitless  discussions.    The Foreign Office has thus far not confirmed the receipt of  any official invitation from India for the prime minister-level  talks, but if India is really interested in negotiations, then  it must, first of all, agree to place the Kashmir issue on the  top of the agenda of such talks. It must also accept the four  preconditions set by Pakistan to create a congenial atmosphere  for the talks, because it is not possible for Pakistan to sit  around a negotiating table with India while New Delhi continues  its oppression and atrocities against the Kashmiris. India will  have to give some proof that it is sincere in holding talks and  is ready to adopt the path of justice. If the Government of  Pakistan receives any formal invitation from India for a  dialogue at any level, then it should remain steadfast on the  aforementioned preconditions and should not engage itself in  negotiations that are not going to yield any positive results.  Likewise, Pakistan should also not give any assurances that it  will not move any resolution on the Kashmir issue at the next UN  General Assembly session. India's behavior in the past has not  left any room for any wishful thinking on our part and we should  not follow a shadow by continuing the process of fruitless  negotiations.</p>

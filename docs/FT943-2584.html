			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Politicians ready for next stage of 'ice hockey' war - Quebec Mr Jacques Parizeau often compares his Parti Quebecois' struggle for independence from Canada to the three periods of an ice hockey game. The first period ended with last October's national elections, when separatists gained a powerful voice in the federal House of Commons by becoming the official opposition with 54 MPs. The second period was last Monday's provincial election in Quebec, in which the PQ hoped to gain a strong mandate to lay the groundwork for its planned breakaway. If Mr Parizeau's dreams come true, the final period has now begun, and will culminate in a big Yes vote in an independence referendum some time before the end of 1995. With the start of the hockey season just a few weeks away, it wasn't surprising that many Quebec newspapers took up Mr Parizeau's metaphor to comment on the outcome of last Monday's poll. The PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, but gained only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, just a fraction more than the defeated Liberals. The Quebec media, by and large, has tended to sympathise with the nationalist cause. But several of the province's most influential commentators see the hockey game developing somewhat differently from Mr Parizeau's scenario. 'The third period will be long, rough and chaotic,' wrote Mr Gilles Lesage, in Le Devoir, Quebec's highbrow, French-language paper. A cartoon in another paper showed Mr Parizeau and Liberal leader Daniel Johnson in hockey gear, facing off for the third period. Neither of the two men carried a hockey stick. Referring to the 1980 referendum on a loose form of 'sovereignty-association' which was held when the PQ was last in office, Mr Lesage noted that 'there's the risk of Quebec being broken in two as it was 15 years ago, as it turns towards a nightmare in which no one wins.' The unexpectedly low proportion of Quebeckers who voted for the PQ is widely interpreted, at least for the time being, as evidence that the separatists face an uphill struggle in the referendum campaign. Lysiane Gagnon, a columnist for La Presse in Montreal, noted that even fewer people would have voted in favour of independence last week than supported the PQ. She concluded that 'the PQ must convert more than 10 per cent of the electorate in less than 15 months: soft federalists, lukewarm nationalists, third-party supporters ..' Under the headline 'Parizeau cornered', Le Soleil, Quebec City's main daily, advised Mr Parizeau to concentrate on such bread-and-butter issues as control of government spending, job creation, health care and education. Michel Auger, political columnist for the tabloid Journal de Montreal - which devoted a numbing 20 pages to its day-after coverage of the election - agreed that the Liberals have the upper hand as the third period gets under way. But Auger cautioned that the federalist forces should not rejoice too soon. 'On the highway to sovereignty, there will be numerous opportunities for flat tyres, and one has often seen broken-down buses which have found a way to arrive at their destination.' The separatists will be counting on English-speaking Canadians, especially in faraway western provinces, to prove that the rest of the country would prefer Quebec to leave. However, editorial writers in western Canadian cities were remarkably restrained in their early reaction to the election. 'All Canadians, within and outside Quebec, should take this opportunity to quietly reaffirm the successes - the cultural richness, the economic well-being, the social harmony and the political security - which have come with Confederation,' said the Calgary Herald. 'For those benefits, Quebec's ambivalence and its need to test its national identity are a small price to pay.' The Globe and Mail, which calls itself Canada's national newspaper, struck a hopeful note about the future. An editorial, titled 'The Genius of Canada', suggested that 'Canada has far more strength and commands far more loyalty among its many communities than the chattering classes generally understand.' But in case anyone is naive enough to assume that the coming referendum will mark the end of the interminable wrangle over Quebec's place in Canada, a cartoon in New Brunswick's Moncton Times-Transcript shows a man in the year 2094, fast asleep on his sofa. A voice from the TV set in front of him intones: 'And in today's news. . . Canada has again failed to separate from Quebec.'</p>

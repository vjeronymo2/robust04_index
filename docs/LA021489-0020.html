			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WITT CLAIMS A CITY BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES MIGHT BE RULED UNLAWFUL, LEAD TO SUITS  </P> <P> San Diego City Atty. John W. Witt warned Monday that enactment of a local  ordinance banning the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons "very  likely" would be invalidated by a court challenge, leaving the city vulnerable  to claims for damages and attorneys' fees.  </P> <P> Witt, differing with the legal opinion that supported passage of a similar  ordinance in Los Angeles last week, reported that regulation of semiautomatic  weapons is an area of law left to the state Legislature -- despite the fact  that no specific state laws exist. Witt said that legal doctrine is known as  "preemption by legislative implication."  </P> <P> "Firearms control is solely within the province of the state Legislature, and a  city ordinance would not be effective, and would, in fact, be ruled unlawful  under the state of California Constitution," Witt said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call for Official Ban  </P> <P> Three San Diego City Council members last week called for passage of a local  ordinance banning the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons such as the  AK-47 rifle used last month in the slaying of five elementary schoolchildren in  Stockton.  </P> <P> Council members Wes Pratt, Judy McCarty and Gloria McColl cited the city's  rapidly escalating homicide rate and gang violence, as well as their desire to  send a strong message to state legislators about the need for regulating the  weapons.  </P> <P> Their proposal will be considered by two council committees Wednesday, but  telephone calls to council offices are running heavily against the idea.  National Rifle Assn. representatives expressed their opposition in a meeting  Monday with McCarty.  </P> <P> The Assembly began hearings on the issue Monday. Three cities -- Los Angeles,  Compton and Stockton -- have approved ordinances regulating the weapons in the  wake of the Stockton slayings.  </P> <P> In his memo, Witt said the Legislature, by enacting detailed law on which  weapons may be possessed, has covered the field of law completely enough that  "it is very likely" that a challenge would be successful.  </P> <P> Should the San Diego City Council pass a law specifically banning the weapons,  a legal challenge would "very likely" succeed on the grounds that the state had  "expressly" reserved that area of law to itself, the memo said.  </P> <P> Witt also said in an interview that California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has  publicly stated that regulation of the weapons is a matter properly left to the  state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City May Pay Court Costs  </P> <P> Stressing his personal desire to control the weapons and send a strong message  to state legislators, Witt nevertheless noted that, if the city lost a court  case it could be forced to pay punitive damages and attorneys' fees. He noted  that the council has officially gone on record in support of two pieces of  state legislation that would regulate sales of the weapons.  </P> <P> Witt's memo appeared to directly contradict an opinion issued by Los Angeles  Deputy City Atty. Henry G. Morris before passage of a Los Angeles ordinance  last week.  </P> <P> "While the matter is not free from doubt, since no provision of state law  expressly prohibits localities from so regulating, we believe that a reasonable  argument can be made in support of local authority to regulate possession of  assault weapons," Morris wrote in a letter to the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> "In our view, the sale of a firearm would be an aspect of control of  possession, since the prevention of the sale of a weapon would preclude access  to possession thereof."  </P> <P> Asked about the differing opinions, Witt said the Los Angeles council had  "bowed to political pressure."  </P> <P> Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the National Rifle Assn.,  agreed with Witt's interpretation of the law. "It sounds like the city attorney  has done a good job," he said. "We don't have to tell (the council members)  anything."  </P> <P> Gardiner said the NRA will be supporting litigation testing the Los Angeles ban  on possession of semi-automatic weapons. A lawsuit was filed Monday.  </P> <P> In an interview, McCarty said the city should enact a law despite Witt's  opinion.  </P> <P> "I believe that we have an emergency in this town," she said. "We have Elliott  Nesses and Al Capones running around this town having a good time, and a lot of  little kids are getting hurt."  </P> <P> However, two council members, Bruce Henderson and Ed Struiksma, said Monday  that they would oppose enactment of a local ordinance in the belief that state  or federal laws are the only way to provide uniform control of the weapons.  </P></p>

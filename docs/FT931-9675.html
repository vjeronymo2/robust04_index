			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Manufacturers lift capital spending CAPITAL spending by manufacturers rallied in the second half of last year, according to government figures yesterday that will increase confidence about growth prospects. Investment in machinery, which accounts for about four-fifths of all capital spending in the sector, held up particularly well. It showed a small increase in the second half of last year, compared with the first half and the final six months of 1991. The provisional seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office underline cautious optimism that the UK may be poised for recovery. Manufacturing accounts for just under a quarter of the economy. Investment by manufacturers on buildings, vehicles and machinery rose by a real, inflation-adjusted 3.1 per cent in the final six months of 1992 compared with the first half. At 1985 prices, the figure went up to Pounds 5.22bn from Pounds 5.06bn. Spending on machinery rose by 4.4 per cent between the first half and the second half of 1992, from Pounds 4.24bn to Pounds 4.42bn. There was a year-on-year rise in the second half of 2 per cent, from Pounds 4.34bn in the final six months of 1991. Last year total capital spending in manufacturing was 3.5 per cent down compared with 1991. In the second half, the figure fell 1.1 per cent in comparison with the final half of 1991. Between 1990 and 1991, capital investment dropped by 9.4 per cent. In the late 1980s, spending on plant, vehicles and construction by manufacturers grew strongly, an important factor behind economic overheating in the period. In the fourth quarter of last year, capital spending increased by 0.6 per cent on the previous quarter. It was 2 per cent down on the equivalent period a year earlier. The CSO said spending in the third quarter of last year increased by 1 per cent on the second quarter, a higher figure than estimated. UK borrowers announced new capital issues in January of Pounds 2.88bn, of which Pounds 2bn was denominated in sterling, said the Bank of England. Actual gross issues were Pounds 1.52bn, with redemptions accounting for Pounds 427m, leaving net issues at Pounds 1.1bn.</p>

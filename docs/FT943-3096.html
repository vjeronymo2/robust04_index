Both companies declined to comment yesterday. Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst with the broking firm Merrill Lynch, said: 'A lot of this is being planted in the press to sift out who's a player and who isn't'. Disney shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 yesterday to Dollars 41 1/4, while GE's rose Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 50 1/4.</p>

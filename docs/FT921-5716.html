			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Soft on soft commissions THE ABOLITION of fixed commissions in London's Big Bang in 1986 was widely expected to put an end to much of the non-price competition that prevailed in the old stockbrokers' cartel. Yet research of mixed quality, for which no explicit price is charged, continues to pour out of securities firms in the City. And the practice of paying soft commissions, whereby broking firms receive an agreed amount of commission business from fund managers in exchange for dealing screens or other investment services, has multiplied to the point where it poses a serious regulatory challenge. A recent survey by Greenwich Associates of 164 institutional investors revealed that the number of institutions doing soft commission business rose from 42 per cent to 52 per cent between 1989 and 1990. The London Stock Exchange estimates that soft commission business accounts for 13 per cent of total commissions. The exchange's chief executive, Mr Peter Rawlins, declared last week that he would be happier if brokers discontinued the practice without outside prompting. This is unlikely to happen, because soft commissions are a marketing device with obvious attractions for the broking fraternity at a time of excess capacity. Brokers are, in effect, offering a discount to their fund management clients in the form of a benefit in kind. The attraction for the broking firm is that it acquires an agreed volume of business, in exchange for providing Reuters screens, research or performance measurement services for the client. The attraction for the fund manager is that the cost of these services falls automatically on the ultimate saver, to whose fund the commissions are charged, instead of resulting in a cash charge on his own budget. First question The first question for the regulators is whether the economics of soft commissions offer benefits to the saver. In any competitive business, discounts are normally passed on to the ultimate customer. The growth in soft commission business has not obviously led to this happening, despite the considerable competition between fund management firms. But nor is it clear that the brokers are making hay. Few London securities firms are earning an adequate return on their capital in an overstocked market. Those that engage in soft commissions argue that without them they would have to raise the explicit charge to fund trustees. The second question concerns potential conflicts of interest. Here the problem arises because the broker is offering benefits in kind not to the saver, but to the fund management intermediary. The Securities and Investments Board (SIB) has already banned the offer of inducements which are have no direct investment benefit for the customer. The worry is that by locking themselves into soft commission deals with a specific broker, fund managers will not obtain best execution and may be tempted to churn portfolios to satisfy soft commission arrangements. The lack of transparency opens the door to cross-subsidies and inefficiencies in the system. Classic weapon The SIB's answer has been to adopt the classic weapon of disclosure. Fund managers now have to reveal the basis on which they deal to the trustees of the funds they handle. Some even advertise the fact that they do no soft commission business to win competitive advantage. And performance measurement provides a discipline of sorts over excessive transaction costs. Yet soft commissions continue to proliferate; and this must partly reflect on the competence and motivation of trustees. Influential trustees such as company finance directors or local authority treasurers tend not to like explicit charges. Nor is it easy for them to police fund managers to ensure best execution. The suspicion remains that this is another City practice that offers greater benefit to intermediaries than savers. The cost of an outright ban would be the loss of some specialist research firms. But the City's image, much tarnished of late, is not helped by such murky practices. The SIB should think again.</p>

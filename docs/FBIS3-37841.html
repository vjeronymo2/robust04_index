			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Arrest of KGB Agents in </F> America"]    [Text] Washington -- U.S. President B. Clinton has  announced the capture of the biggest foreign spy in the U.S.  intelligence service. Aldrich Ames, a 52-year-old CIA staffer,  had worked since 1985 first for the Soviet KGB and then for its  Russian successors.    The president called this a "very serious case" and stated  that an official protest would be made to the Russian  Government. Russian charge d'affaires ad interim V.  Chkhikvishvili was summoned to the State Department where  Secretary of State W. Christopher presented him with a protest  note. The Russian Federation Embassy has reported that the note  contains nothing to indicate the likelihood of a complication in  relations between the two countries. Nor does it contain a call  for any actions by the Russian authorities. Nonetheless T.  Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, has been instructed to  lodge an official protest with the Russian Government.    A. Ames was arrested on Monday on his way to work, where he  headed an anti-drugs subdivision. Soon his 41-year-old wife  Maria was also arrested at home. According to information which  is coming in she was also a paid CIA staffer -- but also a  better paid Russian agent.    In a statement issued in her name Attorney General Janet  Reno  also called the case "extremely serious." The majority of  experts here agree, taking into account that before he was moved  to the drug fighting department Aldrich Ames had for a number of  years headed the counterintelligence service resisting the  Soviet Union.    R. Kessler, author of the well-known book The CIA from  the Inside, who swiftly questioned his acquaintances in  that organization, believes that A. Ames was informed of all the  CIA's secret operations connected with the USSR and Russia.  President Clinton has ordered an immediate investigation into  the size of the damage to U.S. national security. It could be  colossal, considering that America has few intelligence links  left of whose reliability it can be firmly confident.    Over the past decades the communist states' intelligence  services have incurred very serious losses. Despite the high  professional reputation of the relevant services of the GDR,  Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, the wounds inflicted by  traitors in high positions were too deep. The actions of V.  Penkovskiy, who worked successfully for the West for several  years, really shook the USSR's defensive system. The collapse  of the KGB networks in Britain, Italy, and Sweden have been  described in sufficient detail in Western literature. The  impression was created that since the era of Kim Philby and his  renowned Cambridge colleagues who were the glory of the  NKVD-MGB-KGB all that is best in Soviet intelligence is in the  past.    If all the buzzing in the U.S. mass media today is true then  in 1985 the Soviet special services made a breakthrough to  sources of enormous value by recruiting A. Ames and his wife.    In contrast to Philby, Burgess, and the other aces of  espionage, Ames and his wife found the fascination of serving  the Soviet Union lay not in ideological unity but in the level  of remuneration. Radio and television reports are announcing not  without concealed delight that the USSR and Russia paid the Ames  over $1.5 million.    The generous payments, many times in excess of the family's  official income, proved fatal to it. Calculations showed that  in the period between April 1985 and November 1993 Aldrich was  able to take home no more than $335,164, but during this time  the Ames' spent at least $1.3 million. They bought a house in  Arlington, a suburb of Washington, for $540,000. They made  ostentatious purchases with their seemingly unlimited credit  cards: in all $455,000. They bought a Jaguar sports car for  $25,000 -- an automobile which is not so much expensive as  provocatively useless for a normal working family.    Yet the majority of CIA employees are people of very modest  means by U.S. standards. They do not throw money about  themselves and are very suspicious of those colleagues who are  inclined to luxury.    President Clinton said he was informed long ago that the  Ames' were under constant observation. Top secret documents  with no direct bearing on his activity were found in Aldrich's  official cupboard. They managed to establish his method of  communication with his patrons from the Russian intelligence  services. The meetings took place after a discreet sign drawn  in chalk appeared somewhere on a mailbox in Georgetown not far  from the Russian housing complex.    Incidentally, that was the subject of the couple's "spy"  talk  which was recorded on tape and has been broadcast on the radio  several times. Maria was asking angrily why he was slow in  drawing the sign and Aldrich was trying to justify himself,  saying that there was heavy rain and the chalkmark would be  washed away at once.    By studying the contents of the trash cans outside the Ames'  house U.S. counterintelligence agents discovered last September  old tapes from his computer printer and (or) typewriter.  Laboratories had no difficulty in reconstituting the printed  texts from which advance information was obtained about a  meeting with Russian agents scheduled in Caracas, the capital of  Venezuela.    He was an experienced agent and had served in Turkey and  Mexico and was then responsible for recruiting Soviet officials  and in particular KGB officers. He was promoted for his  successes in this job, heading the department for fighting  Soviet intelligence.    But he probably came up against a top-class Soviet  professional, who cunningly recruited him in turn.    The materials handed to the court to obtain an arrest  warrant  for the Ames' bear out that they had passed on to the Russian  special services information about CIA operations and personnel.  Their activity against the United States began in 1985 although  the CIA suspected the existence of a well concealed Soviet agent  in its ranks at the end of the seventies.    If the court fines the Ames' guilty they face life  imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.    President Clinton called the exposure of the Ames' a "very  good joint operation by the FBI and the CIA." The CIA has no  right to operate on U.S. territory although it gave the FBI full  assistance in exposing its employee.    FBI Director Louis Freeh paid tribute to his CIA colleagues  for their readiness "to help us unhesitatingly at each step" of  the investigation, and CIA Director James Woolsey noted in an  official statement that "this joint effort shows how our  counterintelligence agents and FBI employees have cooperated  over the recent period."    This mutual praise is an indirect response to criticism of  past years when differences between the two intelligence  departments allowed CIA staffer E. Howard to flee to Moscow in  1985 and betray several U.S. agents to the KGB.    U.S. observers are angered most by the perfidy of Russia  which, they say, is seeking new aid from the United States yet  itself spending millions of dollars on anti-American espionage.    The picture of intelligence hostilities since the end of the  Cold War has become motley and chaotic. The countries with  powerful special services -- the USSR, the GDR, and  Czechoslovakia -- no longer exist. The successors to the GDR  and Czechoslovakia have completely halted their work against the  West. Russia has not and is believed to have no intention of  doing so, primarily because such activity against it has not  ceased for a moment.    The commentaries of experts, who include many former  professional intelligence workers, contain anger at the fact  that, tempted by the Russian millions, Ames betrayed many U.S.  agents to Moscow. Although this claim is to all appearances  true it also attests to the hypocrisy of this anger since Russia  has no less right to secret operations in the United States than  America has to espionage in Russia.    On Tuesday U.S. journalists laid siege to the Russian  Embassy in Washington requesting comments on the main sensation  of the week. In the absence of a response from Moscow this was  impossible. Accepted practice is for governments to keep quiet  if agents working for their countries are exposed.    The State Department asserts that questions connected with  Aldrich and Maria Ames may be raised with Russian Foreign  Minister A. Kozyrev if there is confirmation of persistent  rumors that he is coming to Washington toward the end of the  week.</p>

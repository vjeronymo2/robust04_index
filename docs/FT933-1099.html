			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brent Walker considering options over William Hill BRENT WALKER, the heavily-indebted leisure and property group which releases its interim results on Monday, is looking at the possibility of retaining its William Hill betting shop chain, rather than floating or selling it. The group is considering two offers for William Hill. The Warburg consortium, which opened the bidding with a Pounds 360m cash offer, is understood to have upped its bid to between Pounds 450m and Pounds 475m. This offer is structured to allow Brent Walker to retain a sizeable, though minority, stake. This would enable the lossmaking group to share in any recovery and growth the betting chain achieved. The other offer, thought to be lower than Warburg's, is from a consortium led by CinVEN and Legal and General. William Hill is also pursuing the flotation option. It has appointed sponsors and is interviewing potential public relations advisers next week. Sober estimates of the likely value at flotation are in the Pounds 520m to Pounds 540m region. It is thought a trade sale could be completed sooner than a flotation and it would not be subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Standard Chartered, the lead bank in the Brent Walker syndicate, confirmed yesterday that it had started talks with the other lenders about refinancing the Pounds 350m William Hill syndicate. William Hill, which is ring-fenced from the rest of Brent Walker, has to repay its loan by March 1 next year. It is thought that Brent Walker would also seek to raise new money from its banks, although StanChart would not comment on this. With the values put on William Hill by the trade offers and the flotation estimates, Brent Walker now has a better chance to convince its banks to take on the William Hill debt. William Hill is cash generative and if the ring fence can be removed and the chain absorbed within Brent Walker it could improve the prospects for the group as a whole. Brent Walker's results are expected to show an improvement in trading at William Hill, thanks to evening opening and despite the fiasco of the Grand National. However, the group's pub business is thought to be under pressure. Massive interest charges will turn operating profits into pre-tax losses. The loss for the first half of 1992 was Pounds 79.4m although operating profits were Pounds 29.5m. Interest totalled Pounds 108m. In the whole of 1992 operating profit was Pounds 49.5m, but pre-tax losses were Pounds 427.4m after interest of Pounds 204.4m and exceptionals of Pounds 246m.</p>

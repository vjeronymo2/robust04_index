			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART NEWS: L.A. CENTER FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIES FINDS A HOME  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies is no longer homeless.  </P> <P> On Saturday, LACPS opens its new downtown gallery space -- the organization's  first home in two years -- with an inaugural exhibition featuring photographic  installations by Los Angeles artists Kim Yasuda and Jody Zellen, and  large-scale photographic mixed-media pieces by the collaborative team of Todd  Gray and Stephan Reusse.  </P> <P> "This is a big step for us," said LACPS Director Suzy Kerr, who explained that  the nonprofit organization has been working to establish a permanent home since  1988, when it received a $25,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant for that  purpose.  </P> <P> Kerr said that up until now, the organization has been operating out of an  office located in the same building as the new gallery, and has held its  programs -- including exhibitions, lectures and workshops -- in other venues,  such as Beyond Baroque, the Fullerton Museum Center and USC.  </P> <P> Kerr said that while the organization still will continue to collaborate with  other locations and venues for its larger exhibitions, the new gallery will be  used to show "local artists doing emerging work."  </P> <P> "We were lucky to get it," said Kerr of the 350-square-foot space, which she  described as "more of a small, New York-style gallery space than a Los Angeles  gallery space." Located at 1048 W. 6th St., the 35x11-foot gallery, which  formerly housed a sign shop, was redesigned by architect and LACPS board member  Josh Schweitzer, and contains a large store-front window facing out to 6th  Street.  </P> <P> Kerr said that she had been too "overwhelmed" with finishing the physical work  necessary for the gallery's opening to set many future programing details, but  that the gallery's second show, to open in late March, will feature the work of  photographer Pat Ward Williams. Programing decisions beyond that, she said,  will be made by LACPS' newly formed program committee, chaired by local artist  Daniel Martinez.  </P> <P> "We're going to put out a call for entries and suggestions. We want to make  this space as open as possible to the community . . . so we want to work on a  fairly spontaneous basis," Kerr said.  </P> <P> But while the new home is certainly a step forward, it isn't the last for  LACPS, which was formed in 1974 to encourage the growth and appreciation of  photography as an art form.  </P> <P> "We plan to move again in a couple of years to a larger, better, permanent  home," said Kerr, noting that the organization's ultimate goal is to have a  300,000-square-foot gallery space in the downtown area.  </P> <P> In the meantime, however, Kerr said she expects more than 300 people to attend  the gallery's opening on Saturday. In addition to the regular gallery opening,  the organization will throw a $10-per-person party from 7-10 p.m. in the  building's 10th floor penthouse. The local band Gutbucket will perform.  </P> <P> The Yasuda, Zellen and Grey and Reusse works will remain on view through March  9.  </P> <P> CALL FOR ENTRIES: Long Beach's Public Corporation for the Arts will accept  slide entries for the city's fifth annual Art Expedition poster through  Thursday. To qualify, entrants must live and produce their work in the city of  Long Beach, must have been working as a professional artist for at least three  years and must already belong to or be ready to join the PCA's Visual Arts  Registry. For information, call Mary Sullivan at (213) 499-7777.  </P> <P> Also accepting entries is the Downey Museum of Art, which is preparing for its  March 22-May 6 "Ceramics Now: 1990" show. For consideration, artists must  submit slides by Feb. 14. The competition is open to all artists working in  ceramics, and the museum is seeking work that is representative of current  trends in the medium. For information, call (213) 861-0419.  </P> <P> NOTES: The Norton Simon Museum of Art has added Gustave Courbet's early  portrait, "Peasant Girl with a Scarf," to its collections. The portrait of a  young peasant woman wearing a checked cotton scarf was painted about 1848,  during the first decade of the artist's maturity. . . . Noted Mexican  photographer Graciela Iturbide, whose first solo museum show in the U.S.,  "External Encounters, Internal Imaginings: Photographs by Graciela Iturbide,"  is currently at the San Francisco Museum of Art, will present a free slide  lecture on Feb. 8 at 7:30 p.m. at San Francisco's Mission Cultural Center, 2868  Mission St. Iturbide will discuss -- in Spanish and accompanied by an English  translator -- her experiences as a photographer working in Mexico and the  United States. . . . Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, the Los Angeles  Center for Photographic Studies, and the Downey Museum of Art are among 23 arts  institutions receiving matching grants through the National/State/County  Partnership. LACE will receive $10,000; LACPS $5,000 and the Downey Museum  $2,500. The grants recognize "significant contributions being made by emerging  and innovative organizations."  </P></p>

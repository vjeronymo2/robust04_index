			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KREMLIN OKS THE USE OF FORCE IN U.N. EMBARGO;  </P> <P> SANCTIONS: SOVIETS RELUCTANTLY AGREE TO BACK MILITARY PLAN BUT INSIST  DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS MUST CONTINUE.  </P> <P> The United States won grudging Soviet consent Friday to a U.N. resolution  backing military enforcement of the embargo against Iraq, clearing the way for  expected Security Council approval of the measure at a late-night meeting that  continued early today.  </P> <P> A Soviet official said his government reluctantly agreed to the use of force  against ships suspected of carrying goods to or from Iraq, in exchange for a  provision emphasizing the need for diplomacy to resolve the Persian Gulf  crisis.  </P> <P> "We don't exclude in some minimum form that the enforcement measures could be  used, but only in the framework of continued diplomatic and political efforts,"  Deputy Soviet Ambassador Valentin V. Lozinsky told reporters.  </P> <P> "There are changes in the text that go in this direction," he said following a  climactic round of talks in which the deal was sealed.  </P> <P> Sources said the Soviet Union began moderating its position after Secretary of  State James A. Baker III spoke by telephone with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard  A. Shevardnadze on Thursday.  </P> <P> Then on Friday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev publicly warned Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein that failure to comply with previous U.N. resolutions  arising from the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait "will inevitably compel the Security  Council to adopt corresponding extra measures."  </P> <P> The warning was seen by diplomats here as a means of enabling the Soviet Union  to drop its weeklong resistance to the proposed U.N. enforcement resolution.  Soviet officials had been arguing that the resolution was premature because  "diplomatic and political efforts have not been exhausted."  </P> <P> Lozinsky was asked if Soviet support of the resolution was connected to  Gorbachev's message to Hussein.  </P> <P> "Oh, exactly," he said. "This is part of the political and diplomatic efforts  that are taken by our government in order to solve this crisis by peaceful  means."  </P> <P> The agreement represents a major victory in President Bush's drive to put an  international stamp on aggressive U.S. efforts to enforce the U.N. trade  sanctions.  </P> <P> Bush has insisted that the United States already has legal authority to  interdict cargo vessels, and U.S. warships have fired shots across the bows of  two tankers hauling oil from Iraq. But the Administration has fought vigorously  for the U.N.'s blessing to avoid being portrayed as a lone enforcer of the  sanctions.  </P> <P> The resolution would permit military commanders of the United States or any  other nation to take unilateral action against commercial vessels to enforce  the previously approved U.N. sanctions barring any form of trade with Iraq.  </P> <P> Specifically, warships could use "such measures commensurate to the specific  circumstances as may be necessary . . . to halt all inward and outward maritime  shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destination."  </P> <P> Participants in the negotiations rejected a Soviet bid to place control of the  enforcement actions under a U.N. military committee. The resolution instead  merely requests that nations "coordinate their actions . . . using, as  appropriate, mechanisms of" the U.N. committee.  </P> <P> Several of the lesser powers on the Security Council pressed for tighter U.N.  control, demanding that the U.N. secretary general and the Security Council  have "active participation" in enforcement actions. This change, proposed by  Cuba, Yemen, Zaire and others, was being discussed with U.S. officials at a  late hour.  </P> <P> Agreement on the resolution was reached after five days of intensive talks  involving the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- the  five permanent members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council.  </P> <P> Britain and France strongly supported the U.S.-sponsored measure. China opposed  it as an unwarranted intervention in a regional matter but said it would  abstain from voting. The Soviets held out the threat of vetoing the resolution,  protesting that any action should await further diplomatic efforts and clear  evidence that the embargo is being violated.  </P> <P> The United Nations has never before approved an enforcement measure in the wake  of economic sanctions.  </P> <P> In 1966, the Security Council called upon Britain to prevent, by force if  necessary, the delivery of oil to Rhodesia. But that was a prelude to  imposition of a trade embargo eight months later.  </P> <P> In its only other authorization of military force, the United Nations in 1950  approved an operation, organized by the United States, to counter the invasion  of South Korea.  </P> <P> More on Gulf Crisis  </P> <P> SOVIET WARNING -- In an urgent message, Gorbachev tells Hussein to relent --  and hints that he may face worldwide military action. A6  </P> <P> SETTING PRIORITIES -- President Bush has indicated he would use military force  against Iraq even if it costs the lives of U.S. hostages. A7  </P> <P> CHANGE OF PLANS -- Weeks ago, the U.S. envoy to Kuwait was preparing to leave  his post. Now he's stuck there, under siege. A7  </P> <P> MARKET MOVES -- The stock market reversed course with its biggest rally since  the invasion, but prices at the gas pump hit their highest level since July,  1982. D1  </P></p>

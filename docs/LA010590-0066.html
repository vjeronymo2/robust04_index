			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> FISH AND GAME DEPT. CRITICIZED IN REPORT  </P> <P> California's Fish and Game officials fail to protect the state's wildlife  adequately, mismanage their regional offices and cannot deal effectively with  other state agencies, according to the governmental watchdog agency. The Little  Hoover Commission, a constitutionally authorized advisory body, said in a  report to the state Legislature that state wildlife policy is crippled by the  perception that "the Fish and Game Commission and the Department of Fish and  Game have isolated themselves from the major groups concerned with the  preservation of fish, game and habitat, while at the same time frequently  straining relations with other government agencies, sporting groups and  developers."  </P></p>

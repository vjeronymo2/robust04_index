			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Italy's SME to be split into three SHARES in SME, the Italian state-controlled foods retailing and catering group, rose 8 per cent to L6,000 on the Milan bourse yesterday following the government's decision to split the company into three for the purposes of privatisation. SME is 62 per cent owned by IRI, the state holding company, with the 38 per cent balance of the shares listed on the Milan bourse. SME sales last year totalled L2,323bn (Dollars 1.68bn). 'We feel splitting the group into three is the best way of getting value,' Mr Michele Tedeschi, IRI's chief executive, said yesterday. SME has a market capitalisation of L2,700bn. The shares had been suspended for more than a week pending clarification of the government's privatisation plans. The government is clearly determined, where possible, to head off bids from potential asset strippers. Mr Tedeschi and members of the government made clear they wished to use the SME privatisation as a model of the cabinet's broader programme of selling off state assets. IRI was criticised two months ago for the poor handling of its decision to sell its software subsidiary, Finsiel, to STET its telecommunications arm. Under the privatisation programme, SME will be split as follows: Frozen foods and ice creams. This part, considered as the industrial side of SME, will consist principally of Italgel Gruppo Dolciario. It will be sold in its entireity with IRI retaining no stake. Groups such as Nestle and Unilever are reportedly most interested in these activities. Branded/canned foods, olive oil. This will centre round the brand names of Cirio Bertoli de Rica and international activities such as SME International Food. SME has 24 per cent of the US olive oil market. It is also possible the milk business, currently included in this grouping will be hived off into a separate fourth group for special sale. Motorway chain restaurants and chain stores. The main companies will be Autogrill and Gs retailing. IRI intends to retain a shareholding, probably through a golden share. The aim, according to Mr Tedeschi, is to create these groups out of the existing company. He insisted minority shareholders' rights would be respected in the proposed division of assets prior to sale. He also said he hoped all the necessary arrangements could be in place for approval by the SME board by January 7. IRI is being advised in the operation by Wassertein Perella. IRI estimates the entire operation could be complete within four to six months.</p>

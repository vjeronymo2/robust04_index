			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM And Maastricht: Germany seeks curb on Brussels GERMANY is pressing for sweeping change in the balance of power in EC institutions which would rein back the Commission and devolve far greater responsibilities to member states in virtually all areas of Community activity. Its proposals - contained in a confidential paper circulated to EC foreign ministers this week - have alarmed states such as Ireland and Spain, which look to the Commission to protect their interests. Germany's emergence as the standard-bearer of subsidiarity - whereby the EC defers to members states in matters which can be better handled at national, regional or local level - has injected a fresh complication into UK efforts to reach broad agreement among the Twelve before the Birmingham summit on October 16, or a clear consensus at the Edinburgh summit in December. Reaching an agreement on subsidiarity is viewed as a vital ingredient for selling the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union to a sceptical European public, and resolving the 'Danish question' caused by Denmark's rejection of the treaty. Although the British support Germany's hardline stand in principle, there are fears that Bonn's enthusiasm for reducing the Commission's power may be going too far, too quickly. The German paper suggests that subsidiarity should apply to social, education, cultural and health policy, where 'measures at the level of the member states are sufficient.' It also suggests assessing 'whether measures at national, (including EC) level are at all necessary', a demand which some EC countries fear could mark the start of an attack on the EC's powers in the area of competition policy and regional aid. According to the German paper, 'the federal government deems it imperative that in each individual - ie for each separate action - the EC's institutions be required to demonstrate that the criteria for the subsidiarity principle are actually met'. In addition, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, told his EC partners this week in Luxembourg that Bonn wanted the right to 'screen' all EC proposals before they became legislative drafts. This demand was opposed by smaller states which fear it could lead to countries opting out of legislation they object to. The paper also contains a plea for more responsibilities for the German Lander. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said this week that the Twelve should agree on new working procedures to apply subsidiarity, new criteria, and fresh examples of subsidiarity at work - either through scrapping old legislation or shelving new proposals. In fact, both the Commission and the Council have found it difficult to pinpoint examples which all EC members can agree on.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS OF SPA COMPLAIN OF PARKING TROUBLES  </P> <P> The Montebello Traffic and Safety Commission last week heard requests for  permit parking from residents who have complained that their streets and  driveways have been congested by patrons of the nearby Beverly-Wilcox Holiday  Spa Health Club.  </P> <P> The commissioners took no action, but will hold a public hearing Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Montebello residents who live on streets surrounding the Beverly-Wilcox  shopping center have been seeking relief from the city because they say the  peace of their neighborhood has been destroyed by the constant traffic of  health spa patrons who cannot find a place to park in the shopping center lot.  </P> <P> Earlier this month at a standing-room-only meeting, the City Council ordered  the spa to re-stripe its parking lot to create more parking spaces, but  residents and some other businesses in the center complained that too much  parking is needed, and re-striping will not solve the problem.  </P></p>

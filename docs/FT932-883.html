			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Russian tractor job eludes Harvard man THOUSANDS of shareholders in the Vladimir Tractor Plant, 200km east of Moscow, met in a football stadium this week to decide who should lead their newly-privatised company. The uneven competition, complete with posters, programmes and snacks, indeed had all the trappings of a football game. But despite being younger and better trained, Mr Iosif Bakaleinnik, a Russian graduate of Harvard Business School who controls 12 per cent of the shareholder votes, failed to take over as chief executive from Mr Anatoly Grishin, the old-style manager who has run the plant for 18 years. The 40-year-old challenger's convincing presentation of plans to improve incentives for workers, and to prepare the company for competition, failed to sway a majority of shareholders, who voted for the certainty represented by 60-year-old Mr Grishin. Pitted against Mr Bakaleinnik were not only fears of what one worker described as 'more revolutionary changes in our lives' but the vested interests like those of Tractorexport, the state organisation which exports the plant's tractors and controls 10 per cent of shareholders' votes through a proxy. Powerful propaganda before the meeting included a warning from the regional administration chief that 'a Harvard education does not train you to tackle the difficulties of the Russian economy'. Mr Bakaleinnik, who was the plant's finance director until he went to Harvard, did manage to secure a seat on the board of directors however and promised he would be back to fight for the top job. In the absence of of any experience of capitalism, many workers made their decision on the basis of parallels with Russian politics. Mr Bakaleinnik should not be trusted because, like President Boris Yeltsin, he made a lot of nice promises but would probably not keep them, said Mrs Nadezhda Baranova. But Mrs Galina Chernishova displayed the sort of stoic faith in the future that has helped account for much of Mr Yeltsin's popular support. 'Change is happening all over the world. Why shouldn't we have it at our company?' she said. 'Things won't improve for us but at least our children will live well.'</p>

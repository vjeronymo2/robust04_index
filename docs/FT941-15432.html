			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Markets in Asia fall as investors take profits Asia's equity markets suffered a sharp decline in trading yesterday, led by a 5.9 per cent plunge in Taiwan and a 5 per cent tumble in Hong Kong. Analysts said the turnround after the recent phenomenal rise in the region was due to selling by US and Japanese retail investors, with institutional funds remaining committed. They also pointed out that while the decline was broadly based, there was no common theme behind yesterday's falls as markets reacted to domestic news and developments. Taiwan's slide, for instance, was largely the result of dashed hopes of stronger links with mainland China. Hong Kong's fall marked a third consecutive day of selling. In subsequent London trading of Hong Kong shares, buyers returned, taking the indicative market index up by 2 per cent, and some brokers expect the market to bounce back today. Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok saw 3 per cent falls, while Singapore and Manila were both down by more than 2 per cent. Many of south-east Asia's markets surged last year, with much of the rise in the final quarter after US and Japanese banks and brokers, notably Morgan Stanley and Nomura, put out strong recommendations. Manila rose by almost 155 per cent, Hong Kong by over 115 per cent and Kuala Lumpur by 98 per cent. Analysts say this left the region vulnerable to investors who wanted to cash in profits, which was confirmed last week when some previously bullish strategists downgraded their views on the region's attractions. The result has been a cumulative 19.3 per cent slide in Kuala Lumpur since the start of this year, and falls of over 14 per cent in Hong Kong and Bangkok. World markets and currencies, Section II</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "EU Committee Said Yes to Sweden"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- The Foreign Affairs Committee of the  European Parliament yesterday voted to urge the European  Parliament to say yes to Swedish membership of the EU from 1  January 1995. The Committee also adopted resolutions covering  Norway, Finland, and Austria.    But the debate which preceded the decision was irritated and  confused and hardly provided any guarantees about how things  will go in the decisive parliamentary vote next week.    The Committee adopted its resolution on Sweden's membership  application with a vote of 15. Seven members voted against the  resolution and two members abstained.    A passage to the effect that the Foreign Affairs Committee  is  only voting for Sweden to be admitted to the EU at New Year 1995  "out of a general sense of political responsibility" was thrown  in at the last moment. Sweden receives a yes from the Committee  "despite the much discussed shortcomings in the EU's  institutional development and the procedural shortcomings  relating to informing the European Parliament about the  membership agreements," the resolution states.    And in the debate several members expressed their bitterness  that the Parliament has not been given any binding promises  about reform of EU bodies. Many EU members of Parliament have  demanded a stronger position for the Parliament and/or a  strengthening of the EU's supranational role as a condition for  voting yes to the enlargement of the EU -- an issue on which the  Parliament now has a right of veto -- but have had little  response to their demand.    "People have completely ignored the conditions the  Parliament  laid down," former French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson  complained.    Many members were also dissatisfied with the procedure for  the important vote, which will be held on 4 May, according to a  preliminary agenda. The European Parliament will only be able  to vote yes or no to approving the agreements with Sweden,  Norway, Finland, and Austria. Only the following day will there  be a debate and votes on Parliament's own resolutions which in  principle will then be meaningless.    The notion that the resolutions, which are adopted the day  after the main vote, can be seen as "explanations of voting  behavior" from the Parliament was an idea that received an  unfavorable reception from many Committee members.    And the uncertainty about what will happen in the Parliament  remains to the very end. Despite the fact that the vote on the  EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries' membership  agreements is now on the agenda there remain three opportunities  to remove it during next week's parliamentary session.</p>

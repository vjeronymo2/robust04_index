			<p>BFN     [Text] DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, who is now  staying in Ukraine, said yesterday that the DPRK would not give  in to any pressures, nor would the so-called Korean nuclear  issue be resolved by sanctions, thus denouncing the double  standard taken by the Western countries regarding the nuclear  issue.    Kim Yong-nam said that regarding the nuclear issue, the  Western countries, especially the United States, have conducted  an oppressive policy toward the DPRK -- which is regarded as the  country that does not obey them -- but instead conducted a  policy of overlooking the behaviors of other countries that are  regarded as their friends.    Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam also said that the DPRK is now  considering Russia's proposal to hold an international  conference attended by the United States, Russia, China, Japan,  ROK, and DPRK to resolve the Korean nuclear issue.    On the same day, U.S. President Clinton, who is visiting  European countries, expressed the hope that the DPRK would  change its view of the nuclear issue, and that it could avoid  economic sanctions by the international community by  reconsidering accepting the International Atomic Energy Agency's  inspections of the DPRK nuclear facilities.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weaker bonds unnerve bourses Bond market weakness troubled a number of bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT tried to ignore bunds as it majored in chemicals and banks, but in the end equities had to concede a small defeat. The Dax closed the session 15.1 higher at 2,124.04; this was actually 8.11 down from Monday's post bourse close; and yesterday's attempt at an after-hours rally failed, the Ibis-indicated Dax ending at 2,125.47 after an afternoon peak of 2,140.05. Turnover climbed from DM9.4bn to DM10bn. BASF rose DM5.70 to DM311 and Hoechst by DM6.90 to DM315.50, respectively gaining DM4.50 and DM2.50 more after hours. Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt said that dividend cuts of DM2 from both companies compared with consensus expectations of DM3, and that there were strong recovery hopes for the sector from the second half of this year. Banks lost some of their fervour in the late afternoon but Commerzbank still ended at DM357, after DM361, following a session gain of DM8 to DM355. Expectations, ahead of today's repo tender, were that the rate could come down into the 5.90 to 5.95 per cent bracket, after last week's fall from 6 to 5.97 per cent in the first variable bid tender for three months. PARIS drifted, waiting for the outcome of today's German repo tender. The CAC 40 index fell 3.46 to 2,216.43 and turnover rose slightly to FFr4.3bn. Suez rose FFr8.20, or 2.4 per cent to FFr349.70 although the companied denied rumours that its insurance subsidiary, Groupe Victoire, was about to be sold, this time to BAT Industries of the UK. In the retail sector, Carrefour climbed FFr75 to FFr4,145 after producing strong results following Monday's market close. Remy recovered FFr4 of Monday's losses to close at FFr238, following comment that Hong Kong's higher taxes on spirits and champagne were less damaging that had been assumed. AMSTERDAM saw sellers coming into the market but generally managed to keep at bay the persistent nerves triggered by a weakness in bonds. Most shares managed to cling on to the sharp gains they made on Monday. The AEX ended the day 1.85 points lower at 422.91. A significant amount of the action came from US traders, according to one broker. KLM took a knock from US selling and fell back 80 cents to Fl 49.70. Conversely, US dealers were keen on Philips and their buying edged up the stock 30 cents to Fl 52.90. Hunter Douglas, which enjoyed positive sentiment on Monday, fell back on vague forecasts although results that although were in line with expectations. Profit-taking weakened the shares further, and they slid Fl 3.10 to Fl 87.70. MILAN continued higher but the mood remained tentative ahead of the elections at the end of the month. The Comit index added 8.24 or 1.3 per cent to 609.23. Pirelli put in a strong performance but analysts said there was no news to account for a rise of L71, or 3.3 per cent to L2,241. Benetton added L899 or 3.5 per cent to L26,728. The banks saw profit-taking, Credito Italiano shedding L47 to L2,629 and BCI easing L36 to L6,266. Telecoms issues continued higher on hopes that the privatisation programme might be speeded: Sip rose L62 to L4,256 and Stet was L86 ahead at L4,756. MADRID followed the bond market lower, the general index easing 2.64 to 338.46 in turnover of Pta29bn. BCH fell Pta85 to Pta2,930 on Monday evening's news that Moody's was considering a debt ratings downgrade for the bank. WARSAW advanced 2 per cent to a record high amid continuing demand for local breweries in which German groups have taken stakes. The Wig index rose 299.6 to 20,760.3 although overall trading was described as subdued. ISTANBUL slid 3.9 per cent in thin trading with many investors unwilling to take fresh positions due to uncertainties over the outlook for the economy. The composite index fell 582.32 to 14,506.39, for a two-day loss of 7 per cent.

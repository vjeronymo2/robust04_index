			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN GIVES A BOOST TO SALOMON'S CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE FORMER PRESIDENT ENTERS A DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLD TO HELP RAISE  $40,000 FOR REP. ANTHONY BEILENSON'S OPPONENT. BUT THE ASSOCIATION MAY BE A  MIXED BLESSING.  </P> <P> The Westside and San Fernando Valley congressional district of Rep. Anthony C.  Beilenson is generally liberal, Jewish, and Democratic -- tough turf if you're  a Republican challenger.  </P> <P> But those political facts of life did not deter the district's most prominent  Republican, a fellow from Bel-Air named Ronald Reagan, from venturing back into  the political arena on behalf of GOP congressional candidate Jim Salomon.  </P> <P> At a private fund-raising reception Thursday in Century City, the former  President endorsed Salomon, a young Beverly Hills trade consultant who is  waging his second uphill battle against Beilenson, a seven-term Democratic  lawmaker.  </P> <P> The appearance of Reagan at a closed-door $1,000-per-person gathering in the  posh J.W. Marriott Hotel provided a $40,000 shot in the arm to the Salomon  campaign, which had been running at a deficit.  </P> <P> Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said the former chief executive spoke briefly of  "the importance of electing people like Jim Salomon to Congress" and hoped that  Salomon "becomes his congressman." The ex-President asked the select group of  contributors to continue their efforts on Salomon's behalf.  </P> <P> The exclusive event served notice that Reagan intends to play a role in the  contest. Salomon said Reagan also has offered to appear in his campaign  commercials on cable television.  </P> <P> But the association with Reagan could prove a mixed blessing for Salomon, who  has taken pains not to mention in campaign signs and billboards that he's a  Republican running in Democratic territory.  </P> <P> The numbers tell why: Beilenson crushed Salomon's first challenge in 1988 by a  2-1 margin. Voters in the 23rd Congressional District also supported Democrat  Michael Dukakis over George Bush in the 1988 presidential race. (They did,  however, abandon their traditional Democratic allegiance in the 1984 Reagan  landslide over Walter Mondale.)  </P> <P> Although Salomon denies it, insiders in both parties suggest that the  challenger's goal this year is to improve on his 1988 showing and build  recognition with an eye on 1992, when congressional districts will have been  redrawn to reflect the recent census.  </P> <P> The highly politicized redistricting process is not expected to benefit  Beilenson, whose independence has often irritated some of his influential  Democratic colleagues -- particularly Reps. Howard Berman of Panorama City and  Henry Waxman of Los Angeles, who are expected to play a leading role in drawing  the new district lines.  </P> <P> Under this scenario, some of the liberal Westside precincts that are  Beilenson's home base would be stripped away from his district, replaced by  more Republican and conservative precincts in the corners of the Valley.  </P> <P> But in 1990 it's still a Democratic district, and Salomon acknowledged in an  interview that he has to present his Republican support "very carefully -- so  it doesn't give some people the impression I'm a lock-step Republican."  </P> <P> In his campaign, Salomon has tried to portray himself as a new breed -- a  moderate on some social issues, including abortion rights, political reform and  environmental protection, and a conservative on others, such as crime and  drugs.  </P> <P> Beilenson's campaign consultant, Craig Miller, said Reagan's involvement raises  the question: "Who is Jim Salomon? Is he progressive and forward-thinking or  does he embrace the ultraconservative politics of Ronald Reagan?"  </P> <P> Salomon said he wants to be judged solely on the basis of his positions on  issues, not by political party labels. He said Reagan did not require a litmus  test on issues. And Salomon pointedly noted he supports a woman's right to an  abortion, which Reagan opposes.  </P> <P> Beilenson was on vacation in Maine and could not be reached for comment, but  Miller expressed confidence that Reagan will have no impact on the outcome of  the congressional race this November. "Ronald Reagan did not have long  coattails when he was in office and he will have no coattails out of office,"  Miller said.  </P> <P> While the impact of Reagan at the polls remains to be seen, the former  President's appearance clearly helped Salomon in one respect -- raising money.  </P> <P> Although he raised and spent far more than Beilenson in the past year and a  half, Salomon's campaign treasury was all but empty at the end of June.  </P> <P> The most recent campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission  show the 34-year-old candidate's campaign had just $5,754 in cash on hand and  had $20,061 in debts on June 30.  </P> <P> In the first half of this year, Salomon raised $69,844 and spent $147,683 on  campaign consultants, computer programs, telephone bills, fund-raising and  printing. He said the campaign has developed an extensive database of all  registered voters in the district and is operating phone banks to shore up  Republican support, before turning its attention to contacting independents and  Democrats.  </P> <P> "We have a tough 2 1/2 months ahead of us," Salomon said.  </P> <P> But he said Reagan's appearance will lend the campaign credibility by  suggesting to potential contributors that the race is viable despite the odds.  He noted that he has recruited nearly 300 campaign co-chairmen who have pledged  to assist in his fund raising. Salomon's largest campaign contribution, $4,950,  came from the National Rifle Assn. He also received $2,500 from Arco's  political action committee.  </P> <P> By contrast, Beilenson had $72,637 in the bank at the end of June. Faced with  Salomon's aggressive fund-raising efforts, the 57-year-old lawmaker last year  abandoned his usual practice of not raising campaign funds in non-election  years.  </P> <P> Beilenson collected $94,929 in 1989. His largest contributions last year came  from Walt Disney Co. President Frank G. Wells, who gave $2,000. The veteran  lawmaker is the only member of Congress from California who does not accept  contributions from political action committees.  </P> <P> In the first half of this year, Beilenson held no fund-raisers and received  just $3,235. However, a major fund-raising event is planned for early October  in Beverly Hills. Beilenson spent $9,283 in the first six months of the year.  </P> <P> Miller said Beilenson expects to be outspent, but argues that the lawmaker's  long record as a state assemblyman, senator and then as a congressman will  provide "durable support that money simply can't buy."  </P> <P> In a preview of the coming campaign, Miller said Beilenson will run on his  record of service and independent leadership. Like most challengers, Salomon  will argue the incumbent is out of touch with his constituents. Peace and  Freedom Party candidate John Honigsfeld will also be on the ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 23RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  </P> <P> Westside and San Fernando Valley district includes Malibu, Topanga, Pacific  Palisades, Brentwood, Westwood, Beverly Hills, Bel-Air, Century City, Palms,  Tarzana, Woodland Hills, Canoga Park, Reseda, and Encino.  </P> <P> VOTER REGISTRATION  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:2.22IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Party  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Registered  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Democrats  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 156,467  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 53.7%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Republicans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 105,043  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 36.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Independents  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 24,525  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Other (American Independent,  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Peace and Freedom, Liber-  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> tarian, miscellaneous)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,195  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 291,230  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> VOTING HISTORY  </P> <P> Congress, November, 1988  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Candidate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rep.

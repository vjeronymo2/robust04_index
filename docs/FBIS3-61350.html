			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Candidate of Legal Sciences A. Buteyko by an </F> unidentified URYADOVYY KURYER correspondent; place and date not  given: "Ukraine's Nuclear Ambitions. Do They Really Exist?"]    [Text]    [Correspondent] The world is widely commenting on the  well-known decision of the Ukrainian parliament concerning the  ratification of START I. Unfortunately, there also are  assertions that Ukraine, allegedly, has ended up in  international isolation and put itself in opposition to other  countries that follow the path of nuclear disarmament. What is  the situation as you see it?    [Buteyko] Yes, indeed, there are ill-wishers in various  countries, in particular in our neighbor to the northeast.  Actually, everything is by far not as unambiguous as some people  would like. At a meeting of the CSCE ministers of foreign  affairs Russia attempted to have a decision adopted that could  have indeed isolated Ukraine. However, they did not succeed at  doing that. Another attempt was made in Brussels, at a meeting  of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, with the same result.  This is why at present some Russian politicians, possibly being  guided by election-time motives, make statements leveling  accusations at Ukraine and point toward the international  community that supposedly also condemns the decision of our  parliament. However, there is, of course, no documentary proof  of such condemnation. On the contrary, the facts testify that,  although some states experience absolutely understandable  uneasiness, others view our position with understanding. The  world waited for a first step toward a genuine nuclear  disarmament, toward a genuine liberation of humanity from the  nuclear monster. Everyone wanted this to happen as soon as  possible, as the saying goes, the day before yesterday.    One does not have to be a prominent professional to  understand that disarmament is no simple matter. It necessitates  considerable expenditures, additional material resources,  technologies, and production capacity, i.e. precisely the  factors that are in very short supply in Ukraine to begin with.  This is why the decision of the parliament was justified  although, as far as I am concerned, somewhat different, more  acceptable wordings could have been found. However, the key  provisions of the decree of the Supreme Council are fully in the  national interest of Ukraine.    I will note that the nature and content of this particular  decision were also predetermined by the position of some  countries of the world. What do I mean? The issues of  guaranteeing our security, the issues of providing technical  assistance, of compensation for nuclear material placed in the  warheads have been repeatedly raised by Ukraine before the  states of the world. Of course, had we been accommodated,  executive power and the president himself would have had more  arguments in order for the members of the parliament to accept  different wordings.    [Correspondent] We would like to specify what the main  content of the accusations that some are now leveling against  Ukraine is.    [Buteyko] One of the main accusations is that we supposedly  violated obligations to destroy nuclear weapons before certain  deadlines in keeping with START I that we have assumed under  international law. However, in this instance our ill-wishers  count on people who are simply not knowledgeable about the area  of international law. Certain principles have long emerged in  relations between states according to which, as a rule,  obligations and rights are linked. If a state assumes certain  obligations to other parties, at the same time it also acquires  rights that safeguard its interests. The nature of the  obligations and the procedure for assuming them are regulated by  the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of International Treaties.  It clearly states that a state may assume obligations by way of  concluding agreements that take effect and, accordingly, become  legally binding documents after they are signed. However, an  agreement may envision another track--ratification, i.e. an act  of parliament. If we look at START I and the Lisbon Protocol, to  which our opponents refer, these documents provided specifically  for ratification. Therefore, obligations for Ukraine arise only  after the Supreme Council votes in favor of them and the  treaties take effect. For now, we may state that they have not  taken effect and Ukraine does not have--I will stress this--any  obligations under international law in this area.    [Correspondent] They refer to the well-known declaration of  the Supreme Council about Ukraine intending to acquire  nonnuclear status in the future and the Declaration on State  Sovereignty....    [Buteyko] Yes, it is so, but the documents mentioned were  unilateral acts of the state, and they may be classified as  those merely proclaiming the objective; by no means can they be  viewed as obligations of Ukraine under international law.  Besides, they contain no mention of definite deadlines, or  anything else.    [Correspondent] As is known, at a certain point, or more  precisely on 7 May 1991, Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk sent a  letter to U.S. President Bush in which he expressed the idea  about the obligation of Ukraine to destroy strategic offensive  nuclear weapons within seven years.    [Buteyko] Indeed, there was such a letter. However, I would  like to stress once again that this was a unilateral political  act on the part of Ukraine. Obligations of a political rather  than legal nature are at issue. For some reason, those who quote  this letter turn only to its first part, forgetting that it also  has a continuation. Specifically, the letter clearly says that  upon the ratification of START I Ukraine will honor its  obligation to destroy strategic nuclear weapons before the  deadlines envisioned by the treaty and, I stress, within the  context of the Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine.  In particular, the treaty envisions that it will have effect for  approximately one-third of the entire nuclear arsenal of the  former Soviet Union. Therefore, the Lisbon Protocol provides  that the four nuclear states--Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus--should conclude an agreement among themselves under  which they will divide this number of nuclear delivery vehicles  and warheads that are subject to destruction. However, Russia  has refused to do this, refused to even proceed to negotiate  this.    Supplements to the letter concerning the destruction of  nuclear weapons within the context of the Declaration on the  Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine should be interpreted under  international law in keeping with the norms that exist in the  already mentioned Vienna Convention. This means that we should  look at what even the political obligation assumed by the  president of Ukraine is about. The sense of it is that nuclear  weapons are located on the territory of Ukraine that were not  manufactured by us but were inherited by Ukraine. Ukraine will  destroy them by way of participating in START I whereas the  remainder of the nuclear weapons that are not covered by the  treaty will become the subject of negotiations with other  interested states. In addition, we should note that the  Declaration on the Nonnuclear Status of Ukraine envisions that  we will destroy these nuclear weapons in line with our  financial, technical, organizational, and legal potential, as  well as proceeding from the need to ensure ecological security.  The problem should be viewed in this very context: Are we  capable of destroying all nuclear weapons in two, three, or  seven years in our specific situation?    Therefore until START I takes effect, Ukraine has no  obligations under international law. All accusations, including  those found in the declaration of the Russian Government, are  completely groundless.    [Correspondent] There is a lot of talk about whether Ukraine  owns nuclear weapons. However, they reproach us, as does Russian  Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev, for Ukraine suddenly  wanting to become the owner of nuclear weapons.    [Buteyko] Empires have fallen apart many times in the  history  of civilization. Humanity has developed norms that regulate  issues associated with the emergence of new states on the rubble  of empires. This is what it is about. Two Vienna conventions  exist concerning the legal succession of states with regard to  treaties, and legal succession with regard to state property,  state debts, and archives. Specifically, they provide that in  the event of the emergence of a new state (or several states)  everything located in their territories becomes the property of  the new state or states. In keeping with these international  norms, the Ukrainian Supreme Council passed the well-known  decree as early as 12 September 1991 in which it was laid down  that all assets, including financial resources, of all  enterprises, offices, and organizations reporting to the Union  became the property of Ukraine. The same applies to strategic  nuclear weapons.    At the time, nobody objected to this. Over time, the thesis  about Ukraine as the owner of nuclear weapons was also confirmed  in other agreements signed and concluded within the framework of  the CIS. Even the agreement on creating the CIS said the states  will exercise joint control. Subsequently, an agreement between  Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, dated 21 December  1991, also said that the states assume such and such obligations  with regard to nuclear weapons.    How could Ukraine have assumed obligations with regard to an  object that was not its property? It is nonsensical. Therefore,  even then it was recognized that Ukraine is the owner of these  weapons.    Besides, there was another string of agreements, in  particular, two about the status of strategic offensive forces  within the framework of the CIS in which Ukraine also acts as  the owner of the components of nuclear weapons deployed in its  territory.    [Correspondent] Does it follow from this that Ukraine is a  nuclear state, or not?    [Buteyko] This is a quite complicated question. Usually,  they  talk about nuclear or nonnuclear states, that is, as if there  were no third. However, it is paradoxical that in the case of  Ukraine this dilemma does not exhaust the entirety of factors.  In the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty itself, there is an  indirect definition of a nuclear state and a state that does not  posses nuclear weapons. Nobody envisioned in this treaty that  states might appear which would inherit nuclear weapons, as  happened in our case. Ukraine has not produced or tested a  nuclear device, it has no technology for producing nuclear  weapons, it does not even control the weapons because the  nuclear button is located in Moscow. Therefore, it so happens  that Ukraine is an owner of nuclear weapons but is not a nuclear  state in the full sense of this term. This is a unique situation  that is not envisioned by existing international agreements.    In view of this, Ukraine should manage the weapons as  material valuables. We are accused because of the Supreme  Council failing to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  However, if this were to happen now, in this situation, when  Russia did not go for an agreement on compensation for tactical  nuclear weapons that had been removed previously, it would turn  out that Ukraine is forsaking its right to compensation for  fissionable materials that are placed in the warheads. It would  have to give the weapons to Russia unconditionally. Can we  really agree to this? We have already had the case of tactical  nuclear weapons; we have already had an agreement on the  division of the property of the former Union abroad. We got  zilch by virtue of that. However, the goal of achieving the  nonnuclear status of Ukraine exists, nobody has canceled it; I  am convinced that a relevant decision of the Supreme Council  will be approved.    [Correspondent] The idea is widespread that nuclear weapons  in Ukraine threaten us with a new Chernobyl, and that we are not  capable of ensuring proper oversight of nuclear warheads.  Therefore, the sooner we give them to Russia the better it is  for us.    [Buteyko] The safety of nuclear charges should be ensured by  the producer--Russia. We had an agreement on warranty inspection  and servicing of nuclear missile complexes by the manufacturer  last year, which was also confirmed during negotiations between  the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. These agreements should be  complied with. I am convinced that both parties will be wise  enough to honor their obligations. If this were suddenly not to  happen, we should know that danger would loom not just for  Ukraine. In this case, such a situation could be the subject of  consideration by the UN Security Council. Negotiations are now  underway both with the United States and Russia concerning  security guarantees, financial and technical assistance, and  compensation. I believe that we will manage to come to  agreements that will be acceptable to Ukraine and other states.    Ukraine is a peace-loving state; it does not threaten  anybody, and this is understood in the world. In particular, our  neighbors the Poles stated during a meeting of the Consultative  Committee of the Presidents of Ukraine and Poland that they  perceive with understanding the position of Ukraine and the  decision of the parliament as the first step along the path  toward achieving the nonnuclear status.    In turn, we understand the uneasiness of some states because  of this problem. A recent conversation between L. Kravchuk and  U.S. President Clinton touched on exactly the readiness to find  mutually acceptable solutions.    I think that the development of events will follow this very  path.</p>

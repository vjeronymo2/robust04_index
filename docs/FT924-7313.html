			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us up 15% in third-quarter TOYS 'R' Us, the large US-based speciality retailer, reported a 15 per cent improvement in third-quarter profits, to Dollars 57.9m. The advance came on sales up from Dollars 1.18bn to Dollars 1.34bn, and translated into earnings per share of 12 cents, compared with 11 cents in the same period of 1991. The retailer, which plans to have 540 toy stores operating in the US by year-end and another 167 overseas, said that comparable store sales only increased 'marginally' in the quarter, although on a nine-month basis they were up by 3.6 per cent. The group said it planned to add another 90-95 new stores next year, both in the US and overseas - including the first outlets in the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Switzerland. Toys 'R' Us has now reported after-tax profits of Dollars 97.8m for the first nine months of the year, compared with Dollars 77.9m a year earlier. Sales in this period advanced from Dollars 3.26bn to Dollars 3.77bn. Tiffany, the upmarket jeweller, reported after-tax profits of just Dollars 56,000 for the three months to end-October, compared with Dollars 8.06m in the same period of 1991. Sales slipped from Dollars 126.4m to Dollars 106.9m. The US retailer , however, blamed reduced shipments to the Mitsukoshi department stores in Japan. These act as Tiffany's principal distributor in the Japanese market, and the cut in shipments was designed to allow the Japanese to adjust stock levels.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Wimpey It speaks volumes for the bleak outlook in the building sectors that even after halving its interim dividend yesterday Wimpey shares were trading on a 10 per cent yield. Investors are not sure whether the lower level of payout can be sustained, and who can argue with them? Tarmac, for one, must be all too painfully aware that a single cut in the current recession may not be enough. To some extent Wimpey has only itself to blame for the market's disenchantment. The company was not alone in raising expectations earlier this year, but a less than informative presentation at the half way stage is hardly calculated to placate shareholders who have lost 50 per cent of their investment in the last six months. Nor does it do to over-sell the strategy. Wimpey has rightly been given credit for pursuing a survival plan without recourse to a rights issue. But interim gearing - 23 per cent post the Pounds 110m Little Britain property proceeds - will be nearer 30 per cent by the year end. It will almost certainly continue to rise in 1993 even if the company completes its Pounds 100m disposal programme and achieves its target of being cash neutral. The bigger worry, though, is where the earnings impetus will come from. Wimpey is surely right to dispose of the sort of low yielding assets which were so fashionable in the 1980s, but its remaining businesses will continue to feel the chill for some time. Further provisions look inevitable in housing, contracting margins will be wafer thin however choosy the company be-comes, and pricing pressure in minerals can only intensify. Wimpey will be a survivor, but hardly an exciting one.</p>

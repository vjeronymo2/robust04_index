			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Eli Altamirano, coordinator of the National  Opposition Union [UNO] Political Council, has confirmed that  three other parties were expelled from this coalition. The three  parties expelled from the anti-Sandinist coalition are: the  Christian Democratic Union [UDC], the Nicaraguan Democratic  Movement [MDN], and the Conservative Popular Alliance [APC]  headed by Miriam Arguello Morales. The reason the UDC, APC,  and MDN were kicked out of the UNO ranks was that they refused  to sign a statement, which was signed by the other UNO parties,  demanding a national constituent assembly. Radio Nicaragua has  been unable to contact the leaders of the expelled parties in  order to get their reaction.</p>

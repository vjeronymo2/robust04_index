			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying and positive data lift Dow Wall Street PROGRAM buying contributed to a strong rally on Wall Street yesterday as investors respon-ded to positive economic reports and equities continued to recover from their recent losses, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 38.75 higher at 3,514.42, after breaking through the 3,500 level at noon. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 5.81 to 448.64 and the Nasdaq composite rose 3.92 to 702.71. New York SE volume reached 284m shares, while rises led falls by 1,283 to 715. Investors took heart after weekly unemployment claims showed a sharper than expected fall. The market was also encouraged by improved same-store sales for June from a number of large US retailers. Woolworth, however, dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 after warning investors that it would post disappointing second-quarter earnings. The retailer reported a slight decline in domestic same-store sales for June. Sears climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 58 after unveiling a strong improvement in comparable store sales for June. Wal-Mart moved forward Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 1/2 and JC Penney appreciated Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 . Nike rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 in active trading after the athletic shoe and apparel maker predicted single-digit growth for the current fiscal year. The company also authorised a stock buyback plan of up to Dollars 450m in class 'B' common stock. Reebok, Nike's main rival, put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 28 1/8 , while LA Gear firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 1/2 . Walt Disney was finally up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 38 3/4 after losing ground in the morning following a delayed opening as the company's Euro Disney operations posted disappointing earnings. Newmont Mining lost Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 , after falling Dollars 3 3/8 a day earlier. Late on Wednesday a secondary offering of 9.65m common shares in the company was priced at Dollars 54 3/4 a share through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. In the technology sector, IBM held steady at Dollars 46 5/8 and Hewlett-Packard advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 78 3/4 , but Digital Equipment edged Dollars  3/4 lower to Dollars 38 1/2 . Airline issues rallied after Wednesday's weakness, with AMR, parent of American Airlines, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 61 7/8 and Delta Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 7/8 , but UAL eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 124 1/4 . In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 7/8 and Intel climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 . Canada TORONTO posted its largest one-day loss for about 33 months, led by steep declines in gold and energy stocks. The TSE 300 index dropped 51.9 to close at 3,920.9. Declines outnumbered advances by 542 to 238 after volume of 70m shares valued at CDollars 795.9m. The gold shares index fell 5.2 per cent and the energy group lost 2.97 per cent as 12 of the 14 sub-groups lost ground. The transportation group shed 4.8 per cent, largely due to a decline in Laidlaw 'B' shares of CDollars 5/8 to CDollars 9 1/4 . The company posted a third-quarter loss, against year-ago net earnings, and sharply lower nine-month net, although the latest periods included a heavy charge.</p>

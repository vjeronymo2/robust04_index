			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Europeans seek role in Japan aircraft European aerospace companies yesterday called on Japan to include them in its latest attempt to fulfil a long-frustrated ambition of creating a world class Japanese civil aircraft industry. A committee of the European Business Community, Europe's main business lobby in Japan, voiced dismay at the inclusion of Boeing as the sole western aerospace group in an important government-backed development project for a short range passenger aircraft, code-named YSX. China is also taking part. The 70-80 seat carrier, due to come into service at the turn of this decade, is 'the essence' of Japanese civil aerospace policy, according to Mr Toshifumi Hirai, director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's aircraft and ordnance division. As such, it is of vital interest to foreign suppliers. Miti officials stressed that the inclusion of Boeing in the initial research for the YSX did not mean European suppliers would be excluded. However, the EBC's aeronautics and space committee was unconvinced and warned that the exclusion of European suppliers would 'further contribute to the imbalance between the US and Europe in Japanese aerospace collaboration'. Japan was depriving itself of the 'longstanding experience of European manufacturers in the regional market', it said. ATR, the Franco-Italian regional airliner-making joint venture, and Saab-Scania of Sweden are among the groups angling for a stake in the project. Until last year, Miti was hoping to develop a medium range 150-seater aircraft, the YXX, with Boeing. But the ministry had to freeze the YXX after Boeing went for the cheaper option of updating an existing aircraft series. Japan was unable to continue alone, a frustrating reminder of its dependence on US aerospace technology.</p>

GERMAN PLAYERS  </P> <P> West German players wilted in their World Cup quarterfinal against  Czechoslovakia because they had been eating too much meat and not enough  carbohydrate-rich pasta, according to team doctor Franz Liesen.  </P> <P> "This was the result of completely wrong nutrition," he said.  </P> <P> "The players have eaten too much meat and not enough pasta. The lack of  carbohydrates caused a crisis in the second half."  </P> <P> Liesen said he had to give an injection of vitamins to each player after the  match to "reestablish the necessary equilibrium in their bodies."  </P> <P> West German team chief Franz Beckenbauer acknowledged the players had been  tired during the quarterfinal but blamed it on the torrid afternoon heat.  </P> <P> Pasta, Italy's national dish, is recommended by sports doctors for building  stamina. Marathon runners sometimes use a concentrated diet of pasta or rice  for "carbohydrate loading" before competition.  </P></p>

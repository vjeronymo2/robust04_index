			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by </F> unidentified KEYHAN correspondent--date and place not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] Do you consider it  possible that the Lebanese Government will sign a compromising  accord with Israel?    [Fadlallah] Lebanon's stance regarding the compromise is  closely linked to that of Syria, and therefore, Lebanon will not  sign anything before Syria does. This is because there is an  agreement between Syria and Lebanon on the basis of which the  Lebanese Government will not sign any accord with Israel unless  it has been previously agreed to by Syria.    [KEYHAN] What steps will the Lebanese Islamic Movement,  especially Hizballah, take against the signing of a compromising  accord by Syria or Lebanon?    [Fadlallah] It is obvious that in such circumstances, the  Islamic Movement will be forced to appraise the situation in a  precise and perceptive manner. This is because in that case, it  will have to reappraise and assess the situation from its own  vantage point and stance and to view the outcome and  repercussions of such a step on the Islamic Movement. Of  course, this will be affected by changing circumstances and  certain exigencies.    However, it is natural that we will not endorse any accord  between Israel and Arab countries. Even if such an accord takes  place, we will continue our opposition but the tactics and means  of combatting such an accord or the fallout of this opposition  or its expression will all depend on the conditions and  exigencies that arise, and the Islamists will appraise them with  regard to the interests of Islam in general. This is exactly  the same as the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran which  has repeatedly expressed its overt opposition to the official  recognition of Israel and has even stressed that it will not  directly deal with those who have compromised. [passage omitted]    [KEYHAN] At present, the strategy of the White House is to  eliminate the Islamic Movement in the Middle East and from the  countries contiguous to the Zionist regime. It appears that the  compromising accord between the Zionist regime and the PLO can  be considered a step in this direction. What is the modus  operandi envisaged by the Islamic Movement in combatting such a  strategy?    [Fadlallah] In my opinion, the United States cannot  eliminate the Islamic Movement from the region, as the White  House does not have the necessary means to do so. We observe  that the U.S. foreign policy has encountered many obstructions  and complexities in numerous countries in such a manner that it  has been unable to implement its policies there. We do not  consider the United States to be very versatile in the region.  This is because the nations still have freedom of action to the  extent that if they cannot defeat the policies of the White  House, they can at least disrupt them.    In addition, I do not believe that the United States has  envisaged the elimination of the Islamic Movement in its current  calculations. Instead, it appears that the United States is  moving along two lines. The first line is to approach the  Islamic Movement and to explore possibilities of establishing  contact with it. This is evident from the current efforts being  made to establish relations with the Egyptian Islamic movement.  The second line involves U.S. efforts to undermine the Islamic  Movement for its ultimate disarmament and embargo.    This is because the United States is not able to eliminate  the Islamic Movement which has such deep roots among the Islamic  masses. I believe that the Islamists will gain more popular  support as a result of the U.S. pressure and thus the White  House's pressure will not be able to undermine the Islamic  Movement.    [KEYHAN] The people of southern Lebanon are still being  subjected to daily attacks by the Zionists. In the event of an  accord between the Zionists and Lebanon what will be the fate of  southern Lebanon?    [Fadlallah] [passage omitted] Obviously, southern Lebanon is  suffering from daily savage attacks on southern Lebanon and this  is why the Islamic Resistance Movement came into being, that is,  in order to prove a firm impediment to the domination of the  Zionists on southern Lebanon. If this Resistance Movement had  not been active in southern Lebanon, the Zionists would have  occupied all of southern Lebanon by various means. [passage  omitted]    We, in the Arab world, and in the Islamic Republic of Iran,  should be very vigilant [passage omitted] because once the  Arab-Zionist compromise takes effect, then precise planning for  exerting pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran from the  economic and security point of view will be carried out. The  Arabs may be incited through various means to impose an embargo  on Iran. In this regard, the American lackeys, especially the  countries in Iran's neighborhood, will be enlisted to put more  pressure on Iran.    [KEYHAN] Recently, Turkey announced that it is willing to  cooperate with Israel in order to combat terrorism.    [Fadlallah] Of course, by terrorism they mean the liberation  movements in the area. [passage omitted]    [KEYHAN] What is your message to the Iranian nation?    [Fadlallah] My message to the Muslim Iranian nation on the  15th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution is that Imam Khomeyni  -- may God be pleased with him -- was able to deal a blow to the  powers of world arrogance with the support and the steadfastness  of your nation. When the Iranian nation stood alongside the  imam the Islamic world and the oppressed of the world stood by  you and the imam. I believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran  is a divine trust for the Muslim people of Iran. I hope that  God Almighty bestows this bounty on us as well. [passage  omitted]    I consider His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i to be a  personality endowed with immense acumen and exceptional  qualities that are necessary for Islamic leadership. He has  immense knowledge of the international issues, especially of the  Islamic world which he studies and follows intensively and  continually.    I believe that the Muslim nation of Iran and the other  Muslim  nations who follow him provide that strength which is necessary  for such leadership and for combatting the plots and designs of  the infidels and the powers of world arrogance.

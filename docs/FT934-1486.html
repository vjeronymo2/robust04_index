			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Irish bank sells DCC stake Bank of Ireland, the principal shareholder in DCC, the private Dublin-based industrial holding company, has sold its 20 per cent stake of 2.7m shares in the company at IPounds 10 (950p) per share to leading fund managers in the UK and Ireland, prior to next year's planned flotation of the company. DCC began as a venture capital company in 1984, with funding from the Bank of Ireland and other leading Irish institutions. Mr Pat Molloy, Bank of Ireland's group chief executive, said: 'Following DCC's evolution into an industrial holding company, it is no longer appropriate for Bank of Ireland, as a commercial banking group, to retain a shareholding in DCC.' The sale of Bank of Ireland's stake values the total 13.6m DCC shares in issue at IPounds 136m. Last month DCC reported a 59 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 8.31m for the six months to September 30 and announced its first interim dividend of 5.52p. The company said it planned a public flotation next year in May-June or September-October 'depending on market conditions'. DCC is 95 per cent owned by institutional investors. Mr Jim Flavin, chief executive, thanked Bank of Ireland for being 'a strong, supportive shareholder since 1984' and said 'we are pleased to welcome the significant new investors in DCC'. These include PDFM, Gartmore Investment and Mercury Asset Management in the UK and IBI nominees and AIB Capital Markets in Ireland.</p>

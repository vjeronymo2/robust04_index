			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: France urges closer ties for Renault, Volvo THE FRENCH government has given a political push to the growing co-operation between Renault, the state-owned car maker, and Volvo, its Swedish partner. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry minister, has called on the pair to go further in their partnership, which began two years ago with an exchange of minority equity stakes. Since then, the pair has pooled the purchasing of some components, share research and development and co-operate in quality control. Mr Strauss-Kahn said more synergies could be explored and asked Renault and Volvo to 'clarify' their relationship by the end of the year. His remarks will be welcomed by the partners, who have been exploring a merger as one of several options for further co-operation, though they have yet to present precise plans to the French government. Paris has until recently been cautious over considering a Renault-Volvo merger because it would have to table a bill in parliament if Volvo wanted to buy more than 25 per cent of the French car maker. The Swedish group currently owns 20 per cent of Renault and has an option to buy another 5 per cent, while Renault holds an 8.2 per cent stake in Volvo's parent group. The government has been unwilling to present what could be a controversial merger plan, given Renault's importance as a historic symbol of French industrial policy, in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum. However, a politically opportune moment could arise if there is a calm period after the Maastricht vote and before the start of campaigning for next March's French legislative elections. Renault is in a strong financial position as it reaps the benefits of several years of cost-cutting measures and a good performance in export markets. However, loss-making Volvo could find it hard, for the moment, to afford the cost of buying more shares in Renault.</p>

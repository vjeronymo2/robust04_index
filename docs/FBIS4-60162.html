			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M. Paydar: "The Karabakh Crisis and the Need </F> for Vigilance"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The role of the Islamic  Republic of Iran in the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis is wrapped in  ambiguity. Iran, which has always been involved in the Karabakh  crisis and has exerted many efforts to find a solution to the  war, has unfortunately remained silent on the outcome of the  Bishkek conference and on the possible dispatch of military  forces to the region. Unfortunately none of the sides--the  Russians, the Azeris, and the Armenians--were ready to grant  Tehran a role in the recent talks and they treated Iran more  marginally than was apparent.    At any rate, a country should know its own limits and how it  can influence those around it. It is not logical for our  country's political cadre and Foreign Ministry officials to be  satisfied merely with some remarks by an Azeri or Armenian  official on the importance of Iran's role in the region while  being excluded from the scene with no hurt feelings. A new  situation is in the making in the Caucasus region, and the  geopolitical situation of the region will soon undergo more  changes. Our diplomats' silence will not solve any problems.  What is the use of assessing a situation after it is over?  This call for vigilance is being issued today. We hope that  the nation's officials will be more responsible in dealing with  press reaction on political issues.</p>

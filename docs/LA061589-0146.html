			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETIC COMMISSION OFFICIAL FIRED; ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED GIFTS  </P> <P> Marty Denkin, the state boxing official under fire since being accused in  January of accepting unauthorized gifts, was fired Wednesday.  </P> <P> Denkin's dismissal was announced by Michael A. Kelley, director of the  California Department of Consumer Affairs, in Sacramento. Kelley cited a  departmental investigation which, he said, revealed Denkin accepted jewelry and  cash from boxing managers and promoters in exchange for approval of bouts.  </P> <P> Denkin, 54, was the California Athletic Commission's assistant executive  officer and ran the commission's Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> His difficulties first arose last January when the San Jose Mercury News  reported that three unidentified managers had accused Denkin of accepting more  than $10,000 in cash and jewelry in exchange for favors for their boxers.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said at the time that Denkin  was the subject of an investigation. However, no charges were filed by the  office.  </P> <P> Then, last February, it was learned by The Times that Denkin and Ken Gray,  Athletic Commission executive officer, had issued a manager's license to Harold  Rossfields Smith. A decade ago, Smith was convicted of embezzling $21.3 million  from Wells Fargo Bank. Smith served nearly six years of a 10-year prison term  before being paroled.  </P> <P> Normally, commission members said, applications from individuals who have been  convicted of felonies are submitted to the eight-member commission and  considered at public meetings. Denkin, Kelley said, has 20 days to appeal his  dismissal.  </P></p>

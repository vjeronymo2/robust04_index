			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Court halts Manila's VAT plans The Philippine government has suffered a new hitch in its bid to launch an expanded value-added tax (VAT) system, a significant component of its economic programme. The Supreme Court told the government yesterday to refrain from implementing the tax scheme, because a restraining order issued last June still applied. The court injunction was issued after the filing of several cases separately by groups opposing the expanded VAT because they argued it was 'unconstitutional' and would lead to sharp price increases. VAT, originally introduced in the Philippines in 1988, is being expanded under a new law to cover more economic sectors in order to bolster the government's revenue base. The government won a favourable ruling on the petitions, but the court said this did not lift the injunction, which was separately issued. After that ruling, the government announced it would start collecting the new tax from October 1. The opposing groups have appealed for a reconsideration of the August court ruling, and the court said that since the case 'remained pending', the temporary injunction would continue to be in force. The government had hoped that the expanded VAT system would increase revenue collections by about 8bn pesos (Pounds 195m) a year, helping keep its budget deficit to 2.2 per cent of GNP this year under its economic programme that gained International Monetary Fund support only last June.</p>

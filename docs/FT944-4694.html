			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Improved efficiency helps Stagecoach advance 64% Stagecoach Holdings, the UK's largest bus group, yesterday announced a 64 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, with its continuing operations showing a dramatic improvement in operating efficiency. The profits, which rose from Pounds 8.86m to Pounds 14.5m in the six months to October 15, were better than expected. The share price jumped 12p to 227p. Stagecoach has been expanding aggressively through acquisitions, and boosting the performance of new subsidiaries through bulk buying of buses and components, and streamlining management. However, during the period, UK operating profits on continuing businesses, excluding acquisitions, came to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 8.6m) giving operating margins up from 14.8 per cent to 18.9 per cent. Acquisitions since April 1993 added a further Pounds 5.44m, while there was a Pounds 2.77m profit from the overseas operations in Africa, New Zealand and Hong Kong. Stagecoach is faced with a UK bus market which is shrinking, due to increasing car usage, but the group achieved revenue growth from continuing operations, and total turnover rose from Pounds 81m to Pounds 126.3m. The company took Pounds 1.57m of redundancy costs in the first half, and reorganisation costs are expected to come to about Pounds 3m for the full year. Stagecoach has so far added about Pounds 158m of annual turnover through acquisitions this year. During the first half it spent about Pounds 73m in bus companies and Pounds 26m on new vehicles. Net debt amounted to Pounds 112m, representing gearing of 157 per cent. Interest costs rose from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 2.63m, but were covered 6.5 times, and the company said it would be comfortable with gearing below 175 per cent. The dividend is raised by 10 per cent from 1.5p to 1.65p, against a 66 per cent increase in earnings per share to 7.3p (4.4p), reflecting rising capital expenditure on fleet and acquisitions. COMMENT The party is almost over for bus operators, as the pace of consolidation within the industry starts to slow, and managements have to focus on squeezing organic growth from a declining market. Stagecoach has always stated that it could substantially improve operating efficiency, and the latest results support its claims. Flexible pricing, and a creative approach to new routes and bus types, are already paying off. This year's figures will benefit from a full contribution from recent London acquisitions, and pre-tax profits should rise to Pounds 31m, representing a p/e of 14.6. The following year sees the full benefit of recent acquisitions. The shares are at a premium to both stock market and sector, but the management has done everything to deserve it, and the shares should continue to out-perform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov, on an official visit to Poland, met Monday  with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to sign economic  agreements on the protection and support for investments and on  avoiding double taxation. According to Olechowski the delayed  signing of the documents testifies to poor economic relations  between the two countries.    The ministers also discussed international issues. Stanislav  Daskalov also met with President Lech Walesa to discuss  cooperation between the two countries.    "For many years we used to be in one political and economic  camp so certain ties and cooperation were established. Now,  when we are reforming our countries, I think that we should  return to some questions," the president told the Bulgarian  guest.    According to Walesa, Poland and Bulgaria should make joint  efforts to create the vision of the new Europe.    Daskalov said that Poland and Bulgaria have common  goals--the  integration with the European communities. He also conveyed the  invitation of President Zelyu Zelev for Lech Walesa to visit  Bulgaria.    The Bulgarian guest and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  discussed problems connected with the development of  Polish-Bulgarian economic and trade contacts, including the  liquidation of trade barriers and the establishing of free trade  zones. The two sides stressed that efforts to integrate with  Europe should not replace bilateral agreements.    Pawlak stressed that the boosting of economic cooperation  between Poland and Bulgaria would allow to overcome obstacles  which had existed in contacts between the two countries in the  past.    Minister Daskalov stressed that Bulgaria will continue to  repay its debt to Poland with deliveries of goods. He added  that there are chances for the debt being settled later this  year. "Our economies are complementary," said Daskalov.    The prime minister and the visiting Bulgarian foreign  minister also touched upon the questions of Macedonia and the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia.    In another development, Daskalov met with under-secretary of  state at the ministry for foreign economic relations Maciej  Lesny to discuss the opportunities to boost economic cooperation  between the two countries.    Later in the day, Minister Daskalov met with deputy Senate  speaker Zofia Kuratowska to touch upon the questions of European  integration and adjusting Polish and Bulgarian legislations to  the European Union standards.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Employer policies on race probed THE COMMISSION for Racial Equality is to launch a formal investigation into the employment practices of the 400 largest private-sector employers in Britain. The exercise, the largest of its kind conducted by the commission, is intended to collect information about how far companies are following government guidelines on the appointment and promotion of ethnic-minority employees. The commission says it will not attempt to 'catch employers out' during the investigation. The commission may, however, use the results to press for legislation to be strengthened and the 10-year-old Race Relations Code of Practice, which accompanies the 1976 Race Relations Act, to be updated. A pilot questionnaire has been sent to 18 volunteer companies, including Kingfisher, Boots and National Westminster Bank. The full survey of remaining companies, each with a minimum of 7,000 employees, is likely to go out in July, with publication of the findings early next year. Ms Mary Coussey, the commission's employment director, said that informal contacts 'tend to suggest there's a minority of 'good' employers who have done a fair bit, but their number hasn't grown very much in recent years'. Last year the Department of Employment issued a 10-point plan for employers on how to implement equal opportunities, including race equality policies and practices. The plan recommends companies should develop an equal opportunities policy, set an action plan, provide training for all, and monitor progress in achieving objectives. Mr Tony Ward, Kingfisher's director of human resources and a senior CRE commissioner, said he thought the investigation would show that most companies had equal opportunity policies on race but they were 'not necessarily measuring how effective they were'.</p>

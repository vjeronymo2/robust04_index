			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil </F> Sha'th, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio, on 1 April;  from the "With The Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Now that the agreement  on the security arrangements in Hebron has been signed in Cairo,  when will this agreement be implemented?    [Sha'th] As soon as possible. Fifteen minutes after the  signing I was at the Norwegian Embassy [in Cairo] with the  official request signed by us and the Israeli Government. I  submitted the request to Mr. Larsen, adviser to the Norwegian  foreign minister and head of the coordination office of the  donating states, to prepare for the arrival of 160 observers  from Norway, Denmark, and Italy as soon as possible. I believe  Mr. Larsen will go to Hebron in the next few days. Also, the  chief of the Norwegian international observers will arrive in  Cairo on Sunday [3 April].    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Does this agreement mirror the  provisions of Security Council Resolution 904?    [Sha'th] At least one of the two major paragraphs of the  resolution is on international protection and the temporary  international presence in Hebron. We reached this in accordance  with Resolution 904. Very soon, 160 observers will be in Hebron  to give its people a feeling of security. They will be present  everywhere. They will have an open-door headquarters for the  citizens of Hebron. I believe this will create a feeling of  security. Israel took some measures and will take other  measures to provide security and protection and to prevent  settlers' violence in the city of Hebron. I believe we are  seeking the implementation of the Security Council resolution,  knowing that this resolution [as heard] was based on Security  Council Resolution 904.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the Palestinian side conceded its  initial demand to send Palestinian police to Hebron. Why?    [Sha'th] The Security Council resolution, in fact, does not  call for dispatching Palestinian police to Hebron. There was an  idea to send Palestinian police to Hebron, and Israel agreed to  this idea. However, we could not reach an agreement on the  number, arms, and conditions, in accordance with which the entry  of this Palestinian police force woyld help achieve the security  of the Palestinians in Hebron. If we cannot achieve this, their  presence will add nothing to this protection, but could create  problems, particularly in the absence of a real participation in  the political authority that will supervise the security power.  Therefore, following lengthy discussion and despite Israel's  agreement to 130 Palestinian police, we decided to double the  international observers in this stage and to postpone the entry  of Palestinian police until after [the implementation] of the  Gaza-Jericho accord when the Palestinian police are deployed  throughout all West Bank cities and when the Israeli forces are  redeployed outside the Palestinians cities, villages, and camps  in the West Bank.    [Mu'addi] Has an agreement been reached in Cairo on the  return of longtime deportees?    [Sha'th] Yes. A group of deportees will return very soon.  And the Palestinian police will enter Gaza and Jericho very  soon. I believe that this police will begin to enter during the  next week to receive military headquarters and garrisons and to  take over police stations in Khan Yunus, Gaza, and Jericho...    [Mu'addi, interrupting] When will economic talks be resumed  and what are the next steps in the coming week?    [Sha'th] I believe the talks will take place next week,  together with the return of the Gaza-Jericho talks in all their  security and civilian committees. This is in addition to the  release of prisoners. Furthermore, the legal committee and the  standing drafting committee will be formed. All these  committees will work intensively during the coming two weeks in  an attempt to reach a comprehensive agreement on issues related  to Gaza-Jericho as soon as possible. This is what we did during  the past two weeks, particularly during the past three weeks as  we worked from 9 o'clock until 2 or 3 after midnight.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   More Transparent Intelligence System -- Johannesburg THE  STAR  in English on 29 June in a page-18 editorial finds that "sadly"  the country does need the 400 million rand budgeted for the  National Intelligence Service (NIS). NIS Chief Mike Louw makes  a case for this budget: "Violent endeavour on the political  fringes, while happily dormant, is by no means buried.  America's spy system is closing 13 missions in Africa, perhaps  to consolidate their efforts from a single SA base. Organised  crime is both growing and is overlapping with the political  arena. Clandestine combat in the economic and technological  fields is overtaking the old simple James Bond issues."  Furthermore, "From what little we know of disruptive intentions  on and around April 27, it seems that without the intelligence  community we may today have been embroiled in something close to  a civil war rather than basking in the joyous birth of a new  nation." However, "what we can demand is an intelligently  transparent intelligence system. Towards that, we make an  unexpected start with Louw's testimony. A new parliamentary  committee on intelligence will soon take it further. We trust  that equivalent information will come to light regarding the ANC  and former homeland services that are now part of the expanded  NIS."    Kasrils Appointment Undesirable -- A second editorial on the  same page believes Ronnie Kasrils' appointment as deputy defense  minister "is neither necessary nor desirable." The paper points  to the "irresponsible role he played in the events leading up to  the Bisho massacre of September 1992. Moreover, the key police  ministry is already under the control of a communist, Sidney  Mufamadi. The appointment of another, Kasrils, as the number  two man at Defence could perturb a good few people at home and  abroad who still remember old-style communist security  machinations."  <H5>  BUSINESS DAY </H5>   Secret Services Accountable to Parliament -- "One of the  more  challenging tasks for the new South African administration is to  establish a network of spies which behaves decently and does not  impinge on the rights of law-abiding citizens," begins  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 June in a page-6  editorial. "At the head of the network would probably be  someone like National Intelligence Services director-general  Mike Louw, who had the unusual experience this week of appearing  before a public hearing to explain why his service should be  given a budget of more than R400m [rand]." BUSINESS DAY  believes governments cannot get by without intelligence  services, however, "the important thing is that secret services  should be accountable to Parliament rather than to the executive  of government, which would soon be tempted to get involved in  the intrigue, and start justifying secret funds and all the  excesses that go with them."</p>

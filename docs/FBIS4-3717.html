			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  and its entire people including compatriots of the Tibetan  nationality are firmly opposed to any attempts to use the  so-called Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal affairs.    These attempts will never be realized, said a spokesman for  the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National People's  Congress (NPC) here today while commenting on a report related  to the relations between Britain and China before and after  1997, issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British  House of Commons on April 13.    The spokesman said the report advocated self-determination  of  Tibet in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs.    It is known to all that since ancient times, he noted, Tibet  has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory.    Before 1959, he said, a system of feudal serfdom was  practiced in Tibet, an insidious oppression darker and more  cruel than that of the Middle Ages in Europe.    The spokesman said old Tibet was one of the regions in the  world which suffered most seriously from violations of human  rights. After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march  down the road of national unity, economic development and people  living in peace and contentment.    This is a reform of epoch-making significance toward  safeguarding human rights and promoting social progress, he said.    But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind  of  change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners who  trampled human rights as "guards of human rights," which he said  pokes great fun at human rights.    The purpose of making such claims is in fact to attempt to  sabotage China's reunification and national unity, he said.    The spokesman said: "We advise them to take a cautious  attitude toward the issue of Tibet in light of what part Britain  has played in history."    The spokesman said the British House of Commons also  suggests  strengthening the ties between the British Parliament and  Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan", calling on the British Government  to ease its restrictions on Taiwan.    He pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  and  Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the People's  Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing  China, which he said has been recognized by the world community.    The spokesman said that the points of view on the issue of  Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons run counter to the principles concerning the  establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Britain.    Its real aim is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one  Taiwan", which is firmly opposed by the entire Chinese populace  including the people of Taiwan, he said.    The report also has the ulterior motive to advocate "China  threat" so as to undermine the relations between China and its  neighboring countries.    It is known to all that China pursues an independent foreign  policy of peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world  peace and stability. So talk of "China threat" is totally  groundless and works in vain. The spokesman said that the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC attaches great importance  to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation  with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons.    The Chinese side does not do anything harmful to Britain and  the British Parliament as well as to Sino-British ties.    But, he said, some from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  British House of Commons have recently repeatedly done harm to  Sino- British relations while stressing maintaining and  developing Sino- British relations.    "We should ask what their motives are and where they will  lead to in bilateral relations," he said.    It is certain that the views and suggestions against China  that the report has raised will bring harm not only to  Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term interests of  Britain, he stressed.    "We believe that those who really care for and want to  safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral relations are not  willing to see such kinds of results," the spokesman added.</p>

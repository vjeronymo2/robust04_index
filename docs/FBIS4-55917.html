			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec said today he viewed the fact that two groups of  demonstrators at the opening of the 45th Sudeten German congress  unfolded banners reading "No to the Munich Treaty" and "Cheb  Must Remain Czech" as an important sign of German citizens  beginning to think a little but about the demands by the Sudeten  German Landmsannschaft (SL). The congress was held in Nuremberg  last weekend. Cheb is a west Bohemian district town situated  near the Czech-German border.    "I believe this is a significant moment," Zieleniec told  journalists. "I hope that German political circles will think so  as well, since thinking about the future is the basis of mutual  reconciliation," he added.    Zieleniec pointed out that the SL demands were the demands  for a revision of the results of World War Two, with all  consequences following from it. In this connection, he warned  against the danger of an avalanche, "which can extend to very  unpredictable and distant ends".    Zieleniec said he considered the demands voiced at the  congress for the abolition of the Benes decrees (on the  displacement of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World  War Two) to be standard demands articulated for long, with  "differing extents of vehemence" by individual Sudeten German  politicians. No considerable deviation from this trend was  recorded at the Sudeten German congress, he added.</p>

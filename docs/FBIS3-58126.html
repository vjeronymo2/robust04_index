The justified security needs of Germany's eastern  neighbors, like Poland and the Czech Republic, needed to be  taken "very seriously," the Chancellor told FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG. He was also in favor of these countries  joining the European Union (EU) when they fulfill the economic  preconditions for doing so.    Kohl once again came out in favor of further expanding  security links between NATO and Russia. Without mentioning the  name of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the extreme right-wing  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Kohl said the recent "shrill  extremist noises" from Moscow should not dissuade NATO from  continuing on this path. On the contrary, they were an  additional reason to maintain the close relations with  particular care. He supported the reform politics of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and expected that in the process of  building a democratic order, "relapses into old thinking" could  be warded off.

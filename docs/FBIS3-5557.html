			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The World Focuses on the National Security </F> Law"]    [Text] It is deplorable that political discussion on the  National Security Law [NSL], which is well known as an evil law  trampling upon human rights, has not shown any progress although  it has, with the domestic movement to repeal the law, become a  matter of international concern. Both a high-ranking U.S.  Government official and the U.S. secretary of state remarked on  their hopes for the repeal of the NSL and it is a main issue at  the UN Human Rights Commission Conference being held in Geneva,  Switzerland. Considering that the Human Rights Commission  Conference adopted a resolution recommending the phased repeal  of the NSL in Vienna in 1992, it is conceivable that a stronger  resolution may be adopted this time. It seems that we will not  be able to avoid being labeled as a "country with underdeveloped  human rights."    While not demanding repeal with the help of international  opinion, we must reemphasize our opinion regarding the  government and ruling party's insistance on disapproving the  revision or repeal of the NSL, and their objection to  international opinion.    First, let us examine if the revision or repeal of the NSL  is  a domestic issue that should not be discussed by others. The  foreign minister called the U.S. ambassador to the ROK to  protest the remarks by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Hubbard, and the Democratic Liberal Party issued a statement  refuting the confirmation remarks by Secretary of State  Christopher. They all asked for a halt in remarks that  interfere in internal affairs. Although we would like to  positively appraise the government and the ruling party's  apparent change in attitude from one of swallowing its anger on  unsatisfactory points in relations with the United States, we  cannot but criticize their points of refutation. Without  mentioning the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the human  rights issue is already a matter of international concern and no  one can deny that it is common practice to apply international  measures. Moreover, the International Human Rights Conference  held in Vienna in July 1993 declared that protection and  improvement of human rights is a legal concern for the  international community. We have to recognize that insistance  on this as a domestic issue is limiting when considering that  our country will have increasingly more occasion to comment on  the human rights conditions of foreign countries.    Next, the problem is whether the NSL should remain an evil  law that tramples on human rights now that the civilian  government is in office. We would like to hear the government's  answer to assertions by human rights groups, including the  Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, that "illegal retention under  the NSL continues." However, an explanation will not solve the  problem. The fact that there is a law condemning "human  thoughts that are not provable" is itself a contradiction that  needs to be raised.    Let us lastly examine why the NSL should be made an issue  when related North Korean laws are far more unreasonable and  atrocious. While comparison of North Korea's laws with ours in  terms of mutuality in North-South relations is not even worth  consideration, if we assume that everything the government and  related organizations say about North Korea's legal system and  human rights situation are true, and strictly apply mutuality  here, we would need to enact more evil laws and tolerate more  atrocious human rights infringements. Is this justifiable?    Recalling the interview with the NEW YORK TIMES in 1979 by  Kim Yong-sam, then president of the New Democratic Party, urging  the United States to "exercise open and direct pressure to then  President Pak Chong-hui," we again ask the government and the  ruling party if the NSL remains indispensable when it goes  against the trend of today's international community which  stresses opening up and internationalization.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "KR Leaders Must Be Offered Role in New </F> Cambodian Government"]    [Text] At times, it seems as if King Norodom Sihanouk  possesses the sole voice of sanity in his wretched country. As  yet another season of war draws to a close, little has changed  in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge [KR], buoyed by consecutive  victories over the government army at Pailin and Anlong Veng,  are vowing to wreak havoc throughout the country. And the  government in Phnom Penh, while stung by the losses,  nevertheless maintains that a military solution is the only  answer to the insurgency.    Appealing for cooler heads in the aftermath of the Khmer  Rouge's fierce counter-offensive on Pailin, Sihanouk urged the  two sides to come together for peace talks, bemoaning that this  "fratricidal war continues to ruin and bleed our nation white".    The leaders of the two warring parties have reluctantly  agreed, but if previous negotiations are anything to go by, the  chances for success are slim.    An earlier attempt by the king to bring the combatants  together was linked to a so-called "Five Point Plan." This  called, amongst other things, for the Khmer Rouge to declare a  ceasefire, open its zones of control and demobilise its  estimated 9,000 man-strong guerrilla army.    In exchange the government would open negotiations with the  rebels to discuss their demands for an advisory role in  government and an offer of cabinet positions for certain  "acceptable Khmer Rouge officials."    The Khmer Rouge's nominal chief, Khieu Samphan, rejected the  deal, saying there could be no preconditions, and the government  responded by intensifying the war against the guerrillas.    The main stumbling block, now as in all previous peace  attempts, is what to do with the Khmer Rouge's powerful  military. The Khmer Rouge leadership knows that without its  guns and border sanctuaries it is doomed and will not abandon  them for vague promises of political legitimacy.    At February's international donor conference in Tokyo, the  Cambodian government dismissed the Khmer Rouge threat as little  more than the last flickers of a dying revolution and said the  country faced bigger problems in overcoming widespread poverty  and infrastructure woes.    But as the guerrillas proved over the dry season, they  remain  a formidable force and potent source of instability in the  country. Cambodia is not going to be able to make a break from  its tragic past as long as they remain at odds with the  government. In recent weeks they have kidnapped and shot at  foreign aid workers and travellers and even advised Sihanouk to  leave the country for safety.    Their ability to create terror at will has disabled the  nascent tourism industry and chilled foreign investors. Clearly  the Khmer Rouge cannot be ignored and, as the recent fighting  showed, are unlikely to be beaten on the battlefield.    But this is not to say the Khmer Rouge -- or rather the  resentment, racial enmity and destabilization they represent --  cannot be vanquished.    By offering Khmer Rouge leaders a limited role in  government,  the Phnom Penh government can temporarily muzzle the military  threat posed by the guerrilla group and allow Cambodia's  suspended development to begin anew.    Economic growth and democracy are the answers to the Khmer  Rouge problem. The ideology of the Marxist group is dead and  the issues that have traditionally sustained them -- the  illegality of the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh  and unlawful Vietnamese immigration -- have been made redundant  by the UN peace mission or are being addressed.    If other issues like official corruption and abuse of power  can also be taken care of, there is no reason why a true  national reconciliation cannot take place in Cambodia. The  Khmer Rouge's footmen will not stay in the jungle if they can  see a better, more just way in mainstream society.</p>

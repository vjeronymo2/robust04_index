			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF  </P> <P> THE SOCIETY OF SIX by Nancy Boas (Bedford Arts: $39.95; 224 pp.)  </P> <P> These six young, bold artists working in Oakland in the 1910s and '20s have  often been called "landscape painters," but their work is considerably more  sophisticated than that of mid-19th Century realists, for rather than  faithfully and "objectively" depicting the environment, their art reflects a  more modernist conflict between inner and outer landscapes. At their best, the  "Oakland Six" use deep and dreamy hues of red, blue and gold not only to  express their love of the land but to portray its pristine beauty as a form of  spiritual purity that is often beyond human attaining.  </P> <P> By showing how the society's paintings presaged modernism, Nancy Boas hopes to  bring them out of the basements to which they were relegated after being  dismissed as derivative. Isolated from European and New England culture, the  Oakland Six didn't learn French Impressionist techniques until an exposition  traversed mountains and deserts to reach the Bay Area in 1915. By then,  however, mainstream artists already were moving on to newer forms of  expression. Even so, the society innovated substantially beyond Impressionism,  Boas argues, pioneering a rapid, raw, coarse and boldly subjective style that  became our country's first distinctly original contribution to visual art.  </P> <P> The work reproduced here in color ranges from intense evocations of the Old  West -- Seldon Gile's "A Pueblo, Arizona" for instance, is a composite of  bright orange masses that are on the verge, as Boas writes, "of exploding into  pure light" -- to August Gay's more introspective studies of troubled psyches  in tranquil environments. Gay's "Stevenson House," for instance, suggests a  world that is outwardly beautiful, but inwardly threatening: a tranquil, pastel  building lies in the background, while in the foreground, the spreading  branches of a tree seem to shatter the composition like glass.  </P></p>

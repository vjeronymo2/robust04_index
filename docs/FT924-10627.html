			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Japan offers to give financial help to industry THE Japanese labour ministry yesterday responded to Japan's deepening industrial recession by offering financial help to 12 industries, including electronics, which are suffering from overcapacity. Subsidies will be used to encourage companies to make permanent cuts in capacity by retraining workers and redeploying them. Up to 392,000 workers will be covered by the scheme. The subsidies, the cost of which is not known, can be awarded for up to a year. The subsidies are especially notable because they cover a range of suppliers to Japan's most successful and internationally prominent manufacturing industries, such as automobiles and electronics. Those industries qualifying for subsidies from next month include makers of printed circuit boards, condensers, resistors, connectors, switches, magnetic heads, tuners, speaker and microphone parts and fuses. Also covered are makers of a range of metal and wire manufacturing equipment for supply to the automobile and electronics industries. Companies in these industries are allowed to apply to the labour ministry for subsidies of up to two-thirds of the salary of affected workers. The ministry will allow subsidies when operations in a particular company have been suspended, when workers are being retrained, or when workers are redeployed. Japan has a long history of using government subsidies to aid industrial rationalisation, and has used subsidies to cut capacity in the shipbuilding and steel industries. Japan's policies are often contrasted to Europe, where subsidies have frequently been used to prop up ailing industries that have become uneconomic. Japan's willingness to use national resources to promote industrial change is often cited as an underlying factor in the country's continued economic success.</p>

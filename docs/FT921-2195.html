			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins declines to Pounds 231.5m - Figures short of expectations as falling paper prices take their toll ARJO Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British pulp and paper group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 10.8 per cent from Pounds 259.6m to Pounds 231.5m for the year to December 31. Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the result was strong given market conditions and that the underlying strengths of the new group, formed by the merger in 1990 of Arjomari-Prioux and Wiggins Teape Appleton, had become apparent. However, the results, compared with non-statutory pro-forma results of the enlarged group in 1990, were below analysts expectations. Although sales volumes increased 3 per cent, group turnover was down 4 per cent from Pounds 2.6bn to Pounds 2.49bn reflecting weak prices. However, the shares rose 13p to 241p. Most of the profits fall was caused by a Pounds 26m decline at the Iberian forestry and pulp operations. A new paper machine at the Iberian Soporcel subsidiary came on stream at a time when demand and prices were already weak, said Mr Stephen Walls, chief executive. Pulp prices had fallen by a third over the past 12 months, he added. The new Soporcel machine would adversely affect results in 1992, he said. In January, AWA broke off negotiations with South-Africa-based Mondi Paper, part of the Anglo-American group, for the sale of its 42.86 per cent stake in Soporcel. The group's worldwide forestry and pulp operations fell into a Pounds 9.4m loss compared with a profit of Pounds 5.7m last year. The group's results were also affected by poor paper demand throughout Europe, said Mr Walls. Demand in Germany and France had slowed, while the UK and Scandinavia remained locked in recession. Profits from the European paper operations fell 5.2 per cent from Pounds 141.6m to Pounds 134.1m. However, the North American paper operations performed extremely well, said Mr Walls, with profits up 12 per cent from Pounds 92.6m to Pounds 104.2m. The paper merchanting operations reported a 33 per cent fall in profits from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 17.9m, a result described by Mr Walls as commendable. The benefits of the merger had been greater than expected, said Mr Walls. He forecast savings of Pounds 15m this year and Pounds 25m next. A provision of Pounds 17.1m has been added to the original Pounds 43.2m put aside to cover the rationalisation of the group following the merger. The outlook was dependent upon an upturn in the world economy, said Mr Walls. The sector was not out of the woods of overcapacity and low prices. Pulp prices had started to increase, but paper prices had a long way to go until he would feel comfortable. There also was still a continuing problem of poor demand, he said. Earnings per share were 18p (21.5p). The recommended final dividend is again 5.05p, maintaining the total at 8.35p for the year. COMMENT AWA came to the market blandishing both its qualities as a defensive stock and a progressive dividend policy. Neither has materialised. Last year's results were uninspired, while trading conditions this year look to be increasingly difficult. A strong German market during the first half which boosted the results last year will not be repeated, and the company looks vulnerable to an increase in pulp prices which, given the state of demand for paper, it would have difficulty passing on to customers. With analysts' profits forecasts for next year wavering at about Pounds 219m, giving a multiple of 14, the stock looks decidedly dull. A poor defensive stock with limited recovery potential.</p>

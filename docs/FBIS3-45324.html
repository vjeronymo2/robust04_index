			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 1627): </F> "Central Authorities Plan To Solve Problems of Rapid  Development in Two to Three Years"]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--According to an  authoritative source here, the top central leadership recently  pointed out that the money supply and the size of capital  construction will continue to increase and go beyond the  economy's endurance in 1994. The central authorities have thus  decided to resolve problems occurring with rapid development in  two to three years.    The source quoted a top leader saying that the economic  macrocontrol measures adopted in 1993 had not thoroughly  resolved the problems brought about by high-speed economic  growth since 1992. Because a "hard landing" [ying zhuo lu 4289  4192 7120] was effected in 1993, this led to serious ups and  downs in the economy and caused certain shocks to society.  Therefore, those measures for intensifying economic  macrocontrol in 1993 could only be effective to a limited  degree. That is, they succeeded in curbing the rising  inflation rate and restraining the scale of capital construction  as banks were prevented from offering large amounts of capital  in the market.    The leader said that according to estimates, the scale of  construction in progress throughout the country is three times  that of 1991. In order to complete all the construction  projects that have been started, it is not enough to just issue  more currency. The increase in the money supply will just result  in a substantial increase in prices. Therefore, it is necessary  to effect an economic "soft landing" in 1994. The money supply  and the scale of capital construction must not be increased  substantially. Otherwise, the authorities will be forced to  effect another round of "hard landing" and to exercise strict  control by mandatory administrative means. It is hard to  imagine what changes would then be brought about in society.  For example, steel and cement prices are still increasing at  present. In 1993, when macrocontrol was being exercised, steel  prices were lowered somewhat, but are now increasing again. The  price of cement has never been lowered. In such circumstances,  it is impossible to enlarge the size of capital construction any  further.    He finally emphasized that the central authorities attach  great importance to reforms in 1994. If the reforms do not go  smoothly, China will lose an important historical opportunity,  and it will be hard to find another similar opportunity in the  future. At present, China is facing a very good domestic and  international situation. Therefore, the 1994 reforms must  succeed, thus fundamentally guaranteeing the sustained, rapid,  and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256  1660] development of the national economy. If the reforms do  not succeed, the size of capital construction continues to grow,  and prices continue to increase, social unrest may occur and  China may lose the opportunity.</p>

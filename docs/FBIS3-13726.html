			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] AL-BA'TH today carries an editorial on the peace  process and the importance of Arab coordination. It says: It  has been proven beyond a doubt that when there is a unified Arab  position on basic pan-Arab issues, the Arab nation can score  major achievements. It has also been proven that any penetration  of the Arab position from any direction for any reason will  definitely harm everyone. This is absolutely clear from the Oslo  agreement and what has followed.    AL-BA'TH adds: Had Arab coordination remained as it had been  at the beginning of the peace talks itwould certainly have been  in the interest of the Arabs and, consequently, in the interest  of the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace.    AL-BA'TH indicates that what matters now is not when the  peace talks will resume, but how Israel will comply with the  resolutions of international legitimacy so that the peace  process will be brought to a successful end leading to a just,  comprehensive peace, which is needed in the region. The paper  believes that the responsibility for achieving this lies with  the cosponsors of the peace process, specifically the United  States, being the initiator of the peace process.    AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's readiness to continue peace  efforts. It indicates that Syria has offered all that is  possible to ensure the continuation of that process in order to  arrive at a comprehensive solution.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: When Syria called for a meeting  of the Arab parties directly concerned with the peace process,  it did so out of its faith in joint Arab action and its absolute  realization that coordination and faithful commitment will  thwart any Israeli attempt to effect another penetration like  the Oslo agreement. Besides, coordination in itself can achieve  at least a minimum level of Arab aspirations.    In an editorial on the UN Security Council resolution on the  Hebron massacre and the chance that the resolution has provided  for the resumption of the peace talks, TISHRIN says:  Undoubtedly, UN Security Council Resolution 904 on the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre has provided a new opportunity to resume the  peace talks. In turn, this will boost the international  arrangements and measures to protect our Palestinian Arab people  in the occupied territories, and will prevent the recurrence of  spiteful crimes and massacres by the settlers with the support  of the Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens in the  occupied territories.    TISHRIN continues: The Hebron massacre and the subsequent  confrontations and events have proven to the entire world the  need to end the Israeli occupation and to arrive at a just,  comprehensive peace in accordance with the Madrid conference  formula away from any procrastination and obstacles. Thus,  Israel must adopt practical measures to protect and ensure the  security of the Palestinians. We also demand that it disarm the  settlers, give up its provocative and extortionist stands, and  seriously contribute toward activating the peace process by  recognizing the facts and objectives of this process and  responding to the UN resolutions, the Madrid conference formula,  and the principle of trading land for peace.    TISHRIN adds: Undoubtedly, the chances that were provided  for the peace process, particularly during the talks, have been  greatly narrowed after the Hebron massacre. Safeguarding the  peace process and extricating it from the impasse to which it  has been driven requires, more than ever before, a public  Israeli acknowledgement in advance that only a full withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories can ensure the achievement of  a just, comprehensive peace and regional security, stability,  and calm.    TISHRIN stresses Syria's eagerness to continue coordination  among the Arab parties to the peace process and its call for a  meeting for consultations prior to the resumption of the talks.  The paper explains that the Arabs, especially Syria, have  always been advocates of right and justice, seriously and  honestly working to achieve a just, comprehensive peace.  However, Israel has met all this with nothing but more  maneuvers and circumvention of the objectives of peace. Had  Israel been, like the Arabs, serious at the Madrid conference  and had it showed commitment to the formula of that conference,  the Hebron massacre would not have taken place and all this  violence and terrorism would not have prevailed in the occupied  territories, which have turned into battlefields in which Arab  citizens are being slaughtered by the gunfire of the occupiers.  Nor would southern Lebanon have suffered destruction,  bombardment, and displacement of its population as a result of  the brutal Israeli aggressions.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: While awaiting the true and full  implementation of Resolution 904, it must be emphasized that  Israel is required, now more than ever before, to respond to all  bases and requirements of peace, headed by full withdrawal from  the occupied territories. Securing such an Israeli response is  both an international and a U.S. responsibility.</p>

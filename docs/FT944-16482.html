			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (5): Potential spotted by foreigners Foreign companies have been quick to see the potential in modernising Bulgaria's once flourishing food and agro-processing industries. The privatisation programme began with the Dollars 20m trade sale of a maize products plant in Razgrad, north eastern Bulgaria to Amylum, owned by CIP of Belgium, Archer Daniels Midland Co. of the US, and Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK. They were quickly followed by other multinational food-processing groups including Kraft Jacobs Suchard and Nestle, which acquired leading chocolate producers in Sofia, and Delta, a Greek food manufacturer, which invested in an ice cream factory in Varna on the Black Sea. Danone of France set up Danone-Serdika in Sofia for the manufacture of dairy products while the Dutch company Frisoso is reported to be interested in Bulgaria's largest diet and baby foods producer, Slancho. Danish investors are investing in meat-processing and several Austrian companies plan investment in turkey farms and asparagus growing. Apart from private investment, western governmental aid and credits from the international institutions are also becoming available for the agricultural sector. The World Bank's first agricultural credit - a Dollars 50m loan to improve private sector access to medium and long-term credit - was negotiated by the ministry of agriculture earlier this year. It has not yet been ratified by parliament, however, because of political infights over the bank's requirement to phase out agricultural subsidies. 'Agriculture is one of the sectors with the most potential,' says Andrew Kenningham, an economist who has spent several years as director of Bulgarian International Business Association, representing foreign investors.</p>

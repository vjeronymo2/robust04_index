			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: STALLONE'S CHALLENGE  </P> <P> If producer David Brown can get "The Midnight Club" going, co-producer  Sylvester Stallone will star as New York's best detective -- in a wheelchair.  </P> <P> "The movie will have state-of-the-art, wheelchair, hand-to-hand combat," Brown  tells us.  </P> <P> "It's about a New York police detective determined to extinguish a crime  overlord. . . . In his single-minded desire to wipe out this man, the detective  is paralyzed from the waist down and almost killed.  </P> <P> "Stallone goes from a man of intense activity to a wheelchair, and the action  continues from the wheelchair."  </P> <P> The script, by John Herzfeld, is based on a book by James B. Patterson, former  CEO of the J. Walter Thompson USA ad agency. The movie, to be financed by  Stallone's Carolco Pictures as a Tri-Star release, is expected to start  shooting early next year. First up for Stallone: the comedy "Oscar," which  begins shooting this fall. Daniel Cerone  </P></p>

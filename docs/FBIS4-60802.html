			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated comment by Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov: "I Will </F> Allow No One To Cast a Cloud Over the Festivities in Moscow"]    [Text] It is gratifying that those who were only recently  parading extremist inclinations are beginning to come to their  senses. The political sphere has nowadays become more stable.  In line with the standards of civilized, democratic countries,  deputies' factions and political parties have formed which  consolidate society and support exclusively parliamentary  methods of fighting for power. A proof of this is the signing  by all the leading political forces of the Treaty on Social  Accord.    Those political forces linked with extremism which refused  to  participate in the treaty are undoubtedly losing the support of  society. Unfortunately, it was necessary to go through the  bloody events of 1 May last year and the clashes of 3-4 October  1993 in order for the madmen to realize that this is no method  for resolving political problems in Russia. Our country will  never again bring itself to obtain rulers through methods of  bloody dictatorship. We have had quite enough revolutions. We  need victories only on the front line of winning prestige among  people through concrete deeds.    Nevertheless, in the light of last year's bitter experience  the forces of law and order have been primed in sufficiently  large numbers for the holding of the May Day celebrations. I am  confident that they will ensure peace and quiet for muscovites.  But we are ready to take control and adopt appropriate measures  against disturbers of public order. There are fears of a rash  of terrorist acts more than of a plan of concerted actions by  gunmen. But today they should understand that their plans will  not go unresisted.    I am an optimist, but readiness to oppose extremists is an  excellent thing in a mayor of Moscow. We are ready for any  changes in the situation in the capital. And if anyone wants to  cast a cloud over the holiday or to break the law, adequate  measures and forces will be activated. At any rate, I  personally will be at work on all four free days.</p>

Soon It  Could Generate More"]    [Text] The Ukrainian parliament adopted four different  resolutions regarding the Chernobyl nuclear plant over the past  four years. The station was "executed" three times (deadlines  for its stoppage were set for the beginning of 1995, then 1992,  and 1993); and in October 1993, the Supreme Council "pardoned"  it, permitting it to function until the exhaustion of its  technical resources. The last decision was forced by life  itself, with the parliament just affirming it. Losing 5 percent  of Ukraine's electric energy, generated by the Chernobyl plant,  means death for our state -- electricity frequency is on the  verge of normal levels, reaching at times 49 hertz. Experts  know very well that if the frequency goes down, this might  trigger a ripple effect paralyzing all industries.    This is another case confirming the proverb that every cloud  has a silver lining. It is not the market economy or  competition but the station's dire situation that forced its  staff to fight for survival on three fronts at a time -- to  maintain the system of nuclear units, to prepare those units for  their decommissioning, and to produce electricity with a 110-118  percent completion of its monthly production plans. As long as  the government was handing out subsidies to unprofitable  enterprises or even entire industries, fueling inflation, the  Chernobyl plant undertook expensive safety measures and at its  own cost, carried out a considerable amount of work necessary to  put the plant out of commission. During nine months of 1994  alone, safety and reliability outlays amounted to 14 billion  karbovanets -- one-fourth of the revenues. At the same time,  production costs for one kilowatt-hour produced at the Chernobyl  plant proved 1.5-fold less than at thermal electric stations,  even though it pays world prices for its nuclear fuel.    In terms of security, Chernobyl nuclear units today are as  good as comparable Russian ones. As the honorary president of  the World Association of Nuclear Plant User States (WANO), Lord  Marshall, emphasized ("ATOMNAYA TECHNIKA ZA RUBEZHOM" [Foreign  Atomic Engineering], No. 6, 1993), that the "safety of RBMK-type  reactors was brought up to quite acceptable levels."  Paradoxically, it was opponents of nuclear engineering that  helped achieve this condition. Following the accident in 1986,  the plant has been working under the constant pressure from the  "Green" Party, politicians, media, as well as an enhanced  scrutiny of foreign and national experts and monitoring  institutions. In December alone, the Chernobyl plant was  visited by Mykola Shteynberg, head of the Ukrainian State Atomic  Supervising Committee, George Kallman, one the leading experts  at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (analogous to the  Ukrainian State Atomic Supervising Committee), and Morris Rosen,  deputy general manager of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency].    During the last visit, in addition to the usual problems, a  new issue was raised -- preparation for resuming the work of the  No. 2 unit, which was stopped after the fire on the No. 4  turbogenerator in October 1991. That accident was caused by the  malfunction of one of the electric cables, and was not connected  with nuclear and radiation safety of the reactor. According to  a timetable set at the station, the No. 2 unit is to be ready  for reactivation as early as November 1994. Although the  Chernobyl plant will again defray most of the costs, government  support will be necessary because, as the station's experts say,  the bloc's reactivation costs will pay off relatively quickly,  funneling net profits to the state budget.    However favorable the situation for the plant might be, the  Chernobyl plant experts realize that the date of the plant  closure is not too many years from now. This is why the  decommission works will be continued. The construction of a new  boiler house and a storage facility for liquid and radioactive  waste will be completed.    What would replace the energy potential in the north of  Ukraine following a shutdown of the Chernobyl plant? The  Chernihiv Oblast administration endorsed a project to build a  new electrical plant near Slavutych with a 2,000 megawatt  capacity. Its type and the kind of fuel will be selected during  a technical and economic evaluation of the project, and  subsequently put to a referendum by the local population. This  is exactly how they act in civilized states when planning to  build a new industrial enterprise.    When decommissioned, the Chernobyl plant might still be of  some value. For example, it may serve as a foundation for a  facility for storing and processing nuclear waste.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: StanChart sets up deal with First Interstate STANDARD Chartered, the UK banking group, and First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles yesterday announced that they are to join forces in three business areas by merging some of their operations. No legal entities are involved and there is no payment by either side. However, some customers, tangible assets, and banking assets will be transferred to Standard Chartered. The two sides have signed a letter of intent, but they will carry out due diligence investigations and obtain regulatory consents before the deal is finalised. Mr Christopher Castleman, executive director financial services at Standard Chartered, said: 'We regard this as being a very interesting enhancement to areas of our activity which are directly ones we want to grow with some very good people from First Interstate who will be joining us.' He said the deal would complement and reinforce Standard Chartered's existing core businesses and branch network in the Asia Pacific region. The transfer from First Interstate will not exceed Pounds 600m and is not expected to have an adverse affect on its capital strength. Three business are involved in the deal: First Interstate's trade-related correspondent banking business, which is dominated by the Asia Pacific region but includes some Mexican business; corporate finance, principally some structuring of Mexican paper with Exim bank guarantees and securitised issues in the US; and a foreign exchange and securities sales and trading derivatives business. Mr Castleman said that the new businesses would fit well into existing operations and were totally in line with the bank's strategy. Mr Edward Carson, chairman and chief executive officer of First Interstate, said that the businesses had been consistently profitable. The transfer would allow it to focus on domestic markets.</p>

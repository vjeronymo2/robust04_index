			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Trafalgar braces for bad news: Provisions and large write-downs on revalued property will swamp conglomerate's profits Trafalgar House, the troubled conglomerate, will today report substantially larger than expected year-end asset writedowns and provisions. Full-year provisions are likely to total about Pounds 400m dwarfing even the most pessimistic estimates from analysts, who have been predicting provisions of up to Pounds 270m, including Pounds 120m of provisions to cover restructuring and property write-downs announced at the interim stage. Provisions on this scale will swamp the expected small underlying annual profit and appear to confirm Trafalgar's reputation for coming up with unexpected bad news. Last year Trafalgar reported a Pounds 30.3m pre-tax loss. The size of the year-end provisions reflects the determination of Trafalgar's new management to get to grips with the group's problems and clean up its battered balance sheet. Trafalgar is now firmly under the influence of Hong Kong Land, which has invested Pounds 200m and built up a 25 per cent stake. Hong Kong Land has four board representatives including Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, and Mr David Gawler, finance director. Trafalgar's board instituted a business review with the group's new financial advisers, Robert Fleming and Schroder Wagg. Independent valuations were made of the group's properties, including group-occupied properties which have previously been held at cost or on the basis of earlier valuations; the commercial property portfolio; the group's hotels including the Ritz, which were last valued in 1989; and the Emerald oil rig in the North Sea. It is understood that these new valuations have shown the need for substantial write-downs. Some analysts also believe that Trafalgar's board may have decided to repay part of its more costly debt such as the 10 7/8 per cent bonds due in 2014. This would absorb some of the proceeds of the planned Pounds 400m rights issue of convertible preference shares, details of which are also expected today. The rights issue was announced in October when Trafalgar issued a profits warning and said the business review had concluded that the February rights issue was not sufficient to to support the group's expanding engineering and construction businesses, the refurbishment of its fleet and plans to invest in infrastructure projects. Trafalgar's share price closed 2p higher at 87 1/2p.</p>

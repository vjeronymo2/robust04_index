			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from Cartagena de Indias] </F>   [Text] Last night, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  arrived in Mexico from Colombia, where he participated in the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit. At the end of the meeting in  Cartagena de Indias, the Latin American presidents endorsed a  proposal to appoint Salinas as head of the World Trade  Directorate, which will replace GATT next year.    Ibero-America is not free from risk. In the presence of  Ibero-American heads of state and government, Salinas warned  that industrialized countries want to impose social dumping on  developing countries.    [Begin Salinas recording] They want to blame us for selling  at lower prices and failing to adhere to environmental  protection and labor standards. [end recording]    Salinas said that trade and investment provide the only  means  to meet the region's urgent need for growth. His participation  in promoting the Cartagena Summit was acknowledged. In this  framework, Argentina proposed Salinas to head the World Trade  Directorate, which will replace GATT next year. The proposal  was accepted by the rest of the Latin American countries.    [Begin Salinas recording] The organization is in a stage of  formation and is expected to become fully operational only next  year. For this reason, I affirm that I am fully devoted to my  duty to serve the Mexican people, and I will continue to do so  until 30 November 1994. [end recording]    Salinas described as encouraging the outcome of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit. Regarding the controversy on Cuba, which  was urged to move toward democracy, Salinas said this.    [Begin Salinas recording] When the Ibero-American Summit was  promoted, it was never expected that there would be a consensus  among those attending the meeting. Instead, the idea was that,  within the framework of the plurality that marks us, we would be  able to agree on similar purposes and goals. [end recording]    The summit has come to an end. The Ibero-American countries  know that they must be integrated into subregional markets,  otherwise the world trade changes will carry them away.</p>

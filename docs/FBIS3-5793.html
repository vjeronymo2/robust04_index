			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said  the recent visit by four Indonesian journalists to Israel is a  source of much regret. The action was clearly contradictory to  Indonesian foreign policy. The visit was premature and could  send the wrong signals about Indonesia's diplomatic position  toward the Middle East in general, and the country's endorsement  of the Palestinian struggle in particular.    The minister said this when he received three of the four  journalists at the Foreign Ministry office in Pejambon, Jakarta  on Thursday, 3 March. The three journalists were from MEDIA  INDONESIA, INDONESIAN BUSINESS WEEKLY, and EKSEKUTIF. The  REPUBLIKA journalist was not present because he is still abroad.    As disclosed by the Foreign Ministry Directorate of  Information on the afternoon of Thursday, 3 March, the three  journalists clarified their reasoning and the background of  their visit to Israel. They admitted that the Israeli  Government hosted their stay, but they had to pay their own air  fares.    Minister Alatas said that although their visit to Israel  might be understandable from a journalistic point of view, on  the other hand, it could have sensitive political implications.  The visit was premature, and it is feared that Israel might  take advantage of it to champion its interests, particularly in  lieu of the agreement on the declaration of principles for  setting up a provisional Palestinian government.    He said: "We welcome the declaration, but we should not be  proceeding too far ahead or assuming that we will move rapidly  toward a process of opening diplomatic relations. The journey  is still a long way from finished, and any hasty moves could  backfire on Indonesia and damage its interests."    Indonesia, as the most populous Muslim nation, is seen as  having a major and important role in dealing with any particular  international issue that could easily influence other nations.  The foreign minister said: "Because of Indonesia's reputation,  we can only change our position after a very cautious  evaluation."</p>

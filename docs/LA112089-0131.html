			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOSING COWBOYS SACKED WITH MONEY WOES  </P> <P> The troubles facing the Dallas Cowboys have spread from the playing field into  the National Football League team's business affairs, a published report said.  </P> <P> The Cowboys have the worst record in the NFL this season. And in recent months,  the club has fallen behind in paying routine bills and making mortgage  payments, team owner Jerry Jones told the Dallas Times Herald.  </P> <P> The newspaper also reported the team held rookie quarterback Troy Aikman's  $1.5-million paycheck until after banking hours and is negotiating with a group  of doctors to sell the Cowboys Valley Ranch headquarters.  </P> <P> Jones, who paid $130 million for the team last February, told the Times Herald  that some of the club's bills have gone unpaid for up to 60 days.  </P> <P> "Obviously the Dallas Cowboys lost money last year," Jones said. "The Dallas  Cowboys were not a moneymaker. That didn't discourage me, and I feel very  strongly that it's a sound business.  </P> <P> "So when the Cowboys need any money for their cash flow, a part of what I do is  provide that money for them."  </P> <P> The Cowboys did not sign Aikman's lump-sum paycheck until after banking hours  Nov. 1 because there would not have been enough money in team accounts to cover  the check, sources said. A TV payment was received and deposited the next day.  </P> <P> Jones also confirmed that the team is trying to sell its 80,000-square-foot  headquarters building and surrounding 28 acres.  </P> <P> William Pestinger, who operates a chiropractic clinic near Valley Ranch, said  he and his colleagues are close to finalizing a deal.  </P></p>

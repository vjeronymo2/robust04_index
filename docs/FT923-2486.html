			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Concern as Bosnian food crisis worsens MR Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, yesterday said that no big differences remained between Washington and Paris on enforcing a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina. But he said the US, France and Britain had reached no agreement on whether to set up and enforce a proposed air exclusion zone to keep Serbian jets from flying over Bosnia, following an increase in ethnic violence in the former Yugoslav republic. Mr Cheney stressed that the UN would have to make any final decision on such a zone, but that the allies would have to agree how to police it. Serb forces have launched a series of air attacks in western and northern Bosnia, prompting calls from UN officials for the creation of a no-fly zone over Bosnia. Sarajevo radio, which is in Moslem hands, yesterday reported seven Serb air attacks on Jajce in western Bosnia, after the UN had complained of air strikes on the Moslem town of Bihac, further north. Despite the fighting, international mediators who will head peace talks in Geneva tomorrow said yesterday that there was a 'new mood' in Belgrade which could provide a lift to prospects for peace. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, and Lord Owen, for the European Community, said they would continue to talk to all sides, despite moves to oust Yugoslavia from the UN. 'It would be foolish not to recognise that we are dealing with a more helpful and progressive attitude in Belgrade than we had in the past,' said Lord Owen. Mr Vance said Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslav prime minister, and President Dobrica Cosic had made 'very, very important commitments', including rejection of 'ethnic cleansing' and pledges to help reverse it. In the breakaway Bosnian Serb parliament, the speaker, Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, said: 'We are completing the job around Jajce which is about to be liberated. Jajce was and will remain Serb and there will be no deals.' Mr Panic proposed yesterday that the rump republic made up of Serbia and Montenegro make a fresh application for UN membership, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, after talks in Moscow with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister. The suggestion was aimed to defuse a dispute with the EC over whether the Serb-dominated territory should keep Yugoslavia's UN seat. An Italian relief aircraft taking supplies to Sarajevo, which crashed in Bosnia this month, was shot down by a missile, an official report released yesterday said. The report, by military experts from Italy, did not say who fired the missile. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees quoted the report as saying: 'The results obtained so far suggest that, without any doubt, the G-222 aircraft had been struck at least by one missile that probably had infra-red guidance.' The European Community is preparing to agree to release Ecu120m (Pounds 87.2m) next week to help refugees in former Yugoslavia survive the winter. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, British foreign minister responsible for Europe, told the European parliament yesterday that talks on the proposal - which would cover the need for food, shelter and medicines from October to December - were being held this week.</p>

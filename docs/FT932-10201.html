			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Shanghai lets in foreign brokers THE Shanghai stock exchange has approved 23 foreign brokerage firms to deal directly in its B-share market. These are shares denominated in US dollars and restricted to foreigners. Among the 23 approved securities houses are Merrill Lynch of the US, Credit Lyonnais of France, Nomura International of Japan and Sun Hung Kai of Hong Kong. Mr Wu Yalun, deputy chief manager of the exchange, said the foreign companies had been offered direct access - previously foreign securities firms were obliged to deal through a local affiliate - to meet the growing needs of overseas securities agen-cies. Mr Wu said the presence of a foreign securities companies would make transactions more competitive on the world market. Trade in the B-share market has been flat recently, partly because foreign investors have been awaiting the listing on the Hong Kong exchange of select mainland compan-ies. Reservations about a lax regulatory environment in China are one of the factors deterring fund managers.</p>

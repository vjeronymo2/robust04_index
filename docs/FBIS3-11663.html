Camacho Solis said a few minutes ago that he joins in  with all Mexicans to reject the attack perpetrated this  afternoon against Luis Donaldo Colosio. What happened, said  Colosio, is a big offense against his family and against all of  us. Here is Juan Carlos Antoyo reporting from Chiapas.    [Antoyo] Camacho Solis was to give a report, a summary on  the  Chiapas situation. We were summoned at 1900 [0100 GMT] but the  message did not arrive. Suddenly there was silence and reactions  were soon felt; the news was released. Manuel Camacho Solis  arrived one hour later to give this brief statement that he had  written by hand on a piece of paper. The following is his  message:    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] The information I was to  release today will be made known in the following days. I have  just communicated with Mexico City and was told that Luis  Donaldo Colosio is in the hands of the best Mexican doctors. I  join the whole nation's indignation for the attack against Luis  Donaldo Colosio's life. What occurred is an attack against  peace and democracy in the nation. The highest value is the  individual's life and his dignity. What has occurred is a great  offense against his family, all our families, and the nation.  [end recording]    [Antoyo] This is all Camacho Solis said.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Brown calls for action on speculators MR GORDON BROWN yes-terday underlined his status as a pivotal figure in the shadow cabinet with a sharp attack on Mr John Major's economic management and a call for international action to end the turmoil in currency markets. Speaking hours before his comfortable election for the first time to the party's ruling national executive committee, the shadow chancellor said the Conservatives had created a 'vacuum at the heart of government instead of putting Britain at the heart of Europe'. The carefully managed conference debate on the economy - designed to emphasise Labour's commitment to buttress rather than supplant the market economy - saw calls from some delegates for a return to more aggressive interventionism and for a stronger commitment to universal welfare benefits. But in the event it passed a series of uncontentious motions calling for a targeted public investment programme, tax incentives for capital spending by manufacturing industry and European-wide action to reduce investment. Foreshadowing the central theme of Mr John Smith's first leadership speech later today, Mr Brown characterised the recent sterling crisis as a failure of leadership by Mr Major. In a combative performance which focused on exploiting the disarray in the cabinet, the shadow chancellor said that sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism had left the government directionless and isolated. Mr Major had now 'retreated from the challenge of Europe to the squalid pursuit of Thatcherism in one country'. Mr Brown accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of refusing to support the prime minister 'leaving him floating downwards to find his own level'. But he eschewed any commitment by Labour to immediate re-entry to the ERM, calling instead for 'a new internationalism' in economic strategy designed to limit the power of speculators. The conference subsequently endorsed the statement agreed by the NEC last week backing closer economic and political co-operation in Europe and a managed system of 'fixed but adjustable' exchange rates. Mr Brown blamed the devaluation of the pound on the weakness of the economy, demanding a national recovery programme targeted at increased investment, training and an immediate boost for the construction industry. Later he told journalists that Labour support for sterling's eventual return to the ERM was contingent on reform of the system. The party wanted an extension of the Basle-Nyborg agreements to expand the scope of intra-marginal intervention in the ERM, an increase in the resources available to central banks to combat speculation and the creation of a common pool of those resources. He also urged a summit meeting to try to find an international means of curbing speculators. Mr Brown sidestepped questions on whether Labour would back a call at the conference from Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union for a 'windfall' tax on currency speculators. In a speech which won warm applause from delegates, Mr Edmonds said that the City had become Britain's 'biggest casino', where more than Pounds 500m had been won by 'cocky young men' betting on a certainty. But for his part the shadow chancellor implicitly acknowledged that such a tax might simply drive foreign currency dealing offshore. He said that action to end the turmoil in currency markets should be considered at a summit of the G7 group of leading industrial countries.</p>

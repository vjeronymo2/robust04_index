			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Kinkel facing pressure to quit Mr Klaus Kinkel, leader of Germany's Free Democrats since 1992 and foreign minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, was last night facing mounting pressure to resign following a hostile reception by delegates attending a special party meeting in Gera in the eastern state of Thuringia. The party's presidium is expected to meet in emergency session early this morning to decide whether it would ask for Mr Kinkel's resignation. 'He is under extreme pressure to resign. That is no surprise given the string of electoral defeats,' said Ms Irmgard Schwaetzer, the former construction minister. 'He will sleep on it tonight. But we should know tomorrow if Kinkel will stay or resign.' Senior party members confirmed that Mr Wolfgang Gerhardt, party leader of Hesse, was a possible successor to Mr Kinkel. Delegates at the congress repeatedly interrupted Mr Kinkel's hour-long keynote speech with boos and whistles. The address was aimed at restoring the party's confidence after it failed to get re-elected to nine state parliaments over the past two years, did not enter the European Parliament and only scraped back into the Bundestag, in October through tactical voting by Christian Democrats.</p>

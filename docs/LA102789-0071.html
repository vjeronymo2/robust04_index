One hostage was reportedly released. At least 79 people have been injured in  the two days of disturbances. State police and firefighters struggled to regain  control of the prison at Camp Hill as thick smoke billowed over the complex and  several explosions were heard. The incident began during a lockdown. Prison  Supt. Robert Freeman had said the disturbance may have been caused by  overcrowding and inmates' anger over changes in policy.  </P></p>

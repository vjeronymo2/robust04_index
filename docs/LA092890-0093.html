			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHIELD LAW PROTECTION UPHELD IN CIVIL SUITS;  </P> <P> COURTS: STATE JUSTICES RULE UNANIMOUSLY THAT JOURNALISTS MAY NOT BE JAILED FOR  REFUSING TO SURRENDER THEIR NOTES, PHOTOS AND OTHER UNPUBLISHED MATERIAL.  </P> <P> In a victory for news organizations, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday  that journalists may not be jailed for refusing to surrender notes, photos and  other unpublished data for use in civil suits arising from events they cover.  </P> <P> The court held unanimously that reporters are immune from being held in  contempt for such refusals under California's news shield law. The law, placed  in the state Constitution in 1980, allows journalists to withhold confidential  sources or "any unpublished information" obtained while gathering news.  </P> <P> The justices held last May that the shield law must give way, however, when a  criminal defendant needs the disputed evidence to ensure a fair trial. But in  Thursday's decision, the court, in an opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson,  said there was no comparable right in a civil case.  </P> <P> The ruling was welcomed as a "big jump" in press protections by C. Michael  Cooley, attorney for the New York Times Co., owner of the Santa Barbara  News-Press, whose photographer had refused requests to turn over unpublished  accident photos to an automobile manufacturer being sued in a personal injury  case.  </P> <P> "This decision underscores the will of the people back in 1980 to give broad  protection to the press to gather news without concern that reporters will be  repeatedly subject to civil subpoenas," Cooley said.  </P> <P> Michael A. Zuk of Los Angeles, attorney for Volkswagen of America Inc., the  defendant in the injury suit, said the ruling would unfairly impede plaintiffs  and defendants from obtaining important evidence in civil cases.  </P> <P> "This prevents civil litigants from even getting into the arena where their  needs can be weighed against the interests of journalists," Zuk said. "It's a  very unfortunate decision."  </P> <P> The case arose after News-Press photographer Robert Ponce took several photos  of an auto accident on U.S. 101 in 1984. Two of the photographs were published  in the newspaper. A passenger in a Volkswagen van, Jerome Sortomme, was injured  and he and his wife sued the auto maker. Volkswagen sought the unpublished  photos to aid in its defense and, after the paper refused, went to court.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Patrick L. McMahon ordered the News-Press to  produce the photos so he could inspect them to see if the paper's need for  protection was outweighed by the company's need for evidence. The paper  appealed, citing concerns that news gathering would be hampered by repeated  demands for unpublished data. In June, 1988, a state Court of Appeal in Fresno  reversed the order, holding that the shield law provided "absolute protection"  to journalists who are not themselves parties in a civil suit.  </P> <P> In Thursday's decision, the high court upheld the appellate court and  reaffirmed the shield law's guarantees. The court did note that other state  laws could allow a reporter to be fined $500 and held liable for damages in  some instances for refusing to turn over unpublished material to civil  litigants.  </P> <P> But as a practical matter, such monetary sanctions are not worth the cost to  the litigants who seek them and thus are "virtually ineffectual," Eagleson  wrote. "The simple economics of modern litigation essentially preclude such an  action."  </P> <P> In another ruling, the high court upheld the conviction and death sentence of  Ronald Lee Sanders for the 1981 bludgeon murder of Janice Allen of Bakersfield.  Sanders, now 38, was accused of killing the woman to prevent her from  testifying against him in a previous attempted robbery.  </P> <P> In a 5-2 decision, the court rejected Sanders' claim that he was entitled to a  retrial because Latinos were systematically under-represented in the pool of  prospective jurors. Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard both  dissented.  </P></p>

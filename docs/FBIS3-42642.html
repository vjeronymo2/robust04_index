			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by People's Deputy of Ukraine Yuriy Hnatkevych </F> under the rubric "Point of View": "Certain Lessons From  Elections in Russia, or Is the Zhirinovskiyization of the New  Parliament a Threat to Us?"]    [Text] The results of elections in Russia have taught  many lessons to Russia itself, to us in Ukraine, and to the  entire concerned world. The origins and consequences of the  success of Zhirinovskiyism will be analyzed for a long time to  come. At present, we should be most interested in the aspects of  the Russian experience that could manifest themselves during our  election drama. Precisely a drama because it is hard to call  elections anything but a dramatic mistake at a time of severe  crisis and confusion in all strata of society and power circles.    It has now become clear that the split of reformist  forces in Russia into several blocs, which most probably was a  tactical move by Yeltsin aimed at taking away as many votes from  the Communists as possible, scattered the platforms of reformers  and diverted the attention and interest of the voters away from  them.    The second mistake of Russian reformers followed from  the first: Certain of their victory over the Communists, they  turned the television and agitation campaign into something of  an election show, into clowning, giving the opportunity to the  one whom the reformers perceived as a clown to rivet the  attention of citizens to the sweet and specific promises. It  turns out that the clown was experienced: He knew well how to  get the people to laugh and how to get them interested.    At present, there are two main sociopolitical ideologies in  Ukraine--the national and the social. These ideologies do not  exist in a completely autonomous manner, they penetrate each  other. Hey, even the most obstinate nationalist wants to eat,  and the most avowed socialist remembers what his nationality is.  However, each of them lays a different emphasis on food and the  nation. For some, "an independent Ukraine" is continuously lit  up on the display of their consciousness, and for others, it is  "I want to live well." Some are prepared to eat poorly or even  die for a free Ukraine, whereas others may, under certain  conditions, give up its independence.    In keeping with the above, we will have two main platforms,  the left and the right, in our elections. The left consists  mainly of the Socialists, the Communists, and the peasant party;  the right--of the Republicans, the Democrats, the Rukh people,  and so on. It is not known whether various parties of the left  persuasion will dare to unite with the Communists or among  themselves. Right-wing parties have announced the creation of  the Standing Council (PDN) to coordinate candidates and efforts.    A third force, which we may conventionally call the "new  democrats," has undoubtedly quite clearly emerged in Ukraine.  These are for the most part former Communists who deliberately  and clearly embarked on the path of our statehood and a market  economy on the basis of private and joint-stock property.  Nevertheless, for ethical and tactical considerations they do  not go for an alliance with parties of a rightist orientation.  This primarily concerns the Party of Democratic Revival of  Ukraine and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. A considerable number  of politicians, such as Ivan Plyushch, belong to this wing.    If we try to classify in principle those on whom the efforts  of the parties will be targeted, we may distinguish two main  types of voters. Politically aware individuals whom agitation  does not influence at all because they have long known who to  vote for are the first type. Those who are socially, or  "sausage-wise," aware belong to the second type. They voted in  favor of the independence of Ukraine mainly because they  believed in a better life under conditions of independence. They  have now been deeply disappointed.    It is hard to say precisely what the number of voters of  this  type is on the whole or in individual regions. However, we may  already say two things with certainty: Such voters are the  majority, and their political culture and competency are a  veritable "black box," a mixture of "mush" of various kinds.  These people are desperate. They are worn out, and they do not  trust anyone anymore. At present, they are saying indignantly  while standing in lines that they will not turn out to vote. If  they do turn out, who will they vote for? Probably there will be  no votes for the Communists and Socialists if they do not  disguise themselves. They carry around baggage that is too  infamous. As far as the national-democrats are concerned, a  considerable proportion of the "sausage-minded" treat them with  aggressive fury. They say that, first, under the democrats  everything has fallen apart and worsened. Second, in the eyes of  the "sausage-minded," the democrats have turned out to be the  same thieves as the partocrats. "They are all the same"--such is  the motto of the lines in stores.    The truth about the allocation of apartments to some  deputies  and the purchase of cars shortly before prices for them were  raised is intertwined with bizarre gossip. Attempts to convince  the people that Larysa Skoryk did not buy three cars and that  she does not have a four-floor dacha bring nothing but sneers.    Recently I learned that parquet floors have been laid in the  building at Pryrichna Street where some deputies live and that  there is even a cafeteria there to which sugar, butter, meat,  and other foodstuffs are delivered, and that prices in the  cafeterias and the canteen of the Supreme Council are one-third  of what they are in the stores. If only these people knew that  not only are the parquet floors and the cafeteria absent but  that the deputies rarely manage to get even sugar and butter  distributed through lists drawn up by housing maintenance  offices. Prices in the cafeterias of the Supreme Council are at  restaurant levels, and for this reason there are always few  people there.    On one occasion I ventured to identify myself as a deputy  while in line for milk; in response I heard a unanimous roar of  laughter. A man with a clearly rural background stated: "He  would not be standing here if he were a deputy. What a joker!"  [rendered in Russian in the original] He told a story about the  deputies recently having "started a fight among themselves in  the Supreme Council store." [rendered in Russian in the  original] There is no such store. So I understood a few truths.  First: Lies of this kind can only be circulated in a purposeful,  thought-out, and planned manner, with a knowledge of the  mentality of the citizens. Second: The stream of "information"  of this kind will greatly increase as the elections draw nearer.    There is no doubt that few of the current deputies will  succeed in breaking through to the new Supreme Council. The  waiting line for milk will not vote for the current democratic  deputies. The line is looking for those who are guilty. It may  even deal with them the way it dealt with the Tsar's family,  capitalists, well-to-do peasants, and enemies of the people. The  line is listening to a third force, which will promise them firm  order. The line does not wish to know anything about the  platforms of blocs. The line awaits specific promises for  tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and those making the  promises will not be long in coming.    They will promise to some to do away with lines, to some--to  pay back the money in saving banks, to others--to set high  salaries, to still others--to close down stands and force  vendors to go work at plants, and to yet others they will  promise a second state language, and they will promise everyone  together that they will be financially disinterested, stop trips  abroad, and vanquish the mafia. And if here and there they also  foster hopes for a return to the ruble zone.... Thus, the step  of the Zhirinovskiys is already heard. The social protest of the  waiting lines is good enough soil for them. An alliance between  the Zhirinovskiys of Russia and Ukraine may become a reality,  too. A powerful opposition front should also become a reality,  which, proceeding from the experience of elections in Russia,  will call for a number of prerequisites.    First. The number of criteria for resolving the  issue of who among the deputies is "ours" or "not ours" should  be reduced. Under certain conditions, the national-democrats  should give support to all who advocate independence, even the  Socialists. The Socialists should do the same. After all, the  threat of a dictatorship is real. The wisdom of the people can  hardly be relied upon. The people are wise, but it was precisely  the people who brought Hitler to power in a constitutional  manner; the people who voted for Stalin for almost 30 years; the  people who rose up from their seats and clapped their hands in  the era of "tits-ema-tits" [phonetic approximation of Brezhnev's  way of pronouncing the word "systematic"], when yet another  leader kept on talking about the general crisis of capitalism.  Contenders for leaders are now numerous, and the election law  makes it possible for virtually everyone to "stick out."    Second. Preelection agitation should be  exhaustive. Democracy is not just a choice, it is a choice in an  environment of sufficient information. Will our parties be able  to give people clear-cut promises substantiated in their words  instead of hard-to-understand platforms? People believe promises  rather than theories.    As far as the democrats are concerned, their success will  depend on whether they will be able to debunk three myths: 1)  the myth that "independence is to blame for everything"; 2) the  myth that "the democrats are to blame" for the economic  collapse; 3) the myth that "they (i.e., the democrats) sold out  for cars and low cafeteria prices." The democrats do not have  much time--one month per myth....    From the author: I request that the honorarium be  transferred to the VECHIRNIY KYYIV Fund.</p>

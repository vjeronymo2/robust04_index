The amnesty "puts a constructive dialogue (between the  president and the parliament) under big doubt", Pain told TASS  on Wednesday adding that it would not promote stability in  society either.    However, he stressed that the Duma decision should not  postpone the presidential address as it is a message "not only  to the Federal Assembly, but to the whole society".    On Wednesday the Duma overwhelmingly voted to declare an  amnesty to organisers of the 1991 Soviet coup, of the armed  opposition revolt in Moscow last year and of the hard-line  demonstration in May 1993. All the three events resulted in  bloodshed.    Pain, who is a member of the Presidential Council, regretted  that the faction headed by Sergey Shakhray also voted to pardon  the rebels. "It is regretful that the amnesty for political  adventurists was supported by the faction with the name of  "Russian Unity and Accord".</p>

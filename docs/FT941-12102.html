			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Suppliers adopt relaxed stance - Suppliers' Opportunity The bigger players in the UK motor components industry were taking a relaxed view of the takeover last night. Companies like T&amp;N and Lucas have a manufacturing presence in most car-producing nations of what has become a global industry. Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N's chairman and a past president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'From our point of view it's neither negative nor positive. As a first-tier supplier, with plants in both countries, we have always assumed that a continuing rationalisation of the car industry would take place. So there is nothing dramatic about this when it involves the linkage of two of our customers who are already well established'. However, the deal was seen as enhancing the prospects of smaller UK-based suppliers which do not have any significant overseas presence. Many such suppliers have improved their efficiency and productivity as a result of their links with best-practice Japanese 'transplant' car factories in the UK. This, coupled with low labour and other costs in the UK, compared with Germany, is likely to prompt BMW to scour the UK more rigorously for cheaper alternatives to German parts. So far, however, BMW has been slower than other German car makers to increase components purchases in the UK. Whereas Volkswagen expects to spend about Pounds 400m on UK components this year - double 1992 levels - there has been little increase on BMW's 1992 total UK spend of some Pounds 120m - a figure that includes purchase of all goods and services. Mr Graham Perkins, motor industry specialist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountant, noted that 'already UK suppliers are being inundated with German estimate requests'. With cost considerations pushing the German car manufacturers to widen their sources of components, Mr Joe Gormezano of Knibb, Gormezano, the motor industry consultants, said: 'Going in with Rover will give BMW access to a number of component suppliers'. Against such a background, there are two niggling fears. First, that BMW might use its new position as an opportunity to help their established German suppliers, desperate for work. Second, that BMW might take back to Germany the research and development work Rover is doing with its systems suppliers.</p>

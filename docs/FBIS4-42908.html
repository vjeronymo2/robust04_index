			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["M.K"-initialed report: "Restrictions on Imports From </F> China Restricted"]    [Text] Bonn -- Four leading German economic associations  -- the Foreign Trade Association of Retail Trade, the Federal  Association of German Industry, the German Industrial and Trade  Congress, and the Federal Association of German Wholesale and  Foreign Trade -- are calling for an end to the restrictions on  imports from China, and have also expressed disappointment with  talks between the European Union Commission and a Chinese  delegation that yielded no results.    Quotas of Chinese imports are even lower than in 1993, so  that trade deals that have already been concluded can no longer  be implemented. Last but not least, virtually no orders can be  placed because it is not known how many import permits will be  issued. This is endangering the existence of importers. All  this can be blamed on EU errors in the management of quotas.  The restrictive practice is jeopardizing export chances.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 05, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs emphasized in an interview that Latvia is ready for  all-round cooperation with Estonia and Lithuania.    During Birkavs' term of office, Baltic cooperation at the  highest level has quickly developed, but also strong competition  has sprung up. There are disagreements on building an oil  terminal and on cooperation between aviation companies.    The Latvian premier regarded the oil terminal construction  as  the main problem at present. He added that Latvia and Lithuania  have considered the option of building the terminal in the  Latvian port of Liepaja instead of Butinge in Lithuania, and  that Lithuania has already taken steps to implement the plan.    Birkavs recalled that, during the recent discussion in the  United Nations of a resolution on human rights violations in the  Baltic states, Latvia threw its backing behind Estonia. "We  decided that we'd rather risk a common defeat than proceed from  different positions," he said.    Commenting on the border question, Birkavs underlined that  "Latvia doesn't intend to dig any ditches on its boundaries with  Estonia and Lithuania." He said the three countries have reached  agreement that only people entering any one of the states are  checked on the border. Plans for a common Baltic economic space  and for consolidating the border with Russia are under work, the  premier added.    With regard to the Petseri and the Abrene regions, Birkavs  said the issue has to be solved at interstate negotiations.  Latvia and Russia disagree about the jurisdiction over the  Abrene region similarly to the Estonian-Russian disagreement  over the Petseri region.    Asked about the weapons of the Latvian armed forces, the  premier said approaching NATO doesn't necessarily mean that arms  used by NATO have to be taken into use. He attached top priority  however to abandoning the former Soviet standards and  guaranteeing the security of the state.    Birkavs said Latvia, too, is negotiating an arms deal with  Israel, and that the country hopes for credit from Israel on  favorable terms. Birkavs claimed the question will be solved  this year.</p>

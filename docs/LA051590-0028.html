			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MARTIN OUT OF CHARACTER AS 'BAD-BOY' IN 'ILLUMINATIONS'  </P> <P> Douglas Martin is a handsome and technically accomplished young dancer whose  height and partnering prowess alone would justify his prominence during the  current Joffrey Ballet season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> However, casting him in the stellar "bad-boy" roles of the repertory -- first  Billy the Kid last week and, on Sunday afternoon, the Rimbaud character in  Frederick Ashton's "Illuminations" -- forces Martin way out of his depth as an  actor.  </P> <P> He works hard to conquer all the movement challenges and knows how to hold  attention through sheer presence, but something fundamentally decent in his  nature undercuts every attempt to seem venal.  </P> <P> When he throws himself on top of the character called Profane Love (a rather  aimlessly jittery Julie Janus), this Rimbaud arches his back all right, but it  isn't sex, it's choreography. Significantly, Martin's best moment in the ballet  is his disgusted final rejection of her.  </P> <P> Replacing Daniel Baudendistel in "Lacrymosa" on Sunday night, Martin broods  superbly -- coming between Jodie Gates and Edward Stierle in a portrayal of the  enigmatic man in black that suggests hidden depths. But, for now, both "Billy"  and "Illuminations" are better served with other Joffrey casts.  </P> <P> Several new "Cotillon" principals interacted well with previously reviewed  artists on Sunday afternoon. Charlene Gehm made an elegant-unto-brittle  Mistress of Ceremonies: perfect for a ballet with lots of secrets under the  fancy-dress vivacity. Cameron Basden danced the Young Girl's friend with an  effective, carefree attack. However, Janus looked strained and listless as the  glamorous predator in the "Hand of Fate" pas de deux -- another Joffrey dancer  who's no good at being bad. LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES HEAR DEBATE ON PROP. 103, APPEAR DIVIDED  </P> <P> Members of an apparently divided state Supreme Court sharply questioned a  battery of attorneys Tuesday in an exhaustive and highly charged debate over  the constitutionality of Proposition 103, the sweeping insurance reform  initiative approved by voters last November.  </P> <P> From the often-spirited questions by the justices, there appeared to be  significant division within the court on the multitude of issues that have  arisen in the case.  </P> <P> The court's two most liberal members -- Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E.  Broussard -- closely interrogated the insurance industry's lawyer as he  attacked the validity of the measure. But perhaps its most conservative member,  Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, peppered the measure's defenders with a series of  questions, expressing doubt that insurers could be required to provide policies  at a loss.  </P> <P> Other justices were less aggressive, but no less intent, in their own  questioning of the lawyers in the case. But it was far from clear what the  outcome will be when the court issues a decision.  </P> <P> The 90-minute argument took place in the most far-reaching case to come before  the newly aligned court since the departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth  Bird and two other court members, who were defeated in the fall, 1986,  election.  </P> <P> The decision will affect millions of Californians holding auto, casualty and  property insurance. At stake is an estimated $4 billion in premium reductions  under the measure, along with broad new governmental control over an industry  that has been relatively unregulated in the past. The case has drawn nationwide  attention, because similar regulatory proposals are being considered in 17  other states.  </P> <P> The dispute has also focused new attention -- and potentially conflicting  pressures -- on the seven justices. As a generally conservative court, it might  be expected to side with business, in this instance the insurance industry. But  the justices also might be inclined to defer to the will of the voters, another  course often taken by conservative courts.  </P> <P> The hearing took place in a jam-packed courtroom, filled to its 102-seat  capacity with lawyers, legislators, officials and reporters. Proceedings were  televised to an overflow audience outside, as well as the nearby Capitol.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earlier Ruling Possible  </P> <P> The justices, under newly adopted internal procedures, are due to issue a  ruling within 90 days. But with the case already under consideration by the  court for four months, an earlier decision may be forthcoming.  </P> <P> The lawyer leading the attack on the measure said the initiative was laden with  invalid provisions and must be struck down by the court in its entirety.  </P> <P> "Proposition 103 was drafted in a hasty manner and in total disregard for the  constitutions of both the state of California and the United States," said  Frank Rothman, a Los Angeles attorney representing the insurance industry. "It  should not have been submitted to the voters."  </P> <P> Defenders of the measure countered that the dramatic rate rollbacks and other  provisions were a lawful way of curtailing runaway insurance costs. If any  portion is struck down, they said, the rest of the initiative should remain in  effect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cried Out for Reform'  </P> <P> "The voters have clearly expressed their outrage over the insurance crisis,"  said state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, making a rare personal appearance  before the court. "The voters found that the current system of  non-accountability and non-regulation, of special legislative privileges and  corporate collusion, cried out for reform."  </P> <P> Joseph W. Cotchett, a Burlingame lawyer representing sponsors of the  initiative, implored the justices to allow most of the measure to take effect,  even if some parts were invalidated.  </P> <P> Speaking expansively as though he were addressing a jury, Cotchett told the  court: "If you find the rollback discriminatory, that can be 'severed out,' "  he said. "You could still have a very good and workable insurance reform  package enacted into law."  </P> <P> Under the initiative, insurance rates would be reduced 20% below their  November, 1987, levels and held in place until November, 1989, with exceptions  allowed only when an insurer shows a "substantial threat of insolvency." After  that period, any rate increases would be subject to approval of an elected  state insurance commissioner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Details of Provisions  </P> <P> Other provisions would sharply limit auto policy cancellations and  non-renewals; base auto insurance rates more on drivers' records and less on  where they live; allow banks to sell insurance; remove insurers' exemption from  state antitrust laws, and establish a nonprofit, independent corporation to  advocate consumer interests.  </P> <P> Insurance companies filed suit challenging the initiative the day after the  Nov. 8 election, charging that it was unconstitutional on several grounds. In  December, the justices agreed to hear the insurers' challenge, but allowed the  measure to take effect except for the rate rollbacks and creation of a consumer  advocacy corporation.  </P> <P> Rothman argued that the consumer advocacy provision conflicted with  constitutional prohibitions against the creation of private corporations by  initiative and thus should not even have gone on the ballot.  </P> <P> The rate rollback, reduction and freeze, he said, were virtually unprecedented  in the law and denied insurers their right to a fair return on their policies.  Procedures for obtaining an exception to the cutbacks were too cumbersome and  time-consuming to provide effective relief, he said.  </P> <P> And if the rate cutbacks are struck down, the entire measure must be  invalidated, Rothman contended. Sponsors had offered the voters a "free lunch"  of popular but legally invalid rollbacks with the aim of achieving enactment of  other less-noticed provisions, he said.  </P> <P> "It was an effort to bait and switch," Rothman said. "They offered the  California public something very appealing and exciting -- a 20% decrease in  insurance rates -- and said that it wouldn't cost the voters a penny.  Meanwhile, there were other parts of the initiative that remained effectively  hidden."  </P> <P> Mosk and Broussard pressed the attorney with questions, suggesting that it  should be up to the industry to demonstrate factually that the rollbacks were  confiscatory. But Rothman responded that the rate reduction process was  unconstitutional on its face and should be struck down now.  </P> <P> Two other attorneys, representing the American Council of Life &amp; Health  Insurance of America and the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of  California, joined Rothman in urging the court to declare the initiative  invalid.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, named as a defendant in the suit, told the court that the  initiative was a valid attempt to combat "sloth, waste and inefficiency" in the  insurance industry.  </P> <P> Kaufman vigorously questioned the attorney general, suggesting that under the  initiative's procedures, it might take years for an insurance company to obtain  relief from sharp cutbacks in rates.  </P> <P> "Would it be legal to force companies to offer policies below cost for up to  six years?" Kaufman asked. Van de Kamp replied that it was "inaccurate" to  suggest that rate relief could not be expedited by both the insurance  commissioner and, if necessary, the courts.  </P> <P> Kaufman also sharply interrogated Karl M. Manheim, a Loyola Law School  professor defending the initiative.  </P> <P> "How can the state of California require an insurance carrier to provide  insurance at less than its cost?" asked the justice. The professor replied that  the court should allow such a provision to take effect as a "rational" attempt  to curtail rates, while allowing insurers an opportunity to challenge the  rollbacks later as excessive.  </P></p>

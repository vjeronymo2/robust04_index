			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRAFT WORTH CELEBRATING FOR SALKELD FAMILY  </P> <P> 'Twas the night before the baseball amateur draft and all through the house,  everyone was stirring -- except Roger Salkeld.  </P> <P> "He was the first one to go to bed last night and the last one to get up this  morning," Elaine Salkeld said of her son Monday morning.  </P> <P> This was the day for which the Salkeld family had waited. Bill Salkeld, whose  father, William, played eight years in the big leagues with the Pirates, White  Sox and Boston Braves, admittedly had longed to see the family name back in pro  baseball.  </P> <P> Roger Salkeld, who was born four years after his grandfather died, was only a  phone call away from making his father's dream come true.  </P> <P> Throughout the season, Salkeld, Saugus High's 6-foot-5 senior right-hander with  the major league fastball, had been projected to be an early draft choice.  </P> <P> Yet, on the biggest day of his life, he was anything but an early riser.  </P> <P> "I sleep fine," Salkeld said, smiling. "You've heard about kids who can't sleep  before Christmas? Not me."  </P> <P> Salkeld, however, was up and about in time to answer the telephone at 10:31  a.m. To the surprise of almost no one, Salkeld had been selected by the Seattle  Mariners as the No. 3 pick in the nation.  </P> <P> "He just said, 'Congratulations' and 'You have been selected,' " Salkeld said.  "I don't even remember his name. After that, he wanted to talk to my dad. That  was about it."  </P> <P> The phone call kicked off a day-long, open-door celebration at the Salkeld  house. Teammates, coaches, family and friends gathered amid a carnival-like  atmosphere with banners and barbecued hot dogs, streamers and helium-filled  balloons.  </P> <P> Salkeld, who has a collection of every major league hat, donned Mariner  headgear and mingled among guests between fielding phone calls from  well-wishers and reporters. Newspaper photographers -- anyone with a camera,  really -- wanted a shot of the most famous pitcher in Saugus High history.  </P> <P> Saugus Coach Doug Worley announced that a ceremony would be held to retire  Salkeld's No. 15 jersey. Worley, a Seattle native and Mariner fan, was  delighted by the news and said that the Centurions, who are scheduled to  receive new uniforms next season, might be outfitted to resemble the Mariners.  </P> <P> "He was dancing around here with different hats on," Worley said. "I said, 'Get  that hat off.' I'm happy that he was drafted high."  </P> <P> A beaming Bill Salkeld, whose father blasted a home run off Cleveland Indian  Hall of Famer Bob Feller in the 1948 World Series, offered an extended hand to  everyone who walked through his front door.  </P> <P> "My dream was to bring back my father's name," he said. "It's wonderful. It's a  West Coast team. We couldn't have asked for anything better."  </P> <P> Salkeld, who three years ago was a baby-faced freshman summoned to join the  varsity, is now on the threshold of becoming a bonus baby.  </P> <P> Contract negotiations are scheduled to begin next week, according to Dave Aust,  director of public relations for the Mariners.  </P> <P> Aust declined comment regarding a signing bonus. Bill Salkeld, who will serve  as his son's agent, also declined comment, saying only that he would request "a  fair offer for a first-round pick."  </P> <P> Last season, Steve Avery, a high school pitcher from Michigan now with the  Atlanta Braves' at the Class-A level, was the third player selected. He  received a signing bonus reported to be $211,000.  </P> <P> No decision has been made regarding where Salkeld will be assigned, Aust said.  </P> <P> "We want to get him signed," Aust said. "Obviously, when you're picked third,  you're one of the best arms in the country."  </P> <P> </P> <P> STATWATCH  </P> <P> Roger Salkeld's career pitching statistics at Saugus High.  </P> <P> CATEGORY: TOTAL  </P> <P> Record: 30-7  </P> <P> Strikeouts: 404  </P> <P> Complete Games: 30  </P> <P> Innings pitched: 266 1/3  </P> <P> Shutouts: 12  </P> <P> Saves: 11  </P> <P> No-hitters: 1  </P> <P> One-hitters: 7  </P> <P> Earned-run average: 1.31  </P></p>

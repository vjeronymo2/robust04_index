			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Hosokawa reassures Kim over N Korea Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said yesterday that his country was ready to support UN sanctions against North Korea if the need arose. In a meeting with South Korean President Kim Young-sam in Tokyo, Mr Hosokawa advised, however, that the UN Security Council should proceed cautiously on the nuclear inspection dispute with North Korea and attempt to maintain dialogue with Pyongyang. If the dispute escalated to a point that sanctions would be imposed, Japan would implement all measures that are permitted by the Japanese constitution, he said. But that condition left open the possibility that Japan might refuse on constitutional grounds to stop the flow of funds to North Korea from pro-Northern Korean-Japanese. The funds, which are estimated to amount to Dollars 600m (Pounds 410m) to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn) annually, are regarded as a vital source of foreign revenue for North Korea, which uses the money to pay for necessary oil and food supplies. Mr Kim arrived in Tokyo yesterday for a three-day visit before going to China, where he will ask Beijing to intervene with North Korea and convince it of the need to accept international inspections. Meanwhile, Japanese Emperor Akihito last night expressed a 'sense of deep sorrow' about his country's harsh colonial rule of Korea between 1910 and 1945. Seoul's resentment over Japanese rule has been an obstacle in relations between the two countries. Watching weapons, Page 14</p>

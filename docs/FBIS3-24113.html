			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] As is known, Armenia's SANS was subjected to  restructuring in accordance with the president's decree on 14  January. Ashot Manucharyan, the president's former adviser on  national security affairs, spoke about that measure during his  press conference yesterday and described it as the work of the  special services of countries hostile to Armenia. He came to  that conclusion in the presence of reporters by "shattering" all  official and unofficial theories published in the press.  According to Manucharyan, the said decree practically  annihilated the SANS and destroyed the network of agents and  that this helps only the special services of hostile nations  because the official measure--that is to suspend the  Administration's work for 3 months and to certify its staff--is  unacceptable. After all, he said, the staff could be certified  without suspending their activities. Mr Manucharyan added that  the said decree must definitely be reconsidered and that a  special commission must be created to review the process by  which that decision was taken and to find the culprits. He  added: "The hostile hand must be found as soon as possible."</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Does the state have a claim? In 1989, I gave my mother the money to buy the council house (under the Right to Buy provisions) in which she was living. It was necessary to leave the house in her name, but she made a will leaving the house to me on her death. Now, at 87, she is still living in the house and, although in relatively good health, is becoming increasingly frail. I am concerned about the situation with regard to the house (value around Pounds 50,000) should she reach the point where we could not care for her and she requires supervised state housing. My mother believes that, should this happen, the house would be sold and the proceeds appropriated by the state. Is this correct? Would she have no say regarding how the money was dealt? What would happen if she lived for only a short time under state care? Suppose the house was sold, she moved in with us, the money was gifted to me and the grandchildren, and she subsequently required state housing. Would there be a claim on the money? We have researched the law relating to the query raised in your letter, and we have concluded that, as your mother has occupied the house for more than three years after exercising her right to buy (and, indeed, buying the house), there can be no interference with her ownership or with any of the proceeds realised on sale. We can find no evidence that the Crown has the power to appropriate anything. All replies are by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

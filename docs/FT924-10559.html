			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Bush and Clinton trade insults as president narrows poll gap ALL PRETENSIONS to politeness in the US presidential campaign are now in tatters. Governor Bill Clinton and President George Bush are directly trading charges that each is unworthy of the public trust, while Mr Ross Perot continues to belittle both as incapable of leading the country. The heat is being generated against the background of fresh public opinion polls which agree that Mr Bush is narrowing the gap but differ wildly on by how much. Surveys out in the past 24 hours put Mr Clinton ahead by as much as 10 points (the Washington Post) and as little as 3 points in the latest CNN/USA Today poll released last night. Most also found Mr Perot was no longer on the rise. The big change has been in Mr Clinton's approach towards Mr Bush. Yesterday in Toledo, Ohio, he angrily charged that 'the American people must see him for what he is - a desperate person who just wants to hold on to power and doesn't give a rip about them'. Though Mr Clinton continues to pound away with his economic message, it is now thoroughly mixed with assaults on Mr Bush's character. This amounts to a tactical shift brought about by relentless personal attacks by the president. Yesterday, in Michigan, Mr Bush himself shifted tack, perhaps concluding that he had drawn enough blood for the moment with his disparagement of the characters of Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore. Instead, he returned again to his great encouragement of the week, the improvement in economic output in the third quarter. Mr Clinton, he charged, had no understanding of the global economy, did not appreciate that the US was outperforming its rivals and would put recovery at risk. In a rare appearance on the campaign trail in Denver on Wednesday night, Mr Perot attacked the other candidates indiscriminately. He ridiculed Mr Clinton because the principal business of the governor's state of Arkansas was raising chickens - 'and these are not jobs which will pass on the American dream to our children'. Mr Bush's attitude, he said, was that, 'if you don't do anything, things will work out'. He urged a crowd of enthusiasts to 'vote your conscience and confound the pollsters and media'.

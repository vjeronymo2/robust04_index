			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 24 </F> February--recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Honorable audience, at last  year's banquet, I said that only the state can genuinely express  the national will of the Lebanese people. The state is above  all, greater than all, safeguards the rights of all, and  protects the future and unity of all Lebanese. I must  reemphasize these points at the threshold of a historic period  in our national life that demands we maintain the greatest  vigilance and solidarity and anything that will spare the  country's indulgence in petty disputes or one-upmanship.    Lebanon is facing internal and external challenges demanding  the mobilization of efforts on every political, economic, and  social level. They also demand that we reemphasize the state's  necessary and basic role in our national society. Any future  role by Lebanon will remain the target of containment and attack  unless the Lebanese state--society and authority--rises to the  level of this role, the hopes being pinned on Lebanon in the  coming years, and the aspirations of the Lebanese, who are  seeking progress and who strongly believe that the elements of  progress have become stronger than the elements of anarchy and  uncertainty.    I would like to emphasize the following main points:    1. The Lebanese state has primary responsibility for  liberating the south and Western al-Biqa' from the Israeli  occupation. It highlights the Lebanese people's right to use  every means to achieve the goal of total and comprehensive  Israeli withdrawal, the implementation of UN Security Council  Resolution 425, and Lebanese authority over all the occupied  territory. Foiling Israel's attempt to undermine progress  toward peace is a national effort in which we must all be  involved, because the resistance of Israel is not achieved only  with weapons. It is also achieved by political, diplomatic, and  social means. We must choose the time and place and mobilize  all our resources for it. We are not alone in this field. The  fraternal Arab states led by Syria stand by us, support our  legitimate rights, and understand our situation. The results of  the Geneva summit between the Syrian and U.S. presidents confirm  that we are not alone and that the Lebanese constants are  receiving support, because they express the conviction of a  people and the choices of a country. The friendly countries  also hasten to assist us and respond to our wishes when we ask  them to intervene.    Brothers, the delicate stage through which the Middle East,  including Lebanon, is passing, together with the difficulties  experienced in the Washington talks and the appearance of more  than one trend in them, demand that the Lebanese people maintain  their solidarity and unite their position in the face of the  renewed Israeli ambitions. Efforts in any direction must be  collective, not individual, objective, not random, and  complementary, not partial, to achieve the desired results,  utilizing all the legitimate means for an effective united  endeavor. The responsibility is great and collective. May we  be able to shoulder it together. God helps those who are united.    2. The Lebanese state is responsible for safeguarding the  people's security and implementing the law. It will allow no  party to usurp its role in this regard or harm the general and  personal safety of the Lebanese.    3. The concurrence between the will to liberate the land  from  Israeli occupation and the will for development and  reconstruction is a central policy in the process of specifying  the role of the Lebanese state. The state that works for  development is the state that can liberate its land from  occupation. Development is synonymous with liberation and must  not contradict it under any circumstance or for any reason.    4. The Lebanese national peace must be based on the  principle  of coordination with Syria and strengthening the relations  between the two countries to fortify the Lebanese position in  the face of regional challenges and prevent Lebanon from being  isolated in the next stages of the developments, whether with  regard to peace or steadfastness. [passage omitted]    5. Lebanon has made good progress in moving from a regime  that handles the crisis to a regime that works to solve the  crisis. The constitutional and legal institutions established  as a result of the al-Ta'if Agreement are a sound national  expression of the will for transformation, which we think there  is urgent need to emphasize right now and in the face of any  parties that wish to keep Lebanon swinging between crises and  solutions.    6. Rebuilding the state does not begin by violating the law.  In the face of this, we must not call for the revival of the  state and compete to defend the democratic system and at the  same time violate the democratic principles and laws. The just  law of the state must prevail over all and be the judge among  all. [passage omitted]    7. Balanced economic development is the principal policy  according to which a fair country must act. It is the principal  policy according to which we as a government act. We want our  activity to cover all the Lebanese areas, particularly the areas  that have historically been deprived of and isolated from state  services and benefits. [passage omitted]    Honorable audience, the common denominator among all the  points I have mentioned is the state and its role. We will be  making a big mistake if we think that usurping one part of the  state's role to benefit a specific party could enrich that party  and make it stronger against other parties. I am confident that  the state will prevail, through your will and efforts,  irrespective of opposition by parties that feel they have been  harmed as a result. We will maintain our policy on  reconciliation, unity, and development. [passage omitted]</p>

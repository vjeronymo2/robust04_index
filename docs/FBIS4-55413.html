			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 15 May (TANJUG) -- In their  attacks on some areas in the republic of Srpska [in  Bosnia-Herzegovina] Muslim units have once again used chemical  weapons, representatives of the VRS [army of the republic of  Srpska] said today. Serb defensive positions on Mount Majevica  and in Mala, Velika Jelaca, and Lisaca have been attacked by  Muslims using shells filled with chlorine-based chemicals. In  their attacks on Serbs from the Tuzla area Muslim units used  chemicals on several occasions, although international  conventions prohibit the use of such weapons. [passage omitted]</p>

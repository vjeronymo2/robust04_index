			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>   [Text] Sofia, January 7 (BTA) -- Today TRUD frontpages a  disclosure of President Zhelyu Zhelev's intention to take over  direct command of the Bulgarian Army. According to his  classified letter, circulated in 300 copies down the military  chain of command last November, the president's advisors in his  military office will rank as deputy commanders of an armed  service to deputy chiefs of General Staff. The daily quotes the  letter in full and cites anonymous experts in constitutional law  as describing the act as a flagrant violation of the  Constitution. "They do not rule out the possibility of  demanding the president's removal from office in pursuance of  Article 103 of Bulgarian Constitution," TRUD adds. A signed  commentary in the same daily stresses that if President Zhelev  nevertheless survives this scandal, he will have to learn a good  lesson. For its part, the Socialists' daily DUMA quotes a  well-known anonymous politician as saying that Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov was kept in the dark about the letter for several  weeks. Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of General Staff of  the Bulgarian Army, declined to comment on the president's order  for DUMA yesterday.</p>

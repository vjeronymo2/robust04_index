			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Police threaten 'open conflict': Sheehy urges radical shake-up of existing structure - Officers warn of consequences THE GOVERNMENT was warned by the Police Federation yesterday that it risked 'open conflict' with the police service if it adopted radical proposals for changing pay and conditions of employment. Recommendations from a government-appointed inquiry chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT industries, constitute one of the most radical packages of change ever proposed in the public sector. It would lead to all police officers eventually being employed on limited-term contracts, with pay related to individual performance and the demands of particular jobs. The Police Federation, which represents all officers up to the rank of chief inspector, said that the Sheehy recommendations would turn police work from a vocation into a 'job like any other job'. That would have serious implications for the way the service operated. The prospect of conflict was also recognised in a comment by Mr Eric Caines, a member of the Sheehy inquiry team and former industrial relations director of the National Health Service. He said the public sector was 'notorious' in its attitude to change, and many hurdles would have to be overcome before the recommendations were implemented. The Police Superintendents' Association warned: 'If the recommendations are implemented we will not be able to recruit, retain and motivate officers of the best quality.' But a more positive initial reaction came from Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of the Association of Chief Police Officers. He welcomed the recommendations for a new pay formula and more managerial freedom for chief constables. The report - combined with Monday's Home Office white paper proposing the restructuring of police authorities on more businesslike lines and other changes - sets the scene for the biggest programme of police reform in modern times. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will consider reactions to the report until September before making final decisions on its 272 recommendations. Many of the proposed changes would require legislation, and a bill is likely in the autumn. Introducing the report yesterday, Sir Patrick said that promotion was now the only reward for efficiency in the police. He said that the system of pay awards related to length of service was not conducive to efficiency.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 6 May -- The faulty valve in circuit No.  2 of the third set at the Beloyarsk nuclear power station, which  caused today's leak of nonradioactive sodium, is now being  repaired, ITAR-TASS was told by the press centre of the Russian  Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy.    Specialists stress that there was not a fire at the station.  The incident involved only the ignition of liquid sodium  escaping into the atmosphere. This is a perfectly logical  chemical reaction, which will cease once the valve has been  repaired and sodium stops leaking into the atmosphere. The  accident has been assessed at level one on the seven-point  international scale of incidents at nuclear power stations.  [passage omitted]</p>

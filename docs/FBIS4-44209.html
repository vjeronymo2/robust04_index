			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe Tatarella by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Regions, a Mine  Defused"]    [Text] Tatarella, Berlusconi's deputy in the government,  comes flying to the rescue only on two specific conditions:  That there is a problem, and that the problem is considered  impossible to solve. "Minister of Harmony" is how the man that  [National Alliance, AN, leader] Fini chose to put into the  executive to redress the balance on the Right likes to refer to  himself. Just listen to the sibylline formula that the  telecommunications minister used to "advise" the wise men at the  RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] to leave the RAI of their  own free will: "I hope that the guardians of public service  impartiality, the interpreters of both the spirit and the letter  of the law, will always have a home in Viale Mazzini and Saxa  Rubra [RAI buildings]."    Strictly according to the rules, in other words, Dematte and  company are safe. But in actual fact, following the political  changes brought by the two elections on 27 March and 12 June, it  is up to them, the old governors, to have the tact to resign.  So, is this the guardians' last week, in view of the imminent  revision of the save-the-RAI decree? "I do not have the agenda  to hand," says Tatarella evasively. The AN deputy thus granted  IL GIORNALE this first interview in his role as deputy prime  minister to talk solely about the great reform. And, at least  in part, this is his prerogative, as Tatarella has just pulled  off another of his feats, this time an institutional one, by  bringing the exponents of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and  the League into agreement on the subject on which they were most  divided, regional autonomy. The cabinet is now about to approve  a constitutional bill that, for the first time ever, brings  together presidential government and federalism: the direct  election of the presidents of the regional governments and a  majority system for all 15 regular regions. On the basis of  this unitary principle, each region will adopt the electoral  model that it prefers: one-tier, French-style two-tier,  three-way second ballot of the type practiced in Sardinia, and  so on.    [Guiglia] A lot of smoke and no fire, this is what the  opposition is saying. Will a bill of this sort ever see the  light of day?    [Tatarella] All fire and no smoke, and the fact that Salvi  of  the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and Rotondi of the  [Italian] Popular Party [PPI] are so cross about it is exactly  what proves it. They are the ones making the smoke. Using old  tactics, they had sent up smoke signals indicating agreement  around [Institutional Reform Minister] Speroni's original  proposal to delegate the electoral system to the regions. But  this signal really concealed an attempt to get the government  coalition to fall out. The attempt failed miserably. The  executive will examine the Speroni bill, amended to take account  of our demands, which emerged from the meetings held between AN  and the League, between Fini and Bossi, and between the experts,  Fisichella and Miglio, even before the government was born.    [Guiglia] Which side made more concessions, the Northern  League or the AN?    [Tatarella] Neither, and I am definitely not saying so for  diplomatic reasons. It was a matter of incorporating the burden  of the talks that our two delegations had had beforehand into  the proposal drafted by the institutional reform minister. We  had to combine the AN's demand for direct democracy with the  League's demand for local democracy and autonomy. An ad hoc  committee comprising Maroni, Del Debbio, and myself had been  appointed at [Education Minister] D'Onofrio's suggestion, and  all we did was reconvene it, as Berlusconi suggested. This way  we arrived at the decision to stand by the agreed program, all  under the guidance of Minister Speroni.    [Guiglia] And what if it turned out to be just a wonderful,  unattainable project?    [Tatarella] It is a challenge to the opposition. Let it come  out into the open and, instead of thinking about the leader that  is no more, start thinking about the reform that may be. And  let it start now, otherwise it might give grounds for suspicion  that the opposition wants to slow the pace of regional electoral  reform in parliament so that the regions will go to the polls  with the old proportional system, which is regrettably still in  force, and which forms the highway for the associationism system  of the dominant groups in the PDS and PPI.    [Guiglia] And what if constitutional reform runs aground  between the two houses of parliament?    [Tatarella] We shall have to resort to ordinary legislation;  but you can be sure of one thing: The regions will not go to  the polls again under the proportional system.    [Guiglia] [Interior Minister] Maroni has granted local  authorities greater freedom to recruit staff. An instance of  state handouts on First Republic lines?    [Tatarella] The press has emphasized only a part of Maroni's  initiative. First of all, there is a general criterion laid  down by the Treasury. Furthermore, its purpose is also to  lessen the political weight and powers of discretion held by  some local authority technical offices.</p>

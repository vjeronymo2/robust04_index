			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Taylor to succeed Lane as Lord Chief Justice SIR Peter Taylor, the Appeal Court judge who led the 1989 inquiry into the Hillsborough football stadium disaster, is to succeed Lord Lane as Lord Chief Justice. Lord Justice Taylor, 61, will take over England's second most senior judicial office at the end of April when Lord Lane steps down after 12 years in the job. Lord Lane, 73, could have remained until his 75th birthday in July 1993, but 'had indicated his wish to retire early', Downing Street said. Sir Peter inherits a criminal justice system under scrutiny by a Royal Commission after a series of miscarriages of justice which have undermined public confidence in the judiciary and the courts. Speaking at a press conference, he conceded there was widespread public anxiety about the criminal justice system and said: 'We have all got a job to do.' He called for a different approach by police to the investigation of crime and for greater vigilance on the part of the judiciary. Judges had to maintain their independence but should be encouraged to be more 'user-friendly'. Asked about recent controversial awards of libel damages, Lord Justice Taylor said that juries would continue to make large awards unless the 'toothless Press Complaints Commission' was given wider powers to impose financial sanctions on newspapers which overstepped the mark. In recent years Lord Lane has been increasingly dogged by controversy. He was heavily criticised for his handling of the first appeal of the Birmingham Six in 1988 when he said 'the longer this hearing has gone on, the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury was correct'. His refusal to apologise to the men when they were finally released in March last year led more than 100 MPs to sign an early day motion calling for his resignation. Lord Justice Taylor had been widely tipped to succeed Lord Lane in spite of having been an Appeal Court judge for only 3 1/2 years. He said he thought he had been appointed because he was seen as 'not wholly out of touch with the mainstream of life in the country'. His appointment was widely welcomed by the legal profession. Mr Gareth Williams QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'It is time for a fresh start and Lord Justice Taylor is just the man to carry out the essential task of reform.' Case for the status quo, Page 6</p>

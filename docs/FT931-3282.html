			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Simon shows decline to Pounds 5.3m - Recession and loss of contract lead to profit fall and dividend cut SIMON Engineering, overshadowed by dividend worries for more than a year, yesterday passed its final after announcing a steep fall in profits. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 5.32m in the year to December 31, mainly due to recession and losses on an important paper engineering contract. The figures, which were below market expectations, were described as 'extremely poor' by Mr Roy Roberts, chairman. Mr Roberts announced he would retire at the end of this year. The shares, which collapsed last year from 301p to a low of 70p, were down 21p early yesterday, but rallied to close 1p up on the day at 114p. Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 487.6m (Pounds 514.5m), mainly because of reduced sales in process engineering. The paper contract, at Jacksonville, Florida, led to a Pounds 5m loss for the year and a Pounds 3.3m write back of profits taken in 1991. The powered access equipment division was affected by falling sales and margins and trading profits fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 3.1m. Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive, said there were signs of improvement in the US, but the UK remained weak. Simon sold most of its environmental division earlier this year, leading to a Pounds 5.39m extraordinary charge. The company did not apply FRS 3 because it said the sale of the division was non-recurring. A fall in advance receipts from process engineering, and an increase in US borrowings because of exchange translations, meant net debt increased from Pounds 37m to Pounds 101.2m. Gearing more than doubled to 87 per cent. However, the sale of the environmental division has reduced gearing since the year-end to about 65 per cent. Earnings fell to 2.6p (12.5p) per share. Following the extraordinary charge, and an interim dividend of 5p - last year's total distribution was 15.7p including a final of 10.7p - there was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 7.83m (Pounds 11.1m). COMMENT Simon's shareholders must be wondering if anything else can go wrong. After being assured by the chairman 12 months ago that this year's dividend would be covered, yesterday's cut suggests over-optimism or misjudgement of the company's markets. The severity of recession is only a partial excuse, accounting for the downturns in the construction and offshore sectors, while the loss on the Jacksonville contract is harder to justify and could scarcely have come at a worse time. Simon remains cautious about this year and is not forecasting any growth in its markets. Although access sales in the US should pick up, Simon needs its process engineering advance receipts to improve and reduce borrowings. Forecast profits this year of Pounds 12m put the shares on more than 18 times. Probably the only prop under the shares at this level is the group's perceived vulnerability to takeover.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sporting links with the law Alasdair Neil has been appointed the first full-time managing partner of City solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons. His three-year appointment reflects a growing trend among the leading City law firms to appoint executive managing partners with functions separate from those of the senior partner. Neil, 53, who has spent all his professional career with Simmons &amp; Simmons, is a corporate lawyer who counts the Marylebone Cricket Club and the International Cricket Conference among his clients. Giving advice on the legality of short-pitched bowling, whether to readmit South Africa to the international cricketing fold and whether women should be allowed to join the MCC, makes a welcome change from the day-to-day workings of the UK corporate scene, he says. ***** Bill Tudor John (right), head of the banking department at City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy is to replace Tony Herbert as the firm's managing partner. Tudor John, 47, read law at Downing College, Cambridge, and, apart from a two-year secondment as a banker with Orion Bank, has been with Allen &amp; Overy since 1967. He has been on the firm's management committee for the past three years with particular responsibility for personnel. Tudor John is a steward of appeal of the British Boxing Board of Appeal and describes himself as a keen shot and failed rugby player.</p>

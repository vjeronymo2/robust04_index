			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Tax move seen as 'gimmick' - Lib Dems THE Liberal Democrats last night dismissed the new 20p income tax rate as a 'gimmick'. But early indications were that its MPs would not oppose many of the Budget proposals - increasing the likelihood of their implementation if the general election leads to a hung parliament. Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said the 20p tax rate was a 'cheap electoral trick' which could have been better targetted. Rather than voting against the proposal, the party may enter the election pledged to raise the 25p basic rate to 26p to fund the extra Pounds 2bn of education spending it committed to. On other measures, the Liberal Democrats have proposed a freeze in the Uniform Business Rate - although they would cut the level in real terms, instead of limiting rises to the rate of inflation as announced yesterday. The party has also campaigned for extra help for small businesses seeking to recover debts from large companies. It backs reforming the Budget process. If Liberal Democrats held the balance of power after the election, an independent central bank and a move to the narrow bands of the Exchange Rate Mechanism would be set as priorities for an anti-inflation strategy. Privately some Liberal Democrats believe the Conservatives would be receptive to such moves. Labour, though, would agree more with the large-scale investment package the Liberal Democrats propose. However, the extra Pounds 6bn to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement suggested by Mr Beith last week may be revised downwards because of the larger than expected government PSBR forecast yesterday.</p>

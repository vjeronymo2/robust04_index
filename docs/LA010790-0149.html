			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER NOTEBOOK: NEW ROLE TAKES VIC TAYBACK BACK TO ORIGINS  </P> <P> Vic Tayback moves further away from the all-American Mel of "Alice's" with his  role as the Lebanese immigrant Youssef Joseph in S.K. Hershewe's comedy, "An  Oasis in Manhattan," opening Jan. 19 at the Venture Theatre in Burbank.  </P> <P> "The 'oasis' is Youssef's household," explained Tayback, "and he runs it like a  dictator. He loves the United States -- he voted for Eisenhower, Nixon and  Reagan -- and thinks that freedom, education and democracy are a good idea. But  there are also some things from the Lebanese tradition that he thinks need to  be upheld. Like when it comes to marriage, he wants his daughters marrying  Lebanese."  </P> <P> The actor, whose own background is Syrian ("the cultures are very close"),  finds the character colorful and likable -- and understands his cultural  clannishness.  </P> <P> "Those kinds of attitudes are a universal thing," he said. "People come over  from another country and try to hold onto things from there. Youssef is  definitely bigoted, but it's not against any particular race. He talks about  Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Swedes, Italians, Irish and Turks -- basically anybody  who isn't Lebanese isn't OK. The play's message is that it's the kids who are  going to take us away from that prejudice."  </P> <P> Also coming up this month:  </P> <P> Jan. 14: "Merlin, or the Barren Land," German playwright Tankred Dorst's  six-hour retelling of the Arthurian legends, opens at the Ventura Court Theatre  in Studio City.

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: THERE'S A BEWITCHING AIR ABOUT OLD SALEM  </P> <P> The year 1692 wasn't a particularly good one around here, what with 19 women  being hanged for witchcraft and the Rev. Cotton Mather throwing fear into much  of New England with his rampant Puritanism.  </P> <P> Cooler heads finally prevailed when Mather's father, a president of Harvard,  condemned the practice in a religious tract of 1693. Even the fiery Cotton  eventually recanted, and things slowly got back to normal.  </P> <P> All of which hasn't kept the Salem police of today from wearing witch shoulder  patches, a newspaper from displaying a witch on its masthead, taxis from  emblazoning them on their doors and the high school from making covens of its  teams by using the old sorceress as a nickname.  </P> <P> From its colorful past, Salem has grown into a lovely and very cultured town,  give or take a few witch museums. It is the home of native son Nathaniel  Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables and the spectacular Peabody Museum of  maritime artifacts and Asian art.  </P> <P> Just a couple of miles down the road is oh-so-affluent Marblehead, one of the  prettiest of New England's port towns and the self-described "yachting capital  of the world."  </P> <P> Getting here: Fly United, American, USAir, TWA, Northwest or Continental to  Boston. From there, it's 30 minutes by commuter rail to Salem.  </P> <P> How long/how much? Allow two or three days for Salem and Marblehead, perhaps  another couple for visiting fetching towns along the North Shore. Accommodation  costs are moderate, fine dining the same.  </P> <P> A few fast facts: June through October are the best and busiest months here, a  short spring rather bleak, winters only for the hardy. Halloween brings the  witches back, along with an 11-day "Haunted Happenings" festival that's scary  and fun. Getting around town is easy with The Hawthorne, a turn-of-the-century  trolley (complete with history narrators) that stops at all the important  places. We highly recommend this ride.  </P> <P> Getting settled in: Hawthorne Hotel (on the Common; $75 to $125 double) is a  Federalist-style place with 18th-Century furnishings that was built by public  subscription in the 1920s. Bedrooms are large, serene and have wonderful  reproductions of period furniture. Choose between the elegant Nathaniel's  dining room or the Tavern on the Green for your meals, the latter with lighter  fare.  </P> <P> One of the most enchanting inns we've seen lately is Marblehead's The Harbor  Light Inn (58 Washington St.; $75-$95 B&amp;B double), an 18th-Century home  meticulously restored, with four-posters, fireplaces, old brasswork, historical  paintings, etchings and prints. Some rooms have a large private deck and  Jacuzzi in the bath. There is also a rooftop walk where you may view boats  coming and going in the harbor and the famed Marblehead Light.  </P> <P> The Stepping Stone Inn (19 Washington Square North; $95-$125 B&amp;B double,  May through October, $75-$105 March-April and November-December) is next door  to Salem's Witch Museum and convenient to most of the town's attractions. It's  an 1846 naval officer's home with eight bedrooms brought up to snuff with  queen-size beds, original art and homemade quilts on the walls. Full breakfasts  include such items as eggs Benedict, fine breads and your own silver pot of  coffee.  </P> <P> Regional food and drink: You're close to the Atlantic here, and that means  seafood that locals are almost snobs about, claiming never to have touched  anything frozen. Cherrystone clams, lobster, halibut, scallops, sole and scrod  are staples, with clam and fish chowders to get things rolling.  </P> <P> A traditional New England clambake may be difficult to find, so watch the  papers for church suppers and the like. There is also plenty of good Italian  food in these parts.  </P> <P> Good dining: Cherrystones (80 Newberry St. off U.S. 1) has every seafood  imaginable. This is a large and rambling place, with wood floors and old  Oriental carpets. Many locals have their big night out here. Try the super-rich  lobster bisque and follow with swordfish grilled, blackened or broiled. There  are also such dishes as smoked salmon ravioli, lobster and scallops Alfredo.  </P> <P> Chase House (Pickering Wharf) is a great place for lunch right on the river  leading to the Atlantic. Sit on a deck and feast on scallops and lobster hauled  right off the boat to the back door. The original Chase House opened in Salem  in 1872, and the new version is trying to bring back the magic of yesteryear.  </P> <P> Two Italian restaurants in Marblehead that caught our fancy are Rosalie's (18  Sewall St.) and Capucino's (40 Atlantic Ave.). Rosalie's features angel hair  pasta with calamari, tomato, basil and garlic, then broiled swordfish with  pesto butter. The fettucine melanzane and vitello Milanese also draw raves. The  decor here is eclectic, with such items as old church pews, a wooden bar, an  antique hutch and a marble table for serving.  </P> <P> Capucino's recently was voted best Italian restaurant on the North Shore, and  it should get another accolade for the mounds of food set before you. Choose  from 11 kinds of veal, 16 pastas and eight seafood dishes, all with a distinct  Italian accent.  </P> <P> On your own: If you don't know anything about witches when you arrive in Salem,  you will when you leave. Figuring out which witch house (there are three) to  start with is your first problem. Try the Witch Museum for starters, then mount  your broom and go from there.  </P> <P> The Peabody is America's oldest continuously operated museum, housing a  fascinating collection of ship figureheads, Polynesian masks, carvings,  pottery, jewelry and textiles from India, Japan, Africa, China and the rest of  Asia. Don't miss it.  </P> <P> The Essex Institute, a museum housed in six old Salem homes dating to 1684,  also has a main building with five galleries of furniture, dolls, toys, silver,  glass, ceramics and military gear tracing the town's 18th and 19th Century  history.  </P> <P> Don't miss Hawthorne's House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668 and set in a  complex of early homes and gardens. If you still have energy in the evening,  take in a show at the North Shore Music Theater, where Ray Charles, Chita  Rivera, Harry Belafonte, Jay Leno, Roy Clark and Tammy Wynette perform in  Broadway musicals and concerts from April through December. It's a first-class  and very professional operation from curtain to curtain.  </P> <P> For more information: Call the North of Boston Visitors Bureau at (508)  532-1449, or write (Box 3031, Peabody, Mass. 01960) for a 56-page guide to the  North Shore, including sights, accommodations and dining.

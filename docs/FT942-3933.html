			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / China urges more talks on N Korea China yesterday made its strongest plea yet for renewed diplomatic efforts to resolve the argument over North Korea's reluctance to open its nuclear sites to inspection. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, reflecting Beijing's growing alarm on the possibility of United Nations sanctions on Pyongyang, urged the international community to refrain from 'closing the door'. Sanctions, Mr Qian told the visiting Japanese foreign minister, Mr Koji Kakizawa, could only intensify the 'contradictions' and even lead to results that all parties would not like to see. However, in Seoul, the US, Japan and South Korea, after holding discussions in the South Korean capital at the weekend, reaffirmed their determination to push for the phased introduction of UN sanctions against North Korea unless Pyongyang accepts international nuclear inspections. Russia also indicated its willingness to support sanctions after the US endorsed a Moscow-sponsored international conference that would attempt to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Invited participants to the conference would include North and South Korea, the US, Russia, Japan, China, the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog. Mr Qian's statement reflected Beijing's fears that a sanctions process backed by the US and its western allies might develop a life of its own and lead eventually to a dangerous confrontation with North Korea. 'We appeal to the parties concerned to make efforts to open dialogue and seek a way of settling the problem step by step,' said Mr Qian. Beijing is now at the centre of intense international efforts to defuse the Korean crisis, recently receiving foreign ministers of both South Korea and Japan as well as the chief of staff of the North Korean armed forces. Mr Qian appeared to foreclose the possibility of early Chinese support of sanctions. The US and its allies may proceed as early as this week before the UN Security Council to put forward a resolution calling for phased sanctions. The IAEA has warned that the opportunity may have passed to verify whether North Korea has diverted weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at a reactor near Pyongyang. On Friday, the IAEA voted to suspend technical assistance to North Korea in protest at its refusal to open its nuclear sites to inspection. China's IAEA delegate abstained. Meanwhile, former US president Jimmy Carter will arrive in Seoul tomorrow on his way to Pyongyang, where he will meet North Korean president Kim Il-sung in what is described as a private initiative to maintain dialogue between North Korea and the US on the nuclear issue.</p>

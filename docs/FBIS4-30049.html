			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has confirmed  that it will accept international inspections of sites that  could reveal its past nuclear activities, South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday.    Pyongyang, in a letter to Washington, said it would "comply  in full" with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards agreement,  Han said at a press conference.    "You can take this to mean that this includes North Korea's  compliance in explaining its past nuclear activities," said Han.    Han's remarks suggest that North Korea has agreed to the  "special inspections" demanded by the IAEA, the UN nuclear  watchdog agency, of two sites believed to store nuclear waste  materials after the North's secretive reprocessing activities in  the past.    Han denied widespread press reports that Washington was  ready  to overlook whatever North Korea may have done during its past  nuclear development.    "That's just not true," said Han. "The past has been the  problem from the beginning, and that is why the matter was  referred to the UN Security Council. We cannot close our eyes  to that."    On the proposed inter-Korean summit, the foreign minister  said Seoul will not try to set the agenda beforehand though the  two sides are expected to discuss implementation of the  agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    A "miraculous" breakthrough in the nuclear impasse was  achieved after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met directly  with North Korean leader Kim Il-song.    Kim relayed through Carter that North Korea would comply  fully with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime and  with the IAEA safeguards accord, allow IAEA inspectors to remain  in North Korea, keep IAEA monitoring equipment in operation and  freeze its nuclear activities.    Pyongyang confirmed these intentions directly to Washington  Thursday, and U.S. President Bill Clinton personally declared  that efforts for UN sanctions against North Korea will be  suspended and the next round of U.S.-North Korea high-level  talks will open in Geneva early next month.    What North Korea said about complying fully with the NPT and  the safeguards accord "carries in it various meanings," Han told  reporters, especially regarding its intentions to show what it  has done in the past with spent fuel.    "At least the possibility of recounting the past through  access to the two undeclared sites remains alive," he said.    "It is unclear as to whether it is still possible for the  IAEA to recount what North Korea did with its spent nuclear fuel  rods in a way it wants and needs. But an explanation of the  past would be possible when this complemented access to the two  sites," said Han.    As to what constituted satisfactory inspection of past  activities, the foreign minister said it would have to be a  method guaranteeing 100-percent transparency deemed satisfactory  to the IAEA.    He denied reports that the Clinton administration was ready  to overlook what North Korea may already have done.    "It was a choice of whether the issue of the past should be  settled before or during the third round of North Korea-U.S.  high- level talks. It was not a choice of whether to address or  ignore it," said Han.    While stressing the importance of both tracing the past and  staving off nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Han said the  time factor places more emphasis on freezing the North's nuclear  program.    He described a "new basis" to continue diplomatic efforts on  the nuclear problem created by Pyongyang's latest gesture.    "It's true that the basis for dialogue was broken when North  Korea unloaded fuel rods from its nuclear reactor," he said.    "But a new basis was laid with new conditions such as North  Korea's promise not to reload and reprocess."</p>

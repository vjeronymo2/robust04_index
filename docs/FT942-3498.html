			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Weak showing by dollar D-Mark strength following Chancellor Helmut Kohl's success in the European elections on Sunday and dollar weakness caused by fears of rising US inflation characterised the foreign exchange markets yesterday, writes Graham Bowley. The success of Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union was seen partly as lifting the political risk that has weighed on the D-Mark, and as a sign of voter confidence that the domestic economic recovery is gaining strength. The D-Mark rose against the dollar in early trade. But later comments from US Federal Reserve Board member Susan Phillips that there were slight signs of inflationary pressures developing in the US, and remarks by US Treasury officials about trade negotiations with Japan, further unnerved the markets and precipitated a dollar slide. In the UK, the Conservative party's dismal performance in the European elections had largely been anticipated and had little overall impact on sterling. The dollar stabilised in late trading after earlier weakness following comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury Secretary. He said intervention last month showed Washington was not trying to devalue the dollar to gain access to Japan's markets. 'It is not in our interest to try to work our way into the market by devaluing the dollar,' he said. But analysts doubted whether Mr Bentsen's remarks would offset new scepticism about US inflation. The comments by Ms Phillips, following adverse producer price data last Friday, provided the catalyst for a more sombre mood. Mr Adrian Cunningham, an economist at UBS, said: 'Her comments are in line with the general US authorities' view that there are risks that inflation will rise but that it is currently subdued. Nevertheless, the dollar began to test the downside after her remarks.' 'The slow grind downwards of the dollar against the D-Mark continues,' said Mr Avinash Persaud of JP Morgan in London. 'The markets have woken up to the inflation threat posed in recent data and elsewhere. There is scope for one last final fling downwards until the Federal Reserve tightens and the dollar stabilises.' Comments by Mr Robert Rubin, the White House chief economic adviser, further undermined the dollar. He said the US was not backing away from its objectives of opening up Japan's markets to more imports and bringing down its trade surplus. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Investment Bank, said: 'Kohl's success and these very unhelpful remarks have given the market an excuse to test the downside of the dollar.' Analysts said investors were also cautious ahead of today's US consumer prices and retail sales data. The US currency closed in London at DM1.65, down from DM1.6672 on Friday, and at Y103.145 against Y103.915. New York trading ended with the dollar at DM1.6457 and Y102.80. The D-Mark's strength followed the German CDU's victory in the European elections. 'There is a feeling that the worst is over and that the economy will emerge strongly from the recession,' said Mr Persaud. 'As confidence grows further, the gains will be maintained and the D-Mark will remain supported.' But Mr Cunningham said: 'When the market starts to focus on the probability that the Bundesbank will continue to cut interest rates, we will start to see the D-Mark giving up some of its gains.' Yesterday, Bundesbank council member Hans-Jurgen Krupp said he was 'quite sure' that there would be 'a further cut' in the official repurchase, or repo, rate in Germany. The pound was hit by the general strength of the D-Mark and the outcome of the European elections, although it did find support from the fact that the Conservative government's performance was not as bad as had initially been expected. The British currency largely shrugged off producer price data for May. This showed a subdued 0.1 per cent rise in output prices in May, but a worryingly large increase of 0.9 per cent in input prices. The pound lost just under a pfennig yesterday to finish at DM2.5061 in London, against DM2.5142 on Friday, and gained around a cent to Dollars 1.5185 from Dollars 1.5080. In the futures market, the December short sterling contract closed at 93.67 from 93.79, thus discounting short-term interest rates about a percentage point higher than the present 5.25 per cent by the end of the year. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England intervened to sell Pounds 401m of Treasury bills due June 17 at 4 9/16 per cent to 4 per cent after forecasting a surplus of Pounds 400m. Overnight money traded between 4 5/8 per cent and 3 1/2 per cent. The French franc was subdued, largely as a result of D-Mark strength but also due to the poor performance of the ruling Balladur government in the European elections. The Italian lira benefited from the success of the Ber-lusconi government in the elections.</p>

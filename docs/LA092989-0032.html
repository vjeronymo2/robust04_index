			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NORMAN OPENS SEASON, GRANDLY, UNEVENLY  </P> <P> Jessye Norman, who opened the concert season at Ambassador Auditorium on  Wednesday with a little help from some friends, doesn't have to think small.  She is a grandiose woman with a grandiose talent.  </P> <P> She exults in the simple joy of divahood. She basks in automatic, delirious  adulation before she can utter a tone. She turns easy essays into complex  dramas. She strikes lofty poses and sculpts pretty phrases in the air.  </P> <P> Sometimes she offers revelations. Sometimes she resorts to distortions. Either  way, she is interesting.  </P> <P> In a day when so many singers are content to be bland technicians, and not  necessarily deft technicians at that, she remains an undoubted presence. She  exhibits character, and she has ideas.  </P> <P> She commands the stage instantly. She seizes the music, dares the listener not  to surrender.  </P> <P> That does not mean, however, that she turns everything she attempts into sonic  gold. On this occasion, she seemed tired and out of sorts during the first half  of the program.  </P> <P> Wherever possible, she opted for low keys and slow tempos. Her tone emerged a  bit raspy. High climaxes were tentative. Pitch became precarious, breath  insecure.  </P> <P> Cleopatra's "Piangero" served as a ponderous Handelian prelude for four Strauss  Lieder submerged in lugubrious Sprechgesang. The intimate sensuality of four  Duparc songs proved more congenial, but even here one could have hoped for more  shimmer and better legato.  </P> <P> Vocal matters improved after intermission. In Ravel's "Sheherazade," Norman's  soprano -- or is it really an extended mezzo-soprano? -- sounded lush, the  expressive allure natural. Linda Chesis added exotic flute colors in the  composer's own chamber-music transcription. Here, as elsewhere, Dan Saunders  provided robust yet sensitive piano accompaniment.  </P> <P> Falla's "Siete canciones populares espanolas" closed the official portion of  the program. Pepe Romero had arranged the original piano part for guitar, a  virtuosic feat. He performed with authentic elan.  </P> <P> The necessary reduction in tone and scope tended, alas, to trivialize the basic  passions. Under the circumstances, Norman had two unsatisfactory choices: She  could either scale down her solos or overpower the guitarist.  </P> <P> For most of the cycle, she held back. She sang beautifully, flirted both with  the line and with her gallant collaborator, pointed the rhetoric with telling  nuances, but muted the flamboyant impact.  </P> <P> Then, in the final "Polo," she let rip with chesty snarls and marvelous growls.  In the process, she brought down the house, and all but blasted Romero off the  stage.  </P> <P> The three encores included two habaneras: Ravel's sinuous "Vocalise,"  exquisitely performed, and Carmen's inevitable cliche, unintentionally  caricatured. Norman -- whose controversial recording of Bizet's greatest hit  has just been released -- indulged in slides, sighs, whispers, yelps, lyrical  evasions and other snail's pace mannerisms that bordered on the grotesque.  </P> <P> The would-be seduction number was followed by the inevitable benediction, "He's  Got The Whole World in His Hands." Standing ovations and floral tributes were  forgone conclusions.  </P></p>

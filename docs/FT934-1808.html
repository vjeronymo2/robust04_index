			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Romanians launch street protests Tens of thousands of Romanians yesterday attended anti-government demonstrations as part of a series of rallies and strikes organised by the country's largest trade union, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Unions say that if the government does not meet their demands, they will hold a strike in mid-January. Both the unions and pro-reform opposition parties, which today bring a motion of no-confidence in the government, say the economy will worsen unless privatisation and restructuring are accelerated.</p>

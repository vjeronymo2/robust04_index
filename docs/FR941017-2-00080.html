(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, paragraph (b), ``Maintenance of Customer Records,'' of Amex Rule 922, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' requires that background and financial information of customers who have been approved for options transactions be maintained at both the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office. Amex Rule 922(b) also requires that copies of account statements be maintained at both the branch office supervising the accounts and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch for the most recent six-month period. The Amex proposes to amend Exchange Rule 922(b) to provide that the customer information and account statements currently maintained at the principal supervisory office may be maintained at a location other than the principal supervisory office if the documents and information are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Presently, the rules of all the options exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') uniformly require that both the branch office servicing an options customer's account and the principal supervisory office having jurisdiction over the branch office retain account statements and other financial and background information for the account for supervisory purposes. With the advances in data storage and retrieval capability available through optical disks, fax machines, microfiche and computer, coupled with the escalating costs of storing records on-site, many member organizations prefer to store documents away from their principal supervisory offices. In this connection, an increasing number of member organizations have asked and received permission from the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') to store the required customer option account documents off-site so long as they are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. In view of the number of requests received by the SROs to store customer options information off-site, the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  has asked each of the options exchanges and the NASD to consider amending their rules to permit the principal supervisory office to store customer account information off-site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The OSRC is a committee comprised of representatives from each of the options exchanges and the NASD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that these off-site storage arrangements are consistent with the record retention requirement rules, provided the documents are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. In this regard, the proposed rule will not compromise the supervisory obligations of a member firm since the firm will still be required to maintain customer option account documents and information at the branch office servicing the customer's account. To ensure compliance with the provisions of the rule, the Amex states that it will periodically examine the document retrieval capabilities of member firms using off-site document storage arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

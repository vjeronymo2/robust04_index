			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: Trigger-happy Fancy whiling away the odd hour blasting off a bazooka on your visit to this week's Chinese Communist Party conference in Beijing? If so, head from Tiananmen Square towards the airport and, a bit to the west, you'll find the 16 1/2 -acre China North International Shooting Range. Billed as the first 'entertainment type shooting activity place' in the country, it is 'provided with over 20 kinds of small arms, such as various pistols, rifles and machine guns, rockets, designed and built by China to be fired by friends of all nations'. Moreover, if you suspect that the other friends' aim may be wayward, don't worry. You can blast away from inside one of 20 shooting compartments 'fitted with bulletproff (sic) steel plate'.</p>

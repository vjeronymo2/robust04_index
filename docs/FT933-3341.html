			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London Metal Exchange COPPER prices edged away from their lows during late trading and ended slightly higher. The imposition of a Dollars 5 a tonne limit on the daily backwardation has defused much of the tightness and the premium to borrow cash for one day was erased, with a 40 cent discount in place at the close. TIN slid to new 20-year lows in sympathy with the Far Eastern markets, but edged up slightly to close at Dollars 4,545 a tonne, still down Dollars 62.50 on the day, in the three months position. The NICKEL market paid little attention to mid-afternoon news Inco had reached a tentative agreement with unions at its Thompson, Manitoba, operation. The three months delivery price closed at Dollars 4,555 a tonne, down Dollars 65. At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures edged higher in very sedate fashion. The near December position closed at Pounds 867 a tonne, up Pounds 11 on the day. 'I think the market is also (like coffee - see story above) running out of steam at the moment but again in the long-term prices look set to really push higher towards Pounds 1,000,' one trader said.

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SAYS BUILDER CAN RENT CONDOS IN WARNER CENTER  </P> <P> Much to the disappointment of homeowners and a Los Angeles City Council member,  officials said Wednesday that they have determined that units in what was  advertised as a luxury condominium complex under construction in Warner Center  can legally be rented instead of sold.  </P> <P> Officials from the city's planning and transportation departments said in  findings released Wednesday that changing the status of the 760-unit Summit  project from condominiums to apartments does not mean that the project can be  halted or delayed by city officials.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joy Picus last month had asked the departments to examine the  Summit project, saying the change in status raised questions about whether its  approval should be withdrawn. Homeowners in Woodland Hills had opposed changing  the condominiums to apartments, saying rental units would bring additional  noise and traffic and would lower the area's property values.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assessing Impact  </P> <P> In launching the inquiry, Picus questioned whether the developer, G. H. Palmer,  had addressed the environmental impact of the change, as well as the effect on  traffic and parking that apartment dwellers would have on the area.  </P> <P> Picus lamented the findings. "I wish I had some tool to get them to sell the  units instead of renting them, but it does not appear that I have," she said.  </P> <P> The city's Building and Safety Department, which Picus also asked to examine  the Summit project, had not yet rendered a final decision on the project. But a  department official said last week that a preliminary examination showed that  the developer apparently could alter the project from condominiums to  apartments.  </P> <P> Homeowner leader Gordon Murley said he was angered by the rulings.  "Technically, they're right, but Palmer had said in all the documents that  those units would be sold," he said. "We take great issue with this."  </P> <P> Palmer executives announced last month that economics and an analysis of real  estate conditions indicated that it was impractical to sell the units, even  though they had been advertised for sale as luxury townhouses. Palmer spokesmen  said the firm never promised to sell the units.  </P> <P> Neither the developer nor his representatives could be reached for comment  Wednesday.  </P></p>

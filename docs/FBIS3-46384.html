The message coming from the seminar indicates that in  order to promote reform, opening up, and economic development in  central and western parts of China, the utilization of foreign  capital in China will be inclined to inland provinces during the  period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan.    The seminar proposed that to support the development of  reform, opening up, and economic construction in the central and  western regions, the focus of the country's utilization of  foreign capital will be tilted to inland provinces during the  period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan to increase the strength of  construction projects in the central and western regions, help  boost economic construction in inland provinces on an overall  scale, narrow the economic gap between the inland provinces and  the coastal regions, quicken the pace of all reform undertakings  in China, and promote the cooperation and development of  complementary projects.    It is known that three projects Gansu Province has procured  have been listed in the state's foreign capital utilization  plan. The three projects are a 30,000-line program-controlled  telephone system, with an investment of $47 million;  comprehensive treatment of atmospheric pollution in Lanzhou,  with an investment of $100 million; and a key water control  project in the Shule He Valley, with an investment of $150  million.</p>

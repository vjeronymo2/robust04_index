			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / French Transport Dispute: Truckers, hit by hard times, lash out - William Dawkins explains why many lorry drivers are in a parlous state FRENCH truckers provide a classic example of how it is often those who feel the most vulnerable that are prone to aggression. Many truckers are in a parlous economic state likely to be made worse by the new driving regulation, under which from July 1 a driver is banned once he has clocked up six penalty points. Truckers and their employers have seen freight charges decline and salaries stagnate under the impact of French road transport deregulation in 1986 and growing competition on foreign routes. The price of vehicles, the main business cost, has risen sharply thanks to tougher European and national controls on pollution, noise and safety. The points system puts truckers under what they see as an intolerable twin pressure. They can no longer afford to ignore driving regulations because they risk unemployment, yet they still need to drive at over the speed limit and for more hours per day than allowed to keep up their incomes. This has been felt more intensely in France than elsewhere because it has been slower than others like Britain and Germany to launch a penalty points system, and because the country and distances within it are larger than its neighbours. Paris lifted state controls on road freight rates - with the support of the industry - in 1986. Since then rates have fallen by an estimated 15 per cent as 10,000 new hauliers joined the market. Today, France has 35,000 road haulage companies, 85 per cent of which employ less than 10 people. They employ 190,000 drivers, to which can be added 30,000 one-man outfits, completing the picture of a fragmented, cut-throat industry. The surge in competition has boosted the proportion of goods carried by road in France over the past 10 years from 66 per cent to 75 per cent. Customers have benefited, but, according to the FNAUT transport users' federation, a quarter of all truck loads are carried at a loss for the haulier. The pressure is reflected in low basic wages, averaging between FFr6,000 (Pounds 615) and FFr6,500 per month, according to union estimates. However, a hard-working trucker can double his wage by winning productivity and punctuality bonuses, which is where the pressure to flout driving regulations comes into play. By law, French truckers must not spend more than 46 hours per week at the wheel. Their weekly average is just over 53 hours, according to the national transport council. Another study by SAPRR, a leading motorway operator, shows the average truck of 40 tonnes or more travels at 98 kmph, well over the 80 kmph limit. A truck is involved in 15 per cent of French road deaths, estimates the SAPRR. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has offered to suspend the use of spy-in-the-cab recorders as evidence in traffic offences, as a gesture to the truckers. Government negotiators believe they are near agreement with truckers' unions on a move away from productivity bonuses - with their obvious dangers - towards bigger wages. The government is also prepared to allow truckers who have lost penalty points to take unpaid leave to take the tests needed to earn back clean licences. These gestures have yet to satisfy the truckers. Their demands continue to vary between the total abandonment of the points system, to the establishment of special professional licences, with a higher number of points. But the government cannot easily climb down.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Praise for Spanish minister who quit SPAIN'S prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, was moving quickly yesterday to resolve a delicate political crisis after his health minister, Mr Julian Garcia Valverde, was forced to resign. Mr Gonzalez, to whom cabinet changes are anathema, was understood to be preparing to name a successor. Mr Garcia Valverde resigned because of a growing scandal surrounding land speculation near Madrid by the state railway monopoly, Renfe, of which he was president before being promoted to the government nearly a year ago. He thus became the first minister in any of Mr Gonzalez's governments since the Socialists first came to power in 1982 to resign as a direct result of corruption charges, despite a string of political scandals. El Pais, the country's biggest newspaper, yesterday welcomed the resignation. 'In a country that seems to be getting used to a rigid division between the reality of the lives of its citizens and their political leaders, and in which the word resignation appears to have no place, Mr Garcia Valverde's decision is highly significant,' it said. By taking responsibility for a series of payments by Renfe to intermediaries in order to buy land which it hoped to sell later to finance the construction of a new railway line, Mr Garcia Valverde has overnight converted himself into a minor folk hero. Last year alone the government was caught up in at least four serious corruption scandals. Mr Gonzalez, who is anxious to discard his government's shaky ethical image, is understood to want to appoint a successor to Mr Garcia Valverde quickly and is unlikely to use the resignation as an excuse for a large cabinet reshuffle. But there are serious doubts about the health of his veteran foreign minister, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, whom illness forced to miss last month's Maastricht summit. A rapid appointment to the health portfolio would help the prime minister allay speculation that he might call a general election before he has to in October 1993.</p>

This report summarizes a survey of  more than 7,000 farm households nationwide by the Central Policy  Research Center of the central government and the Ministry of  Agriculture's Office of Rural Economy Fixed Observation Sites.  It reflects the voice and desires of the peasantry from the  first line of agricultural production, and as such is of great  value to us in understanding and studying rural problems.    Rural fixed observation sites were established a decade ago,  in 1984. To understand the developmental situation and problems  of the rural market system, during the first half of last year  they undertook by random sample this special survey of "rural  households and the market," among 7,012 rural households. Survey  questionnaires and forms sent out totalled 636, and the same  number were returned, so the survey was totally effective.  <H5>  Agricultural Production Is More Marketized </H5>   Rural reform has pushed millions of peasants into the great  tide of commercial economics, and many of these peasants have  begun to operate in accordance with the market economy,  regardless of pre-production decisions concerning what to  produce or how much of it, as well as sales during and after  sale. This is a sign of the further development of the  agricultural production market.    First, there has been fundamental implementation of the  rights of farm families, and the effect of prices on production  is becoming daily more obvious. According to the survey, 57.53  percent of the households surveyed thought that current  production decisions were theirs to make (including what to  produce, how much to produce, and how to produce); rural  households have gradually adopted the principle of maximum  benefit.    Second, under the function of the price factor, the  commercial rate of agricultural products has improved, while the  personal use rate has declined. The survey showed that the  overall commercialization rate of agricultural products was  54.49 percent.    Third, there has been a steady decrease in the variety and  volume of state-purchased products among agricultural products,  while the rate of products sold directly to markets has  continually increased. In 1992, among households surveyed, there  were only two products for which the State purchased more than  half of the total: cotton (70.95 percent) and tobacco (66.29  percent); grain occupied 48.45 percent, with the rest all sold  in markets.    In 1992, among all agricultural products sold by households  surveyed, 31.31 percent were sold to state-owned commercial  departments, 64.58 percent were sold by private individuals  directly or indirectly into the market, and other parts were  sold in other forms. Of the agricultural products sold, the  accounts of 76.5 percent were settled on time, which means that  nearly one-fourth were not settled on time.    Fourth, rural households entering the market did not feel  that connecting with the market was a comfortable experience.  Their first problem was that, in a situation where the markets  were opening up, they did not know what to produce, due to  inconsistent information. This made it difficult to turn their  produce into commodities. In 1992, among agricultural products  of surveyed households, those products in which more than 10  percent of output had been stored up and were ready for sale  were medicinal materials (30.1 percent), oranges (36.2 percent),  gunny (30.1 percent), wood (17.4 percent), vegetable oils (14.8  percent), and corn (12.6 percent). This was caused by a supply  and demand imbalance, so prices were too low. Second,  administrative decrees under the planned economic system were  still a constant occurrence, and the self operating rights of  rural households have not really been implemented. There were  42.47 percent of rural households reporting some sort of  administrative interference with their production. In the  pre-production decisions on 19 out of 20 varieties of  agricultural products (medicinal materials excepted), the  decisions were still made on the basis of accomplishing  government assignments. Third, there is a very low degree of  organization of farmers going into circulation. There were very  few rural households, only 4.6 percent, which participated in  the operation and sale of agricultural products, a total of only  44 days engaging in transporting goods for sale. Therefore,  although there was definite improvement in the degree of  marketization degree of agricultural products, there was still a  limited number of farmers engaged in operational activities, so  an agricultural product price formulation system has not been  genuinely established, and the market development of  agricultural products needs to be perfected.  <H5>  Agricultural Products Are Generally Supplied By the Market </H5>   Studies show that the majority of agricultural production  materials required by surveyed households were purchased in the  market, a change from the former situation of relying chiefly on  the state and collective allocations. This is a considerable  improvement from the process of market reliance.    One, the majority of the supplies used in agricultural  production are purchased in the market at a higher cost. In  1992, every family surveyed spent 765.24 yuan for farming  supplies, of which 677.84 yuan was spent in the market at a  negotiated price, which was 89.64 percent of the total  expenditure; 78.4 yuan was the parity price expenditure, which  was 10.36 percent of the total.    Two, the farm supplies purchased at the parity price were  insufficient, and quite often could not be supplied, so they  played a lesser role in production as the conditions for  completely relaxing the price grew more mature by the day. In  1992, parity price chemical fertilizer received by farmers  constituted only 63.9 percent of the total supply, while parity  price diesel fuel could not be fully supplied either.    The survey showed that, at present, there are a growing  number of departments which are involved in managing farm  supplied, establishing a pattern of multi-channel circulation.  In addition to supply and marketing cooperatives which both  operate "connected" parity farm supplies and organize goods  sources for sale at negotiated prices, departments which  popularize agricultural technology manage farm supplies which  are related to technology popularization and fee-based services.  Community cooperatives and special cooperatives also organize  goods sources to serve farm households, there are manufacturers  which sell directly, private operators set up stalls to sell or  deliver goods to the customer's door-step.    Three, farmers' greatest objections are that the price of  farm supplies is rising too rapidly, and that the market is  flooded with poor quality, copied, or bogus products. There is a  sharp contradiction between the supply and demand for farm  supplies, while slow market development combined with imperfect  management makes pricing and quality into flash point issues  bringing many farmer complaints. When the surveyed households  responded to a question concerning the "least satisfying thing  about purchasing farm supplies", the ranking in order of was:  high prices number one, poor product quality was second, and too  many copied, bogus, and poor quality products was third. Looked  at by category of product, besides the pricing problem, 34.8  percent of farming households mentioned bad quality seeds, 31.9  percent noted the large amount of copied, bogus, and poor  quality pesticides, while 43.5 percent of farming households  mentioned the lack of funds for buying farming machinery.    Resolution of the agricultural materials supply problem  demands supporting not only the development of the agricultural  use industry, promoting a necessary balance between supply and  sales of farm supplies, but also stressing price restructuring,  further opening up of the market, encouraging multi-channel  circulation under the conditions of strengthening macroscopic  administration, and accelerating development of key elements of  the market.  <H5>  [5 Jan p 1] </H5>   [Text] Capital Is Starting To Flow, as "Glue" for  Allocating Resources    The survey of rural fixed observation spots shows that the  single pattern of capital circulation has begun to change, with  the objective of regulating surplus and resolving production  capital. Multiple channels of capital circulation are emerging,  but the capital market has not been established yet, and there  are still contradictions between capital and supply, which  restricts the development of production and economic growth.    First, as capital circulation channels become pluralized,  banks and credit unions face a challenge to their position as  the chief channel, with personal loans between individuals  surpassing the old timers. Based on the survey, in 1992 the  average farm household had 422.57 yuan in loans for production,  which was 21.46 percent of the cash outlay for family  operational costs. Of farm households' total loan burden, 185.04  yuan of the debt came from banks and credit unions, or 43.79  percent; 10.15 yuan of the debt came from cooperative fund  committees, which was 2.4 percent; and there were 215.86 yuan in  personal loans, 51.08 percent, surpassing banks and credit  unions to take over first place.    Looking at different types of farm households, those totally  engaged in farming had the smallest loan amount, only 16.16  percent of their household operational expenditure for the  entire year; households totally engaged in non-farming pursuits  had the largest loan amount, which was 37.74 percent of their  operational expenditure for the entire year, in addition to  private interest-free loans. This kind of phenomena shows that  it has been the rise of non-agricultural industry that has  brought on capital circulation, and a situation whereby capital  regulation and circulation are no longer small-scale and  mutually assisting, initiating a "market" tendency.    Second, loan capital has been centered on the short term,  with very little long-term lending, and most of the capital was  put into non-agricultural industry. Looking at the investment  direction of loan capital, most of it went into non-farming  areas, and this constituted 63.5 percent of the total amount of  farming households loan capital; 26.5 percent of the loans went  into forestry, livestock, fishing, and commercial plants, with  only 10.5 percent put into grain production.    Different capital resources have different interest rate  standards. This reflects the fact that floating interest rates  do indeed exist in the countryside.    Third, there is an outstanding contradiction between supply  and demand, but as a practical matter the amount is not very  big. The investigation showed that 64.1 percent of farming  households felt the lack of capital for agricultural production,  which makes it difficult for them to engage in expanded  reproduction. Among farming households who lacked capital, 75.3  percent of them were willing to raise capital through loans. But  in fact only 32.1 percent of farming households did so, which  was 48.9 percent of farming households having a capital shortage.    As resource allocation and the economic means of regulation  have changed, capital has begun to flow as the "glue" of  resource allocation. But the capital market has yet to be  established in the countryside. To promote rural financial  system reform, and enable limited capital to work more  positively in rural resource allocation, we should permit  pluralized growth and development while developing and  perfecting major channels of finance and capital, strengthen  administration in the process of development, and enlarge rural  cooperative fund associations, bringing their mutual assistance  function into play.  <H5>  A Slow Shift in Land-Use Rights </H5>   Land functions as a special production element, its market  formation signaled by shifting and flowing land-use rights,  allowing its allocation to accord perfectly with benefit  principles. For many years, along with the development of rural  non-agricultural industry and the improvement in  non-agricultural product degree of marketization, smashing the  situation of land being isolated and sealed, there has appeared  a shift in land-use rights. This also displays several new  characteristics.    First, land contracts are basically stable, with not many  shifts in contractors. Based on the survey, since the  implementation of the household responsibility system of linking  remuneration to output, 63.9 percent of farming households have  readjusted their contracted land, while 36.1 percent of farming  households have never done so. Among sample households, 93.8  percent of farming households have not subcontracted their land,  4.2 percent of farming households subcontracted only part of  their land, and 1.99 percent of farming households have  subcontracted all of their land to others.    Second, in the current phase, it is impossible for land-use  rights to shift on a large scale, as these are restricted for  the most part by society's safeguard functions. The survey shows  that in grain production, which occupies most of the land area,  production decisions are based primarily on the family's life  requirements. Whether farm households subcontract their land  largely depends on how much of a labor force the households have.    Third, this shift in land-use rights is still in a  spontaneous and disorderly situation, lacking regulated  administration.    Fourth, in a situation where the planting business brings  fewer benefits, farming households are reluctant to put more  land into operation.    The survey shows that there are many features restricting  shifts in land-use rights. In addition to the major role still  played by the land's societal protection function, the original  collective property rights are unclear; leaving the land means  abandoning all that one has built up, while development of rural  urbanization and township enterprises regional construction is  also quite slow. To resolve the land problem, we must positively  invigorate operation and usage rights under the precondition of  maintaining collective ownership and stabilizing farming  families' contractual rights. We should not only allow, but  should also guide and regulate compensation for shifts in  land-use rights, to bring about a perfect reorganization of the  key elements of production.  <H5>  Circulation of the Labor Force Has Accelerated </H5>   The survey of fixed observation sites shows that since the  breakup of the old pattern in which the entire labor force was  bound to the land, labor has started to flow among the various  rural businesses and between urban areas and the countryside.  Some farmers are now choosing their jobs based on their  qualifications, their preferences, and the law of value. So we  are just in the midst of cultivating a labor market.    One, the fact that surpluses and shortages of labor force  exist at the same time in industries, regions, and farming  households makes it both possible and necessary to make  adjustments between surplus and shortage and the circulation of  labor. Based on research and estimates, the surplus labor force  is about one-third to one-fourth of the average farming  household's labor force; but meanwhile, about two-fifths of  farming households are confronting shortages of labor in family  operations in varying degrees. Among these, 4.5 percent of the  households had labor shortages throughout the year, while 35.5  percent of the households had a shortage during the busiest  farming season. In the production and operation of  non-agricultural industries, the labor shortage problem was more  urgent, with the total frequency reaching 40.8 percent.    To meet the need of maintaining normal production  operations,  30.8 percent of the families sampled hired help. Those who did  not hire outside help despite having a labor shortage gave their  inability to afford it as the reason. The rate for this was 62.2  percent.    Second, as hiring of help increased, so did wages. Most of  the outside hiring was done by non-agricultural industries.  Non-agricultural industries accounted for 60.7 percent of the  outside hiring in 1992, 24.1 percent by planting businesses  (12.7 percent in grain production), and a very small part by  forestry, fishing, and stock raising.    Spurred by the economic benefits and lured by job openings,  labor is shifting from undeveloped to developed regions. This  trend became very clear when the households in the survey were  divided along regional lines. The average hired help workdays in  the eastern areas were 35 percent higher than in the inland  areas, and 2.8 times again higher than in the west.    Three, when the labor force flows on a smaller scale, with  unstable employment, it requires wider channels for labor  shifts, and the establishment and perfection of a labor market.  Although at one time or another mid-level organizations in many  places have seen the emergence of some sort of labor market with  employment agencies, etc., these have all been in a preliminary  status, and lacked organized leadership.    There are many reasons for the backward development of a  rural labor force market. Besides the poor qualifications of the  labor force itself, being unsuited to the requirements of new  job openings, even more important have been the restrictions of  the economic development level and system. Two different types  of resident registration systems have created a protective  screen and barrier blocking the flow of labor between the cities  and the rural areas. Township enterprises' situation of "leaving  land doesn't mean leaving the countryside" also delays  construction in small towns by restricting the labor force  shift. The restricting elements listed above must be resolved in  order to develop a rural labor force market.  <H5>  [6 Jan p 1] </H5>   [Text] The change from a planned economy to a market  economic system will by no means be successful in every  instance, but will have to deal with complex and rapidly  changing markets. There are various kinds of contradictions  between the small-scale production of farming households and big  markets, two of which are the low qualifications of the farmers  and a lack of fundamental change in the role of government.  Resolution of these problems requires persistence in opening  and conscientious organization, in order to create better  external circumstances for farmers going into the markets.    One, the lower qualifications of farmers makes it difficult  for them to match up with market economy requirements.    Rural reform has pushed farmers to the primary position in  the market economy, but whether they can swim freely in the  ocean of the market economy will be determined to a very high  degree by their qualifications. Looking at documents for  different groups which indicate the labor force's educational  level as one of the important indicators of farmers'  qualifications, the educational level shows a positive  relationship to family operational benefits. Looking at share of  productive fixed assets (initial value), illiterate farming  households are at 100, grade school level households at 122,  junior high school level 116, and middle high school level 130;  looking at gross income from family operations, illiterate  households are still at 100, followed by the others in order at  110, 113, and 116 respectively. Among households surveyed, 13.8  percent of heads of household or those making production  decisions were illiterate, 41.5 percent had a grade school  education, 34.5 percent had a junior high school education, and  10.1 percent of them had a high school education. In addition,  11.5 percent of the farmers had special skills, and only 3.9  percent of the farmers had received professional education and  training.    A low educational level, combined with the affects of the  traditional production economy and the old, planned economic  system, has resulted in conservative thinking and narrow vision  in a great many farmers. They are contented with slight  financial improvements, they are afraid of risk and worry  excessively, they do not know how to arrange production and  operations activities, nor do they have any way of obtaining  such information when they get into the market economy. They can  deal with regular farming work only by traditional ways and  their experiences, they do not understand market rules, they  cannot take advantage of market regulations.    The survey showed that quite a few farmers have only a dim  understanding of marketing concepts, and very little of  contractual concepts. There is a low rate of contracting and  implementing contracts for the purchase and sale of agricultural  products. In 1992, only 159 households of sampling households  signed purchase and sales contracts, which was only 2.3 percent  of the total number of families.    Two, the small production scale of farming households and  their low specialization level make it difficult for them to  face the big markets. Based on the study, the average family had  4.76 people, a labor force of 2.63, farming 11.7 mu of land  which was divided into 8.08 pieces, and at year's end owned  2,480 yuan of the initial value of production fixed capital.  Among households surveyed, 57.5 were engaged completely in  agriculture, 29.6 percent of the households engaged mostly in  agriculture but with other businesses as well, 11.1 percent of  households engaged mostly in non-agricultural business but in  farming was well, 1.3 percent were involved completely in  non-agricultural operations, and 1.5 percent were other.    In this situation of small scale operations, the coexistence  of self-supply and self-merchandising has brought production  into the "small but complete" pattern, and led to a trend of  holding different businesses, in order to deal with market  risks. The activity of holding different businesses on a small  scale must lead to small batch production, leaving them  powerless to engage in market competition and lacking a  negotiating position. Other than what they supply to themselves,  very few of the farmers' products can go into the market for  exchange. In a way, this is an exchange of surplus products:  when the markets offer a good price, farmers sell more; when  not, they take more for themselves, so they have no way of  establishing a competitive advantage. This can be explained by  the fact that completely agricultural households sell so many  kinds of products. Among these totally agricultural operators,  33.5 percent sell one or two types of agricultural products,  14.6 percent sell three or four types, 16.5 percent sell more  than five kinds of agricultural products, with the extreme  example being the sale of 15 kinds of agricultural products.  Meanwhile, trade methods have been unorganized and scattered,  with very little organized sales or regulated trust sales,  wholesale, or futures, so they were also in an unfavorable  trading position in trade. Many of the self-operation rights  received from production and operations are lost in market  circulation.    Three, the role of government has not really changed,  macroscopic adjustment and control lack force, and there is no  regular and perfected market environment for farming households  entering the market. In the conflict that arises from the new  old systems coexisting, one still often sees the administrative  order of the old system, and farmers' self-operation rights in  production have not been implemented completely. In some cases,  farmers' rights to make their own decisions concerning what to  plant have been replaced by administrative plans. The markets  for certain products are often closed by administrative means.  All these things have restricted farmers' activities in varying  degrees. Construction of a market economic system is very  imperfect, especially for that macroadjustment and control which  are essential to a market economy. The foundations are lacking  for a perfect system.    First is the information foundation. In recent years,  although relevant departments have attempted to improve the  means of information transfer to promote development of a market  economy, all their efforts have been far short of what is  needed, regardless of whether it has been the quantity of  information supply or how up-to-date or accurate; this has  resulted in losses for producers. Some farmers have even gotten  the idea that whatever the government encourages us to plant,  that will be hard to sell; whatever the government restricts us  from planting, that will sell well. In the situation of a market  economy, vast numbers of farmers are thoroughly familiar with  the principle of maximizing income. In addition, while budgetary  restrictions are very efficient in household operations,  extremely few farmers know what will earn them more money, so  they urgently require "information guidance".    Second is the facilities foundation. Constructing a market  system for trade in agricultural products is delayed and  backward, with even primary level trading markets for  agricultural products trading markets having trouble attaining a  satisfactory status. According to documents which classify the  sampled households by their distance agricultural products  trading markets, 30.1 percent of farming households' lived more  than 20 km away from the markets, and 26.4 percent of farming  households' lived more than 10 km from the markets. Under  circumstances of inconvenient transportation and backward means  transport, things are more difficult for farming households who  live far from the markets. The shortage of storage facilities  and poor means of processing have made agricultural products a  "short leg", with most of them having to be sold locally.    Third is the system foundation. Regulations and laws  essential to the market economy are very imperfect: In some  places there are no regulations to comply with, and especially  in the countryside, those laws which do exist are not complied  with. Most of the problems farmers encounter in shipping  agricultural products and selling them are due to the  imperfection of laws and system. Of the sampled farming  households, 306 stated that the greatest difficulty they had in  going into circulation was, first, that there were too many  barriers, and the phenomenon of levying arbitrary charges was  severe; second, poor social security made them lack a sense of  security. These both involve legal construction.    Many of the sampled households, when confronting the great  wave of the market economy, summarized their desires in such  sentences as this: What farmers want is to prosper; what they  lack is the means to do it; what they are short of is capital;  what is difficult for them is technology; what they worry about  is marketing channels; what they expect is service.    To remove the barriers for farmers going to market, from the  standpoint of developing major entities for producing  merchandize, there must be a rise in the farmers' own  qualifications in education, technology, and merchandizing  economics. From the standpoint of establishing a market economic  system, the changeover from the old to the new system must be  stepped up. There must be a change in the role of government,  stronger macroadjustment and control, development of a  production elements market, and a greater degree of opening in  rural economic development. Comprehensive development of the  rural economy must be shifted into the channel of a socialist  market economy.</p>

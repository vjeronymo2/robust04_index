			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is in China. He is  accompanied by dozens of businessmen wanting to secure a market  of almost 2 billion people. Paulo Lavadinho reports from  Beijing.    [Lavadinho] This is the largest ever delegation to accompany  the prime minister. He arrived in Beijing seven years after  having signed with Prime Minister Zao Ziang the Joint  Declaration on Macao. It was at the People's Palace, where this  morning, after receiving military honors in Tiananmen square, he  held the first official meetings.    During the welcoming ceremony, the Chinese prime minister  stressed the excellent relations between the two countries and  expressed his government's satisfaction over the transition  period in Macao. Cavaco Silva also recalled his government's  wish to resolve all matters pertaining to the territory, always  at the negotiating table.    [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] Futhermore, I would like to  stress -- as I did seven years ago -- the commitment of the  Portuguese Government to the implementation of the articles  enshrined in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and to the  continuing dialogue between Portugal and China regarding Macao  with a view to giving its people stability and progress and the  safeguarding of their way of life and cultural specificity after  1999. [end recording]    [Lavadinho] No details regarding the talks have emerged. At  dinner Cavaco Silva and Li Peng talked once more about the  unresolved issues regarding Macao. However, both heads of  government advocated good relations between China and the EU.  [passage omitted]</p>

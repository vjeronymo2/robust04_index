			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Weekend 'Chetniks' on the warpath: Should Nato be fearful of military involvement in Yugoslavia? THROUGHOUT the capitals of western Europe, an unequivocal consensus has emerged over the past week: Europe must not get involved in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. In London, Paris, The Hague and Rome, defence ministries and senior officers have repeatedly warned their governments that any large-scale military involvement in Bosnia would incur a high financial and human cost. Western governments are even reluctant to provide any substantial military support to protect aid convoys. Moreover, the idea mooted at last month's Geneva conference on refugees concerning the establishment of security corridors in Bosnia has now been abandoned, as confirmed by Mr John Major, the British prime minister on Wednesday night. Such deep reluctance begs the question of why western governments are so in awe of the Serb military machine in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Officials at Nato yesterday tried to explain Europe's reluctance to become involved. 'First, Nato is not ready for such an operation. We have not fought in any war. But second, leaving aside the terrain, we don't know what kind of army, or how many armies we would be fighting in Bosnia,' a Nato official said. The Serb army in Bosnia inherited at least 500 artillery pieces, 300 tanks and 40,000 soldiers from the former Yugoslav army. It also took over an indigenous defence industry in Bosnia, a communications network and a senior officer corps handpicked by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. One of the key army commanders in Bosnia is General Ratko Mladic. As former commander of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina, western Croatia, Gen Mladic helped to organise the Serb insurrection against the Croats in 1991. But four weeks after the European Community recognised the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina last April, Mr Milosevic ordered Gen Mladic to take command of Sarajevo. 'This is the man who controls the formal army units,' a UN official based in Belgrade said. 'This is the man you negotiate ceasefires with.' However, Mr Charles Meynell, editor of the London-based East Europe Newsletter, says the former JNA units exist uncomfortably alongside bands of thugs and irregulars. 'Much of the professional officer corps of the JNA, including the most influential Serbian generals - many of whom have resigned - were, and are aghast at the mixture of Serbian hoodlums, criminals and 'Ramboesque' drug-taking delinquents who have been so prominent in the ransacking of Bosnia,' says Mr Meynell. The low morale among sections of the army is partly confirmed by the recent resignation of Major General Vuk Obradovic, once considered a 'hard-nosed' loyal Serb nationalist. 'This is a measure of how disreputable the Serbian military machine has become,' added Mr Meynell. Apart from the army and the irregulars, parts of Bosnia is overrun by 'weekend Chetniks.' Between Fridays and Sundays they cross the river Drina from Krajujevac, Nis and Valjevo in Serbia, and from Montenegro. Those captured say they have been paid DM500 a day for fighting in Bosnia. 'These guys are well fed, nationalist and ready for a weekend's fight,' said a UK Ministry of Defence adviser. 'They wreak havoc.' But what is the combat effectiveness of such a two-tiered force? 'If you look at the way in which 45,000 Croat troops, managed to push back the Serb army from Mostar (the capital of western Hercegovina, in western Bosnia) between late May and early July, it begs the question why a combined western force cannot take on the Serbs in other parts of Bosnia,' a western military attache said. A Nato official noted that 'The army is good at bombarding. And they still have the air-power. But it has no infantry. Look at how long it took them to flatten Vukovar? (the eastern Croatian city ). In some ways, apart from Mostar, the army, or the irregulars for that matter, have never been really tested,' he said.</p>

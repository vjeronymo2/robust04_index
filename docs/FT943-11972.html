			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of The Bank of England (3): Wings spread for stability - Peter Norman analyses the recent management restructuring At the beginning of this month the Bank of England underwent its biggest management restructuring since 1980. Most of its activities, which previously were scattered through numerous separate divisions, have been concentrated in two 'wings', one responsible for achieving monetary stability, the other charged with securing financial stability. The changes, which took effect 12 months after Mr Eddie George became governor, with Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea as his deputy, reflect the preoccupations of both men. They want to secure lasting low inflation, a solid financial system and efficient and competitive financial markets in Britain. The restructuring is intended to create a leaner, more focused bank. One important aspect has been to bring the Bank's operational and analytical work closer together to make it better able to respond to rapid changes and incipient dangers in the world economy and financial markets. Mr Pennant-Rea, brought into the Bank from the Economist newspaper in 1993, was responsible for planning the changes. The exercise began last December during a weekend brainstorming session of top Bank managers at Ashridge management college in Hertfordshire. In the following months, details were thrashed out in three working groups which reported to the deputy governor. The immediate challenge for Mr George and Mr Pennant-Rea is to secure support for the changes inside the Bank. As the July deadline approached it became increasingly clear that the reorganisation had created unhappiness, even among senior officials who recognised that the Old Lady was ready for a shake-up. Bank staff were prey to considerable uncertainty during the planning of the reorganisation. Although there have been no compulsory redundancies, the restructuring has resulted in the departure of nine of the Bank's 45 most senior officials. It is expected to prompt the departure of another 10 to 15 of the 150 high level managers just below head of division level. Further down the institution, the reorganisation will cost about 80 jobs among the Bank's clerical staff. The changes are causing one departure at the level just below deputy governor: Mr Hugh Harris, an associate director, is to take early retirement. However, the Bank's four executive directors have prospered under the changes and continue in office. Two have been assigned to each of the wings. The monetary stability wing is headed by Mr Mervyn King, the Bank's chief economist, and Mr Ian Plenderleith, its markets guru. Its responsibilities extend from economic and monetary analysis of the UK and other countries, through preparation of the bank's monetary policy advice to the government and its quarterly inflation report, to the implementation of monetary policy in the financial markets. The financial stability wing comes under Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's long serving head of supervisory activities, and Mr Pen Kent, the man responsible for the UK's financial infrastructure. This wing brings together all the Bank's supervision work, including the surveillance of markets and foreign financial systems, its work on payment, settlement and clearing systems and liaison with other regulators in the UK and overseas. The financial stability wing also reflects the Bank's interest in the efficiency and competitiveness of the UK financial system, including Crest, the Bank's project for stock exchange settlements. There is a central services area in addition to the wings. This covers the Bank's own finances, personnel, the information division and the centre for banking studies, the Bank's university for teaching central banking. The changes have resulted in the creation of a new rank of deputy director, below executive director. The five deputy directors - Mr Graham Kentfield, Mr John Townend, Mr Bill Allen, Mr Michael Foot and Mr Alastair Clark - look as if they will be the next generation of top managers at the Bank. The most striking institutional change has been the disbandment of the Bank's international division and the integration of its work into the two main wings. A look at the Bank's new organogram also reveals that there is no longer an economics division, although several departments deal with economic issues. For those responsible for the restructuring, these changes symbolise the point of the whole exercise. On the economic side, for example, the Bank has given up large scale macro-economic modelling in favour of closer study of specific issues. The changes are intended to involve the economists more closely with the Bank's operations in the financial markets. The disbanding of the international division reflects a belief that it had become a hindrance rather than a help to the Bank's main goal of achieving monetary and financial stability. Critics argued that the division had developed into an 'in-house foreign office' which had become detached from the bank's main work. Now, rather than send specialists to international meetings, Bank staff from the governor down will be involved in international representation. However, it is perhaps significant that no other large central bank has so far felt the urge to follow the Bank of England's lead and scrap its international division. There are also concerns in Threadneedle Street that the Bank may be sacrificing some unique skills. While the maintenance of London-based country experts for far flung locations may seem a luxury, it has paid dividends in the past. In 1980, for example, the US turned to the Bank to act as an intermediary with Iran in discussions over the return of frozen Iranian assets in the US. The Bank's action helped pave the way for the end of the Teheran hostage crisis and generated goodwill in the US. It will be some time before the effects of the Ashridge restructuring become clear. But it would be unwise to assume it marks the end of change at the Bank. The Bank's role and structure would be affected if ever there were moves within the UK to give it more formal independence. Then there is the Maastricht Treaty and its goal of a single European currency and central bank. At present European economic and monetary union seems a distant prospect and UK involvement unlikely. But will that always be the case? In the meantime, however, Mr George and Mr Pennant-Rea have stamped their ideals and aspirations very firmly on an ancient institution. They now have to ensure that their controversial restructuring produces the hoped-for results.</p>

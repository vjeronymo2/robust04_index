			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NEW BASEBALL STADIUM TO BE BUILT AT SDSU  </P> <P> A 1,500 seat stadium will be built at San Diego State's Charlie Smith Field  with funds coming from an anonymous benefactor, Aztec baseball Coach Jim Dietz  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The 1,500 seats would replace the aluminum bleachers that seat 1,000. Plans are  to add two 500-seat wings down the right and left-field lines and increase the  right-field seating to 1,000 to some day give Smith Field a capacity of 3,500.  </P> <P> In conjunction with the donation, SDSU will host a fundraiser at Smith Field on  Nov. 11 at 3 p.m. The model of the project will be unveiled at that time.  </P> <P> Dietz and Athletic Director Fred Miller said that the donation is not  particularly tied to the turnout at the fundraiser, but that the donor does  want to determine if there is interest in SDSU's baseball program.  </P> <P> Previous plans for Smith Field had called for aluminum seating with backs to  replace the bleacher-style seats currently in place and to eventually add new  concession stands, a clubhouse and press box.  </P> <P> Miller said it was premature to release any dollar figures regarding the  donation and the eventual build-out plans for Smith Field.  </P> <P> "We really do need to find out where we stand (in the community)," Dietz said.  "Which we will on Nov. 11.  </P> <P> Dietz said that ESPN was prepared to televise an Aztec game during the upcoming  season but later told him that the facilities were substandard and they would  instead televise the Aztecs playing at Fresno State. He also noted that SDSU's  bids to host the Western Athletic Conference tournament and NCAA regionals have  been turned down because of the school's poor facilities.  </P> <P> CHARGERS  </P> <P> Chargers Coach Dan Henning said he has decided who will start at quarterback  for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles, but that he won't make an  announcement until he meets with the players today.  </P> <P> "We'll tell the quarterback's (today)," Henning said.  </P> <P> Henning was then asked if he had made the decision.  </P> <P> "Pretty much," Henning said. "But that means if I tell you, then I have to call  all of them to tell them. I have pretty much an idea of who it will be. When  they come in (today), we'll tell them how to practice and who to prepare to  start the game."  </P> <P> AZTECS  </P> <P> San Diego State running back Darrin Wagner missed his second day of practice  because of illness but he might return to workouts today, Coach Al Luginbill  said. Reserve linebacker Thane Fisher could return for Saturday night's game  against New Mexico after missing last Saturday's game because of a broken hand.  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Point Loma Nazarene College was dropped from the District 3 NAIA Tournament  after losing its first match to Biola, 9-15, 15-12, 15-13, 15-7. Lynett  Campbell and Janelle Dutton each had 17 kills for Point Loma (14-9). Biola  improved to 20-12.  </P> <P> Jenifer Dodson had nine kills as UC San Diego defeated Cal State Los Angeles,  15-4, 13-15, 15-3, 15-4. The Lady Tritons improved to 18-12.  </P></p>

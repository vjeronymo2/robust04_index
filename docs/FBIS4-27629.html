			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 2 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Cable  News Network (CNN) will be asked to clarify its news report  claiming Malaysia is among three Muslim countries supplying arms  to Bosnian Muslims in violation of a United Nations ban. We  want to know their intention for carrying the report,  Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat told reporters here  Wednesday.    The CNN reported Tuesday, quoting sources, that Malaysia,  Iran and Turkey had been identified as the countries running  arms to the Bosnians.    Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed denied it,  and  Turkey did the same. Mohamed urged CNN to carry Dr. Mahathir's  denial if it wished to be fair to Malaysia.</p>

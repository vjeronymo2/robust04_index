			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Claes warns on talks over EU enlargement TALKS ON reforming the decision-making structure of the European Union should not be mixed up with enlargement negotiations, the Belgian presidency of the EU said yesterday. 'You can't do the two (at once): a choice has to be made,' Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, told the European parliament yesterday. The Union has set itself a tough timetable of finishing negotiations with the four candidate countries - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - by the beginning of March 1994, in the hope that they will be able to join the EU by the beginning of 1995. But the parliament is concerned that the addition of new member states could hinder EU action, unless substantial reforms are made in sensitive areas such as majority voting by ministers, the number of European commissioners, and the composition of the three-country 'troika' which carries out foreign policy missions on behalf of the EU. Smaller members of the EU have frequently voiced concerns that reforms - particularly of the existing weighted voting system - might simply mean that they are railroaded into decisions by larger countries, which have more votes. But certain MEPs believe that reform should be tackled as soon as possible, to avoid confusion later. Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French conservative MEP, yesterday warned against using the argument that small member states had to be defended as 'an excuse for not doing anything'. The parliament last night voted in favour of a resolution calling for institutional changes to 'accompany' enlargement, including greater use of an improved system of weighted majority voting. These changes 'must be incorporated in the accession treaties', said the resolution. Mr Claes said he would draw the attention of his fellow foreign ministers to the parliament's resolution when they meet on December 6 and 7. In theory, MEPs have the power to block the accession of new EU members but sources close to the enlargement negotiations said yesterday they believed the parliament would be reluctant to hold the accession process to ransom over institutional reform.</p>

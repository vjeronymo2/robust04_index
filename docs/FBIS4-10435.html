			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of "exclusive" interview with Cuban Foreign </F> Minister Roberto Robaina by Daniel Santoro, Carlos Arroyo, and  Rogelio Garcia Lupa; in Buenos Aires on 8 April]    [Text] [CLARIN] Last year, [President Carlos] Menem said in  Bahia Blanca that he was absolutely disgusted to be at the same  summit as Castro. The latter stated that the Argentine  president is an "opportunist" who aligned himself with the  United States. Is there any possibility of their meeting in  Cartagena [de Indias, Colombia]?    [Robaina] The presidents must decide that, and secondly, my  country wants bilateral relations with Argentina to be above any  argument.    [CLARIN] If Menem continues to demand what he terms "the  democratization of Cuba," do you still want them to meet?    [Robaina] We really want to explain to him what we  understand  by democratization. We agree with their request that our country  institute a multi-party system, but Cuba is a besieged  stronghold (by the United States) and cannot afford to lose its  unity.    [CLARIN] Brazilian trade unionist Lula da Silva has a good  chance of winning the Brazilian presidential elections and the  Grand Front may be successful at the polls in Buenos Aires City  on 10 April. Are we seeing a resurgence of the left in Latin  America?    [Robaina] Latin American peoples have an extremely complex  economic reality which has helped the resurgence of the left in  some Latin American countries. This goes to prove the extent to  which they continue to believe that some (neoliberal) movements,  currently in office, have not yet met their needs.    [CLARIN] Will your government grant refuge to [former  Revolutionary People's Army leader Enrique] Gorriaran Melo, just  as it granted asylum to Argentines who were persecuted by the  military regime?    [Robaina] Cuba has relations with several leftist parties  throughout Latin America, but it would be unwarrantable for the  Cuban Government to undertake acts that may damage its relations  with other countries. The times of Cuban relations with a left  that was experiencing persecution and savagery are behind us now.    [CLARIN] With the election of Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria as OAS secretary general, does Cuba believe the time has  come for it to return to this forum?    [Robaina] That is not a matter of priority for us because we  were expelled from that organization. Notwithstanding this,  those already furthering that idea within the OAS should know  that Cuba will not object.    [CLARIN] Will you invite anti-Castroist groups residing in  Miami to the meeting of Cuban exiles to be held on 22 April in  your country?    [Robaina] It will not be a meeting of groups. In any case,  those who have not been invited are just hysterical individuals.    [CLARIN] Will the agenda include proposals like the one  allowing elderly Cubans living abroad to spend their last few  days in Cuba?    [Robaina] You are well informed (he laughs). One cannot say,  however, that there is a closed agenda.    [CLARIN] Will the legalized use of dollars on the island  lead  to the establishment of a privileged social group -- one that  has foreign currency?    [Robaina] No. The country is undergoing a process of  economic transformation which entails the implementation of an  open market policy for foreign capital, the liberalization of  the job market, and the legalization of the use of a hard  currency.... But this has an enormous political and social  cost, which we assume because if we do not effect these changes  the consequences will be even worse.    [CLARIN] It has been mentioned that you, a 37-year-old  minister, might be Fidel's successor. Is that true?    [Robaina] Fidel himself brought up the subject in a very  clear way -- he is not interest in staying in power for ever....  He is there because Cubans decided to give him that mandate....  Instead of looking for a successor, we should try to find a  way, as Cubans, to collectively participate in the process.</p>

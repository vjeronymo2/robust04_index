			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Observer: Back to basics Lord Nuffield, the wealthy car tycoon who founded Nuffield College, would be proud of today's Employment in Britain survey. Nuffield was never happy with the idea of his college being regarded as a citadel of the social sciences at the expense of his beloved engineering industry. So the news that the bulk of the research for the survey was carried out by Dr Duncan Gallie, a Nuffield fellow, and funded jointly by the Department of Employment and the Leverhulme Trust, plus private companies such as British Steel, BT, Sainsbury, and NatWest, would be music to the late tycoon's ears. A first sign from Britain's industrial heartland, perhaps, that social research into the workplace may be an assistance and not a threat to industrial progress?</p>

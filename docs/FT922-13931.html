			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Costain plans to continue debt reduction ONE OF Costain Group's main messages yesterday, after announcing a Pounds 69.2m pre-tax loss for 1991, was the progress made on reducing debt. Before last April's Pounds 77m rights issue, at 155p a share, net debt reached Pounds 372m, gearing of well over 100 per cent. Thanks to that issue and the Pounds 101m disposal of the investment property portfolio, year-end gearing came down to 53 per cent on net debt of Pounds 168m. This excludes Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet debt in the Spitalfields development on the fringe of the City, and Pounds 38m of convertible preference shares. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the group planned to reduce borrowings further this year, again by disposals as cash flow was expected to be neutral. With the business now concentrating on engineering and construction and on mining, candidates for sale included non-coal mining activities in the US and properties in Australia. The group has been struggling to reduce borrowings since the Pounds 124m purchase of Pyro Energy, a US coal mining concern, in mid-1989. Gearing went up from 25 per cent to 75 per cent as a result. Not long after the purchase, an explosion at a Kentucky mine killed 10 people and closed the pit for 14 weeks. Productivity was badly affected and Mr Costain admitted that the return so far on the investment was disappointing. After that acquisition, the group missed its gearing reduction targets and by the end of 1990 the ratio stood at about 100 per cent. Since then Pounds 255m has been cut from borrowings. The period has coincided with disappointments on the housing and commercial property fronts. In 1988 the group sold nearly 1,900 houses. Last year it sold 400. The core engineering and construction business showed some resilience last year, making an operating profit of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 32.9m), after Pounds 12m of provisions against the Channel tunnel contract. Turnover slipped to Pounds 979m (Pounds 1.07bn). Mr Costain said the international contracting workload had doubled, cushioning the effects of UK recession. Mining, which saw profits fall from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 33.6m, should improve, he said.</p>

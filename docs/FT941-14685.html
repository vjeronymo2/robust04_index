			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / BTR to raise Pounds 66m by Canadian stake sale BTR, the industrial conglomerate, is to raise about Pounds 66m from the sale of its 59 per cent stake in Hawker Siddeley Canada, as it continues to refocus on its core industrial manufacturing businesses. This follows the disposal in recent months of two wholesale and distribution companies for a total of Pounds 245.5m, and the announcement of the flotation of Graham Group on the London Stock Exchange. Hawker Siddeley Canada, part of BTR's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of the Hawker Siddeley group in late 1991, is involved in businesses ranging from industrial maintenance and transportation leasing to mining contracting and some manufacturing. BTR said the company no longer fitted into its strategy of focusing on pure industrial manufacturing, currently accounting for about 85 per cent of sales. BTR owns 4.82m ordinary shares in Hawker Siddeley Canada, a Toronto-listed company. The shares will be sold through a fully underwritten placement led by RBC Dominion, at a price to be finalised shortly. Based on Monday's closing price of CDollars 27, the placement will raise CDollars 130m. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said the Canadian subsidiary had shareholders' funds of CDollars 240m and no borrowings, apart from non-recourse debt from its leasing operations. Analysts believe the latest sale should end an aggressive run of disposals, which has left the group with a clearer structure and a stronger balance sheet. BTR had gearing estimated at 60 per cent in December 1993. With the cash proceeds from the flotation of Graham Group, the sale of Hawker Siddeley Canada and the exercise of 1993-1994 warrants, this figure could fall to around 40 per cent this year. The management demonstrated its comfort with current gearing levels in December through the purchase of US manufacturer Rexnord for Dollars 420m (Pounds 283m) cash plus the assumption of Dollars 400m debt. The group's share price closed 9 1/2 p higher at 374p. Lex, Page 20</p>

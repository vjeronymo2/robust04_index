			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Liu Zhongli by </F> staff reporter Dong Ruisheng (5516 3843 3932); date, place not  given: "Finance Minister Liu Zhongli Speaks on Several Hot  Points in Implementation of the New Tax System" --first  paragraph is editor's note]    [Text] The new tax system has been operating for three  months. What is the effect? What new conflicts have we met  with in the process? Have such aspects as production,  circulation, financial revenues, and commodity prices been  adversely affected? This reporter invited Finance Minister Liu  Zhongli to learn his views on these hot issues about which  people are concerned.  <H5>  The Tax Reform Has Not Brought About Drastic Fluctuations or </H5> Huge Increases in Commodity Prices    Commodity price increases were widespread last winter and  this spring, and the masses had strong grievances against this  situation. Many people suspected that it had something to do  with the introduction of the new tax system. So what is the  truth?    Liu Zhongli explained: We set great store by mass opinion,  and have been tracking and looking into their views ever since  the introduction of the new tax system. Now I can say for  certain that the tax reform has not brought about drastic  fluctuations or huge increases in commodity prices. Last year,  prior to the tax reform, every tonne of rolled steel was priced  over 4,000 yuan, but since the introduction of the new tax  system this year, the price of rolled steel not only has not  risen, but has dropped a bit, showing that the law of supply and  demand is functioning. Some people said that the levy of  consumption tax led to increased prices for refrigerators, color  television sets, and other household electrical appliances, but  this too is groundless. At present, the scope of the  consumption tax levy does not cover household electrical  appliances. The key targets of the levy can be divided into  five major categories: 1) Special consumer goods -- such as  cigarettes, liquor, and firecrackers and fireworks -- excessive  consumption of which will jeopardize people's health, the social  order, and the ecological environment; 2) Luxuries and non-daily  necessities, such as gold, jewelry, jade, and cosmetics; 3) High  energy-consumption and high-grade consumer goods, such as  automobiles and motorcycles; 4) Petroleum-related goods that  cannot be regenerated, such as gasoline and diesel fuel; and 5)  Consumer goods with certain financial significance, such as car  tires and products for skin and hair protection. Compared with  the former tax system, there is basically no change in taxable  consumer goods' overall level of tax burden, even if the  consumption tax is levied on these products, and most of the tax  items are basically at the original level of burden. The levy of  the consumption tax will not affect the level of commodity  prices.    People objected to increased vegetable prices, with some  saying they were caused by the tax reform, but Liu Zhongli  considered such remarks as not conforming to the reality. He  said: At present, vegetables are still levied at the original  retail tax rate. The main reasons accounting for price rises in  vegetables are: 1) Vegetable plots in the suburbs of many  cities have been transformed into real estate and economic  development zones, and new vegetable plots must be developed in  the outer suburbs, thus incurring greater cost; 2) Some  wholesalers and retailers running vegetable businesses have  seized the opportunity of the introduction of the reform to  raise prices, fix prices in excess of those authorized, and ask  exorbitant prices, thus disturbing normal pricing order in the  market and driving up the level of commodity prices; and 3)  Vegetable prices also depend on whether it is off or peak  season, and on the law of value.    Comrade Liu Zhongli said: To understand the level of  commodity prices, we must uphold the standpoint of seeking truth  from facts and of the market economy. To solve this problem,  the basic method is to handle things according to law and to  increase effective supplies to the market. The State Council  meeting on the "Shopping Basket" project will have a positive  meaning in stabilizing non-staple food prices.    After citing numerous facts, Liu Zhongli pointed out with  emphasis: The root cause of increases in the general level of  commodity prices is excessive investment and granting of loans,  excessive currency issuance, and the exceedingly rapid growth of  consumption funds. In the final analysis, price increases are  caused by the double pushing of the forces of demand -- for  consumption and for investment. The party Central Committee and  the State Council attach great importance to this problem, and  have already decided, on the one hand, to carry out massive  inspections of commodity prices and the scale of investment for  capital construction and to strengthen and improve macroscopic  regulation; and on the other, to carry out the "Shopping Basket"  project and increase effective supplies to society by vigorously  developing agriculture. We are going to solve the problem and  stabilize commodity prices by taking the measures in these two  respects. The tax reform is correct and cannot be doubted, and  we should continue to progress on this basis.  <H5>  The Tax Reform Has Not Adversely Affected Production, </H5> Circulation, and Financial Revenues    Liu Zhongli said: The new tax system has operated for three  months, and the overall situation is normal. We have basically  achieved steady transition without causing any great problems.  All walks of life in society and most enterprises have  responded calmly to the introduction of the new tax system and  the changes in tax burdens. The introduction of the new tax  system has not increased the tax burden of foreign businessmen  investing in China, thus dispelling their doubts. Industrial  production is still developing rapidly. According to statistics  compiled by the State Statistical Bureau, from January to  February, industrial enterprises at and above the county level  throughout the country completed 541.9 billion yuan worth of  output value, up 18.16 percent over the same period last year.  As far as financial revenues are concerned, a trend of huge  growth is still shown. By the end of February, the national  domestic financial revenues (excluding debts) increased 32.1  percent over the same period last year, including 41.405 billion  yuan of industrial and commercial tax revenues, which registered  an increase of 32.3 percent over the same period last year. As  for the general value-added tax [VAT], as a shared tax, a total  of 21.503 billion yuan was turned over to treasuries from  January to February, and 71.1 percent and 28.9 percent of the  sum was turned to the central and local treasuries,  respectively, which was basically close to the requirements of  the tax-sharing system. As proved by practice over the past  three months, the tax reform package is a proper one, and the  positive results achieved by the reform have strengthened our  confidence and determination in scoring a sure victory in the  tax reform.    Compared With the Former Tax System, the New VAT  Merely Makes Changes in the Method of Tax Calculation, But It  Does Not Increase the Overall Tax Burden of Commodities    The VAT, in essence, is a levy on the amount of added value.  So what is the most fundamental difference between the  post-reform VAT and that in the former tax system?    Liu Zhongli said: Our country started levying the VAT on an  experimental basis in 1979, and there was no unified standard of  tax burden; the scope of the levy was not wide; the product tax  levied on the links of industrial production and coexisted with  and overlapped the VAT; the business tax was levied on commodity  circulation link, whereas the unified industrial and commercial  tax was levied on enterprises linked to foreign investment; and  there was no unified taxation policy. Moreover, restricted by  the scope of the levy, it was difficult to implement a tax  deduction system in which invoices clearly indicating the amount  of tax payment are produced. Consequently, even though taxes  were reduced or remitted in a certain link, taxes still were  deducted in the following link, thus making it impossible for  the VAT to bring its intrinsic mechanism of control into play.    Liu Zhongli said that the implementation of the new VAT  embodied the characteristics of being standardized, close-knit,  and convenient: First, the scope of the levy is widened, that  is, the links of production, import, wholesaling and retailing  businesses, and processing all are included in the scope of the  VAT levy. Second, the scope of taxpayers is widened, that is,  all units and individuals selling goods and offering labor  services for processing and repairs inside the PRC and importing  goods into the territory are included. Third, tax rates are  combined and simplified, that is, the tax structure has only two  grades of tax rates; the basic tax rate is 17 percent, while the  low tax rate is 13 percent. In addition, a zero tax rate is  levied on exports, whereas a six percent tax rate is levied on  small taxpayers who do not have sound accounting and auditing  practices. Fourth, a VAT deduction system is implemented in  which invoices are produced that clearly indicate the amount of  tax payment.    At present, some people regard the 17 percent of extra-price  tax [jia wai shui 0116 1120 4451] as a tax levied on top of the  selling price. Liu Zhongli said that this practice was  certainly incorrect. The so-called in-price tax [jia nei shui  0116 0355 4451] refers to the fact that prior to the reform, the  amount of VAT was included in selling prices, and the tax rates  were calculated according to the tax-inclusive prices; whereas  the so-called extra-price tax refers to the fact that the rates  of post-reform VAT are calculated according to the prices that  do not include VAT, and the prices and the amount of VAT are  separately stated. However, when commodities are sold in the  retailing link, the tax amount is still included in the prices,  rather than separately stated. Compared with the former tax  system, the new VAT merely makes changes in the method of tax  calculation, but it does not increase the overall tax burden of  commodities. Hence, the selling prices of commodities should  not be raised.    Using special invoices to implement the VAT can close the  loophole of loss of state taxes. However, for small taxpayers  who do not have sound accounting and auditing practices, the  marketing of their products will be affected, to a certain  extent, because they are not included in this taxation category,  which will be unfavorable to the production, operation, and  development of small enterprises. So, how can we solve this  problem?    Liu Zhongli said: This problem really exists and we have  taken note of it. To affect the production and operation of  these enterprises, we have already taken a number of measures.  However, the fundamental way is still to help these small  enterprises take the path of sound accounting and auditing so as  to promote and strengthen the VAT administration.    Implementation of the land VAT helps standardize the order  of  real estate transactions, rationally regulate value-added land  gains, and keep land and apartment speculation in check. It is  a good thing. However, some foreign businessmen have strongly  objected to it, so is it unfavorable to foreign investment in  our country's real estate industry?    Liu Zhongli pointed out: Since 1987, our country has been  reforming the system of land use and has allowed profit-making  transfers of land use rights. Over the past two years, the real  estate industry has developed very rapidly and the real estate  market has begun to take shape. At the same time, however, some  problems also have arisen. For example, land allotment crazes  arose in some localities, and some units and individuals took  the opportunity to speculate on plots of land and unbuilt  apartments so that the state incurred great losses in land  assets gains, whereas certain units and individuals reaped  staggering profits, thus affecting the normal operation of the  state's overall macroscopic regulation. To reverse this  situation, we began to levy the land VAT, the purpose of which  is to encourage normal real estate development and management,  curb real estate speculation, and standardize the order of real  estate transactions. The State Council already has promulgated  regulations, stipulating that the land VAT must be levied, the  unified tax system must be enforced throughout the country, and  no locality is allowed to work out its own policy. Some  reasonable suggestions will be considered when drawing up the  detailed rules and regulations for implementation.    There is no tax reduction or exemption in the VAT, but for  those enterprises and professions which really have run into  difficulties and are supported the state -- such as welfare  enterprises set up by the disabled and the coal industry -- how  can their tax burden be settled and lightened?    Li Zhongli said: Even the VAT rate of these enterprises and  professions cannot be altered because the following links will  have to bear a heavier tax burden if theirs are lightened. So  what should we do? We can take the method of levying the tax  first, before returning the proceeds to them. In addition, we  can adjust our financial policy to support the development of  these enterprises and professions.  <H5>  Overall, the Tax Reform Will Not Increase Enterprises' Tax </H5> Burden    After reforming enterprise income tax and levying the new  VAT, some enterprises complained that they had to bear a heavier  tax burden, so what actually has been achieved by the three  months' practice?    As far as the turnover tax reform is concerned, enterprises  are most affected by the VAT reform. Since VAT is an  extra-price levy and the sytem of tax deduction by producing  invoices is implemented, such taxes paid by enterprises are the  remaining sum of the taxable amount of goods sold minus the  taxable amount of goods bought, and is transferred to buyers  through sales. Hence, the VAT will not increase enterprises'  tax burden.    Liu Zhongli said: The three months' practice of the new tax  reform also proves that the tax burden of most enterprises is  the same as before, or even slightly less than previously, and  that only a minority of enterprises are affected by the reform,  and the effect is next to nothing. Such being the case, why  have some people said that they shoulder a heavier tax burden?    Liu Zhongli said: One of the situations is that in the past  several years, the task of tax levies was not strictly  fulfilled, and various localities reduced or exempted many  taxes, so when we started levying the new VAT at every level and  closed all the loopholes, some people perhaps felt that their  tax burden was heavier than before. Another situation is due to  a broader tax base. For example, suppose the tax rate is three  percent and the pre-reform annual turnover was 1 million yuan,  then 30,000 yuan of tax should be paid, but when the post-reform  annual turnover reaches 1.3 million yuan, then 36,000 yuan of  tax should be paid. Such a case cannot be considered an  increase in the tax rate and the tax burden, but is due to a  broader tax base brought about by a larger turnover.    In addition, the reform of enterprise income tax has unified  income taxes paid by all types of enterprises, which are all  subject to a 33 percent proportional tax rate. Moreover, the  regulatory tax for state-owned enterprises has been abolished,  and such enterprises are exempt from paying "two funds" ["liang  jin" 0357 6855 refers to construction fees and budget adjustment  funds for key energy and communication projects]. For  enterprises having a low profit level, a two-grade proportional  tax rate, that is, 27 percent and 18 percent, has been set. In  this way, most enterprises have a lighter income tax burden than  before.</p>

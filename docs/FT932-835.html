			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Lucky numbers spell B-I-N-G-O: The game's popularity has expanded On a warm Thursday evening this week, 1,000 people are hunched over their bingo tickets in a converted 1930s cinema in Wood Green, north London. The listed interior is freshly, if garishly, painted. The numbers shouted out by the caller appear on screens around the room. Gone are the traditional numbered ping-pong balls blown through a plastic tube; the caller reads from a computerised random-number generator. If the decor comes as a surprise to those expecting something shabbier, so do the customers. There are plenty of the industry's traditional players: elderly women. But there are also young couples, groups of women in their 20s and 30s, men with arms covered in tattoos. Those inside the club, part of the Top Rank chain, are as racially diverse as on the streets outside. The extension of bingo's appeal this week attracted a new entrant to the industry. First Leisure, the 10-pin bowling, discotheque and tourist attractions group, announced it was paying Pounds 19.9m for Nudge Leisure, a private company with seven bingo clubs in the Midlands. First Leisure says the increasing number of younger, more affluent customers makes bingo an attractive investment. The group intends to open two or three new clubs a year, creating a chain of up to 30 venues. Bingo prospered throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, but declined as unemployment rose during the early years of Margaret Thatcher's government. The game began to regain popularity in the latter half of the 1980s, spurred by improved facilities and bigger money prizes. Last year the number of licensed clubs nationwide showed a net increase of eight, bringing the total to 1,019 - the first rise since 1974. About 2.8m people play regularly in the UK, according to the Bingo Association of Great Britain. Two large operators dominate the business: the Rank Organisation, with 163 clubs trading under the Top Rank and Mecca names, and Gala Clubs, owned by Bass, which has 136 venues. Although the chains' clubs are predominantly in converted cinemas and theatres, both groups are focusing their investment on purpose-built bingo centres on the outskirts of towns and cities, providing parking as well as access by public transport. Mr John Garrett, managing director of Rank's recreation division, says that it is in the purpose-built clubs that the change in the bingo market is most evident. At the group's newly-opened Southend club, which also offers a Saturday night cabaret, the average age is 39. Thirty per cent of the Southend customers are men. The group says its bingo business has held up reasonably well during the recession, with last year's total admissions of 35m up 2 per cent on 1989. The average expenditure of Rank's customers per visit is about Pounds 13.50  -including entry fees, bingo tickets, food, drink and amusement machine spending. Spending has increased in line with inflation throughout the recession. Given the preponderance of older clubs, however, accounts of how bingo has changed should not be overdone. The average age nationally is 53; and women still account for 80 per cent of players. Mr Ian Burke, Gala Clubs' chief executive, says many of the traditional players have been a valuable resource during the recession. Pensioners on fixed incomes have continued to play. The industry has been helped by female unemployment rising more slowly than that of men, Mr Burke says. Mr Nick Tamblyn, First Leisure's commercial director, says: 'The market shift is gradual rather than something that's happening overnight.' Nor is the social class of bingo players changing markedly. 'Let's not kid ourselves that we're looking for the BMW set. We're not. But we are now more geared to the car-driving visitor.' Mr Tamblyn says that, together with snooker and 10-pin bowling, bingo is a business where operators can rely on large numbers of people spending small amounts of money, compared with other leisure pursuits such as foreign holidays. When times are hard, bingo customers tend to cut down on the number of times they play each week rather than stopping altogether. Some appear to have cut down very little. Ms Jackie Quintin, a 33-year old mother of four who won Pounds 425 at Wood Green on Thursday night, plays two or three times a week. Persistence appears to pay off; last February she won Pounds 1,200. Far bigger prizes are available. At the newly-built Top Rank club in Romford, Essex, about 700 players are attempting to win a prize of Pounds 49,354.13. Most of the prize is on offer as part of the National Game, played every night and twice on Saturdays by 675 clubs around the country. The clubs are linked by computer. The numbers come from a central random generator at a centre near Heathrow airport. The prize that night was won by a player at a club in Glasgow. There are enough smaller prizes, from Pounds 50 upwards, however, to give everyone the chance of winning something, sometime. Mrs Jan Jobson, a 26-year old housewife, who plays at the Romford club once a week, won Pounds 1,000 last November. 'It's addictive. Once you've won once, you've got to come back and win again,' she says. No gambling business can succeed, of course, unless customers lose more than they win, but a Gallup survey of bingo players in 1991 found that only 4 per cent had never won anything. A third said they had won more than 10 times. Gaming legislation in the UK places severe constraints, however, on the bingo industry's ability to market itself. All bingo players have to be club members. Although membership is free, customers have to wait 24 hours after being accepted before they can play. Clubs are only allowed to advertise their venues to the public as social meeting places. They are not allowed to say what prize money is available, even on the outside of the club. Much of the broadening of bingo's appeal has been by word of mouth. Mr Jason Derham, a 24-year old painter and decorator who plays at Romford once a month, was persuaded to come by his girlfriend, whose parents had been playing for years. The plastic membership swipe cards, which players use to gain entry do, however, provide clubs with marketing information which they use to target customers directly. Members receive birthday cards from the club, as well as offers such as a free drink on a particular night. The Rank Organisation says it once noticed from the information provided by the cards that a group of regular customers, all living in the same area, had stopped coming. Further investigation revealed that a change in the bus timetable had made it difficult for members from that area to reach the club in time for the start of the session. When the starting time was made slightly later, the customers began playing again.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Abrar Media office in Gaza] </F>   [Text] In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Shaykh  'Abdallah al-Shami, a prominent figure close to the Islamic  Jihad in Gaza, has said that the group has recently been engaged  in a political dialogue to find some formula for action through  a political front [wajihah siyasiyah] that would avoid clashes  with the Palestinian self-rule authority.    The cadres of the movement have almost unanimously agreed to  establish a formula for public political, social, and cultural  action through which the Islamic Jihad can perform its Islamic  duty to further the Palestinian cause, he said.    Shaykh al-Shami, who served as the official spokesman for  the  Islamic Jihad deportees in Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon, said the  public front will not be a substitute for, but a backer of, the  Islamic Jihad.    Asked if this political front will also be active in the  West  Bank areas that are not under the authority of the Palestinian  self-rule council, Shaykh al-Shami explained that the  establishment of the front is linked to the circumstantial  change: the launching of the Palestinian self-rule authority.  The front will operate only in the Palestinian autonomous  region, he said.    Shaykh al-Shami believes the front will be open to all  Palestinians who embrace Islam, are committed to it, and who  work for the Palestinian cause.    On the possibility of the leaders of this front  participating  in the upcoming elections for the self-rule council, Shaykh  al-Shami said it is not necessary for every political party or  political front to participate in all elections or in the  executive power.    Our clear political position, he said, is not to participate  in the institutions of the self-rule, which the Islamic Jihad  has opposed from the very beginning.    Asked about the issue of Hani 'Abid, a journalist close to  the Islamic Jihad who has been detained by the Palestinian  authorities for more than 10 days, al-Shami said that after  several meetings between Palestinian security leaders and  figures close to the Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian security  leadership promised to release 'Abid within a few days.  However, this did not happen and the Islamic Jihad is waiting  for them to keep their promises, he said.</p>

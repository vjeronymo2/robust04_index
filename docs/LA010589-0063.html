			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: TAKE FOOD COMMERCIALS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT  </P> <P> As consumers we are being inundated more and more these days with nutritional  information. It comes at us from every angle, and much of it, I think, indeed  does have an angle. Much of it comes to us compliments of somebody trying to  sell us something.  </P> <P> Television commercials for everything from calcium-enriched orange juice to  polyunsaturated cooking oil try to convince us that their products are really  the best for us.  </P> <P> If you use product "X," you will be healthier, live longer and more productive  lives, have lower incidence of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis,  hardening of the arteries, sexual impotence. Not only that, if you use product  "X" in conjunction with "our proven diet plan," "our proven exercise program"  or in a fat-modified diet including "our oat bran," "natural kiwi fuzz" and our  special "raspberry dazzle" you can conceivably expect to "live well past your  normal life expectancy. You have our word on it."  </P> <P> It has, I think, gotten a little out of hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Like the Snake Oil Salesman  </P> <P> In my opinion the seller of nutrition today is remarkably similar to the snake  oil salesman of years gone by. "Right this way ladies and gentlemen, I hold in  my hand the sure cure for . . . ." Today's society still succumbs to the  promise for simple cures of any ailment, from the guarantee of quick, near  miraculous weight loss -- like Oprah's -- to the more subtle promise of a  dietary cure for diabetes or cancer. In my opinion we, in America, are  bombarded daily with nutrition information that ranges from simply incorrect to  blatant fraud.  </P> <P> Grain cereals are beginning to advertise, "Contains no cholesterol." That's  wonderful. Fits perfectly with "today's active life styles" and all that, but  the fact is that unless the grains advertised were once made with animal fat  (which is highly unlikely -- like making orange juice with apples), they never  did contain cholesterol. So why are they now advertising that they contain "no  cholesterol?"  </P> <P> Is all of this nutrition information really worth anything to us at all, or is  it mostly just hype?  </P> <P> I picked up a flyer at the checkout counter of my supermarket the other day as  I checked out my steaks, tomatoes and canned anchovies. It read: "Nutrition  Therapy -- Chewable Oat Bran Fiber with apple pectin -- Nutrition Therapy  chewable Oat Bran Fiber, 500 mg. is processed in a way that concentrates the  protein, vitamins and minerals found naturally in oats. More importantly,  chewable oat bran is high in water-soluble fiber, which medical research has  indicated may be helpful in lowering cholesterol levels when used as part of a  total dietary program."  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Big Red Letters  </P> <P> The words "lowering cholesterol levels" were, of course, in big red letters.  </P> <P> Reading the label and literature on some of our food products is getting to be  a bit more complicated than reading a legal document. We need a nutritionist  these days just as we need a lawyer to help us wade through the rhetoric and  find reality. Finding one, however, is not nearly so easy as finding a lawyer.  Lawyers are everywhere. There are 31 pages of attorneys listed in the Yellow  Pages of my phone directory, but only 21 names listed between "nursing homes"  and "nuts-edible" under the heading "nutritionists" and only two of these have  "RD" after their name. There were several "Ph.D.s" and "MDs" but those letters  don't often mean very much when it comes to nutrition. It is very possible to  be a Doctor of Philosophy, indeed a world-famous brain surgeon and know very  little about nutrition.  </P> <P> "RD" stands for registered dietitian and indicates that the person after whose  name the letters appear has met the requirements established by the Commission  of Dietetic Registration. Those requirements include a bachelor's degree,  internship or equivalent program, a national examination and continuing  postgraduate study. When you need sound nutritional advice about dieting,  weight loss, reducing fat, salt, cholesterol, etc., don't rely on what you see  on the television or read on the side of cereal boxes; consult a registered  dietitian.  </P> <P> To find one in your area, try your local county public health department,  public health nutritionist, hospital dietary department or simply look in the  phone book Yellow Pages under the heading "Dietitians" (it's between "Diesel  Fuel" and "Disk Jockeys"). Don't look for "Nutritionists": Anyone can call  himself a nutritionist.  </P></p>

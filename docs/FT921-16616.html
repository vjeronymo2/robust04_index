			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / 1992 US Forecast: Recovery at last in sight - Renewed US contraction should not persist The US recession that began in mid-1990 has never really ended. Although real gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of 1 1/2 per cent in the second and third quarters of 1991, this represented no more than a temporary rebound from the depressed levels at the time of the Gulf war. The end of the war triggered purchases, particularly of houses and cars, that had been postponed because of low confidence and soaring oil prices. But there was no follow-through from the initial rebound, and the economy has deteriorated steadily since the summer. Most importantly, the end of the war failed to bring large and steady increases in employment. Modest hiring by factories and home-builders occurred for a time, but was soon swamped by continued lay-offs in sectors less affected by the end of the war. State and local governments made further payroll cuts in response to poor tax collections that created large budget gaps. Employment in defence-related industries continued to drop following last year's budget accord, which called for a 25 per cent reduction in real defence outlays by the mid-1990s. Lay-offs also continued in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors, partly reflecting fall-out from sustained declines in commercial property values and construction activity. The postwar euphoria thus inevitably gave way to a sober recognition on the part of households of the continuing deterioration in employment prospects. Consumer confidence plummeted, back to the levels seen during the Gulf war crisis and even the 1981-82 recession. Accordingly, household spending on a variety of goods declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 1991, with the volume of car sales dipping to the lowest level since the early 1980s. The combination of sharply weaker demand and rising inventories is now bringing the inevitable cuts in output. Industrial production began declining in November and will probably continue to fall into the second quarter of 1992. It is too early to pinpoint the bottom of the business cycle with a high degree of confidence. But there are a number of factors that suggest that the renewed contraction is not likely to be particularly severe or protracted. Inventories are not overly excessive, and cyclical sectors such as cars and housing already have reached recession or near-recession levels of activity. In due course recent and prospective declines in interest rates and the dollar exchange rate, and even possibly some spur from fiscal policy, will boost demand. A reasonable forecast is that a recovery in the overall economy will start by the middle of this year. Last month's easing in monetary policy, in which the discount rate was lowered by a full percentage point and the target Federal funds rate by half a percentage point in a single day, marked a recognition by the monetary authorities of the need for more aggressive action. These moves were followed by a reduction in the prime rate charged by banks to 6 1/2 per cent, nearly two full percentage points below the level last August. Economic activity will also be boosted in time by the lower heels of a Bundesbank tightening, has brought the Dollars /DM exchange rate about 15 per cent lower than the levels that prevailed last summer, and the Dollars /yen exchange rate has come down nearly 10 per cent. The lower dollar should allow US producers to continue to pick up share in world markets. Finally, of course, Congress may well enact some quick-acting fiscal package after it reconvenes this month. Policy in this area, too, could make some contribution to pulling the US out of recession. The current downturn is unusual in that, if it does last until the middle of 1992, it will become the longest contraction since the 1930s. But it will also likely prove to be a mild one in terms of the peak-to-trough decline in real output. This long but gradual downturn reflects the effects of two sets of forces, both of which will tend to ensure that inflation remains well controlled even after the recovery begins. First, the economy is still recovering from a 'hangover' of sorts from excesses that were accumulated during the 1980s. In particular, the economy is still being restrained by the long-term drags of debt retrenchment, service-sector cost-cutting, defence spending cuts, and the after-effects of construction overbuilding. These forces will continue to act as a drag on growth for some time to come. Equally important, current economic weakness reflects the persistently restrictive bias of economic policy. Federal fiscal policy has been tight since 1986, reflecting efforts to reduce the huge federal budget deficit. And monetary policy has not yet been as accommodative as in past recessions, as measured by real interest rates or by money growth. The overall disinflationary thrust of policy over the past half-decade has pushed down nominal GDP growth to its slowest pace in 30 years. The slowdown in total spending has had its main impact on real growth rather than on inflation over the last three years. That mix will change as weak real output growth gradually erodes inflation. The extra capacity in markets for labour and capital created by the weak economic performance of the past three years virtually guarantees that inflation will move significantly lower in the early 1990s. The unemployment rate is likely to hover above 7 1/2 per cent through most of 1992, well above the 5-6 per cent rate considered full employment. In the mid-1980s this level of joblessness pushed growth in labour compensation costs down to 3-3 1/2 per cent annually. From a peak of 5 1/2 per cent briefly attained in early 1991, 'core' consumer price inflation (excluding food and energy) has already dropped to 4 1/2 per cent year-on-year. Over the past six months the annualised increase has been only 3 1/2 per cent, despite a temporary boost from higher excise and sales taxes. Over the coming months, further improvement in inflation should be visible, to 2 1/2 -3 per cent by the end of 1992. This low rate may overstate the extent of decline in price pressures, inasmuch as it would reflect conditions at the recession trough. Even so, a longer-term trend of roughly 3 per cent seems likely.

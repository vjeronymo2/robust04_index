			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ANTI-CIA MURAL IN ECUADOR'S CONGRESS  </P> <P> Re James F. Smith's "The Painter and the Yanquis," Nov. 29: Smith writes, " . .  . some Americans denounce (artist Oswaldo Guayasamin) as a leftist ingrate  guilty of perfidious insult to the United States." This is in reference to a  Nazi helmet with the letters "CIA" emblazoned on it which appears in  Guayasamin's mural in Ecuador's Congress.  </P> <P> If Americans such as U.S. Ambassador Richard Holwill find Guayasamin's mural  offensive to the point of demanding that President of Congress Wilfrido Lucero  climb a ladder in order to paint over the letters, then I suggest that this is  a typically insidious case of Yanqui arrogance approaching Khomeini-style  intolerance.  </P> <P> Rather than removing the letters from the mural, the nefarious and completely  un-American institution of the CIA should be totally and permanently removed  from this hemisphere.  </P> <P> MICHAEL D.

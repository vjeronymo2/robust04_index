			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs erode early Dow advance Wall Street SHARPLY higher overseas equities and the improvement in the dollar provided an early boost for US stock markets yesterday, but a series of late sell programs brought share prices back in their tracks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was only 7.83 up at 3,254.64, well below the day's high of more than 3,270. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a mere 0.03 firmer at 413.54, although the Nasdaq composite finished 4.47 ahead at 563.27. New York SE turnover totalled 178.6m shares. Good rallies in foreign markets, especially in Tokyo, where the Nikkei Average jumped 6.1 per cent, buoyed sentiment when trading in New York opened. The performance of the dollar also provided support for stocks, which have been troubled lately by the currency's decline and its effect on bond prices. The good news from overseas and the currency markets helped equity investors shrug off some mixed economic reports. Although the latest weekly jobless claims fell sharply, the figures were distorted by one-off factors. The news that gross domestic product rose by 1.4 per cent in the second quarter, as had been originally estimated, had no effect on stocks, although a downward revision in the quarterly sales component was slightly worrying. HJ Heinz firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 in active trading after the food group announced a joint venture with Hillsdown Holdings, of the UK, to buy a Hungarian state-owned canning company. GTE declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34 7/8 after broking house Smith Barney cut its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold', saying that the share price had come close to reaching the analyst's target of Dollars 40. News of a strike at one of General Motors' plants in Ohio - which will force the company to cancel production early next week at its Saturn factory - failed to upset the stock, but it suffered from program selling and ended Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 33 3/4 . The other two big motor stocks were also initially firmer but ran into late selling. Ford ended Dollars  1/8 off at Dollars 40 3/8 and Chrysler unchanged at Dollars 19 1/2 . Du Pont lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 49 5/8 after broking house PaineWebber reduced its 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates for the company because of an expected fall in carpet fibre sales and a tightening in refining margins at its Conoco oil subsidiary, which accounts for 20 per cent of Du Pont's operating profits. Canada TORONTO followed Wall Street to close just mildly firmer after retreating from early gains. The TSE 300 index was finally 9.6 up at 3,392.6 and rises led falls by 285 to 207 after volume of 22.9m shares. Deprenyl ended CDollars  1/2 lower at CDollars 7 1/2 . Unfavourable press coverage over the last few days has hammered the stock. The firm issued a statement reassuring investors of the strength of the company. Air Canada, steady at CDollars 4.30, submitted a bid to invest CDollars 400m in Continental Airlines.</p>

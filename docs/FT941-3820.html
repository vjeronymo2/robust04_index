			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Chile eyes trade accord with US: President Frei 'inseparably wedded' to export-led development Chile has a 'good chance' of concluding a free-trade agreement with the US by the end of this year or the start of 1995, Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's new finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Aninat said the new administration of President Eduardo Frei had been assured by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that Chile was next in line for an agreement. It was still not clear whether this would take the form of a bilateral deal with the US or accession to the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Aninat said. Addressing a foreign investment convention in Santiago of more than 100 company executives, Mr Aninat said Chile would continue the process of opening up its economy. It would seek to reduce tariffs and gradually open up its capital account, though there would be no 'adventures' that might destabilise exchange rate policy or threaten growth. Mr Aninat foresaw a step-by-step relaxation of restrictions to foreign investment - such as the one-year period for capital repatriation - over the next six years, but not in 'the very short term'. He predicted that this year would see growth of 4.5 per cent and an investment rate of about 28 per cent, one point higher than the record level achieved in 1993. Mr Frei, who assumed power last Friday, told the convention that he was 'inseparably wedded' to the export-led development model, which he predicted would allow Chile to double the size of its economy in the next decade. That growth would be harnessed to eradicating extreme poverty by the end of the century, one of the 'great tasks' of his government. For this, there was not only a 'moral imperative,' but also 'an important economic objective' in terms of expanding the domestic market and ensuring social stability, he said. Mr Ricardo Lagos, minister of public works, said growth and poverty eradication would require huge improvements in infrastructure. He estimated that Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22bn) would have to be invested by 2010, a goal that would demand the co-operation of the public and private sectors on an unprecedented scale. The government had 'set a target' of spending Dollars 1.5bn a year on infrastructure, double the amount allocated in the 1993 budget, he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> San Francisco police officers used a steel battering ram to smash into an  apartment where they interrupted an alleged drug deal and set off a shoot-out  in which two suspects were wounded. Capt. Michael Brush said one group of  suspects was being ripped off by another group just as the officers entered to  serve a drug warrant. The suspects reportedly began shooting and the officers  returned fire. One man was wounded in the knee and another was grazed in the  head. Nine people were arrested. Officers said they confiscated a large bag  containing what appeared to be cocaine as well as weapons and ammunition.  </P></p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (8): Decision-makers grow wary - Boardroom attitudes Although risk management has not yet achieved the recognition in the UK and Europe that it enjoys in North America, its profile is developing fast. As the business climate and attitudes to litigation continue to change, European organisations are realising their vulnerability to factors and situations beyond their immediate control and are turning increasingly to risk management for protection. The ultimate risk managers of any organisation are the members of the board, but modern business trends such as 'just in time', minimising inventories and streamlining production - very often with single source suppliers - have introduced numerous new factors into the risk equation and further complicated the decision-making process. More than ever before, the senior decision-makers require access to all the facts, and not only those which a champion for a new business venture is likely to emphasise. As a result, a new dynamic role is being created. Increasingly, boards are coming to rely upon their risk managers to supply a 'risk profile' of the principal exposures and the perception of the importance of risk management is growing. This changing perception has been reflected by corresponding changes at Airmic, the UK organisation dedicated to representing the interests of insurance and risk management professionals, which has recently introduced corporate membership. Despite the fact that it has not yet actively marketed the new membership category, the association already has some 80 corporate members, most of which are drawn from the UK's top 200 companies. The credibility of insurance buyers and risk managers at board level has been much enhanced by Airmic during the past two years, as a result of its drive to fully represent the views of its members to the government and other decision makers. The association has played a crucial role from the outset in the terrorism issue, and has been heavily involved in the debate on equalisation reserves for insurance companies, the imposition of insurance premium tax, environmental considerations, and a number of other technical insurance-related issues. This high profile has earned the association an authoritative position on risk management and insurance issues. It now maintains a regular programme of contact with MPs, the UK's department of trade and industry and other government departments. Many of Airmic's members are multinational organisations and demand a global view of risk management issues. The association has done much to strengthen relationships with overseas risk management organisations and to ensure that the UK does not become isolated. This is an important consideration in view of the evolution of a single Europe where, with the continuous development of European Union (EU) legislation, risk management organisations share a common interest. Airmic plays an active role alongside the Association Europeenne Des Assures De L'Industrie (AEAI) which represents the various European risk management societies. This activity is important because it gives Airmic access to a lobbying capability in Brussels, the heart of the EU. Airmic is also a key member of the International Federation of Insurance and Risk Management Associations (Ifrima), through which it liaises with sister organisations in Europe, North and South America, Australia, South Africa, India and the Far East. Airmic works together on a number of issues with the North American Association Rims which, together with the Public Risk Insurance Management Association (Prima), is a very powerful organisation with significant influence and lobbying capability. A principal objective of all the risk management associations is to enhance the credibility of the function at the most senior level as any structured risk management approach will work properly only if it is endorsed at this level. The reality is, however, that most risks are encountered at operational level, and this is where the emphasis on control should fall. Risk management is not just about catastrophic events; it is a culture that, like safety and quality, should be imbued throughout the organisation. An important building block is an open-minded review of past experience and significant benefits can be gained from analysis of incidents, both in frequency and cause. Another important feature of any risk management programme is its risk transfer and insurance arrangements. Many organisations in North America and in Europe are building their risk management structures alongside what used to be the insurance department. The diversity of the function is such that there is unlikely to be any one section of the organisation with a wide enough remit to influence all aspects; however, we believe that the risk management function should operate not in an independent way but as a catalyst, in making sure that a broad perspective is taken of risk situations and co-operative expertise brought to the problems and the board.

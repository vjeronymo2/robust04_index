			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Colgate-Palmolive ahead 27% COLGATE-PALMOLIVE, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported a 27 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income and a 14 per cent increase in earnings per share. The company reported net income of Dollars 110m, or 66 cents a share, up from Dollars 86.9m, or 58 cents, in the same period of last year on sales 12 per cent higher at Dollars 1.77bn. The company had 14 per cent more shares outstanding in the quarter than a year before. For the full year, Colgate reported net income of Dollars 477m, or Dollars 2.92 a share, compared to Dollars 124.9m, or 77 cents, in 1991 when the company took a Dollars 243m restructuring charge. Excluding the charge, income rose 30 per cent, while earnings per share were up 14 per cent on sales 16 per cent ahead at Dollars 7bn. The 1992 figures were helped by the Mennen personal care business, which Colgate acquired early in the year. Mr Reuben Mark, chairman, said each of Colgate's four main geographic regions achieved excellent growth, with the largest base business sales increases coming from Latin America and Asia/Africa. Gross profit margins had set a record of 47.1 per cent, up from 45.6 per cent, as the company moved its product mix towards high-margin personal care products and invested in more efficient production. In the fourth quarter household and personal care product sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 1.53bn, while specialty marketing, which includes pet nutrition and healthcare, was 6 per cent ahead at Dollars 237.4m.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEWS;  </P> <P> MAMET STEPS DOWN FROM SHRINE  </P> <P> Some Freaks by David Mamet (Viking: $16.95; 182 pages).  </P> <P> Admire David Mamet and you'll get your head bitten off, or at the very least, a  cigar in the face.  </P> <P> There he is on the book jacket, glowering from his car window, half his face in  shadow. If you are a cop who'd stopped him for a broken tail-light, you'd  return to the cruiser and radio for back-up. If you are his wife, you'd take  the garbage out yourself, and make sure not to walk between him and the TV set.  </P> <P> Such, more or less, is the image suggested in this assorted collection of  articles, addresses, musings and rumbles. Mamet is virtually a poet of the  theater, drawing a musical sweet haplessness out of his sharpies and dummies.  He doesn't thank you to say so.  </P> <P> "I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU and the NRA and I never signed up to  be sensitive," he writes in a piece about playing poker with the boys.  </P> <P> Attending a convention of counterinsurgency groupies sponsored by Soldier of  Fortune magazine, he frets that his Oxford shirt and blue jeans will mark him  as "another wussy Eastern intellectual with a marvelous gift for dialogue."  </P> <P> He takes part wholeheartedly, shooting off a pistol and entering the pugil  stick contest. He knocks his first opponent into the swimming pool, and is  knocked over by the second, though not before overpowering him in the  preliminary ritual scream.  </P> <P> "Lovely people," he writes of the conventioneers, even if he doesn't agree with  some of their ideas. "But then I don't agree with some of my own ideas and seem  powerless to rid myself of them." And he adds that they "seemed to love the  idea of America in much the same way that someone else might love the idea of  the Theater -- that is, as a perfect institution."  </P> <P> By rights, that last half-phrase would qualify as sensitive, and maybe  brilliant. But Mamet, one of our authentic theater artists, may have made his  bed but he will not be caught dead lying in it. In these assorted pieces, he  hacks away at any hint of enshrinement.  </P> <P> He tells the Signet Society at Harvard -- he must have jumped at the chance to  perform the lion in a den of sensitive Daniels -- that if he became an artist  it was not mainly because of talent or message. Perhaps it was "to accommodate  and embrace a deviant personality which was not going to be employed  elsewhere." If you're a left-handed plumber, in other words, you do left-handed  pipe-bends.  </P> <P> It can be as tedious for an artist to flaunt his hairy chest as his hair shirt.  Mamet's art, in any case, does not principally lie in writing such occasional  pieces as are collected here in "Some Freaks." Many are as rough in workmanship  as in message; there is a lot of sounding off and putting the feet up. It makes  the feet feel good, but readers aren't feet.  </P> <P> Aside from eight or nine pieces too slight or ephemeral to survive collecting,  Mamet usually has something worthwhile, or arresting, or bruising to say. He is  witty and idiosyncratic for part of the trip. The trick is to get off in time.  The stop after idiosyncrasy is sententiousness.  </P> <P> Mamet's notes on being a first-time film director -- "House of Games" -- nicely  distinguish those things a director can do from those he should submit to.  Sometimes, a general's job is simply to be seen on his white horse. Mamet  writes of stepping ceremonially up to the viewfinder for each shot -- at this  stage, the real responsibility belongs to the cinematographer -- and  ostentatiously reversing the bill on his cap.  </P> <P> Discussing acting for TV, he advises the performer to do little. The script  will furnish the characterization, he writes. Acting technique should aim "to  render the actor sufficiently uninflected to allow the audience to accept him  in a multiplicity of roles."  </P> <P> Two of the pieces denounce what Mamet sees as the tendency of American Jews to  downplay their Jewishness. Reform Judaism, in particular, he calls "religion in  a plain brown wrapper, the selling point of which was that it would not  embarrass us."  </P> <P> He argues that American Jews are dedicated to speaking up for civil rights and  social equality for all minority groups except their own. Young Jewish women of  his generation, he writes, flocked to enroll in Black Studies programs. And  their friends and families, he adds, "supported them in their support of Black  self-love at the same time we supported them in surgically recarving their  faces so that they would look less 'Jewish.' "  </P> <P> There is a brutal wit here -- it sounds like Jackie Mason -- but it seems a  partial view, to say the least, and considering the backlash among Jewish  voters to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, partly outdated.  </P> <P> It is also hard to know what he means when he laments that Jewish houses look  like Yankee houses and have no visual identity. What would a specifically  Jewish house look like? What, for that matter, would a specifically Catholic  house look like? If you want to be fundamental about it: like tents, both of  them.  </P></p>

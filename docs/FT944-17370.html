			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Growth continues at European chip maker The strong improvement in results at SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, continued in the second quarter with profits increasing 47 per cent to Dollars 86.5m. The second-quarter rise took first-half net profits to Dollars 166.1m, slightly above the figure for the whole of 1993. The first half of the group's financial year ended at the beginning of July. The company, formed in 1987 through the merger of Thomson Semiconductor of France and Italy's SGS Microelectronics, said the improvement in results reflected the buoyancy of the international semiconductor market, the introduction of products and increased productivity. The strong demand for semiconductors and related products was reflected in sales of Dollars 1.27bn, a rise of 32 per cent over the comparable period in 1993. In the second quarter, revenues amounted to Dollars 672m. SGS-Thomson said all of its principal product groups increased sales in the second quarter, while bookings during the period were described as strong. The company's principal markets include semiconductors for applications in telecoms, computers and control systems. Its principal geographical markets in Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific, reported increased turnover. Industry analysts in Paris said they expected the strong sales growth of the past few years to slow towards the end of this year. 'Demand will remain healthy for the foreseeable future, but there will be a cooling off as more capacity comes on stream and as the cycle peaks,' said an electronics analyst. SGS-Thomson said it had continued to invest heavily in new equipment and facilities, particularly in France, Italy and the US. However, the debt-to-equity ratio was maintained at about 25 per cent, according to the group.</p>

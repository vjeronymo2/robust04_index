			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Management: Irritable, moody, late and high - Health Check / The difficulties of detecting drug abuse in the office Although many of us have images of manic currency dealers who use cocaine recreationally, or of criminals addicted to heroin, drug abusers rarely conform to neat stereotypes. They are found across the spectrum, some of them in jobs which appear responsible and even staid. In the UK there are thought to be more than 100,000 regular users of hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine, and an unknown number who use cannabis and other drugs generally considered 'soft'. However, the distinction may be academic - what counts is the effect on performance. Drugs have obvious dangers in areas such as the transport industry. But drug use also poses more subtle hazards, such as inaccuracies, poor attendance and petty theft to support the habit. There can be more sickness leave, higher staff turnover and economic loss - in the US an estimated Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) is lost in annual productivity because of drug abuse. For employers, legal repercussions are a possibility. In the event of an accident, for instance, charges could be brought under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (which obliges employers to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of employees and others who may be affected by the work). Symptoms which raise suspicions of drug use in a colleague or employee include moodiness, irritability, erratic output, mistakes and bad timekeeping. But these can be caused by fatigue, stress or physical illness. One cannot know without testing. In Britain the basic drug screening menu covers amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine and opiates (such as heroin and morphine), and one can test for many others, such as barbiturates and bensodiazepines (diazepam and other tranquillisers). Some organisations test 'with cause' - when there is some reason to suspect drug use. Others may test all their employees and prospective employees. In the transport industry, much testing is related to the Transport and Works Act (Alcohol and Drug section) 1992. The act came into effect after the Cannon Street crash of 1991 when the train driver tested positive for cannabis. Oil companies such as Texaco, Shell and Esso have screening programmes which are especially relevant to offshore work. In one study of platform workers, 9.2 per cent tested positive for cannabis. Hilary Goodwin, a specialist occupational health physician, points out that several weeks' worth of drugs are easier to conceal on a rig than several weeks' worth of alcohol. Nowadays, many medium-sized enterprises are also taking up screening. In these businesses, drugs may pose no obvious physical danger, but users can still be a liability. Lindsay Hadfield of Medscreen, a company which conducts drug testing programmes, has noticed increasing awareness of the effects on office-based staff. 'Lapses in concentration can be crucial if, for instance, they result in a contract containing a figure with the wrong number of noughts'. Testing is far from simple. There may be false positives (cough mixtures and poppy seeds can give positive tests for opiates) and false negatives, in that cocaine and heroin only persist for 12 to 48 hours in the body, while cannabis can last weeks. Acquiring the sample is problematical. The urine sample must come from the individual who is being tested, without adulteration or substitution, and must be sent to the lab in a tamper-proof container. Throughout the procedure tight controls and documentary evidence are needed. Screening is obviously costly for a business and there has to be a reason for it. In particular, there is no point testing for drugs unless it is clear what to do next. Goodwin, who has particular expertise in policy development and in testing for alcohol and drug abuse in the workplace, says: 'It's crucial to have a company policy setting out the purpose of testing - and the action to be taken in the case of a positive test - before any testing begins. Company policy influences the way tests are interpreted, so test results should be interpreted by a doctor with a special interest in drug misuse at work.' Increasingly, organisations perceive drug use to be a matter for confidential counselling and treatment of an individual as much as for disciplinary action. Some companies, such as London Underground and Shell, have their own in-house counselling units. Those which do not have to turn elsewhere. The charity Turning Point offers an advice service for organisations, and training for personnel staff and supervisors. John Marsden of Turning Point says: 'We would always encourage an employer to survey local treatment services in their area. It's often possible to network into what's available'. He adds that a number of treatment providers will co-operate by confirming that an employee who has been referred has in fact attended.

The world economy is not always favorable. [passage  indistinct] at times is hard to obtain. Therefore, the spirit of  depending on ourselves, our own efforts, our own materials, our  own resources -- human, material, and financial -- is the real  background and foundation to any successful development activity.    So this is the spirit from which we have to borrow here. We  would also like to strengthen and encourage existing relations  and areas of cooperation. We came here to borrow quite a lot of  ideas. You have been successful in many fields, notwithstanding,  of course, the fact that you are going through a very special  period. This, however, further strengthens the spirit of the  Revolution.    Thus, forward we shall go. [end recording]</p>

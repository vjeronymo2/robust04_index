			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulundi May 5 SAPA -- Dr. Frank Themba Mdlalose,  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] premier designate for KwaZulu-Natal  has had a long and illustrious political career spanning about  19 years.    Educated at St Francis High School, Mariannhill, outside  Durban, the good-natured Mdlalose matriculated in 1949. He then  attended the University of Fort Hare where he obtained an  education diploma.    From 1950 until 1953 he was the African National Congress  Youth League branch president.    Mdlalose continued his studies at the University of Natal  and  in 1958 he obtained his MB CH B degree, and became a resident  doctor at Durban's King Edward Hospital.    Subsequently he became a medical practitioner in  Atteridgeville near Pretoria, and Steadville and Madadeni in  northern Natal.    Mdlalose joined the IFP at its launch in 1975.    In 1978 Mdlalose was appointed minister of interior in the  KwaZulu Legislative Assembly [KLA] in Ulundi -- a position he  held for five years. He was then appointed minister of health.    Mdlalose has won the respect and admiration of political  friend and foe alike as an outspoken and gentle-mannered  politician.    He has often taken a more moderate line than his KLA  counterparts. Mdlalose has played a vital role in steering the  IFP through the hurly-burly of democracy negotiations. He was  appointed minister without portfolio to take on this mantle as a  negotiator at the World Trade Centre.    Rumours abounded in 1993 that he had attempted to resign but  was persuaded otherwise by close friend and IFP leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi. A subsequent car crash in which Mdlalose  sustained serious injuries is still shrouded in mystery.    Mdlalose was born in Nquthu, northern Natal to Jaconia  Mdlalose, a general dealer and Tabitha Mthembu, a teacher.    He is married to Eunice Nokuthula Sikhosane and has three  sons and two daughters. His interests include child welfare,  tennis and boxing.</p>

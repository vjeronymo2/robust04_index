			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Observer: Party line A bit odd that Midland Independent Newspapers, which is being floated on the stock market, has the same chairman as the Tory party. Sir Norman Fowler can point to the fact that he accepted the chairmanship of the regional newspaper chain a good six months before he was tapped to be party chairman. Although it sounds like he will be stepping down as party chairman before long, he has not given up hope of further high office. The group stoutly defends its editorial independence but perhaps it should remove the independent from its title until Sir Norman quits the political scene once and for all.</p>

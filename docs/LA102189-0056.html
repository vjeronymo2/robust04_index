			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEATHER ADDS TO BAY AREA MISERY; BUSH VIEWS HAVOC;  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE: COLD AND THE THREAT OF RAIN DAMPEN SPIRITS AS A GRIM PRESIDENT  PROMISES QUICK FEDERAL AID.  </P> <P> Bay Area quake victims, including more than 6,500 still displaced from their  homes, were beset by new miseries Friday in the form of falling temperatures,  the threat of rain and mounting damages, but they were promised quick federal  relief by a grim President Bush.  </P> <P> Any relief will be welcomed as more careful study of the area struck by  Tuesday's 6.9-magnitude quake -- and more than 1,500 aftershocks -- pushed  conservative damage estimates to more than $4.2 billion. "On paper, the city is  broke," said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.  </P> <P> The official death toll rose to 53 Friday as more bodies were pulled from the  debris of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland. The toll includes 32 in  Alameda County, where the double-decked freeway is located, 10 in San  Francisco, five each in Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties, and one in  Monterey County.  </P> <P> A San Francisco coroner's office spokesman, who asked not to be identified,  said five people are also missing and presumed dead in the rubble of the city's  Marina District buildings.  </P> <P> At least 3,011 injuries were reported, the state Office of Emergency Services  said, and a hospital association said that 250 people were still being treated  in hospitals.  </P> <P> Weather conditions turned less favorable Friday, with cool blustery winds  pushing out the Indian summer that had made the first two days after the  devastating quake at least bearable. But rain was forecast for much of the  region on Saturday, and temperatures were expected to drop into the 40s in the  Santa Cruz mountains, where many residents are camping in their yards.  </P> <P> Bush flew into the Bay Area from Washington on Friday morning and made  inspection stops at the site of the crumbled Nimitz Freeway in Oakland and in  downtown Santa Cruz, where several buildings in a pedestrian mall had  collapsed.  </P> <P> Bush appeared stunned as he arrived Friday morning at the scene of the crumbled  freeway in west Oakland. "Jesus," he muttered aloud. "I'm deeply moved by this,  deeply moved," the President said.  </P> <P> Bush named Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to keep federal relief  flowing smoothly.  </P> <P> Agnos said he talked with the President for about 45 minutes Friday and was  pleased with the conversation.  </P> <P> "I am satisfied that we had a chance to get our points across. We had plenty of  time to talk to him," Agnos said. "He was disturbed by what he saw and I was  impressed by the sincerity of his reaction."  </P> <P> At the scene of the Nimitz Freeway disaster, Oakland police said 32 bodies had  been recovered and about 85 possible other victims are listed as missing. About  40 vehicles have been pulled out, half of them without occupants. Police Capt.  James Hahn said at least 52 cars remain stuck in the rubble.  </P> <P> Work was suspended at 7 p.m. Friday after workers using a jackhammer to break  up concrete debris felt "some shifting and shaking of the entire structure,"  said Kyle Nelson, spokesman for Caltrans, the state transportation authority.  </P> <P> Nelson said he anticipates rescue work resuming by daybreak after the collapsed  double-decked freeway is shored up with steel, wood and "tons and tons of  dirt."  </P> <P> The vehicles being pulled empty from the rubble apparently were abandoned in  the seconds during and after the main quake, Caltrans spokesman Greg Bayol  said.  </P> <P> "People must have stopped their cars and got out when they realized (the upper  deck) was beginning to fall," Bayol said. "I know one person's body was found  on the freeway; we think that person stopped the car, got out and got hit by  another car."  </P> <P> Some cars may also have been parked in a lot beneath the lower deck of the 1  1/4-mile stretch of Interstate 880 freeway that fell.  </P> <P> The state Office of Emergency Services said it knew of 6,569 people believed to  be displaced from their homes. Most of them were forced to seek the aid of  friends, check into hotels or motels, spend the nights at evacuation centers or  camp out in parks and front yards. As many as 500 victims have been spending  the night on blankets at Callaghan Park in Watsonville.  </P> <P> But in Santa Cruz County, the area with the most residences destroyed by the  quake, officials said the number of people facing the weekend -- and perhaps  far longer -- out of their homes is much higher.  </P> <P> Nancy Gordon, Santa Cruz County emergency services coordinator, estimated that  between 8,000 and 10,000 county residents are in that situation. "They are not  necessarily homeless," she said. "Some are just afraid of aftershocks."  </P> <P> Small towns along the mountain ridges that isolate Santa Cruz from the Bay Area  took the worst hit, with hundreds of houses and other buildings destroyed or  damaged.  </P> <P> In the city of Santa Cruz, about 50 houses were judged uninhabitable. But Mayor  Mardi Wormhoudt said six to eight buildings along the open-air Pacific Garden  Mall, the heart of the city's historic downtown, will have to be demolished and  that another six or so may face a similar fate. In all, 250 businesses that  employ 2,000 people were damaged on the mall. Most of the buildings date from  1880 to 1910 and were of unreinforced brick construction.  </P> <P> At least three people died when a department store and a coffee emporium on the  mall collapsed.  </P> <P> Santa Cruz's popular beachside amusement area suffered some damage. The ground  buckled near the Ferris wheel and log ride, which will remain closed until  spring, but the 65-year-old Big Dipper roller coaster and other rides will  reopen in two weeks, said Marq Lipton, marketing director of the boardwalk  complex.  </P> <P> Long lines were reported at Santa Cruz markets and gasoline stations Friday.  And some people complained of price gouging.  </P> <P> Employees of a local Long's drugstore filled two vans with water bottles,  batteries, baby formula, diapers and other items, and gave the products away to  customers and social service agencies. The prescription pharmacy was run out of  a side door by flashlight even though "literally 65%" of the store's stock lay  on the floor, dumped there by the quake.  </P> <P> Charleston, S.C., hit hard by the recent Hurricane Hugo, sent five police  officers and 7,000 gallons of fresh water to help Santa Cruz, as a way of  thanking California for its aid. "We thought we'd return the favor," said  Charleston Patrolman Frederick Pasley, 25, who was standing guard along the  mall.  </P> <P> Caltrans estimates that California 17, the major highway into Santa Cruz from  the north, will be closed for four to six weeks. Raw sewage from the Santa Cruz  area continued to flow into Monterey Bay Friday from breaks in two major sewer  lines. "It's pretty significant," said Diane Evans of the county Department of  Environmental Health, adding that beaches in the area were closed.  </P> <P> Gary Patton, chairman of the Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors, said he was  pleased that Bush came to Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> "He understands that we've got to get people out of the shelters, and he said,  'We will do as a nation whatever is necessary,' " Patton said. "We're going to  hold him to it."  </P> <P> Others in the Santa Cruz area said they hoped that the devastation in their  less-traveled county would not be forgotten as the media attention focuses on  San Francisco and Oakland.  </P> <P> "I hope we don't get forgotten. We are smaller but proportionately we were hit  very hard," said Karen McNally, geophysics professor at UC Santa Cruz and  director of the Charles F. Richter Seismology Laboratory.  </P> <P> In Watsonville, which sometimes calls itself the frozen-food capital of the  country, processing plants were finding it hard to get workers to help with  clean-up efforts and work in fields.  </P> <P> The town's center took heavy damage from the Tuesday quake, and several hundred  families have stayed huddled outside of their damaged homes since a major  aftershock Thursday morning.  </P> <P> "Our house is in terrible shape, and we have nowhere to leave the children,"  said Armando Ortiz, warming his hands over a barrel fire on a high school  football field. "They are still very frightened, and I don't want to leave my  family alone."  </P> <P> In Salinas, in Monterey County, the City Council ignored pleas by the Salinas  Historical Society that they were "throwing away the most historically  significant buildings in Salinas," and ordered demolition of six badly damaged  old structures on Main Street. Among the buildings the society had tried to  save were the Cominos and Franklin hotels.  </P> <P> The Cominos, which used to be the largest hotel in Salinas, was built in 1874  and was immortalized by John Steinbeck in "East of Eden."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, geologists said Friday they had found evidence of slippage along the  San Andreas Fault in a 30-mile section between Lexington Reservoir and the town  of San Juan Bautista.  </P> <P> James Diederich, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, said  the slippage was found in a laser survey of landmarks in the area. Preliminary  evidence showed a right lateral "strike-slip" along the San Andreas, but does  not conclusively prove that the notorious fault was involved in Tuesday's  earthquake.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, the biggest crowd of displaced victims -- about 1,000 people,  most of whom were homeless before the quake -- have spent the nights at the  Moscone Center convention hall. Bob Prentice, the mayor's coordinator of  homeless programs, said that as many as 1,000 city-financed hotel rooms used to  shelter the homeless had been lost to the earthquake.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, San Francisco city inspectors continued their evaluation of 2,000  Marina District buildings that were damaged in the quake. Laurence M.  Kornfield, the chief building inspector, said the job should be finished today.  </P> <P> On Thursday night, emergency officials had to coax reluctant residents out of  their earthquake-damaged homes.  </P> <P> "At 11 o'clock last night we got a 93-year-old man out of one house and we had  18 people who we had to get food and water for because they wouldn't come out  of their homes," said Mayor Agnos, who had been on the scene. The residents  were afraid that once they left, they would not be allowed to return, Agnos  said.  </P> <P> Several hundred residents lined up Friday morning at Marina Middle School, the  local center for disaster planning, to get the coveted colored passes that  identified them as tenants and property owners so they would be allowed in to  visit their homes. A green card bestowed permission to return home. A yellow  one allowed a brief visit to remove possessions.  </P> <P> Red barred entry except with a city inspector, and only then after the tenant  signed a waiver of liability for the city.  </P> <P> But enforcement was spotty. Getting through official barricades often depended  on who was checking passes.  </P> <P> Joe DiMaggio, the baseball legend, waited in line with the less famous. "I'm  just like anybody else," said DiMaggio, who added that he has lived in the  Marina District since 1937. Later a top-level building inspector took him in  hand.  </P> <P> Liz Burrie finally got to her apartment building at North Point and Divisadero  at 6 a.m. Friday. The entire four-story structure had collapsed. She picked her  way over the rubble, accompanied by an inspector and a police officer, and  climbed into what used to be her top-floor bay window. She spent an hour  hauling out what she could find.  </P> <P> She found her cat alive, but the animal skittered away in the debris.  </P> <P> "It is unbelievable how much survived," Burrie said.  </P> <P> Urgency built among the anxious residents, those without shelter and those just  wishing to collect their possessions, as the changing weather brought blustery  winds and the threat of a cold rain.  </P> <P> Residents cast out of their homes by the earthquake or the worried building  inspectors continued to stream into shelters around the Bay Area.  </P> <P> "They keep condemning buildings and we get more and more people," said Charlton  Horne, volunteer coordinator at the American Red Cross shelter at Martin Luther  King Elementary School in Oakland.  </P> <P> James Roberts, chief of the structures division for Caltrans, said in  Sacramento that the Embarcadero Freeway in downtown San Francisco will remain  closed, possibly until 1991.  </P> <P> Roberts said the Embarcadero, which is elevated above the San Francisco  waterfront and ends in North Beach, will not be reopened until its concrete  pillars are reinforced with steel to ensure that they will not give way and  collapse in the next major quake. This work cannot even be designed until an  investigation of the Nimitz collapse is completed in three or four months.  </P> <P> A moderate aftershock Friday evening briefly closed three lanes of U.S. 101 in  Marin County, but Caltrans said the damage was minor.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles Friday announced a list of 19  Japanese corporations that had donated almost $4 million to the earthquake  relief effort. A $1-million contribution from Sony Corp. was the largest.  </P> <P> This story was written in Los Angeles by Times staff writers Kevin Roderick and  Myrna Oliver from staff reports in the Bay Area and Santa Cruz County.  </P> <P> The following Times staff members contributed to earthquake coverage.

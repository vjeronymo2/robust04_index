			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGES COURT PUBLIC AT WESTWOOD FORUM;  </P> <P> JUDICIARY: SOME OF THE 30 JURISTS URGED PRESSURE ON THE LEGISLATURE TO CHANGE  UNPOPULAR LAWS THAT GUIDE THE BENCH'S RULINGS.  </P> <P> A group of 30 local judges shucked their robes and gavels, but maintained their  judicial restraint Tuesday night as they fielded questions from the public  about what they do and why they do it.  </P> <P> The unprecedented event, one of 70 public forums scheduled around the state  during "Meet Your Judges Week," drew about 275 members of the public to  Wadsworth Theater in Westwood.  </P> <P> Topics of the questions varied from grandparents' visitation rights to why  criminals are paroled before serving their full terms in prison. The answer to  the second question -- that prisoners are released early under a state law  passed by the Legislature and that trial judges have nothing to do with it --  was one of their key messages of the evening.  </P> <P> Going to the podium to answer specific questions, judge after judge said in one  way or another that they don't have as much power or leeway as the public seems  to think, because the Legislature makes the laws and higher courts interpret  them.  </P> <P> "If you don't like the system, you have to change it through the state  Legislature," said the panel moderator, "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner.  "Judges can't do it."  </P> <P> The judges also urged the public not to judge the system by what they see in  the media, either in fictionalized dramas or news reporting on unusual cases  that make headlines.  </P> <P> "The newspapers are not going to tell you about the everyday cases," said  Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor. "You're seeing the extremes."  </P> <P> At the Westwood forum, 18 Los Angeles County Superior Court judges and one  commissioner were joined on the stage by Municipal Court judges (including  Wapner's son, Fred, newly appointed to the bench) and commissioners from Los  Angeles, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City.  </P> <P> Their stated mission for the evening was to "demystify" the judicial process  for citizens. Superior Court Judge David Perez noted that judges, isolated by  their canons of ethics and constrained by law from commenting on pending cases,  are virtually required by the judicial system to be remote, almost anonymous  figures.  </P> <P> Indeed, according to one poll, Wapner, who had a distinguished career on the  Superior Court bench before becoming a television star, is better known to the  public than U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  </P> <P> The barriers between the judiciary and the public are basically impenetrable,  Superior Court Judge Sara Radin said when asked, "How can people with no money  get in to talk to a judge?"  </P> <P> "No one can just walk in and talk to a judge," she said.  </P> <P> Even at the forum, only written questions were taken and answered, prompting  Arthur Sigler of West Los Angeles, who said he had expected a spirited verbal  exchange, to contend that he felt "cheated" by the controlled, low-key format.  </P> <P> Some of the judges mingled with the crowd after the two-hour forum ended. Those  whose queries went unanswered and who included their address will receive a  written answer in the mail, forum organizers promised.  </P> <P> The judicial decorum that permeated the forum was occasionally punctuated by an  aside, as when Beverly Hills Municipal Court Judge Judith Stein introduced  herself by saying she was not the "Zsa Zsa" judge. (Judge Charles Rubin, who  presided at Zsa Zsa Gabor's misdemeanor trial last year, was on the panel  Tuesday evening, but no one asked him about the headline-grabbing case.)  </P> <P> Another headline case was clearly on citizens' and the judges' minds, as  illustrated by a question put to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge, James  Albracht, who hears criminal cases in Santa Monica: What can a judge do to  limit long trials?  </P> <P> "The bottom line is -- I don't know," Albracht replied, noting his "fine, wise"  colleague Superior Court Judge William Pounders' vain efforts to shorten the  marathon McMartin Preschool molestation trial.  </P> <P> Albracht said current law and interpretations by higher courts, particularly  the state Supreme Court during the tenure of former Chief Justice Rose Bird,  have given attorneys a long leash, making it hard "for even a fine judge to  clamp down on lawyers." He also said that, if a prosecutor chooses to file an  unwieldy 50- or 100-count case, a judge has little power to pare it down.  </P> <P> That answer, however, drew a sharp retort from Wapner, who said it was wrong to  blame the higher court or attorneys. "Judges are in charge and you take  charge," Wapner insisted.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David Rothman, the supervising judge of the Santa Monica  courthouse, ended the evening fielding a question that brought a smile to his  face. It came from a 15-year-old who was contemplating a career in the  judiciary and wanted to know if Rothman would become a judge all over again if  given the chance.  </P> <P> "The answer is absolutely," said Rothman. "You touch many lives. . . . The  money ain't great. The colleagues are terrific, wonderful, bright people."  </P> <P> Judges are called upon daily to make such decisions as the custody of an infant  -- "a heart-rending decision," said Rothman. "That's the kind of stuff that the  people whom you're looking at do."  </P></p>

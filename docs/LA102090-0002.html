			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OZZY'S MESSAGE  </P> <P> As a 47-year-old Ozzy Osbourne fan, I thought I'd heard every conceivable  criticism of his music and antics from the mean-spirited people of my  generation who've forgotten how rock 'n' roll enriched our own lives. But now,  with the lame excuse of bereavement over a teen suicide, they're trying to  blame a tragedy that must have myriad causes on Ozzy's masterpiece of  anti-booze propaganda, "Suicide Solution."  </P> <P> Do they read the lyrics they're condemning? Lines like "Grab a bottle, drown  your sorrow" and "Now you live inside a bottle; the Reaper's moving at full  throttle" are bluntly satirical attacks on our hypocrisy about alcohol.  </P> <P> This isn't Shakespeare, requiring several readings and years of contemplation  to interpret. Any adult who can't understand this ham-fisted pop poetry must  think that "Moby Dick" is an anti-whaling treatise and that Kafka's  "Metamorphosis" is about bugs!  </P> <P> GENE FELLNER  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

It was signed by 70 countries.    Russia has, however, officially announced it is not going to  join this agreement.    Sada Aksartova, a spokeswoman for the international  ecological organisation Greenpeace, in commenting on the Russian  Federation's stand, told a RIA correspondent it was a great  mistake on the part of the Russian Government, and will evoke a  highly negative response from the other countries.    Among the major powers, according to Aksartova, only  Australia, in addition to Russia, has refused to accede to the  agreement, "taking time-out" for two years.</p>

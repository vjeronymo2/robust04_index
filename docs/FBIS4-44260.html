			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Following the failure to choose a  successor for European Union Commission President Jacques  Delors, the Federal Government is obviously distancing itself to  a certain extent from its previous support of Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. One must look for a solution over  the next three weeks until the special summit in Brussels on 15  July, Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel told the press on Monday  [27 June]. One cannot yet see what the solution could be like.  In a newspaper interview Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free  Democratic Party), however, had praised Dehaene once again as a  "dedicated European" and added that the European Union needs "a  doer." Dehaene had failed to be chosen because of the British  veto at the Corfu summit.</p>

The DoD, as the matching agency under the Privacy Act, is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of a computer matching program between OPM and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The objective is to identify individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay and (1) credit for military service in their civil service annuities, or (2) annuities based on the `guaranteed minimum' disability formula. This match will identify and/or prevent erroneous payments under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA), the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (FERSA), and the Joint Uniform Military Retired Pay System. This agreement replaces all existing data exchange agreements that pertain to the disclosure of beneficiary payment data between DMDC and OPM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed action will become effective January 12, 1995, and the computer matching will proceed accordingly without further notice, unless comments are received which would result in a contrary determination or if the Office of Management and Budget or Congress objects thereto.

The purpose of the match is to exchange personal data between the agencies for identification of individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay. The match will yield the identity and location of those individuals within the Federal government so that OPM can make more timely and accurate adjustments in benefits, and prevent or correct overpayments, fraud and abuse, thus assuring proper benefit payments. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A copy of the computer matching agreement between OPM and DoD is available upon request to the public.

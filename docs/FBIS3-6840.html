			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- The No. 1 opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ended part of its Diet boycott  Tuesday [22 March], agreeing to enact a set of 16 bills and a  fiscal 1994 stopgap budget by the end of this month, officials  said. Parliamentary strategists from the coalition and  opposition camps reached the accord in a meeting.    The 16 bills are mostly budget-related ones. The provisional  budget, which is expected to total around 11 trillion yen,  covers government spending in the initial 50 days of fiscal 1994  starting April 1.    However, the LDP refused to comply with a coalition request  to launch deliberations on the 73.08 trillion yen full budget  for fiscal 1994 by the House of Representatives Budget  Committee, the officials said. The prospect for the opening of  the key parliamentary committee session has remained uncertain,  they said.    During the day's meeting of parliamentary strategists, the  coalition asked the LDP to accept their proposal to allow the  cabinet to explain the new state budget before the committee,  they said. Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs  Committee rejected the request, renewing an LDP demand that  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa provide more information about  his 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin  trucking group.    Meanwhile, Hosokawa again turned down the opposition demand  to submit documents that would corroborate his claims that he  repaid the 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin Co. Hosokawa  told reporters at his official residence, "there is nothing I  can do" to comply with the LDP's demand to see the financial  documents on the Sagawa loan to help revive parliamentary  discussion on the fiscal 1994 budget bill.    Neither would Hosokawa bend on his earlier refusal to  arrange  for his former financial secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, to appear  before the Diet committee to testify concerning LDP allegations  that Hosokawa accepted the money as an unreported political  donation.    Sagawa Kyubin was at the center of a 1992-1993 money-and-mob  scandal which involved now retired LDP power broker Shin  Kanemaru and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.</p>

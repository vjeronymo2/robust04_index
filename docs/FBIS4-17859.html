			<p>BFN     [Text] Vyacheslav Grunskiy has told us that, last night  Bosnian Muslims seized two Russian servicemen from the UN  peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia at checkpoint No. 6 of the  Russian battalion in Sarajevo, which is on the dividing line  between the conflicting sides. They are Private Potapov and  Sergeant Vlasov.    As the Bosnian side has breached the statutes on the  peacekeeping forces, the commander of the Russian UN forces in  Bosnia has sent a note of protest to the Bosnian military  leadership. At present the Russian servicemen are effectively  the prisoners of the Bosnian Muslims.</p>

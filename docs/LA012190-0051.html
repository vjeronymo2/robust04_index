			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> RESEARCHERS BRIGHTEN LIFE FOR WINTER BLUES SUFFERERS  </P> <P> Winter had held Peggy in its dark grip every year since she was 11. She  overslept, gorged on cookies and lost contact with friends. She couldn't  concentrate. In school, her grades dropped. On the job, her work suffered.  </P> <P> Then, quite literally, she saw the light. She has been doing fine ever since.  </P> <P> Peggy suffered extreme winter blues -- in medical terminology, seasonal  affective disorder (SAD). Milder cases are known as S-SAD, for subsyndromal  SAD.  </P> <P> One in five Americans has some of the symptoms, Norman E. Rosenthal, a  psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health in this Washington  suburb, learned a few years ago in a study of the relationship of geographical  latitudes and SAD.  </P> <P> The farther north people live, the likelier they are to experience winter  depression. In Sarasota, Fla., for example, the percentage afflicted was only  8.9. In Nashua, N.H., at the other extreme, it was 30.2.  </P> <P> Only in the last decade have Rosenthal and others been studying this pervasive  but neglected condition. They presume that in the absence of sunlight some  people develop abnormalities in certain brain chemicals, but they are still  seeking details on how this process works.  </P> <P> Their most important finding is what they see as a solution for most sufferers:  bright lights.  </P> <P> That is what cured Peggy, a native Midwesterner who later moved to New England.  Hers is one of the case histories cited in Rosenthal's recently published book,  "Seasons of the Mind: Why You Get the Winter Blues and What You Can Do About  It."  </P> <P> Rosenthal found that a few hours' daily exposure to a bank of fluorescent  lights will, over a short period of time, pull as many as eight out of 10 SAD  sufferers out of their depression.  </P> <P> Before the light treatment -- phototherapy -- was discovered, many  winter-depressed people thought they had a psychological problem.  </P> <P> "Recognition that they're suffering from an altered physiological state is a  great comfort," Rosenthal said. "And so, to some degree, is an acceptance that  you don't have to be quite as functional all year round, that you can have a  bit of a fallow season, and that's not the end of the world."  </P> <P> A light box costs about $400. Early models stood upright, and users sat in  front of them for as long as four hours a day. The fluorescent tubes emitted a  full spectrum of light.  </P> <P> Now researchers have learned that higher-intensity light boxes, installed on a  slanted frame, produce the same results in only half an hour a day. Elimination  of the ultraviolet spectrum reduces some negative side effects without  decreasing the light's effectiveness, Rosenthal says.  </P> <P> For winter-depression victims who don't have time for conventional light  treatment, a portable solution may be on the way.  </P> <P> Carla Hellekson, a Seattle psychiatrist, is working with Rosenthal and George  Brainerd, a Philadelphia neurophysicist, on a small, battery-powered light that  could be mounted at the front of a pith helmet, permitting wearers to go about  their normal routine.  </P> <P> No light treatment should be tried without a physician's guidance, Rosenthal  and others caution. Neil Owen, president of a Rockville, Md., company that  manufactures light boxes, says he always refers prospective customers to a  doctor before he sells them a box.  </P> <P> Among his customers is the U.S. State Department. Several boxes have been  ordered to test their effectiveness among embassy employees who get the blues  in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries that have long, dark  winters.  </P> <P> Above the 50th parallel north, SAD is "a pretty significant kind of problem,"  says T.C. Feir, a State Department physician in Vienna, Austria, who has  jurisdiction over some of the embassies. "We look at this (the lights) with  considerable interest."  </P> <P> But Feir, like some others, remains unconvinced of the effectiveness of light  treatment. "There are a lot of skeptics out there," he says. "I consider myself  a reasonable skeptic."  </P> <P> Winter depression has always been a problem in northern latitudes, but other  nations have lagged behind the United States in research on it.  </P></p>

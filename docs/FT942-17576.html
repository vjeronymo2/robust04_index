			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rises The dollar rose sharply in New York yesterday after the release of strong jobs data renewed speculation of a near term tightening in US monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith. The March non-farm payroll rose by 456,000, roughly double market expectations, and the largest such rise since a gain of 556,000 jobs in October 1987. The dollar rose more than two pfennigs on the news from DM1.6770 to DM1.6980, before slipping back below DM1.6950 in late morning trading. It was also higher against the yen trading above Y103.60. Volumes were very thin on account of the Easter break. Activity in foreign exchanges was otherwise very subdued with most markets closed for the long weekend. Although the initial view of the US jobs figures was that they supported an early tightening, a closer look suggested a more complicated picture. Mr Lacy Hunt, chief US economist at Midland Global Markets in New York, said the labour market was in fact weaker than the headline figure suggested. Citing the low rate of growth in hourly earnings, and the deflationary effect of jobs growth in low-paying service jobs, he suggested an early or dramatic move from the Fed was unnecessary. The D-Mark finished generally weaker in Europe on Thursday with evidence of position-squaring ahead of the Easter break. The largest move came from the Italian lira which rose on hopes that an Italian government might be formed sooner than expected. After closing on Thursday ten lira firmer in London at L963.3 against the D-Mark, the lira rose further yesterday to L959.75 after reports of a successful meeting between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the victorious Freedom Alliance leader, and his alliance partner,the Northern League. Elsewhere on Thursday, the Bank of France cut its intervention rate by ten basis points to 5.90 per cent - the second such cut in the week. The franc ended slightly firmer, at FFr3.414 to the D-Mark from FFr3.419 on Wednesday. The escudo ended firmer, at Es102.7 from Es103.2, after the Bank of Portugal lent support to the ailing currency by raising its emergency lending rate to 13 per cent from 11 per cent. German call money rates fell sharply on Thursday to 5.25/6.00 per cent, from 6.75 per cent on Wednesday as tight end-of-month conditions eased. In the futures market the June euromark contract firmed by three basis points to 94.55. The December contract rose nine basis points to 95.00. Sterling weakness persisted on Thursday with the UK currency finishing at DM2.4785 against the D-Mark from DM2.4829. It was slightly firmer against the dollar finishing at Dollars 1.4846, but lost a cent in thin trade yesterday to trade below Dollars 1.4750. There was better news in the futures market where bullish comments by the chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke about growth and inflation prospects revived hopes of an early cut in interest rates. The June short sterling future finished one basis point firmer at 94.53 while the December contract was seven basis points higher at 94.03. In the discount market the Bank of England moved quickly to remove a large Pounds 1.95bn shortage with two early rounds of assistance.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Germany 'on money supply tightrope': Dilemma for Bundesbank in fixing monetary target THE Bundesbank is 'walking a tightrope' between the need to curb money supply growth and pressure from Germany's European partners to avoid stifling an economic recovery, a senior Bundesbank official said at the weekend. Germany's money supply has ballooned by nearly 40 per cent in the past two years with the absorption of east Germany, putting the Bundesbank in a severe dilemma as its central council meets this week to review its monetary target for 1992. The central bank, headed by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, is aware that drastic action to curb growth in the money supply would upset its EC partners. But in the last resort it is likely to give priority to restoring Germany's domestic monetary stability. The senior official suggested that countries which thought they were suffering from Germany's monetary policies could take the initiative by seeking realignment within the European Monetary System. Pointing to the possibility of occasional currency changes in the EMS - where the last full-scale realignment was in January 1987 - the official said: 'We are not in a fixed exchange rate system yet.' Although he stopped short of calling outright for a re-alignment, he indicated that the Bundesbank believed market forces might eventually force weaker currencies towards a devaluation. The official did not mention EMS devaluation candidates by name. But he said the Bank of Italy had been intervening with 'considerable' amounts to defend the lira last week. The official warned that if other countries were worried about rising German inflation, the only way this could be combated would be through tight German interest rates. Bundesbank officials appear undecided about what the council should do at Thursday's meeting. Despite the half-point rise in official interest rates in December which lifted the Lombard rate to 9.75 per cent and the discount rate to 8 per cent, domestic monetary conditions have become more uncertain and less responsive to Bundesbank action. A further rise in the Lombard rate is unlikely because of the problems this would cause for other members of the European Monetary System, who want to reduce rates. The less important discount rate could be increased, however, or measures taken to limit banks' access to central bank funds. While the Bundesbank has virtually given up hope that this year's money supply target will be met, it hopes to create the conditions for slower growth in M3, the broad monetary aggregate, next year. M3 has risen at an annualised 9 per cent against a target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent. But the council is unlikely to alter the goal in the face of M3's expansion, much of it caused by bank credits to finance heavily subsidised investments in east Germany.

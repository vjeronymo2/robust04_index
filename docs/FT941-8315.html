			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Tough decisions lie ahead for Kuwaitis: Oil prices are weak and parliament is strong With oil prices near a five-year low, an unfamiliar sound is emanating from the Gulf states: the creak of tightening belts. Saudi Arabia began this year pledging to cut government spending by a fifth. Oman said it must trim its budget by 10 per cent. Qatar is cutting where it can. In recent weeks, Kuwait has joined in. Kuwait's finance minister, central bank governor and others have all signalled the need for big cuts in state spending. Each Gulf government faces a tough task, since either cutting spending or raising revenues through higher fees on state-provided services (income taxes in the Gulf are politically inconceivable) would mark the first time in recent history that these 'oil rich' kingdoms, emirates and sheikhdoms have had to face eroding the panoply of benefits each offers their nationals. Kuwait's task, however, is perhaps the stiffest since unlike its neighbours the government has an elected parliament to deal with. And it already appears that the opposition-dominated National Assembly is in no mood to fall easily in line with the government's austerity calls. Such calls have been issuing with increasing shrillness from Kuwaiti policymakers - a measure partly of the worsening outlook for state finances, but partly also of the government's appreciation that, for the first time in its experience, it must persuade a strong and recalcitrant parliament. Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister, has recently begun using such uncharacteristic Kuwaiti words as 'urgent reforms' and 'sacrifices'. The reason for such calls is plain enough. Kuwait had already budgeted for a KD1.2bn (Pounds 2.7bn) fiscal deficit for 1993-94 before oil prices weakened. In January, however, Mr al-Rodhan revealed that at the midpoint of Kuwait's June-July fiscal year, the state had already reached 67 per cent of the budgeted deficit. Worse, soft crude prices forced the government to revise its calculus for oil revenues - 89 per cent of state income - from 1.74m barrels per day of oil sold at an average Dollars 15 a barrel, to 2m barrels a day sold at Dollars 10.50 a barrel. This implies a big cut in revenues, though since the official budget includes neither defence spending nor investment income, it is impossible accurately to forecast the budgetary gap for 1993-94. However, senior officials say they expect Kuwait to manage this deficit from its own resources, partly through domestic treasury bill sales and partly from overseas investment income. Kuwait's overseas holdings were slashed from just under Dollars 100bn before the Gulf war to nearer Dollars 35bn today, in a fire-sale to finance the war's costs. But the remaining holdings earned a return of around 20 per cent in 1993, thanks largely to bullish world equity markets. 'Last year our assets grew at a rate more than enough to pay for the deficit,' says Mr Ali Rashid al-Badr, managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority. But problems lie ahead. Kuwait cannot rely on continued buoyancy in world equity markets any more than on a sharp recovery in crude prices. But state spending will rise in 1994-95 as Kuwait starts repaying principal on the Dollars 5.5bn syndicated loan taken out after the Gulf war, adding Dollars 2.7bn to annual outlays. Under such additional pressure, Kuwait apparently has little option but to cut spending elsewhere, or to raise revenues. Either would mean impinging on the high salaries, subsidised services and other comforts which put Kuwait among the most padded welfare states in the world. More than 95 per cent of employed Kuwaitis, for instance, work in the public sector. Salaries, accordingly, devour 52 per cent of government spending. Healthcare, power, petrol, water and telephone calls are so heavily subsidised as to be virtually free. But senior government figures believe this is unsustainable. Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, the central bank governor, says: 'Kuwaitis will have to suffer over the next two to three years - we have no choice.' The problem will be convincing Kuwait's National Assembly, which, through a combination of its own industriousness and the diminished authority of the ruling al-Sabah family since the Gulf war, has become the most powerful in the state's history. It has already passed laws mandating parliamentary scrutiny of some state investments, has investigated allegations of corruption and mismanagement in Kuwait's Spanish investments and is seeking further to expand its powers of veto and supervision. Government budget proposals will have to be approved by the National Assembly in spring. But talk of cuts and other radical solutions to Kuwait's economic straits is unlikely to win much sympathy. The government has begun to air such notions as privatisation and direct foreign investment, even in the country's strategic oil industry. But MPs see privatisation largely as a process likely to cost Kuwaitis jobs. Talk of even limited foreign investment in the banking sector was met earlier this month with instinctive cries of 'neocolonialism' among MPs. As for the need to cut spending, or raise state revenues, few MPs seem to consider this message has got across to most Kuwaitis, and fewer show much inclination to be associated with such unpopular decisions. 'There's not yet the feeling we must do anything, certainly not that we should make sacrifices,' says Mr Abdulla al-Nibari, an opposition MP. He also echoes a widely held view that a government associated with alleged fraud and mismanagement in the state's multi-billion-dollar investments would find itself on shaky ground if it tried to persuade Kuwaitis to cut their living standards. A tough and perhaps immobilising struggle between the government and the assembly is therefore in prospect. With this in sight, many leaders of Kuwaiti society, particularly senior members of Kuwait's main merchant families, have been lobbying the ruling family to shake up the system and pre-empt a debilitating political impasse. In private consultations with Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the prime minister and crown prince, they are understood to have expressed disappointment with his apparent inability to impose himself on either his cabinet colleagues or parliament itself. The next step in what promises to be an intricate ballet by Kuwait's cautious ruling family, its dogged parliament, anxious economic policymakers and some increasingly frustrated merchants may well be a cabinet shake-up. Kuwait newspapers quoted 'highly informed sources' earlier this month as saying the 16-member cabinet would be shuffled after the present holy month of Ramadan to enable some much needed 'quick decision-making'. All of this is bound to be persuading Kuwait's equally financially pressed neighbours that the last thing they need on top of cash flow problems is an elected parliament.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forecast cuts hit Aerospace A SPATE of sharp profits downgrades hit British Aerospace, sending the shares plunging after the company reported interim figures at the bottom end of market expectations. Profits came in at Pounds 20m, against a loss of Pounds 129m a year earlier, but researchers had anticipated profits around Pounds 28m and a slightly higher dividend payment. It was the higher than expected interest paid figures, together with continuing losses at the company's turbo prop operation, that really upset the market and led to the swingeing downgrades from most securities houses. Dealers rushed to sell the shares, which tumbled 31 to 389p at the day's worst before a small rally late in the session saw them close 26 down at 394p, after heavy trading of nearly 10m. Mr Chris Avery at Paribas Capital Markets reduced his full-year forecast by Pounds 70m to Pounds 50m, while Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman Brothers also arrived at the same figure after lowering his previous estimate by Pounds 45m. However, both remain positive. NatWest Securities also reduced its forecast by more than 50 per cent, going from Pounds 104m to Pounds 50m, but said it was maintaining its 'long term positive stance'. Ironically it was at the last set of interim figures that the share price of BAe was more than halved after the company said it was to make a second-half provision of Pounds 1bn.</p>

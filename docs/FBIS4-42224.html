			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party leader Rudolf </F> Scharping by Jean-Paul Picaper in Wittlich; date not given:  "Scharping: `We Want a European Germany'"]    [Text] Born in Rhineland-Palatinate, like Helmut  Kohl, Rudolf Scharping was elected minister-president of this  German land two years ago. In 1993, he became the leader of the  Socialist opposition. The tall and youthful 47-year-old SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader now hopes to become  chancellor after the 16 October parliamentary election.    [Picaper] After the presidential election last Monday [23  May] in Berlin, you said that the liberal party had discredited  itself by voting massively for Roman Herzog. Helmut Kohl called  you a "graceless loser...."    [Scharping] While the Federal Assembly, which elected the  president, was entitled to its decision, it did not take into  account the will of a majority of the population. The liberals  yielded to the chancellor's appetite for power. This is what I  criticized, but my criticisms were directed at the Christian  Democrats and their president, Helmut Kohl.    [Picaper] Do you nonetheless accept Roman Herzog as  president?    [Scharping] Of course; this was a democratic decision. Any  honest democrat will cooperate with the president.    [Picaper] You enjoyed a considerable lead over Helmut Kohl  in opinion polls. Today, he has caught up with you.    [Scharping] This does not worry me at all. While the gap  has been varying, the SPD remains in the lead. I am convinced  that we will win the European election of 12 June.    [Picaper] Helmut Kohl had to wait almost 10 years before he  became chancellor. Will you wait this long?    [Scharping] No. We intend to win the October 1994  parliamentary election. And the outlook is good.    [Picaper] Helmut Kohl had rivals in his own party, in  particular Franz Josef Strauss. Is Gerhard Schroeder a  potential rival for you?    [Scharping] We were both in the running for the position of  SPD leader. Gerhard Schroder is a good minister-president in  Lower Saxony, and we have no problem cooperating. Close  cooperation between SPD minister-presidents is essential.  Germany has 16 laender. We participate in the government in 11  of them, including nine in which we lead the government.  <H5>  Our NATO Commitments </H5>   [Picaper] Do you have the full support of SPD members?    [Scharping] I was elected party leader by referendum. More  than half of our 900,000 members actually voted. It was the  first time in the history of the party that such a procedure was  used. This demonstrates our commitment to letting citizens shape  political decisions, both within our party and throughout the  republic.    [Picaper] After the reunification, do you think that  Germany's political and economic system should have been  reassessed?    [Scharping] German reunification was both an opportunity and  a challenge. No one disputes Helmut Kohl's merits in achieving  German unity, and no one will forget the support of our Western  friends. However, since then, economically and socially, Germany  has unfortunately been steered in the wrong direction, a selfish  one, both by the government and the Bundesbank.    [Picaper] Over the past 10 years, there have been  differences within the Socialist International between French  Socialist Party (PSF) leaders and SPD representatives, among  other things with respect to European defense. What has become  of these differences?    [Scharping] All my visits to Paris proved to me that the  strength of our friendship always allows us to achieve a joint  position. It is essential that we promote growth and job  creation, research and technology. On these issues, there are  no disagreements between Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard  on the one hand, and Germany's Social Democrats on the other.    There indeed were a few differences between France and  Germany on foreign policy, including between the French  Socialists and Germany's Social Democrats. The Elysee Treaty is  over 30 years old. I consider that now is the time to make an  evaluation and to identify in an addendum both the issues we  agree on and future avenues for cooperation. Our friends and  partners must know that Germany and France work together ever  more closely on economic, monetary, and financial policy, but  also on social policy and, I hope, environmental matters. If the  Paris-Bonn axis thrives, Europe will make progress, and that is  our common responsibility, which we must take on with commitment  and passion.    [Picaper] A member of France's current government said that  Europe cannot be built together with the SPD, especially because  you refuse to take part in non-NATO military operations...    [Scharping] I think that Alain Lamassoure [French European  Affairs minister] was mistaken, at least with regard to  Germany's Social Democrats. In any case, we had a chat about  that shortly after his statement. I think one should not meddle  with internal debates going on in a friendly country. However,  one may voice one's opinion. Mr. Lamassoure is entitled to his  opinion, one among many others.    After I was elected SPD leader, I chose Paris for my first  visit abroad, although France can hardly be viewed as a foreign  country any more. This was because, in my opinion,  French-German cooperation and friendship are the key to European  progress. I spoke with many French politicians: [President]  Francois Mitterrand, [PS Secretary General] Michel Rocard, but  also [Paris Mayor] Jacques Chirac and [former President] Valery  Giscard d'Estaing. We have a strong common foundation for  working together. Whatever government is in power in France or  Germany, our relationship will remain good.  <H5>  Cooperation With France </H5>   [Picaper] And yet, you will not deny that there was and is a  neutralist and pacifist wing within the SPD....    [Scharping] Among the Social Democrats, among the Left,  there has always been a pacifist wing. However, that alone does  not make a state's foreign policy. The Constitutional Court  will soon issue a ruling on military operations beyond our  borders. My party has decided that it will honor our NATO and  UN commitments. We also approved German cooperation with France  within the WEU [Western European Union] and the Franco-German  Corps. We approve of it without reservation. We want a  European Germany, not a German- dominated Europe.    [Picaper] If you win the elections, you will have to enter  into a coalition with the pacifist Greens, since you will not  have an absolute majority.    [Scharping] No. Speaking of foreign policy, at their latest  conference, the Greens have passed resolutions that are as silly  as they are flawed, including winding up NATO and suppressing  the Bundeswehr. This is no way to go about shaping national  policy, and if that is the policy they want, the Greens will  find themselves isolated.    [Picaper] If you do not want to work with the Greens and  since you cannot get along with the liberals, all that will be  left for you to do will be to set up a large coalition with  Helmut Kohl's CDU [Christian Democratic Union].    [Scharping] This is a prospect I reject. The SPD will be  the dominant party and will find itself a partner. Until the  parliamentary election of 16 October, we shall strive to win  over as many voters as we can. And in the evening of that day,  the supply of partners will exceed demand. Market economics  tells us that the greater the supply, the lower the price and  the easier the negotiation.    [Picaper] In your debate with Helmut Kohl in the Bundestag  on Friday [27 May], you censured him for only talking about the  European Commission's white paper, but not implementing it.    [Scharping] The white paper contains very good suggestions,  which will remain attached to Jacques Delors' name, and I think  it is a shame that they are not reflected in the German  Government's policies. People start having doubts about a  European economic policy which made over 20 million people  jobless.  <H5>  Common Future </H5>   [Picaper] What will tomorrow's Europe be like: a large  free-trade zone with over 20 member states, or an integrated  Europe?    [Scharping] The enlargement of the European Union [EU] must  not be an obstacle to its integration. Some people say that  taking in Scandinavian countries and Austria will balance the  EU. There is no truth to this, as it presupposes that there  currently is some kind of imbalance. Truth is, Europe simply  needs to be complete, by integrating the Scandinavian countries,  Austria, and later the Central European countries.    Enlargement must not compromise institutional reform,  either.  Francois Mitterrand, too, believes that a "multispeed" Europe is  feasible. It is obvious that France, Germany, and Benelux will  meet stated objectives in the areas of monetary policy,  industrial productivity, or financial stability faster than,  say, by way of example, Greece, or later, Poland, the Czech  Republic, or Slovakia.    [Picaper] What will be Germany's future status within  Europe: a centrally located country open to all, or a country  anchored to the West?    [Scharping] There must never be any doubt anymore as to  Germany's integration with Western democracies. Germany is a  Western country. We neither want to be the center of all things  nor to revert to the old Axis policies. We are blessed with  peaceful relations with all of our neighbors. Germany must  never again be tempted into going it alone in Europe.    [Picaper] A few days ago, skinheads and neo-Nazis committed  racist attacks in Magdeburg.    [Scharping] The underlying causes of this phenomenon are  poor education as well as a lack of vocational training and  facilities affording them the opportunity to do something  meaningful with their leisure time. Add to this a growing sense  of despair. So we must invest in education and free time, not  only to thwart the progress of extremism, but also to secure our  common future.    [Picaper] You have likened yourself to Bill Clinton. Do you  think your fortunes will be similar?    [Scharping] I believe that pressure for change in Germany  has been growing. People want government policies to change.  While Bill Clinton and Rudolf Scharping are different animals,  they belong to the same generation. This can be an asset.</p>

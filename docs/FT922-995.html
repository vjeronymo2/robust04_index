			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Asia-Pacific states agree to formalise trade links FIFTEEN nations have agreed on the first steps to turn their Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) group into a permanent institution, writes Peter Ungphakorn in Bangkok. At a three-day meeting that ended in Bangkok yesterday they agreed to set up a small secretariat, initially headed by an official seconded from one of the member governments. 'This really represents a new stage in Apec's development. Whereas before it was a dialogue organisation, now it will be an institution,' said Mr Ted Delofski, head of the Australian delegation. Since its creation almost three years ago, Apec's main achievements have been to hold annual meetings of its trade and foreign ministers and to devise 10 programmes for co-operation in subjects ranging from fisheries to lowering trade barriers. Some members, most notably Australia and New Zealand, barely disguise the fact that they see Apec as an insurance policy in case the world breaks up into warring trade blocs. The 13 other members are: the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.</p>

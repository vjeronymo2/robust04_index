			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (5): A token of love, a sign of trouble - Lucia van der Post takes a close look at diamonds Since time began, the point of jewellery has been swank and status. After all, who really needs a bit of carbon, even if it is absolutely pure and extraordinarily old? I know . . . it is often quite exquisitely made and sometimes the skill and craft is so dazzling that only a museum exhibition all its own will do it justice. But the art is never the real point. It is almost never the chief impulse behind the making and the buying. Now you might have thought that during the recession, few would have had much inclination, let alone the cash, to indulge in things so fundamentally unnecessary. You would be wrong. Over at de Beers they are quietly pleased. The last 18 months have been good to diamonds. There have been a few awkward moments when supply vastly outstripped demand and the dreaded quota system (which restricts the number of diamonds that de Beers' Central Selling Organisation agrees to buy from suppliers) had to be brought into play. But recently the performance of diamonds at auction has outperformed all the financial indices (let alone sales of Impressionists and Old Masters) by a wide margin. At auction, prices in the flawless D stone category have moved from Pounds 28,500 per carat to about Pounds 42,900 a carat. Laurence Graff, who deals almost exclusively in the largest, flawless, most rare, stones (which means that his customers are almost exclusively foreign) has recently bought back for Dollars 350,000 (Pounds 240,000) a five-carat blue diamond that he sold 15 years earlier for Dollars 60,000 a carat. Last November, in a Sotheby's Geneva sale, a flawless rectangular cut diamond of 100.36 carats earned the soubriquet of the most expensive jewel ever sold, when an anonymous buyer parted with Pounds 8,028,603 to own it. All this leads experienced watchers to conclude (as if we did not know it) that we live in turbulent times. Sales of stones are far more closely linked to the needs of the rich to have their wealth in a tiny, portable, instantly-accessible form, than it is to the mysterious movements of the romantic heart. Buyers of these huge investment pieces are supplied mainly by three areas - Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan and Italy  -all of which have problems of a sort and many of whose inhabitants would like, if they could, to be able to move themselves and their wealth about at the drop of an invasion or an unsympathetic bit of legislation. These are the buyers who keep up the prices for the purest, finest, biggest gems. As always the motto is that if it is investment and resale value you are want, invest in the best you can afford. We have only to think of the Romanoffs, the German jews, the Emir of Kuwait (who packed much of his considerable wealth into a rucksack), to realise that exile with millions in one's overnight case is an infinitely more agreeable prospect than exile with all one's assets left behind. But while these sort of purchases fuel the headlines and provide a background of glamour and intrigue, it is the humbler buyers of more day-to-day jewellery who keep the jewellers in lunches. All through the recession the business of living has gone on - deals may have been thin on the ground but troths have been pledged, anniversaries celebrated, babies ushered into the world and important milestones reached. Jewels to celebrate these events provide the bread and butter of the jewellers' business. So even in 1992 (the last year for which figures are available), when the recession had barely begun to recede, 55m different diamond pieces, worth an average of just under Dollars 750, were bought worldwide. Take engagement rings - so strong is the custom that in the English-speaking western world more than 70 brides in every 100 are given a diamond engagement ring. Standards of design have risen enormously - it is fashionable these days to bash big corporations but it is hard to over-estimate the influence that de Beers' annual international awards have had on diamond jewellery worldwide. This year's collection of award-winners displays an astonishing range of different techniques, styles and settings. For technique, take the flexible bangle designed by Jennifer Bloy and made by Matthew Cambery which is the winner of the UK section; for styles, compare the romantic, almost old-fashioned diamond and platinum brooch designed by Yuko Nakajima of Japan with the chunky necklace of white gold and apophylite crystal and diamonds designed by Jul B Dizon of the Philippines. Nobody, after looking at the dazzling collection (which they will be able to do at Christie's, 8 King Street, London SW1 from May 5-13) could possibly think that the diamond business is moribund. But jewellers report that while buyers are still there (and indeed never went away) these days they are infinitely more knowledgeable and twice as cautious. At Asprey of Bond Street, for instance, a boutique collection was launched for the first time. A boutique collection is a fancy name for a lower-priced range which its devisers hope will attract not just the eye of a love-lorn suitor but also the hard-earned cash of the successful career girl who buys for herself. The Sunflower collection has been a huge success - partly, it seems, because there are pieces, such as a pair of ear-rings, that cost as little as Pounds 350, and partly due to the interest generated by offering a large new, accessibly-priced range of designs. Jewellers everywhere report that although the business is there, they have to work harder to get it, that people are more selective and have to be persuaded that they are buying real value. However small the purchase, customers like to know that it is a real carat or proper gold. At Boodle &amp; Dunthorpe, a jewellery chain that started with shops in Liverpool and Manchester and now has two London stores (one in Knightsbridge and one in Bond Street) they generate interest with exhibitions, with designer promotions and by taking care to offer pieces that, however inexpensive, have something of quality about them. Tastes have changed - there seems a greater fondness for the more discreet look of platinum, for burnished rather than yellow gold, for simpler pieces that can be worn through the day as well as by night. Stores such as Tiffany, which always have wearable pieces that career girls can buy for themselves and wear from the school-round in the morning, through the boardroom meeting and on to the opera or to dinner, have done steady business all through the recession. A small, but important, sub-market has risen around the popularity of body-piercing with the international young, and diamond studs continue to be among the most popular of jewellery buys. As always, whether it be restaurants or holidays, cosmetics or jewels, the message seems to be - offer value for money, work hard and listen carefully to the customer, and even in the direst of times, there is business to be done.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIA SEES CHINA FACING RENEWED UNREST;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE AUSTERITY CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED IN 1988 TO STEM INFLATION HAS ANGERED  WORKERS AND WORSENED UNEMPLOYMENT, THE U.S. REPORT SAYS.  </P> <P> The CIA, in a strikingly gloomy portrait of the situation in China, said  Thursday that the world's most populous country faces the prospect of renewed  social unrest because of angry workers and mounting unemployment.  </P> <P> In its annual report to Congress on the Chinese economy, the CIA said that  chances for a quick return to the market-oriented reforms of the 1980s are  "dim" and that the country's social stability is "tenuous." Unemployment in  China is now at its highest level in a decade and urban living standards are  declining, it said.  </P> <P> The CIA report directly contradicts the repeated public claims of the Chinese  regime that the reforms continue and that the political climate there is calm.  On Monday, the day China allowed renowned dissident Fang Lizhi to leave the  country, Premier Li Peng spoke glowingly of what he called the "growing  political and economic stability in China."  </P> <P> The U.S. intelligence report, however, suggests that if there is new disorder  in China, it may come not from the Chinese students and intellectuals who  spearheaded last year's pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men  Square, but rather from masses of disgruntled workers and jobless migrants.  </P> <P> "According to many accounts, layoffs have created an embittered and volatile  class of unemployed," the CIA asserted in a section entitled "Economic Problems  Threaten Social Stability."  </P> <P> ". . . The growing number of unemployed and underemployed poses a social  problem, whether they return to the countryside or stay in the cities. In  addition to disturbances in the workplace, the growing pool of idle workers has  produced a rise in the level of crime nationwide."  </P> <P> According to the CIA, China is being forced to devote increasing resources to  the job of maintaining order.  </P> <P> For example, the intelligence agency explained, although the regime is  increasing defense spending by more than 15% this year, "a significant portion  of the increase . . . will go to purchasing new equipment, such as riot-control  gear for military rapid-reaction units, and repaying the operational costs  incurred by the military in enforcing martial law in Beijing and Lhasa during  1989."  </P> <P> China's economic problems stem from an austerity campaign launched by the  regime in the fall of 1988. In an effort to reduce inflation, the leadership in  Beijing clamped down on bank credit, cut back on investment projects, reimposed  some price controls and brought to a halt the efforts to let prices be  determined by market forces.  </P> <P> The CIA said that China's drive succeeded in slowing down inflation, which  dropped from annual rates of nearly 30% in late 1988 to less than 5% early this  year. But the intelligence agency said that the austerity program was so  restrictive that it "caused China's worst economic slump in a decade."  </P> <P> "Workers are disgruntled, because they believe they are bearing the brunt of  Beijing's austerity measures; many are receiving only about 70% of their  expected wages and no bonuses, which have traditionally accounted for about  one-third of workers' incomes," the CIA declared.  </P> <P> ". . . Some workers have complained that the current belt-tightening is the  worst they have experienced since the early 1960s, when China was recovering  from the disastrous Great Leap Forward."  </P> <P> The CIA contended that China's austerity program has treated only the symptoms  of China's economic instability, rather than the underlying cause -- the fact  that the reform program launched a decade ago under the leadership of Deng  Xiaoping was stopped halfway before it achieved the efficiencies of a market  economy.  </P> <P> Over the last few years, the CIA said, a number of economic reforms have been  either frozen or "abandoned," including proposed changes in China's pricing  system, banking, bankruptcy and foreign trade policies.  </P> <P> "Political support for reform has been weakened by leadership squabbling and  the removal of two reform-minded party general secretaries in the past three  years," said the intelligence agency. It was referring to the Chinese Communist  Party's ouster of party secretary Hu Yaobang in 1987 and of his successor, Zhao  Ziyang, after the upheavals in Beijing last year.  </P> <P> "While it is unlikely that many senior officials want to return to the command  economy and isolationist policies that dominated China before 1979, there are  those in the leadership who want to place strict limits on the non-state sector  and to increase the party's role in enterprise management."  </P> <P> During a hearing on the CIA report Thursday by the congressional Joint Economic  Committee, one scholar, Nicholas R. Lardy of the University of Washington,  disputed the agency's contention that China's economic reforms are being  abandoned. Although China is now in a serious economic slump, Lardy said,  "there has been very little evidence of a wholesale retreat from the reform  measures adopted a decade ago."  </P> <P> Another scholar, Harvard University Prof. Dwight H. Perkins, argued that for  the moment, China is so paralyzed that it has no economic policy.  </P> <P> "Those making economic policy are waiting for the fundamental questions of who  will rule to be resolved," Perkins said. "And those currently ruling are  reluctant to move for fear of a popular reaction that would undermine their  ability to rule."  </P></p>

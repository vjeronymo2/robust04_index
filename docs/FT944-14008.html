			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Abacus Abacus, the electronic components distributor, has acquired a 75 per cent stake in Promax, which distributes Philips' products in Denmark and Sweden. The purchase price is DKr23.6m (Pounds 2.5m), satisfied by the proceeds of a placing of 1.58m new ordinary shares at 158p. In the event that not all the shares are placed, the shortfall will be paid in cash. In addition, a further 1.39m new shares have been conditionally placed at 158p to raise about Pounds 2.1m net of expenses to provide additional working capital for Promax. Of the extra money raised, some Pounds 700,000 will be used to acquire the freehold premises in Jutland which the company occupies. Promax made pre-tax profits of DKr5.5m on turnover of DKr151m in 1993, and in the six months to June 30 achieved a profit of DKr3.9m on turnover of DKr86.8m. Net assets at that date amounted to some DKr8.6m.</p>

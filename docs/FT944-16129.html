			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Carolco's future in doubt as merger fails The future of the independent Hollywood studio Carolco Pictures remained in doubt last night after the company abandoned its merger with the video and music retailer Live Entertainment. The collapse of the stock-swap merger, which comes just a week after Carolco warned that severe liquidity problems threatened to force the studio's closure, was prompted by the recent sharp decline in the value of both companies' shares. Since March 24, when the Dollars 15m merger was officially announced, Live's share price has plummeted 50 per cent to Dollars 1 3/8 and Carolco's 61 per cent to Dollars  7/32 . They fell so far that trading in the two stocks was suspended by the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday because they no longer met the exchange's minimum listing requirements. Live said yesterday that it was seeking to list its stock on the Nasdaq market. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Live shareholders were to receive 5.5 Carolco shares for every one Live share. At the time, a 'collar' was built into the deal that was intended to keep the total value of the transaction within certain limits if either company's share price fluctuated wildly before the merger was completed. The collar, however, failed when the value of the two stocks plunged in the intervening months amid spiralling financial problems at both companies. Of the two, Carolco's situation is the more desperate, and some industry analysts believe the studio may be forced into bankruptcy soon. Carolco is currently trying to salvage production on its Dollars 75m action-adventure pirate film Cut-throat Island by selling its only other film in production, Showgirls, to the MGM studio, and negotiating fresh funding from its three foreign shareholders, Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of Italy and Canal Plus of France.</p>

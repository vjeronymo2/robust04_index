			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Save the saver with a single tax break - Serious Money Private investors need no reminding at the moment of the complexities of the personal tax system. They need to check the new tax codings sent out by the Inland Revenue for 1994/95 to see that they are correct (see page VII) and they now have only a little over a month before the end of the tax year on April 5 to implement tax planning measures. The choice includes any number of tax-efficient savings and investment schemes, some small, like a tax-exempt special savings account, which will pay income gross on a maximum investment of Pounds 9,000 over five years, and some potentially large, like personal equity plans. These offer relief from income and capital gains on an investment of up to Pounds 9,000 a year, which can be split between two main types of plan - a general and a single company plan. The choice does not end there if your spare cash is limited. Should you instead increase contributions to your personal pension, subject to the limits, or should you take out an additional voluntary contribution if you are an employee in an occupational scheme? Deciding which is best depends not only on your personal circumstances; you are likely also to be influenced by the different tax system under which these investments operate. Pension contributions are the most tax-efficient since they are grossed up and invested in a tax-free fund, which is not the case with money put into a Tessa or Pep. Private investors also have to remember when to make their investment for maximum tax-efficiency. The financial year is not the same as the calendar year; a Pep year used to be a calendar year but is now a financial year while a Tessa year is neither and corresponds instead to the anniversary of the initial investment. How can we find our way out of this savings mess? Instead of simplifying matters Kenneth Clarke's budget last November if anything has made things worse, as our growing Q&amp;A briefcase postbag testifies. The abolition of CGT indexation, for example, to create or increase losses has been met with bemusement by some readers and incredulity by others. The Institute for Fiscal Studies this week urged reform of the taxation of savings, arguing that the current regime satisfies none of the requirements for 'neutrality, fairness and transparency.'* While arguments about how the tax system might be simplified are endless, one of the Institute's recommendations, that Peps and Tessa should be swept up into a single tax free plan, has merit. After all, if savers are being given tax breaks of a similar nature, why not give an allowance for tax-free savings and leave it up to the individual to decide which investments to use it for? The IFS suggests that savings could be invested in a range of financial assets, from shares and securities to futures and options in the new extended plan, which it names Expep. No tax relief would be given for amounts put in the Expep but income and capital gains would be tax-free and (unlike a Tessa), withdrawals could be made at any time. It suggests setting the annual limit at Pounds 12,000 to be roughly in line with an amalgamation of the current Pep and Tessa annual allowances. Part of the attraction of a tax-free allowance idea is that attempts by the government to channel private investors' money into areas it wishes to develop have not been too successful. Tessas were meant to encourage small savers but anecdotal evidence suggests that little of the Tessa money has been new; instead, those with building society savings have simply transferred them into a Tessa to make use of the tax break. The Business Expansion Scheme, which was abolished at the end of December, was meant to encourage investment in growing businesses but it only became successful after the government allowed it to be used to increase the supply of private rented accommodation. Sponsors developed loan-back schemes so lucrative that they were banned overnight by Norman Lamont in his March 1993 budget. Some BES schemes still remain controversial. Investors in Johnson Fry's Mortgage Express Super Growth BES (which is not a loan-back scheme) are awaiting the outcome of a dispute between the company and the Inland Revenue over the timing of tax relief, which will affect the level of returns to investors. Enterprise Zone Trusts, potentially the largest tax break of all, received a blow this week when the House of Lords rejected an appeal by Matrix Securities, investment advisers, against the Inland Revenue for refusing to grant clearance to its docklands scheme. In this case, investors' cheques have already been returned but some investors in the BES and EZT have been attracted by the size of the tax breaks and have not fully appreciated the risks. There is certainly an argument then, for protecting investors by consolidating tax breaks into one allowance, since these elaborate schemes often seem to benefit City promoters more than investors. That would also have the virtue of simplifying the personal savings tax system. *Setting Savings Free, a summary of the Final Report of the IFS Capital Taxes Group, IFS, 7 Ridgemount Street, London WC1E 7AE, Pounds 10.</p>

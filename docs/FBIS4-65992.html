			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 25 (AFP) -- President Francois Mitterrand  on Wednesday [25 May] insisted he was opposed to any lifting of  an arms embargo on ex-Yugoslavia, as pressure groups lobbied in  France for an end to the ban voted by the UN Security Council.    Mitterrand, who spoke at a cabinet meeting, warned that  allowing arms deliveries could trigger an escalation of the  Bosnian conflict that could "go well beyond the Balkans," his  spokesman Jean Musitelli said.    The French president, whose country Wednesday hosted peace  talks by an international contact group and the belligerents in  the Bosnian war, also said the "sole alternative to negotiation  is war."    Mitterrand's own Socialist ally, Michel Rocard, who heads  the  French Socialist Party and the Socialist list for the June 12  European elections, has publicly differed with the president,  speaking out in favor of lifting the embargo.    A group of French intellectuals has also threatened to  present their own list at the European elections if the  mainstream lists do not call for allowing arms deliveries to  Bosnian Moslem government troops.    Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic met with Rocard and  other  officials in Paris Monday to plead this cause.    Rocard, a presidential hopeful, Wednesday urged that  "negotiations still be given a chance." But he said "elementary  morality would imply that at least if we cannot protect the  Bosnians, we let them protect themselves."    The talks with the international contact group on  Bosnia-Herzegovina took place Wednesday in Talloires, a town in  the French Alps just across the border from Geneva.    The meeting aimed to reach an agreement on the future  carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside a general four-month  ceasefire, as a prelude to a permanent peace.    Earlier Wednesday, Defense Minister Francois Leotard  confirmed that the French military contingent in former  Yugoslavia would be dropped by 2,500 men by the end of the year.    France, which forms the backbone of the UN force in  ex-Yugoslavia, now has 6,800 troops there.    By the end of 1994, "we are going to drop the volume of our  forces in Bosnia and we are going to regroup them around  Sarajevo," Leotard said on French radio.    France, and later Britain, have both warned they would pull  their forces out of Bosnia if there is no breakthrough in the  peace process. Britain has about 3,000 troops in former  Yugoslavia.</p>

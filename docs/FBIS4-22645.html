			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Yurkov: "A Commentary in This </F> Connection"]    [Text] There is no need to introduce the Boguchansk GES to  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers--this is the second year the newspaper  has followed the progress of this Siberian construction project,  and it tells readers regularly about how Siberian residents are  faring.    Yuriy Sakharnov, the general director of BoguchanGESstroy, a  friend of the newspaper and a writer for it, has traveled over  half the world in search of loans: under the omnipotent duo in  the former Russian Government--Ye. Gaydar and B.  Fedorov--financing of the country's only power generation  project of this size practically came to an end. We should have  had the courage, persistence, and wisdom of the builder-patriot,  who has new power generation construction projects in Uzbekistan  and Siberia--in "that" life they were called All-Union shock  projects--behind him; we should not despair, give up our life as  a hopeless task and sell our professional talent to the nouveaux  riches who are rapidly surrounding the capital with a "belt of  millionaires"--cottages and villas. In our opinion, these are  palaces and country estates for the wealthy, who have become  rich by completely doing away with social protection for the  people.    Sakharnov found understanding in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. The  newspaper reported on the situation at the construction site, it  told about the collective which did not receive wages for months  but did not abandon the work that was begun, and it told about  the monetarist ministers who wanted to force Russia to live from  day to day--to abandon the mines, the plants, the factories, and  the construction sites... Then Arkadiy Volskiy and the entire  Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs heard Sakharnov.  Sensible heads also were found in the Russian Federation  Government, and they understood and realized that Russia has  been and continues to be held together by the might of three  complexes--the military-industrial, fuel and energy, and  machinebuilding complexes. One of them--the machinebuilding  complex--has been lost, we believe. Since it is already being  shifted, the VPK [military-industrial complex] has been  castrated. And it is a fact that Russia is now living by the  grace of the fuel and energy complex, obtaining not only energy  resources, but foreign exchange from it as well. And Viktor  Chernomyrdin is being openly defamed for his traditional  sympathy for this, by the way.    After becoming familiar with BoguchanGESstroy operations at  the site, Vice Premier A. Shokhin came to the unequivocal  conclusion thast construction of the power station cannot be  discontinued if we have a responsible attitude toward  maintaining and building up the country's power generation  potential. Yu. Safranik, the minister in charge of the fuel and  energy complex, held a similar position.    It would appear that everyone is for it, but who is opposed  to it? But month after month went by, and the prepared and  approved drafts were not turned into actual documents. The  all-powerful bureaucratic guarantee impeded execution of the  directives from higher authorities and political intrigues  overcame the common sense and economic strategy of the complex.  The first vice premier should have had the character of Oleg  Soskovets so as not to allow the document to be lost in the  stratagems of intrigues and irresponsibility and to give hope  not simply to the many thousands in the labor collective  building the power station, but the entire energy complex; even  during an economic emergency, the country cannot help but work  toward tomorrow. For the loss of prospects means the loss of a  future.    In a recent meeting at the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA editorial  office, Yu. Sakharnov was sitting at the same table with  Vladislav Fronin, the chief editor of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, who  had gotten his start in it as a literary staffer in the working  youth department. Speaking in a humorous vein, he said it would  be good to declare the Boguchansk GES an All-Union Komsomol  shock project, then all the problems would be resolved. Well,  that is bad luck--there is no more All-Union. Or Komsomol,  either.    Unfortunately, many things that we are grieving about  do not exist now. In seizing life from payday to payday, we have  borrowed life. But after all, sooner or later the debt must be  paid. Reproduction of our national heritage cannot be replaced  by clearance sales. You cannot compensate for professional  experience in building hydroelectric stations with the resources  of a huge country by ultraradical incantations. In the final  analysis, we are not stupid enough to reject what the entire  enlightened world envied us, the Soviet people, for.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA had already been criticized in this  connection by sinister democratic newspapers when it began  saying in the spring of 1992 that former fraternal republics in  the former Soviet Union should not erect customhouses and cordon  off their borders, but restore the ties that were broken, and  reinforce, not destroy (!) the unified "fields"--the  information, market, legal, financial, and other fields. And the  ties of relationship should not be forgotten in the process. Not  of leaders with leaders, but between our brides and "their"  grooms. And vice versa. In short, we should not be scattering  now, but running together.    In an interview with RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA at that time,  Nursultan Nazarbayev first advanced the idea which is reflected  today in the formula for a Eurasian Union.    So the idea advanced at the RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA table by  Vladislav Fronin and seized upon by Yuriy Sakharnov, the builder  of All-Union shock projects, impelled us to relive the past--to  organize peripheral public supervision of the government's  decree on the Boguchansk GES. It produced a satisfactory effect  at one time. Is it suitable under the current conditions? Will  it help the labor collective of hydroelectric station builders?    Yuriy Sakhanov is confident that it will help.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, as a partner of long standing with  Krasnoyarsk residents, is taking implementation of this  government decree under public supervision. The newspaper will  be informing the Russian public regularly how the construction  is progressing, who is helping the Boguchan workers and how, who  is impeding fulfillment of orders for construction of the  Russian state's power generation facility, and how and why they  are doing it. We will be naming those who contribute to the  increase in power generation potential in Siberia and the  country, and we will also name those who put spokes in the  wheels of the Angara construction project.    So a start has been made. Everyone who has helped to bring  about this decree through the responsibility of his service or  simply through his duty as a citizen cannot be enumerated. But  certain persons "behind the scenes" should be mentioned:    A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs [RSPP], and his new deputy, RSPP  Vice-President B. Kurakin; A. Dyakov, president of the RAO  [Russian Joint-Stock Company] "YeES Rossii"; V. Zyryakov,  assistant to the first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation  Council of Ministers and Government; Yu. Mikhaylov, a government  adviser; V. Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray; and Yu. Korsun,  the deputy minister of fuel and energy. Of course, in first  place we ought to name all the builders of the Boguchansk GES,  as well as those who did not believe that the specialty of  destroyer is valued more highly in Russia than a builder. Most  likely not only this truth, but economic feasibility and  political realism, have helped all those participating in this  to join hands and form a circle of civil and patriotic harmony  to rescue the work essential to everyone.    It is possible that some may be irritated by lines in  my commentary: they may say the chief editor is singing like a  nightingale, but where is the spring? Listing the names of  lobbyists for a new Siberian construction project, for what  purpose?    Why, in fact?    I honestly admit--without any purpose or malicious  intent. It is simply pleasant to realize that there are persons  in Russia who fight to the bitter end to prevent what we have  built with our hands, the work of our life, from being  destroyed. And it is pleasant to help them. If only in  words.    And this is why I listed the names--there is a clear  discrepancy here. Judge for yourselves. We journalists try for  weeks and months to "extract" the surnames of those involved in  bad dealings. And the more such names we have to our credit, the  better our statement of service, it is believed. Perhaps it is  better... It is as if we have forgotten how to say a kind word,  as if it has fallen into disuse in our vocabulary and become  unnecessary in our contacts with the public.    This is not true--it is more necessary today than under  communism.    My words are not an indulgence for the remission of sins.  Tomorrow we may present claims against O. Soskovets and V.  Kurakin, and I hope they will understand this is how RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA operates.    Today, I hope they will understand this: we want the Russian  people to turn to them when there are promising operations--they  will help. Tell me, what is bad about this? If there are  persons at all levels in Russia that can be depended upon today.    There is no more powerful means of strengthening authority,  especially democratic authority, than the economic might of the  state and social protection for its citizens. And any  government, if it wants to be democratic and strong, will not  give preference to destructive instead of constructive trends.  It is awkward even to say this--it is a common truth for all  times and peoples.    We remain to be convinced by a specific example: whether our  executive authority is strong enough to realize a creative  project. And there is no need to smile at a certain degree of  extra passion in my commentary--yes, one swallow dos not make a  spring. Especially as the decree is still not the GES.    This is the situation. And we are making a fuss because of  this.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Food: Financial discipline comes first on the menu - The basic rights and wrongs of restaurant trade costings less concerned with Budget secrets, perhaps, but invaluable for the latest culinary fashion and the preoccupations of restaurateurs and chefs. This year, the talk is about bills and how to keep them small. On the menu, cod has replaced sea-bass, oxtail is the rage and lentils are here to stay. But what do chefs know about setting reasonable prices and, more importantly, keeping them reasonable? It was time to consult Mr J. During the 1980s Mr J played financial counsellor to more than 10 London restaurants, carving his own special niche in the market. His duties ranged from recording takings to credit control; making out the monthly cheques and wages; petty cash analysis; producing weekly food costs; fortnightly beverage stock-takes, and producing monthly management accounts. He was absolutely scrupulous; his only weaknesses were indecipherable handwriting and a hatred for computers. In a profession where there is little time for discussion, he produced reliable figures no-one could argue with - not even the chef. Mr J began our last meeting in his own restaurant where, finally, he has been able to practice what he has long preached. Any successful restaurant needs three ingredients: a talented chef, a welcoming front-of-house and an attentive bookkeeper. With two of the three you might just survive, but not with fewer, and Mr J. cited two examples. First, a partnership of two talented chefs who failed to understand either their customers or their books, and the restaurant went into receivership. Second, a busy London restaurant with a weekly turnover of Pounds 15,000. It had not achieved its correct food margin in three years, in spite of excellent reviews, and had fired its executive chef. Then to specifics. Of a restaurant's total income, food and beverage costs should be no more than 40 per cent. This leaves a 60 per cent gross margin of which 25 per cent of the total income should be the budget for wages, a further 25 per cent for all other expenses, allowing a gross profit margin of 10 per cent. As VAT and Inland Revenue inspectors have clamped down on casual labour, and rising rent and rates have pushed up overheads, obtaining the right food cost has become crucial. Yet Mr J finds this is the discipline which chefs most lack. Their answer, when food margins are not achieved, is to raise menu prices. Restaurant-lovers know this is self-defeating: we go less often. The solution is more fundamental. Any menu, Mr J argues, must begin with a breakdown of all its ingredients and a costing of each dish. If a 40 per cent food cost is the goal, then a dish that will appear on the menu at Pounds 10 must cost no more than Pounds 3 to take account of VAT. Electronic cash tills and computers have made the arithmetic easier. But what does Mr J advise for any chef keen to keep his prices low and his customers happy? He has installed a weekly regime throughout London. He begins by calculating the food takings separately from the beverage income and then adding up the cost of all the food delivered, making sure that the chef does not try to hide even the smallest invoice. This gives an accurate indication of how the restaurant is faring within 24 hours of the end of a week's trading. When the figures are not what they should be the chef will always have an excuse and Mr J believes he has heard them all. A consignment of expensive fish had just arrived; a parcel of 'cheap' truffles that were just too good to miss; or a quiet Saturday night because of the Cup Final. Mr J dismisses them all. He has other explanations. First, that the menu costings are incorrect. They must be investigated not with the intention of raising the prices but by working back from acceptable menu prices - what the customer will pay - to sustainable costs. There is also the possibility of loss or theft - a fillet of beef going astray, deliveries which fall constantly short but which the kitchen does not bother to re-weigh, or a chef in cahoots with an unscrupulous supplier. Most often, the answer lies under the chef's very eyes. What is being left on the customer's plate or going straight into the pig bin? Minimising wastage has always been an essential quality in a talented chef, but today nobody congratulates a chef for a meal we can only half-eat. We prefer half a bill instead. In the 1970s chefs learnt nouvelle cuisine; in the 1980s how to write cookbooks and appear on TV; in the 1990s, according to Mr J, they must learn how to cost and price menus sensibly.</p>

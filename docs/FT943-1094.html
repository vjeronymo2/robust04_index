			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Profitability in view after bumpy ride - Fiat On Thursday, Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector industrial group, will publish its half-year results, providing the first concrete indications of how it is working towards the objective of full-year profits outlined by Mr Gianni Agnelli, group chairman, at the shareholder meeting in June. Last year, the group revealed a L966bn (Pounds 393.5m) loss for the first half - which became a record L1,783bn (Pounds 726.2m) loss in the full year  -and a complex cash-raising plan worth a total of L5,000bn. The group's shares fell sharply afterwards. This year's half-year announcement should be less dramatic. Analysts are more or less in agreement that the group will show a small pre-tax profit for the first half. Fiat cars - which include the Alfa Romeo and Lancia brands - have managed to increase their market share in Italy, with the help of a competitive exchange rate which has deterred buyers of rival foreign marques, in particular Japanese. Exports should also show strong growth, for the same reasons, with the Fiat Punto, launched last year, leading the recovery. The prospect of good results is already in the Fiat share price, according to analysts, and investors may be more concerned next week by the Italian government's efforts to push through a 1995 budget.</p>

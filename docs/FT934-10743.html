			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Abrasive Giuliani takes on volatile New York: Martin Dickson on the city's new mayor NEW Yorkers have elected a white former prosecutor who talks tough on crime as their first Republican mayor in a generation in the hope that he can improve what many perceive to be a declining quality of life in America's largest city. But Mr Rudolph Giuliani, who defeated Mr David Dinkins, the black, one-term Democratic mayor in Tuesday's election, will face formidable hurdles - political, economic and fiscal - in pursuit of his pledge to put a shine back on the Big Apple. Mr Giuliani, the 49-year-old son of a bar owner in the borough of Brooklyn, won 51 per cent of the vote to Mr Dinkins' 48 per cent, reversing the outcome of the previous election in 1989, when Mr Dinkins won by a mere 2 per cent. The voting pattern was very similar to 1989, with Mr Giuliani picking up some 75 per cent of whites (who made up about half the voters), Mr Dinkins taking virtually all the blacks (about 28 per cent of voters) and gaining around two-thirds of the Hispanic vote (around 13 per cent of voters). The crucial difference from 1989 appears to have been the defection to Mr Giuliani of enough educated white voters and Hispanics to give the Republican candidate the edge. And those voters were particularly concerned about the quality-of-life issue. New York is slowly emerging from a four-year recession which has wiped out nearly 400,000 jobs, it has a high (though recently falling) crime rate, and its constant struggle to balance its budget in recent years has left it with a rotting infrastructure. Race relations are always liable to sudden flare-ups, though they are less tense than in many other American cities, thanks to the heterogeneous nature of New York's population. Mr Giuliani, the first Republican mayor since Mr John Lindsay, who ran City Hall from 1966 to 1973, comes to this volatile set of problems with a slate of new, if sometimes vague, policies, and a mix of advantages and drawbacks. Perhaps the greatest question mark facing his administration is whether he has the personality to build the broad coalitions necessary to run New York smoothly. Educated at New York University's law school, Mr Giuliani sprung to prominence in the 1980s as a tough crime fighter. He served for a time as number three in President Reagan's Justice Department before becoming US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he vigorously pursued the Mafia and Wall Street insider traders. In these jobs and in his pursuit of City Hall in 1989, he came across as a distinctly puritanical, impatient man, with a short temper and a lust for publicity. During this autumn's campaign he has presented a more mellow, less wooden appearance, but he still lacks the charisma of the handsome, aristocratic Mr Lindsay, which helped him govern a city whose elected officials remain overwhelming Democratic. However, Mr Mitchell Moss, who heads the Urban Research Center at New York University, argues that Mr Giuliani will have the advantage of a co-operative Democratic City Council, not least because voters on Tuesday also displayed their dissatisfaction with the political establishment by approving a measure limiting elected officials to eight years in office. In another sign of unhappiness, the overwhelmingly white inhabitants of the borough of Staten Island voted to take the first step towards secession from the rest of New York City. Mr Giuliani also has to show he has the character to reach out beyond his white electoral backers to the black community, which is deeply distrustful of him and will be smarting from the defeat of Mr Dinkins, the first black mayor of a major US city to lose his first re-election bid. Mr Dinkins, a kindly, gentlemanly figure, failed partly because of poor campaign strategy and partly because of the reputation he gained in his term for very mixed administrative abilities. Nevertheless, he did manage to ease a great deal of racial tension in the city. The fear is that Mr Giuliani's abrasive personality could exacerbate it. Mr Giuliani's campaign advisers were almost entirely white and male, though in his victory speech early yesterday he promised that 'nobody - no ethnic, religious or racial group - will escape my care.' On economic, fiscal and business matters Mr Giuliani could prove much more effective than Mr Dinkins, who is widely faulted for failing during his term to do more to bring the city's vast Dollars 31bn budget under control. The new mayor has promised to reform the city's tax structure and bring a 'managerial revolution to City Hall' - a reference to the new fashion among US municipalities for the privatisation of services or incentives to improve worker productivity. He has promised to cut the city's payroll by 34,000, but has not spelt out how he will do this. Budget cuts will certainly be necessary - and quickly, for when he takes office on January 1 Mr Giuliani is expected to inherit a shortfall of several hundred million dollars in this year's budget and gaps of some Dollars 2bn in each of the next three years. As he starts to hack, every community will be watching, ready to denounce him for the merest hint of ethnic or political bias. For Mr Giuliani, no less than Mr Dinkins, the great American melting pot promises to remain very hot.</p>

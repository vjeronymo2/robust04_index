			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA PLACE: SHOPPING BY THE SEA  </P> <P> Santa Monica Place is identified as the shopping mall by the sea -- by its  stores and by the number of beach-going visitors that pass through its doors.  </P> <P> The mall has followed the trend toward specialty stores, adding a Pacific  Sunwear outlet (hip surf garb). It also boasts two environmentally sensitive  retail outlets in the Heal the Bay Museum and Nature's Own. The great outdoors  theme is also reflected in its Eddie Bauer store.  </P> <P> Developed and operated by the Rouse Co. of Columbia, Md., the center recently  remodeled its facade and interior with an eye toward shedding its generic mall  image. The mall has been aided greatly in that regard by the recently completed  renovation of the adjacent Third Street Promenade, which has added several  upscale restaurants and three new movie theaters within a two-block radius.  </P> <P> The $15-million remodeling job, which took nearly 11 months to complete,  included the addition of several skylights and other decorative touches that  brightened both the inside and exterior of the beach-side shopping center.  Marketing officials, however, say the real upgrade involved the addition of  several new stores, such as Imaginerium, which they are banking on to boost  sales.  </P> <P> Mall officials say the shopping center is more community-minded than most, in  part because of its location in downtown Santa Monica and its proximity to the  city's Civic Center.  </P> <P> As a reflection of the city's landscape, mall officials recently planted palm  trees inside and added a drip fountain in the center court.  </P> <P> "We have certain natural advantages here because of our location," said Robin  Faulk, marketing director. "A lot of the reasons Santa Monica is great is the  reason why Santa Monica Place is great."  </P> <P> During the holidays, mall employees are required to park in the Santa Monica  Civic Center parking lot a few blocks away. Even so, the mall tends to suffer  from insufficient parking. The problem is sometimes worse on summer weekends  than during the Christmas season because beach-goers find the mall's lot a free  and convenient place to leave their cars.  </P> <P> Although the mall competes primarily with Westside Pavilion, its target  audience is located along the coast, the affluent residents from Malibu to Los  Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> In 1989, Santa Monica Place ranked 15th in total sales among the 45 largest  malls in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SANTA MONICA PLACE, SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Year opened: 1980  </P> <P> Retail square footage: 570,000  </P> <P> Anchor stores: the Broadway, Robinson's  </P> <P> Number of stores: 160  </P> <P> Memorable feature: New fountain in center court  </P></p>

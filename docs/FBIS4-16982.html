			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- The National Salvation Front (NSF)  intends to hold a session of the NSF Council this Sunday [24  April]. It is to elect the NSF leadership and discuss the  organization's immediate tasks. The ITAR-TASS correspondent  learned this today from Ilya Konstantinov, chairman of the NSF  Executive Committee.    The activities of the organization were suspended following  the events of 3-4 October 1993, while Konstantinov himself was  arrested. He was released from jail following the amnesty  resolution passed by the State Duma.    Asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent to give his assessment  of the Accord for Russia movement, which is being set up with  the help of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Konstantinov said it was too  early to do this. At this stage the NSF is distancing itself  from the movement.    Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Federation  Communist  Party, who once actively participated in the activities of the  NSF and is now one of the initiators of the creation of the  Accord for Russia movement, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent  that he was still advocating the strengthening of the patriotic  movement and the unification of all national-patriotic forces.  In his view, this unification is impeded on the one hand, by  the policy of the authorities and on the other, by increasing  radicalism among nationalist patriots, both left- and right-wing.</p>

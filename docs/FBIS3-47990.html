			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By An Hui-chang] </F>   [Text] Various observations on the current status of Kim  Yong-sun, who has been known to have been a secretary in charge  of North Korea's policy on South Korea, attract public interest.    On 10 January, some foreign sources reported that Kang  Chu-il, first deputy director of the Reunification Front  Department of the Workers Party of Korea, had been appointed  secretary in charge of policy on the South and that Kim Yong-sun  came to take charge of policy on the United States.    Prior to this, in the middle of November 1993, it was  observed that "Kim Yong-sun had been ousted and had not yet been  appointed to any position." In fact, Kim had not been engaged  in any external activity until the time he met Australian  nuclear expert Peter Heiz [as transliterated] in July 1993, thus  making the observation convincing.    In early December of last year, however, when the sixth  session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea  was held, it was confirmed that Kim had been eliminated from the  list of candidate members of the Political Bureau of the party  Central Committee but still remained as secretary in charge of  policy on the South. This enabled people to reach a conclusion  on the various observations on Kim's status.    However, a recent report by foreign sources that Kim has  been  appointed to the post in charge of U.S. policy has prompted  various new observations.    First, the ROK's Board of National Unification has denied  the  report that Kim quit the post in charge of policy on the South.    An official concerned denied the report on Kang Chu-il's  appointment as secretary in charge of South Korean policy,  saying that "It is usual for a party secretary to be member of  the party Central Committee. However, there has been no report  that Kang has been appointed member or candidate member of the  party Central Committee since 1980." Another official concerned  pointed out, "North Korea has never appointed a director-level  official to be secretary of the party."    Accordingly, observers say that the rumor on Kim's dismissal  from the post in charge of South Korean policy has been created  because Kang practically exercises authority in making policies  on South Korea although Kim maintains his title as secretary in  charge. This is persuasive. They say that they have actually  observed signs of Kim's declining power since 1992.    According to a Board of National Unification official, a  Japanese figure, who visited North Korea and met Kim at that  time, told him that "Kim Yong-sun once promised me to arrange a  meeting with Kim Chong-il and seemed very confident. In the  recent meeting with me, however, he looked somewhat weak [daso  himi ppajindutan]."    Also related to this is the fact that he, as a candidate  member of the Political Bureau, was downgraded from ranking No.  15 to No. 26 in the party hierarchy late last December.    In view of the fact that North Korea considers the  improvement of relations with the United States to be an urgent  question, however, it is possible that North Korea created the  new post in charge of U.S. policy so as to assign Kim, who had  played the role of a conduit with the United States, to a  certain duty. Judging from this and the fact that Hwang  Chang-yop has recently sent an invitation to lawmakers of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan, analysts say that Hwang  Chang-yop, as secretary in charge of international relations, is  completely in charge of policy on Japan, and Kim Yong-sun, an  authority on U.S. affairs, takes complete charge of policy on  the United States, while Kang Chu-il takes charge of practical  business on the South.</p>

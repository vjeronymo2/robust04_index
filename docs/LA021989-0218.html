			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON HAS TO WORK OVERTIME TO DEFEAT SAN JOSE THIS TIME  </P> <P> It was the sort of roar usually reserved in the Big West Conference for days  when Nevada Las Vegas is on the ropes, but this time it came at the expense of  Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> When Tom Desiano hit a 12-foot jumper with 55 seconds left in San Jose State's  game against the Titans Saturday, it set the fans thumping in Civic Auditorium.  </P> <P> Desiano's shot gave the Spartans a one-point lead, their first of the game, and  it put victory into the minds of most of the crowd of 1,874.  </P> <P> San Jose State, the team made up mostly of football players, a team manager and  assorted other walk-ons since 10 players began boycotting in protest of Coach  Bill Berry last month, had lost its past 12 games, seven since the walkout.  </P> <P> This was the closest yet, but Fullerton pulled out a 70-69 overtime victory.  </P> <P> Johnny Johnson, who as a Spartan tailback led the Big West Conference in  rushing, hit the first of two free throws with 8 seconds left in regulation to  tie the score. But he missed the second, and the game went to overtime after  Fullerton was unable to score in the final seconds.  </P> <P> San Jose (5-19 overall, 1-14 in the conference) had a 69-67 lead as the  overtime period ran down, but Fullerton's John Sykes rebounded Cedric Ceballos'  miss in the final seconds and went up for a two-handed reverse dunk. An  official called a foul on the play. Sykes, who had made four of 11 free throws  in the past two games, sank one with a second remaining, saving the Titans the  humiliation of becoming the first team to lose to San Jose State's makeshift  bunch.  </P> <P> Fullerton had a complaint at the end of regulation when there was no call after  Johnson made contact with Ceballos after blocking his shot in the final  seconds.  </P> <P> San Jose State may have had a complaint at the end of overtime.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I got fouled," Sykes said. "I didn't really feel it."  </P> <P> Never mind that this San Jose State II team has improved so much that some  suggest it is a rival to San Jose State I. Never mind that Fullerton was only a  3 1/2-point favorite according to one published line.  </P> <P> A loss would have meant jubilation for San Jose, humiliation for Fullerton.  </P> <P> "Games like this, you wish nobody lost," said Berry, whom the boycotting  players accused of extreme verbal abuse. "Under the situation, under the  circumstances, I may be doubly disappointed that we couldn't get over the hump  just for the kids. I certainly could have used the boost too."  </P> <P> Fullerton, which has had its own troubles with the resignation of Coach George  McQuarn shortly before the season started and the departure of several players,  could sympathize -- to a point.  </P> <P> "I feel sympathy toward them because of their situation," said Derek Jones, who  along with Ceballos had 19 points to lead the Titans. Mark Hill added 16. "But  I want to go out and win just like they do. Those other teams were trying to  beat us as badly as possible. . . . It was a strange feeling. San Jose is in a  kind of situation like we were in at the beginning of the season.  </P> <P> "No one wants to be the first to lose to them. No one wants to make the mistake  that costs us the game."  </P> <P> Fullerton, which beat San Jose State, 82-60, in the hastily assembled team's  debut last month, could only praise the Spartans.  </P> <P> "Berry has done an excellent job coaching these kids," Fullerton Coach John  Sneed said.  </P> <P> Jones said the team had improved "maybe 100%."  </P> <P> Craig McPherson led San Jose with 20 points, and Dwain Daniels added 17.  </P> <P> "They had a day to practice before," Jones said. "There's not much you can  teach in a day. They've had a month now. They're a team I think should be  watched out for in the conference tournament. They could get somebody."  </P> <P> With the victory, the Titans (12-11, 7-7) equaled their win total of last  season, when they went 12-17.  </P> <P> Fullerton had to hang on to win despite shooting 56% in the game, its highest  percentage so far this season. The Titans took a 27-13 lead at the outset,  making 12 of their first 13 shots, with the only miss because of offensive  basket interference.  </P> <P> San Jose trailed by only three at halftime, but was down by 10 with 12 minutes  to play.  </P> <P> "You just need a break, somebody to make a big play," Berry said. "I'll be  darned if we didn't defend the heck out of Ceballos at the end, and he shot a  short airball. Then, gosh darn, Sykes came up with it, put it in and of course  the official called the foul so we didn't get into another overtime.  </P> <P> "Had we gotten that last airball rebound, the ball would have been ours. We'd  get fouled, maybe, and make our free throws, maybe. . . . There are a million  things you can say, 'What if, what if,' Berry said. "I'll be doing that  tonight. I just hope (the players) don't."  </P></p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Observer: A room with a message Dan Pena is one American entrepreneur it is almost impossible to get rid of. Having been edged off the boards of two companies most executives could be forgiven for entertaining some self-doubt. But not 46-year-old Dan. The former chief executive of Great Western Resources is making the most of his latest setback. 'My entire life has been built upon the crushed bones of those who continued to remind me, 'Dan, you can't do that',' says Pena. No surprise then that Pena's latest venture is a series of 'You Can't Do That]' executive seminars in the academic serenity of his 525-year-old Scottish castle. The title will be especially meaningful to Pena's fellow visionaries who remember his tenure at GWR, where his expenses claims and company loans sparked a shareholder rebellion last year. The week-long seminar will focus on 'what they didn't teach you in graduate school and what you may not have encountered in the real world'. The tuition doesn't come cheap. For Dollars 13,000 Pena can offer six nights in his Ghost Suite, complete with haunt. However, he's throwing in a black tie dinner with Angus's landed gentry. And in case clients doubt what Dan Pena thinks about Dan Pena, the mailing shot includes his memorable line, 'I'm doing so well, if I were doing any better, I should be investigated.'</p>

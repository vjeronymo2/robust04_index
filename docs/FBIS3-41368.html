			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Betrayal of National Dignity."] </F>   [Text] The caretaker government's announcement that it  would hand over narcotics smugglers to the U.S. or other  countries and the permission given to the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration to do as it pleases in Pakistan and to take  direct action in this country has caused the flight of major  narcotics dealers from Pakistan. Meanwhile, drug mafia leaders  are reportedly buying Stinger missiles from Afghan commanders.  Alleged international drug dealer Haji Ayub Afridi who is wanted  by the U.S. is reported to have fled to Afghanistan with the  help of the Khyber Agency political authorities. The government  of Pakistan had reportedly issued warrants for Afridi's arrest.    Ayub Afridi's flight shows clearly that the administration  did not want to arrest him; it seems that by spreading reports  of intentions to hand him over to the U.S. and of making [other]  arrests, a clear signal was given to major narcotics dealers to  make suitable arrangements for themselves. If Ayub Afridi was in  fact helped to escape by the political authorities, then these  authorities should be placed under arrest and punished. Why was  he allowed to escape after the government had issued orders for  his arrest?    The most objectionable part of the whole affair is the  manner  in which a U.S. agency has been allowed to take action within  Pakistan as though this country was not independent but an  American colony or a helpless country like Panama whose  president was captured by American troops. Will similar action  be taken in the near future in Pakistan and the U.S. will be  allowed to arrest and take away anyone it wants within Pakistan?  American spies are already raiding Pakistani homes. One cannot  understand how the Government of Pakistan has allowed such  things to happen. Would the U.S. ever allow Pakistani police to  round up and arrest criminals it seeks in the U.S.? There is not  an elected government at present holding office in Pakistan but  being a caretaker government does not mean that national dignity  and pride should be sacrificed.    The business of narcotics undoubtedly destroys generations  and nations but it cannot be eradicated by the measures that  have been taken so far. Governments have repeatedly announced  that drug dealers would be punished severely. We have repeatedly  asked that drug dealers be put to death. But as matters now  stand, major drug dealers do as they please but unimportant drug  agents and sellers get caught. Powerful individuals are engaged  in the drug business and perhaps governments are afraid of them  or they are the government's backers.    These powerful drug dealers may now be buying Stinger  missiles and getting ready for a major show-down. If the reports  of the sale of Stinger missiles are true, then the Government of  Pakistan should first of all seek help from the government of  Afghanistan and ask it to dissuade Afghan commanders from  selling their Stinger missiles and protecting drug dealers.</p>

Kansi is  one of the `10 most wanted' people in the United States.    This correspondent, who happened to be in Sehwan for a  visit,  saw a strange, clean-shaven, fair and tall person and recognised  him immediately as Aimal Kansi. Pictures of Kansi have appeared  on wanted posters all over the world. However, neither this  correspondent not Kansi introduced themselves to each other.    Between puffs of hashish, the person who stared at the Indus  Hotel of Sehwan, where the shrine of Qalandar Lal Shahbaz and a  "Kafi" of a Pashtoon Seth (businessman) are situated, said that  he was on a visit to the shrine of the Sufi mystic.    He said that he was in the transport businesses in Karachi,  however, he refused to give his residential address in that  city. "The whole world is my home," he said when asked about his  permanent abode.    Speaking in pidgin Urdu and occasionally in fluent English,  Kansi said that his original village was near Zhob in  Balochistan but he had spent most of his life in the United  States and Germany.    After the firing incident, the American Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) had recovered an AK-47 assault rifle from an  apartment where Kansi used to live with his friends. The FBI  report said the rifle was the same as that used in the shooting.  The report also stated that Kansi had no criminal record and  that his neighbours generally thought him to be a normal person  who posed no threat to anyone.    The Fairfax Country Police of Virginia and the FBI had  issued  warrants against Kansi, after the firing, charging him with the  shooting on January 25 that occurred during the morning rush  hour traffic just outside the CIA headquarters in Langley,  Virginia. Two CIA personnel were killed and three others were  injured in the bizarre shooting for which no motive has been  established.    In February last year a team from the FBI had come to  Pakistan and along with Pakistani officials, raided some of the  houses of the people who belonged to the Kansi tribe of Quetta  in an attempt to arrest the accused. The raids, however, failed  as the family informed the officials that Kansi had left for the  U.S. a couple of days back.    The manhunt for Kansi led to a dead-end. Finally the U.S.  authorities placed a reward of $100,000 for information leading  to the arrest of Mir Aimal Kansi.    "I was operated upon twice in the States because of  excessive  drinking. That is why I have given up alcohol," Kansi said,  surrounded by some of the Malangs (spiritually intoxicated  followers) of Sher Baaz Qalandar, who were sharing [word  indistinct] of hashish, Kansi showed me his [word indistinct]  and said, "I was, first, comforted with hashish in Germany by my  girlfriend and since then, I feel that anybody who does not  experience the joy of smoking hashish cannot enjoy life." Thick  clouds of smoke swirled around his tough face.    "This person takes hashish worth Rs [Rupees] 100 daily,"  said  a bearer of the hotel about Kansi, when asked how much hashish  he took in a day.    Kansi also said that his father was an army officer "But now  I am all alone."    When he was very high Kansi opened up and displayed his  feelings. he laughingly requested: "My friends, now I feel very  alone. Please make arrangements for my wedding." A servant at  the hotel told THE NEWS that the person we were talking about  did not meet anybody during his week-long stay in Sehwan.    "I visit the shrine of the Qalandar because I feel a certain  peace there. I have hashish and Khang with the Malangs sitting  inside the shrine," Kansi said.    He, however, avoided any other discussion about the United  States other than references to his girlfriends and hashish  smoking. This correspondent also did not show any eagerness  about anything because this could have led to some suspicion on  the part of Kansi.    Kansi was very impressed by the quality of the hashish  available in Sehwan. "If you guys were in Germany with this  quality of hashish, I swear, the girls would be crazy about you."    After this chance encounter with Kansi, he disappeared from  the hotel and the town. Despite efforts by this correspondent to  trace him again he was never seen in the vicinity of the town.    Aimal Kansi had gone to the U.S. from Pakistan and was  working as a courier with a private company.    A recent report from Bangkok also said that the police's  special branch teams had received information from Washington  that Kansi, had slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide in  the network of guerillas and criminal gangs operating there.    The Thai police, on the information, have circulated wanted  posters for the arrest of three men -- Kansi, Mohammad Farooq  and Ramsi Ahmad Yusuf. The latter two are suspects in the World  Trade Centre bombing case.    The wanted posters offer $2 million for the information  leading to the arrest of suspects.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (21): Shougang has international ambitions - The dramatic expansion plans of an engineering giant A VISITOR to the Capital Iron and Steel works in Beijing's western suburbs is left in no doubt as to the most important event in the steel giant's recent history. The entrance foyer of its reception pavilion is dominated by an outsize portrait of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, visiting the plant on May 22, 1992. Shougang could hardly have hoped for higher-level endorsement of its ambitious expansion plans, both in China itself and internationally. Indeed, the story of the company and its high-level connections provide a valuable insight into the workings of an opaque Chinese system. Within weeks of Mr Deng's inspection visit, State Council, or cabinet, approved a fairly dramatic expansion of Shougang's charter, including the establishment of the China Shougang International Trade and Engineering Company, and the granting of a coveted banking license. According to company literature, Shougang is now empowered to 'engage directly in import and export business, set up plants and run joint ventures abroad, undertake engineering contracts abroad and conduct labour services. Shougang was also empowered to operate business in the fields of finance and foreign trade.' There is little, it seems, that Shougang cannot do. Mr Pan Huanyuan, Vice President of International Operations and a Shougang board member, said that the company's ambition was to become a 'trans-national enterprise'. A decision to accelerate the expansion of its activities abroad had been taken by directors late last year. In fact, Shougang, which ranks as China's fourth largest industrial enterprise and third biggest steel producer, had already signalled its ambitions in the international market place. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Shougang Holding (Hong Kong) Ltd. it had begun swooping on a clutch of listed Hong Kong companies, and in the process forged some powerful alliances, including partnership with billionaire Li Kashing in a steel company - Shougang Concord Inter- national Enterprises, previously known as Tung Wing Steel Holdings. Other Hong Kong invest- ments include interests in a metals trading company, an electronic-component manufacturer and a property company. Among partners in the property company, known as the Shougang Concord Grand (Group) is Mr Deng Zhifang, the son of Mr Deng Xiaoping himself. These connections will have done no harm to Shougang's global ambitions. Shougang's move into Hong Kong has enabled it to secure 'back door' listings on the local stock exchange, opening up prospects of the steel giant transferring some its mainland interests to these listed companies. The company's Hong Kong investments will also facilitate additional capital raising in the local market. Mr Pan says that in selecting Hong Kong as a 'fortress' for its international ambitions, Shougang was mindful of its advantages as a 'centre of finance, information and communications.' But he also made it clear that the company was intent on seeking opportunities in the wider world. 'Shougang is interested in everything, although, of course, we are not interested in running a cemetery]' he declares. To this end, the company took control of the Mesta Engineering Company of the US in 1988, and last year it purchased an iron-ore mine in Peru for UDollars 120m. It is now looking for further invest- ments in the mining sector in places like Latin America, Australia and South Africa. In China itself, the company began in 1979, after reaching agreement with the authorities on a new 'responsibility system' under which it was allowed to retain a share of its profits for re-investment, diversifying into such areas as construction, real estate, electronics, ship-building, shipping, the manufacture of auto parts and textiles. Shougang's employees number 280,000, the majority of whom are engaged in either operating the company's iron-ore mine near Tangshan, north of Beijing, or at the Beijing plant which resembles a small town with 60-70,000 people resident there, and engaged predominantly in steel-making activities. Steel-making accounts for about 80 per cent of Shougang's profits which are expected to reach Yn4.6bn (UDollars 807m) this year, compared with Yn299m in 1978, the year before the introduction of the responsibility system of profit-sharing with the state. Steel-making would remain the focus of Shougang's endeavours in spite of its diversification strategy, said Mr Pan. The company expected to lift production to 8.8m tonnes of steel by the end of 1994, up from 5.7m tonnes in 1992. At present, the steelmaker ranks third in production behind the Anshan works in Liaoning province, but plans to be number one in China by the end of the century. Another ambition is to be ranked among the world's top 10 steel manufacturers. China this year will produce about 80m tonnes of steel, making it the world's third largest producer behind the US and Japan. The Shougang official noted that per capita steel consumption in China was less than 70 kilograms compared the world average of 150 kilograms. This left much scope for increased business, as China became more affluent. 'China's 250m families need more and more steel products,' he says. Apart from its Beijing plant which will reach its maximum production capacity of 10m tonnes by the turn of the century, Shougang is planning a giant new steel-making facility in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing. In partnership with Mr Li Kashing's Cheung Kong Holdings, the company will invest Yn22bn in the first phase whose production would reach 5m tonnes annually. A second phase would double capacity to 10m tonnes. Shougang could not be accused of lacking ambition . . . or connections.</p>

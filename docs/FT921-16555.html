			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Consumer body targets banks: Which? report highlights bad buys in financial services sector even more - financially prudent in 1992, the Consumers' Association suggests cutting some habits which may be costing more than they should. The association targets what it calls the financial bad buys of 1991. The list includes services from such names as Sun Alliance, TSB, Argos, Midland and National Westminster banks. The association urges consumers to look hard at thevalue for money they are getting. Its verdict: not great. The association, a registered charity, publishes its criticisms of the financial services sector in the latest issue of its monthly magazine Which?. If you decide to make 1992 the year you finally take out some life insurance, exercise caution, the association warns. According to Which?, a 29-year-old woman would not do well if she opted for Reliance Mutual's 15-year policy paying out a lump sum of Pounds 50,000 at a cost of Pounds 205.80. Scottish Equitable would provide equivalent cover for only Pounds 47. Midland Bank's current account 'gets the prize' for worst current account deal. Which? says: 'Not only does it not pay interest on a credit balance, Midland came out worst in customer satisfaction and efficiency.' NatWest's Current and CurrentPlus accounts fare little better. Which? says: 'With either of these accounts, if you had gone overdrawn by Pounds 500 for one week, been sent a letter and bounced just one cheque, you'd have been charged Pounds 84.19.' Those charges include interest, arrangement fee for the overdraft, plus standard charges for bouncing a cheque and sending a letter. Be careful too when using stores' own credit cards. Rumbelows, the electrical goods supplier, and Argos, the catalogue store, were found to charge 'a whopping 41.7 per cent APR'. Argos has since dropped its rate to a still impressive 37.6 per cent. If you are one of the estimated 80,000 mortgage holders who might lose their home in 1992, the report has some useful tips. The association looked at 50 different mortgage lenders between April 1986 and September 1991. A mortgage from Bretton Financial Services - a Royal Life company - averaged 13.38 per cent annually. It cost Pounds 1,850 more than the cheapest, from Tunbridge Wells Equitable, which charged an average 12.5 per cent. The TSB, averaging 13.1 per cent, was the most expensive high-street mortgage lender unearthed. Once you have the home, take out the insurance. But think carefully before turning to Sun Alliance. Which? reports that for a house with a rebuild cost of Pounds 75,000 in a high risk area, a Sun Alliance policy cost Pounds 187.50 a year more than a similar policy from Top-UK. Ms Jane Vass of the Consumers' Association said: 'With financial services more than any other area, it's a case of buyer beware. But even taking that into account, some of our bad buys are astonishingly bad.'</p>

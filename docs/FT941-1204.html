			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Bundesbank warning on derivatives The Bundesbank yesterday issued a forceful public warning on the mounting risks presented by the proliferation of financial derivatives trading in global markets. Financial institutions' should take care to install controls to ensure they had a realistic picture of the dangers faced, Mr Edgar Meister, a central bank director told a Frankfurt conference. The difficulties of some managers in understanding the activities of the analysts and mathematicians, 'today's sorcerer's apprentices', in their trading departments was a serious problem, he said. Mr Meister warned that no institution should consider entering the derivatives business unless it was staffed by people with the necessary know-how, competent supervisors and high-performance computer and software systems. The trend towards ever more complex 'hybrid' products, linking different derivative instruments, made risk assessment ever more difficult, he said. Non-bank newcomers to the business, operating outside the scope of banking supervision, presented a special problem, and more information was needed on them and their activities, he said. 'Statements to the effect that nothing has happened yet or that there is no need for additional regulation are just as unhelpful as horror scenarios such as the often-used picture of young people using their computers to construct a hydrogen bomb for the financial world,' he said. Mr Meister suggested that the dangers were often played down with claims that only the big banks were active and they had risks under control: 'I cannot accept this attitude and behave as though only good guys were involved.' In Germany, where regulation was relatively tight, derivatives trading had reached a scale where it almost equalled the banking sector's entire business volume, he said. In response, the Bundesbank is discussing in detail the extent to which its statutory obligation to maintain monetary stability was being hampered by this business. Along with the federal supervisory authorities it was reviewing the effectiveness of current minimum requirements for derivatives trading, he added.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tempted by liquid gold Those of a nervous disposition or with vertigo should perhaps avert their gaze from world equity markets. There is no doubt that the liquidity flowing from deposits into bonds and equities is having a powerful effect on financial asset prices. What is more debatable is the degree to which the rise is sustainable. Unlike 1987, this is not a rally fuelled by borrowed money and high gearing. The search for yield is in part a genuine switch between asset classes as a result of the low rates available on deposits. Yet the liquidity in the financial system - most notably in the US - is a result of a prolonged stimulus by central banks which risks inflating asset prices unsustainably. In that context, and with UK equity yields so low, even a modest uptick in inflation is a cause for some concern. By most measures, UK equities are now more expensive than they were at the peak in 1987. There is some comfort for the optimists in the third-quarter UK growth figures which show the economy growing at a reasonably robust 2 per cent annual rate. The picture which emerges is of strengthening consumer spending while exports and investment remain patchy. Yet despite this week's rate cuts on the continent, the risks of a widening trade gap remain, further hedging the UK's room for manoeuvre. The budget may bring modest or deferred tax increases and some loosening of monetary policy, but the potential for further cuts remains limited. How much further the market can rise depends upon imponderable international flows. The faster the rise, the greater the risk of a nasty bump.</p>

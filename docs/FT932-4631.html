			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Finland waits for interim reports season Global equities moved quietly into June with last week foreshortened by the Whitsun holiday. Gains in Japan outweighed miniscule declines in Europe and the US to leave the FT-Actuaries World Index up 0.1 per cent in local currency terms. The biggest falls came in markets which, to date, had produced the largest gains. In Europe, Finland dropped on profit-taking after a rise of 47.9 per cent in the five months to May 28; in the Pacific, Hong Kong fell on news that China had decided not to support its currency on some of its semi-official swap markets. Goldman Sachs noted last week that news from Finland recently has been almost exclusively about rights issues: 'The fact that several of these proposed cash calls (Nokia, Metsa-Serla) have been directed to foreign investors and that they will improve liquidity further has made the market reaction mild.' Goldman is still positive on the Helsinki market but says that near-term performance will depend on the tone of the interim reports due this month. 'Most of the companies should show strong improvements on last year's levels,' it adds, 'thanks to the devaluation effect on their large net exports (on average around 35 per cent), even if the high debt in foreign currency will reduce the benefits somewhat.' Hong Kong, the second-best World Index performer this year, showed its weakness mostly in companies with significant exposure to China. On the mainland, Shanghai and Shenzhen B share indices fell in sympathy, and a broker said foreign investors had lost their confidence in China's economy, and currency. Mexico's 2 per cent decline was the more worrying because it was already the only constituent market showing a loss this year. However, Latin American Securities in London says that what happened amounted to 'a siesta in a quiet week'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              % change       % change             % change in local currency??    sterling??   in USdollars??             1 Week 4 Weeks  1 Year Start of   Start of      Start of                                      1993       1993          1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +1.51   +3.94  -15.29   +4.06     +4.71         +4.99 Belgium      -1.59   -1.24   +0.51   +6.85     +6.25         +6.52 Denmark      -0.92   -3.68  -10.27  +13.15    +13.89        +14.19 Finland      -3.95   -4.39  +52.77  +42.08    +34.99        +35.34 France       -1.51   -1.05   -5.59   +2.68     +3.44         +3.71 Germany      +0.26   +1.10   -8.97   +6.89     +6.43         +6.71 Ireland      +0.97   +4.66  +14.39  +29.50    +19.42        +19.73 Italy        -1.75   -1.95  +15.75  +24.89    +23.93        +24.26 Netherlands  -0.60   +0.12   +3.03   +9.56     +9.09         +9.37 Norway       -0.28   -0.88   -7.96  +12.79    +13.27        +13.57 Spain        +0.80   +8.70   +2.89  +22.47    +10.66        +10.95 Sweden       -0.92   +0.71  +14.57  +11.68     +7.91         +8.20 Switzerland  +0.75   +5.77  +17.68  +11.59    +11.76        +12.04 UK           -0.20   +1.45   +6.71   +1.07     +1.07         +1.34 EUROPE       -0.38   +1.24   +3.12   +6.16     +5.59         +5.87  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -1.23   +2.42   -0.62   +9.53     +7.32         +7.61 Hong Kong    -2.79   +5.62  +14.43  +31.06    +31.00        +31.34 Japan        +0.95   +2.34  +24.24  +25.91    +45.51        +45.90 Malaysia     -1.02   +5.29  +46.49  +27.32    +30.07        +30.41 New Zealand  +0.89   +5.54   +4.19  +10.04    +15.10        +15.39 Singapore    +0.94   +8.36  +14.25  +19.78    +22.03        +22.35 Canada       -0.07   +1.34   +6.58  +11.19    +10.29        +10.58 USA          -0.06   +1.84   +9.19   +3.30     +3.03         +3.30 Mexico       -1.96   -4.21  -12.66  -11.61    -11.88        -11.65 South Africa -1.46   +5.51   +4.94  +26.08    +32.86        +33.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +0.09   +1.99  +11.36  +11.07    +15.38        +15.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ??

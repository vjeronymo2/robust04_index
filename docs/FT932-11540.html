			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Airlines criticise Heathrow rents INTERNATIONAL airlines operating from Heathrow airport's Terminal 3 have attacked BAA, which operates London's airports, for charging excessive rents. The Airline Operators' Committee said that the rents for office space at Heathrow were more than twice the level of property rents outside the airport. BAA said yesterday that it had agreed to look at off-airport comparisons in setting future rental levels.</p>

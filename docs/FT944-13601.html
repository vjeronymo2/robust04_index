			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Microsoft begins search for Windows partner in China Microsoft has begun courting local partners to help design and launch the Chinese version of its next-generation Windows 95 software, Reuter reports from Beijing. The effort to cultivate ties with software developers, industry regulators and the trade press also aims to smooth feathers ruffled during the US software giant's blunt-edged entry to China last year. While Windows has emerged as the de facto standard for four out of every five desktop machines worldwide, Beijing regulators have refused - often indignantly - to accept the Chinese version of Windows as a standard for China. Microsoft executives admit having alienated key electronics ministry officials by relying heavily on managers from arch-rival Taiwan who looked down on China's less-developed market and by developing the mainland version, nicknamed P-Win, not in China but in Taiwan, which uses a different form of Chinese characters and highly dissimilar methods of keyboard entry. The company said a Chinese partner would be selected by the end of the year to assure that Windows 95 was available in China within six months of the US version. It also said that Chinese regulators appeared to have dropped their insistence on protecting the mainland market long enough to allow a home-grown platform to emerge, a tacit acceptance of Microsoft Windows as a de facto standard.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool After rising towards the end of November the Australian market started to ease last week and the downturn became more definite in the past couple of days. The market indicator there, which touched 541 cents ten days ago, closed last week at 534 and sank in two days to 516 cents a kg by December 9. The November rise in the wool market brought out more interest in prices within the trade, but only a limited amount of small scale business resulted. Europe is still very far from convinced that the recession is showing signs of coming to an end.</p>

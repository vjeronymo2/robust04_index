			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Korean power utility surges 70% midway Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the state-controlled electricity monopoly, reported that net profits rose 70 per cent to Won391.5bn for the first half of 1994, writes John Burton. Sales rose 14.6 per cent to Won4,051bn. Analysts believe the profit growth mainly reflected a recent change in accounting rules to reduce special depreciation charges. These charges depressed earnings last year. Kepco is the largest company listed on the Seoul bourse, accounting for about 13 per cent of market capitalisation.</p>

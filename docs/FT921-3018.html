			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Arts: John Mortimer's 'Zaide' - New York Mozart was composing Zaide, his first essay in German opera, when the commission for the opera seria Idomeneo arrived, and Zaide was set aside. Two years later, Joseph II was commissioning German pieces for his national company: Mozart looked at his unfinished Zaide, decided it was not 'comic' enough for Vienna, and wrote instead Die Entfuhrung, on much the same subject but with Blonde, Pedrillo and Osmin added. Zaide remained unknown until the composer's widow found and sold it to a publisher. Fifteen musical numbers - perhaps three-quarters of the intended  - survive, but not the spoken dialogue that should link them. Mozart's source was a libretto in which Zaide, the Constanze figure and Gomatz, the Belmonte figure turn out to be brother and sister, and the Sultan's overseer turns out to be both their father and one who had saved the Sultan's life 20 years before. But after the first few numbers Mozart departed from his source; and for the soprano and tenor he wrote tender love music suggesting that he had a different denouement in mind. The score ends with what is presumably the second-act finale, in which the recaptured pair face death together, Allazim pleads for mercy, and the Sultan is inflexible. Thereafter, it's anyone's guess what happens . . . and so Zaide, which contains marvellous numbers, has attracted many speculators, eager to save some excellently dramatic music for the stage. Italo Calvino produced a version - it reached London in William Weaver's translation - in which Mozart's incomplete score was washed up on a desert island and the performers who came across it tried various ways of fleshing it out and resolving it. The latest version of Zaide is by John Mortimer. It received its world premiere last Thursday in the Juilliard Theater, brought by the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music. Mortimer - like Peter Sellars in his production of Handel's Giulio Cesare and Ken Cazan in his St. Louis production of Mozart's Mitridate - chose the modern Middle East as his main setting: the Sultan, a religious fanatic, heads the party in power, Gomatz is a political prisoner and Allazim is a professor who once taught both of them. The roles are doubled: singers in robes sing Mozart's music, and actors in modern dress speak Mortimer's drama. At the close, Mozart's Sultan releases Zaide, Gomatz and Allazim to freedom while, on the other side of the stage, Mortimer's Sultan has the trio executed. Well, it's a having-it-both-ways idea, but it did not amount to much. In a programme note, Mortimer wrote rather promisingly of a contrast between dreams, such as can be sung about, and harsh prose reality. But his political prose exchanges are trite and obvious, his modern characters conventional cardboard. His Allazim's 'Battles are a sign of weakness, not strength. If you let them go you'll prove yourself strong enough not to care about dissidents . . . I could guarantee you an excellent press. Perhaps a seat at the conference table' is a fair specimen. In the aftermath of a real Gulf War, this tacking of contemporaneity to an 18th-century abduction drama seemed glibly opportunist - and ill-matched to the emotions explored in the score. It was the 'unreal' figures - the singers animated by Mozart's music - who came to life. Or would have come to life had they been better sung, had Cincinnati been able to field less modest vocal resources. The Juilliard, only a 1,000 seater, apparently intimate, but very wide and with dead acoustics, is a trap into which the Bloomington troupe that brought Lo sposo deluso to New York earlier this season also fell. And the actors lacked the rhetorical force to quicken the melodramas. Malcolm Fraser produced. Jindong Cai conducted, too blandly. William Mann in his Mozart book says, 'Attempts to turn this fragment into a viable theatrical musical experience cannot succeed . . . the best use to be made of it is either by gramophone records or concert performances.' I agree. I've not seen Paul Griffiths's The Jewel Box, which sounds captivating. But John Mortimer's Zaide proves as unsatisfying as all the earlier attempts to 'make something stageable' of Mozart's unfinished, unfinishable Zaide, Oca del Cairo and Sposo deluso.</p>

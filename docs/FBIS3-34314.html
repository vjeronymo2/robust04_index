			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Baghdad BABIL in Arabic on 2 February  publishes on page 12 the following report under the banner  headline "The Greatest Honor: Serving the Homeland and the  Leader:"    "The coalition aircraft have dropped fliers over Bani-Sakin  area, near al-Nashwah, al-Basrah Governorate.    "The Iraqis listen to beamed foreign radios, which have a  greater influence than the fliers. During their underground  struggle, the Ba'thists used the flier technique and they cannot  be deceived by such games.    "The aircraft that dropped these fliers are the same  aircraft  that dropped hundreds of tonnes of bombs on our great people.  They failed to achieve the enemies' goal to infringe on the  sovereignty, security, and renaissance of Iraq under its mujahid  leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve  him. Accursed be they and shame on those who sold their  homeland to jump into the hands of the foreigner."    Copies of six of these fliers are published with the report.  Each flier is headlined "Wanted By International Justice," and  includes a picture of the official concerned with a summary of  "crimes" he has committed printed under the picture. The fliers  read:    "Taha Yasin Ramadan, accused of crimes against humanity,  including mass murder committed by the Republican Guard in the  south under his command."    " 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, accused of crimes against humanity,  including the killing of tens of thousands of citizens in Iraqi  Kurdistan in al-Anfal Operations."    "Watban Ibrahim, accused of crimes against humanity. He  ordered the execution of 42 merchants in Baghdad in July 1992."    "Muhammad Hamzah al-Zubaydi, accused of crimes against  humanity, including brutal suppression of the popular uprising  in al-Samawah, al-Nasiriyah, al-Basrah, al-Kut, al-'Amarah, and  the marshlands in the south in March 1991."    " 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, accused of crimes against humanity,  including mass murder, rape, and instigating genocide."    " 'Aziz Salih al-Numan, accused of crimes against humanity,  including ordering the destruction and desecration of holy  places when he was governor of Karbala' and al-Najaf."</p>

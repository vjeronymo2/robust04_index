			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Lloyd's could snatch victory in Names vote Lloyd's could still win majority acceptance from lossmaking Names for its Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer, the Association of Lloyd's Members said yesterday. The association, which represents about half of the market's 18,000 Names - individuals whose assets back the market - said informal polls of its members had shown a two-to-one majority in favour of the offer. Mr Neil Shaw, association chairman, said: 'Names should not assume from press reports that the offer is boundto fail. If Names wish to accept Lloyd's offer, it is vital for them to act to protect their own interests.' Recent meetings of action groups have indicated that many of the heaviest lossmaking Names intend to reject the deal and that Lloyd's would not get the 70 per cent majority - by value of the offer - needed for its acceptance. Mr Shaw said: 'There is a significant number of Names for whom acceptance of the offer would not be appropriate, but also there is an equally significant number for whom acceptance would be in their best interest.' He said it was not necessary for Names to resign from their action groups if they accepted the offer. If the offer failed, Names' acceptanceswould be void and they would be free to pursue their litigation rights. The statement drew an angry response from Mr Michael Deeny, chairmanof the Gooda Walker Names Action group - the biggest of more than a dozen action groups - whose case is due to come to court in April. He said: 'The truth is, the offer is dead. Every single action group actively engaged in litigation has voted to reject the offer by an overwhelming majority.' Lloyd's will announce the number of acceptances for the offer on February 14.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Alcan forecasts continued oversupply ALCAN Aluminium says oversupply of metal will persist this year despite a slowdown in exports from the former east bloc to the west in the first two months. Alcan is maintaining its quarterly dividend of 15 US cents but expects another tough year, says Mr David Morton, chairman. The Canadian company has pared capital outlays to USDollars 550m from USDollars 880m in 1991 and the investment will be confined to completing rolling mill capacity in the US and Germany. However, Alcan will keep environmental spending up to USDollars 120m. Mr Jacques Bougie, president, said Alcan will cut another USDollars 300m from its cost base in 1992 and more in 1993. Productivity targets throughout its bauxite, alumina, smelting and fabricating operations worldwide are now set in a five-year time frame. He said that although recent spot market prices reflected the slowdown in the flow of east European metals to the west, Alcan was being extremely cautious and suspects the inflow will resume soon due to foreign exchange pressures. Alcan has stopped work on the Kemano hydro-electric project in northern British Columbia, required for the expansion of its smelter nearby, following a court judgment on environmental issues now under appeal. In 1991, Alcan posted a loss of USDollars 36m, or 25 cents a share, against a profit of USDollars 543m, or Dollars 2.33, in 1990. Revenues were USDollars 7.75bn against USDollars 8.7bn.</p>

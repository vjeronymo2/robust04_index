This rule continues on a permanent basis three measures originally imposed by a temporary emergency rule: A 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit for haddock year-round for all vessels permitted under the FMP and for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); a prohibition on scallop dredge vessels from possessing or landing haddock from January through June; and an extension of the time period of the closure of Closed Area II to 6 months (from January through June), rather than 4 months (February through May), in 1995. The intended effect of this rule is to protect depleted haddock stocks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the Environmental Assessment (EA) and Regulatory Impact Review (RIR) supporting this action may be obtained from Allen E.

All three of the measures contained in this final rule are also contained in the emergency rule that is effective through June 30, 1994 (59 FR 15656, April 4, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council voted on February 17 to begin the resubmission process for the disapproved 5,000-lb (2,268-kg) haddock possession limit in Amendment 5 to the FMP by submitting a 750-pound (340-kg) possession limit. The 750-pound (340-kg) limit was recommended by the Council on the basis of Plan Development Team and Council staff analysis of the haddock fishery. The 750-pound (340-kg) limit and a proposed implementing rule were submitted to NMFS on March 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 28, 1994, NMFS disapproved the Council's 750-pound (340-kg) limit because it was determined to be inconsistent with National Standard 1 of the Magnuson Act, which requires that management measures prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the U.S. fishing industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This determination was based, in part, on data from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) that indicate that current haddock catches are generally less than 500 pounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (226.8 kg). The Council's argument that a 750-pound (340-kg) limit would allow vessels to keep what would be discarded anyway, therefore, was no longer relevant to this segment of the multispecies fishery. This additional information which was available to NMFS at the time the resubmission was disapproved, but not available to the Council at the time of its analysis, underscores the appropriateness of a 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit in order to ensure maximum protection to this severely depleted resource. Accordingly, the 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit is included in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS also determined that, because scallop vessels fish in Closed Area II during the period when haddock are congregated to spawn, all scallop dredge vessels should be prohibited from landing or possessing haddock during the closed period to ensure that such vessels do not target these concentrations of haddock. While the Council requested that the Regional Director consider whether scallop dredges should be prohibited from being in the area during the closure, instead of being prohibited from possessing or landing haddock, the information provided by the NEFSC of NMFS did not support precluding scallopers from the closed area. Accordingly the prohibition from possessing or landing haddock is included in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the resubmission package did not propose the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of the time closure of Closed Area II. The data acquired by the NEFSC since the Council's analysis supports an extension of the time closure in 1995, rather than beginning in 1996, as stipulated in Amendment 5. The expansion of Closed Area II in time for 1995 will provide additional protection to the concentrations of haddock that occur in the area. The closure of Area II beginning in January rather than February, and ending at the end of June rather than at the end of May, should ensure that haddock beginning to concentrate in the area are provided the fullest protection. Accordingly, an extension of the time period of the closure is included in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

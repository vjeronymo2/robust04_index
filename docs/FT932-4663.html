			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Lofs AS A result of losses in its new vessel, London &amp; Overseas Freighters saw pre-tax profit fall from Dollars 2.67m to Dollars 1.86m (Pounds 1.2m) in the year to March 31. The accounts are now stated in dollars as the company moved its domicile to Bermuda a year ago. The dividend this time is 2 cents gross, which will be converted into sterling unless individual shareholders decide otherwise. The 1991-92 payment was 1.25p net. Directors said the reduced profit could be blamed on trading of the acquired Nestor, now renamed London Enterprise. Its losses have been Dollars 630,000 since being transferred from Scoresby. This year London Enterprise will be overhauled with consequent loss of revenue. In mid-July the newly built tanker London Pride should be delivered to trade under the profitable charter to Chevron.</p>

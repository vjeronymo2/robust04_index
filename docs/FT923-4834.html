			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts surge on borrowing move THE UK government bond market surged two points in one of the strongest rallies seen in recent months following a Treasury announcement that the government will be borrowing the equivalent of Ecu10bn in a variety of currencies. The borrowing decision has two positive implications for the gilt market as it reduces funding pressure and will help to support sterling in the foreign exchange markets. UK economists said the Ecu10bn borrowing - which is equivalent to about Pounds 7bn - would greatly reduce the government's need to borrow in the gilt market. 'The bottom line is that the government will have to sell Pounds 7bn fewer gilts' said one dealer. According to economists' estimates, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PBSR) for 1992/93 will be about Pounds 33bn, against Treasury forecasts of Pounds 28bn. According to Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged, the government's remaining funding in the gilt market will be cut from Pounds 13bn to Pounds 6bn as a result of the borrowing plan. Volume in the futures market was double normal levels with about 45,000 contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which opened at 95.20, rose to 97.12 while in the cash market the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 113.00 to 115.00 yielding 9.43 per cent. Long and medium-dated gilt issues showed the strongest gains, reflecting the fact that these are the maturities where funding pressure was expected to be heaviest before yesterday's announcement. FRENCH government bonds rallied, pulled up by the surge in gilt prices. The Matif futures contract climbed from 104.86 to 105.58 and dealers said the market managed to take the French Treasury's auction of FFr11.8bn of stock in its stride. However, the French market will be waiting to see the outcome of the television debate between President Mitterrand and Mr Philippe Seguin which was scheduled for last night. US Treasury prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as traders and investors anxiously awaited today's important August jobs data. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 98 5/8 , yielding 7.359 per cent. There was even less movement at the short end of the market, where the two-year note was unchanged at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.085 per cent. All week trading has been conducted in the shadow of today's employment report, with most participants reluctant to take large positions for fear of being caught cold in the event of a major surprise in the jobs figures. The consensus of analysts expects non-farm payrolls to have risen 155,000 last month, following the 198,000 increase in July. Half of the monthly gain, however, is expected to result from the hiring of temporary employees under a federally funded summer jobs programme.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (11): Catalyst for economic growth in black areas - Public contracts are vital to the success of minority-owned businesses, but local competition remains intense / Minority-owned businesses Over the past decade, the C D Moody construction company has worked on some of Atlanta's biggest building projects: Underground Atlanta, a large shopping mall and tourist attraction in the city centre, the Georgia Dome, site of the 1994 Super Bowl, and the new atrium at the ever-expanding Hartsfield International Airport. Not bad for a seven-year-old, black-owned company with only 47 employees on the payroll. David Moody, the architect who incorporated the firm in 1988, believes Atlanta's progressive public policy has helped him to succeed. 'The city of Atlanta's minority participation program was a great help,' says Mr Moody, whose company will generate Dollars 8m in revenues this year. 'They are serious about it . . . Because of it, I've been able to get my foot in the door. Mr Moody's experience supports the argument of many economists that Atlanta is among the best places for African American entrepreneurs to do business. But whether or not Atlanta is an oasis of black entrepreneurship depends to some extent on who one asks. Some Atlantans say the notion of the city as a 'Mecca' for black entrepreneurs is a myth and point to statistics that show Atlanta lagging behind other metropolitan areas in minority business success. According to a recent study by researchers at Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta barely makes the top-10 list of leading metropolitan areas in terms of black business growth. Washington D C, Houston and Sacramento beat the city in terms of black businesses per 100,000 African Americans. And black-owned companies produce only 1 per cent of the Atlanta metro area jobs and less than 3.2 per cent of its business receipts. Bob Holmes, a state legislator from Atlanta and co-author of the study The Status of Black Atlanta, says the idea of Atlanta as a benign incubator of black businesses is 'over hyped' - the product of an effective but misleading public relations effort on the city's part. Most black-owned businesses in the city are marginal, he says, and points out that the African American share of total business receipts has fallen since 1977. Moreover, Atlanta's black entrepreneurs face the same obstacles as black entrepreneurs anywhere. Most business growth is in the suburbs, away from black population centres, and discrimination means black businesses have more trouble securing loans and doing business within the private sector. According to the study, discrimination against black-owned businesses comes in many forms, showing up in 'bonding, price differential . . . refusal to use (minority) subcontractors, bid manipulation . . . double standards in performance and qualification . . . slow payment and non-payment' and 'exclusion from the 'Good Old Boy Network' in subcontracting.' The report acknowledges, however, that great gains have been made in opening up the public sector to minority-owned businesses, and many black firms are thriving in the rich Atlanta market. Mr Moody's ability to build his business on lucrative government contracts is evidence of this, as is a study by Georgia Tech economist Thomas Boston now under way. Mr Boston argues that Atlanta, while not a Mecca, is a thriving centre of black industry and commerce. 'There is probably not another metro area in the country with as many programs for minority entrepreneurs,' says Mr Boston, who cites contracting policies that require a minimum percentage of government business to be set aside for minorities. Set-asides are mandatory for the city of Atlanta and Fulton County (in which the city is located), the Atlanta transit authority, and the Atlanta school board. Voluntary programs are in place at the Atlanta hospital authority and in neighbouring DeKalb County. But black contractors still find it hard to break into the private sector. According to the Clark Atlanta study, Atlanta's minority contractors get 93 per cent of their revenues from the public sector and only 7 per cent from private markets. In contrast, white contractors generate 80 per cent of their sales from the private sector. Mr Boston maintains that public contracts are a vital engine for growth among minority-owned businesses. 'These programmes allow market penetration by minorities . . .in areas that were heretofore closed to them,' he says. This, he adds, enables minority businesses to build strong revenue bases from which to launch ventures into the private sector. Meanwhile, Mr Boston argues, the atmosphere for black business in Atlanta is far better than the Clark Atlanta study suggests. First, he says, according to his own research, arbitrary census criteria for black-owned businesses have left nearly three black-owned firms not counted as such for every one that is recorded. Thus, he says, 'the capacity of black-owned firms is greater than is commonly perceived.' In terms of average revenue, the rate of revenue growth and the start-up rate, Atlanta ranks first among leading metropolitan areas. Most agree that there is a trend toward greater business growth in the suburbs at the expense of the city centre, where Atlanta's black population is largely concentrated. That business growth includes high-revenue black-owned businesses, the presence of which in the suburbs parallels a movement by more-affluent blacks away from the city centre. But regardless of where they are located, black-owned businesses are a catalyst for economic growth in the black community, no matter how dispersed that community is becoming. 'Black-owned businesses on average have 85 per cent black employees,' Mr Boston says. Atlanta's black entrepreneurs, like minority business people across the country, face significant problems in the area of financing and credit, he adds. The amount of start-up and improvement capital available to black businesses is limited, according to the Atlanta Economic Development Commission. In this sense, the city is a victim of its own success: the sheer number of businesses competing for loans often makes it difficult to secure financing. That, according to Mr Moody, should not be a deterrent to ambitious black entrepreneurs. If he had to start all over again in business, he says, he would do it in Atlanta. 'Construction is a tough business, and minority contractors have to prove themselves constantly. But as far as the public market is concerned, we're on an equal playing field now.'</p>

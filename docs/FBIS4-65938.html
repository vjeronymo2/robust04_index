			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gerd Brueggemann: "No End to the </F> Lamentations"]    [Text] True, the hike in short-term U.S. interest rates by  the Federal Reserve Board has greatly diminished the difference  between interest rates in the United States and Germany.  However, this does not necessarily mean that the permanent  complaints by U.S. politicians about the Bundesbank's tight  credit policy will now be silenced. But it would also be wrong  to overestimate its importance.    In Washington, economic and financial policy measures in  other countries are examined only seldom for their respective  causes, but more predominantly for their effects on the U.S.  economy. From the Washington viewpoint, that seems  understandable.    Since most U.S. politicians, for reasons of reelection, are  growth-oriented rather than stability-oriented like their German  counterparts, high interest rates in an important target country  for U.S. exports, such as Germany, constitute a brake for the  U.S. economy and are thus an evil worthy of criticism. This  attitude is essentially based on the opinion that the economic  policy of industrial countries--for instance, within the  framework of G-7--should best be guided by the necessities of  U.S. economic policy.    The German finance ministers and presidents of the  Bundesbank, who on innumerable occasions had to listen to such  U.S. lamentations, when in doubt have always turned a friendly  deaf ear and presented what they saw as right in the interest of  their own country. That was, and probably is, the only  appropriate reaction.</p>

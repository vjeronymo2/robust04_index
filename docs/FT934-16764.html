			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: MacGregor warned over BR MR JOHN MacGregor, the transport secretary, should 'bow to common sense and travellers' wishes' and abandon rail privatisation, a passenger group urged yesterday, on the eve of his address to the conference. Opinion polls showed only 8 per cent of people believed privatisation would work, said Mr Steve Wilkinson, chairman of the Railway Development Society. He said there was 'precious little enthusiasm for privatisation among Mr MacGregor's parliamentary colleagues, party members or, indeed, potential private railway operators'. Meanwhile, Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, warned that 23 Tory marginal seats could be at risk if the 'running down' of the cash-starved London-to-Scotland West Coast main line was allowed to continue. Fares would rise by up to 50 per cent and staff levels would be cut by more than A third, the Scottish Save Our Railways campaign said yesterday. Its figures were based on a study carried out by the Scottish Transport Studies Group. ScotRail is to be one of the first pilot shadow franchise areas, a test for privatisation. Meanwhile British Rail said yesterday that an increasing number of speed restrictions are having to be imposed on lines because of lack of maintenance funds. BR warned: 'We need Pounds 850m a year just to keep existing passenger services at their present level and our funding for each of the next three years is less than that.' The environmental group Transport 2000 said it feared routes in need of repair might be axed altogether when BR is privatised.</p>

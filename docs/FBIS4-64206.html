			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Almost Everyone Notices the Boom"] </F>   [Text] The German's economy's prospects have improved even  further. Following recession and stabilization, important  economic spheres in the western part of the country have begun  to recover. Growth has consolidated in the new laender. The  boom there now seems to be the result of increasingly  independent economic stimuli. Economics Minister Guenther  Rexrodt is even convinced that the government's economic  forecast and the 1.5 percent real economic growth for the whole  country predicted by the research institutes can be exceeded.    Economic trends are going to be the focus of the Hanover  Fair, the world's largest exhibition of investment goods. The  mood among the over 6,800 exhibitors from 60 countries and among  the visitors is optimistic; better foreign sales of German goods  are expected than in 1993. "Production and turnover are clearly  improving," the chemical industry, one of the largest industrial  branches represented in Hanover, claims. Therefore it comes as  no surprise that Chancellor Helmut Kohl ("a turn for the  better") and German Chamber of Trade and Industry president  Hans-Peter Stihl ("the order books are getting full") are very  happy about the fair.    Already before the fair, the statisticians noticed that  demand and production in the processing industry had expanded in  February, a growth of about 3 percent against the January level.  Orders show that domestic business has also picked up at last,  with an increase of 2.5 percent. Out of the large industrial  sectors, the investment goods industry has reaped above-average  benefits from the increase in orders. On the other hand, orders  in the automobile industry have grown disproportionately against  January, an increase of 9 percent. This development has  obviously already had a bearing on production. Here too,  production in the investment goods industry has experienced an  above-average increase, beating the relevant 1993 result in  terms of demand and output.    This confirms what the FAZ [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG]  development indicator, which reports on the placement of orders,  the business climate, and job vacancies, predicted over 12  months ago. "The chances of an economic revival this year have  improved even further," the analysis reads. Even the latest  Institute for Economic Research [IFO] economic development  indicator shows a continuation of the positive developments in  industry, consisting chiefly of brisk business with exports.  All main production sectors and most subsidiary branches expect  higher output than they did in last summer's survey. In August  1993 they expected a decrease in output in 1994, but in fact the  size of 1994 orders has displayed respectable growth. A further  consolidation of economic growth is expected in 1995. According  to all these surveys, it is the investment goods industry that  is the main source of the economic growth; the main sectors of  this industry responsible for this growth are machinery, road  vehicles, and electrical goods.    A major reason for the improved trend and the optimistic  forecasts for the coming months is the clear improvement in  export conditions: Following "slow" growth among Germany's  major trade partners, the demand of these partners for German  commodities has again increased, and has done so ever since the  beginning of last year. The growth stimuli were backed up by a  repeated improvement in competitiveness, and a reduction in  costs. The devaluation of the mark against the dollar and yen  have boosted foreign demand by an additional amount. Following  the sharp decline in exports, especially in the first half of  1993, exports picked up again in the second half of the year  albeit by a very small amount. In February 1994, exports rose by  a good 6 percent against January. Total exports in January and  February were 3 percent higher than in the same months of 1993.  The export surplus in these months, amounting to almost 12  billion marks, was almost double the figure for January and  February 1993.    In the meantime, the mood among consumers also seems to be  improving slowly. The Nuremberg-based Society for Consumer,  Market, and Sales Research expects an improvement in the general  economic situation beginning in the middle of 1994, together  with better prospects for the labor market, an increase in  incomes, and higher turnover in the retail trade, coupled with a  decrease in inflation. The Cologne-based Institute of German  Industry says that in order to support private consumption,  consumers should have reduced the savings indicator since the  end of 1991 from 13.1 to 11.1 percent. In western Germany alone,  every percent less inflation is increasing the maneuvering space  of real incomes by around 18 billion marks.    In eastern Germany, in the meantime, economic stimuli have  been increasingly shifting from the construction industry and  services sector to industry. Following earlier sharp declines,  internal orders in the processing industry went up by almost one  fifth in 1993. Industrial output has at last undergone a strong  increase by 7.5 percent against the 1992 figure. Thus, the fall  in employment in industry has been halted. The Bundesbank  claims that the reduction in employment in the whole of German  industry could now reach an end.</p>

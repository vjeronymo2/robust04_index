			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F> Dino Frescobaldi in Geneva; date not given: "My United Nations  Has Not Failed"; -- first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Geneva -- What is the UN secretary general's reply  to those who are now putting that international organization in  the dock? To those who have even called for his resignation?  We dined on Chinese delicacies with Butrus-Ghali in one of the  three restaurants of the hotel that stands between the lake and  the now famous Palace of Nations in Geneva. It was one of his  rare moments of relaxation in an extremely busy working day.    "To start with," Butrus-Ghali began, "the fact that I have  disagreements with important members of the United Nations  proves that I am independent and that I try to defend the  organization's independence and specificity. The United Nations  is criticized now, but it could not be so before, because it did  not do anything. We are dealing now with 17 different  operations worldwide. We have no less than 70,000 troops, and  our peacekeeping budget has increased from $500 to $4 billion.  We have increased our activities tenfold. We deal not only with  conflicts but also with a large number of issues, from the  environment to health and education. We also deal with the  democratization process and elections. We sent 2,600 observers  to South Africa to monitor the elections, and we have been  working with the local police there since 1992 to contain the  violence. Of course, we have encountered difficulties in some  areas, but we have also achieved some successes, as in Cambodia,  El Salvador, and Mozambique, on the basis of the agreement  reached in Italy. Even in Somalia we have succeeded in training  personnel for a police force and in vaccinating 300,000  children. Let us not forget that 2 million people died in  Biafra. In Somalia, however, we saved 200,000 children. People  say that we have failed in Yugoslavia. It is not true: We have  established a cease-fire between Croats and Serbs in Krajina,  have helped two million refugees, and have transported millions  of metric tons of food to Sarajevo. For the first time in the  history of the United Nations, we have sent troops where there  is no war -- to Macedonia, within the context of preventive  diplomacy. It must not be expected that all the operations in  which the United Nations intervenes must necessarily succeed.    [Frescobaldi] Perhaps people's opinions are influenced by  what happened in Somalia....    [Butrus-Ghali] But everybody should realize now why it was  so  difficult there. THE WASHINGTON POST revealed this by  explaining exactly and at length what happened: There were  disputes between the various American military chiefs. With  that happening, we could not impose peace.    [Frescobaldi] When you took on your post, did you foresee  the  obstacles that you would encounter?    [Butrus-Ghali] Yes and no. I was well aware that a new phase  was beginning in the world, in which we do not yet know what  rules and new ideas should govern international relations. I  realized that after the end of the Cold War there was a  political will on the part of the states to impart a new role to  the United Nations, but the problem is that the states have not  yet decided what kind of new role they want it to perform.    [Frescobaldi] Are you referring to the only remaining  superpower?    [Butrus-Ghali] That is not true. There is Japan, too. The  Japanese are divided; we do not know what they want in this  regard; the public is reluctant to commit itself. I have paid  three visits to Germany. It is the same there, and the  responses are the same. And the same goes for Argentina and  Chile too. If all these states decided to play their part, the  United Nations really would become an international institution  with some power. If it is wished to grant it power.... But  until last January, only 20 of the 184 member states had paid  their contributions. The United States owes us almost a billion  dollars. To conclude: There is not the political will on the  part of the member states to use this instrument.    [Frescobaldi] Could you explain?    [Butrus-Ghali] First explanation: Many do not yet know what  the post-Cold War ground rules are. Second, for some states,  such as America and Russia, it was easy to obtain billions from  their citizens when there was a clear and specific enemy. Now  it is much more difficult to achieve a mobilization, when the  danger is spread round the world. Third, people were prepared  to die to defend their own territory, but now they are no longer  prepared to take part in remote operations under a strange flag  in order to defend other people's peace.    [Frescobaldi] Will we reach the establishment of a UN army?    [Butrus-Ghali] I have never been in favor of it. It would  entail creating a bureaucracy. What would we do with the  generals if there were no wars? What I am asking the states to  do is to have ready a special contingent to be made available  within 24-48 hours -- a contingent that would return to its own  ranks once the operation is over. I have proposed a contract to  Italy to make available, if necessary, five transport aircraft  belonging to the Italian Armed Forces. I do not doubt that some  situations would have been resolved if it had been possible to  intervene within the space of a few days. For instance, I have  no doubt that if we could have sent 5,000 men to Rwanda within  48 hours, we would have resolved matters. Now it is taking  months of exhausting negotiations to decide who will take  command and to create expedition corps among people that you do  not know and that change their minds at the last minute.    [Frescobaldi] Have these delays also had an impact on the  situation in Bosnia?    [Butrus-Ghali] I will tell you in this regard that last June  I asked to have an additional 10,000 men available. In fact, on  the basis of a study, I said that 35,000 more men were needed.  They told me: We will give you 10,000, and that is all. The  fact is that hitherto I have not managed to secure even these.    [Frescobaldi] Did you address Italy, too, in connection with  Yugoslavia, even though it is a bordering state?    [Butrus-Ghali] We are in such serious trouble that I  eventually asked even Italy to participate. Of course, in  Italy's case there is a danger of reviving old memories, but in  the present situation it is a lesser danger. I made a choice  between the two dangers. We cannot do without the quality of  the Italian troops belonging to NATO, who possess the same  weapons as the other contingents.    [Frescobaldi] What was Italy's reply?    [Butrus-Ghali] We did not receive a reply; we waited, then  we  asked again. We were told that it would be necessary to await  the election results, and now we have to wait for the new  government. This is an example. But Italy is not the only  instance. In Germany they told me that they have constitutional  problems. So I sent a delegation to the Constitutional Court.  I then had three hours of discussions with the Bundestag  Foreign Affairs Committee. For the same reason I have already  visited Japan twice, and I will go there a third time. All this  takes up endless time.    [Frescobaldi] Do you think that an end to the Yugoslav  tragedy is possible?    [Butrus-Ghali] Ethnic war is like a contagious illness that  spreads and propagates itself. I believe that the United  Nations has already achieved a great deal by containing the war  in Bosnia and by preventing it from extending beyond  Yugoslavia's borders. As for the rest, that will take a long  time. Unfortunately, I cannot fail to draw a parallel with  Lebanon. It is difficult to end a tragic process when it has  claimed so many lives. Beirut too was an important center -- no  less so than Sarajevo. It was a banking center, a cultural  center with four universities, a center of information with the  shaykhs' residences and oil interests. And yet that war has  lasted 14 years.</p>

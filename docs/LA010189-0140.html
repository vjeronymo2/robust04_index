			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FLORA OF THE VALLEY: COCKLEBURS  </P> <P> Cockleburs, a common plant in fields and riverbeds, along roadsides and near  reservoirs, is easily recognized by its prickly burs.  </P> <P> With numerous species, cockleburs are plentiful throughout the United States.  </P> <P> The most frequently seen in California are Xanthium strumarium and Xanthium  spinosum. Xanthium is a Greek word meaning yellow and was the ancient name of a  plant used to dye hair.  </P> <P>  Although their origin is unknown, cockleburs are not considered native plants.  Often pesky, they can develop solid stands on river flood plains covering many  acres.  </P> <P> Because each bur-like fruit contains two seeds that produces its own generation  of offspring, cockleburs are difficult to eradicate once started. One of the  seeds requires much more oxygen than the other and remains dormant for a year  longer than its twin. Seeds are protected by airtight coats.  </P> <P> Cockleburs are bushy plants that grow to about 3 feet tall. Their inconspicuous  flowers are greenish and minute.  </P> <P> The hairy, egg-shaped burs are about half-an-inch long and covered with hooked  prickles that attach themselves to animal fur, manes and tails.  </P> <P> The stems are covered with tiny hairs. The oval to wedge-shaped leaves are  toothed and 2 to 5 inches long. They are thick in texture and usually are  three-lobed.  </P> <P> Cockleburs in the seedling stage are poisonous to animals.

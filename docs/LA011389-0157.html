			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> 3 HUNTINGTON BEACH SKINHEADS GET MAXIMUM IN 'GAY-BASHING'  </P> <P> A judge in Santa Ana today handed three young neo-Nazi skinheads the maximum  possible sentences in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in a Laguna Beach park  last summer.  </P> <P> Accusing the three of a "wolf pack " mentality, Superior Court Judge David H.  Brickner sentenced Aaron F. Compean, 18, who assaulted the victim with a lead  pipe, to seven years in prison. John M. Moore, 23, received four years and  eight months for assault and attempted robbery, and Stephen Walther, 18, was  sentenced to four years.  </P> <P> The three men, all from Huntington Beach, screamed, "Kill the faggot!" when  they attacked 48-year-old Robert Joyce. But the jury that convicted them two  months ago rejected prosecutors' claims that the crime was attempted murder.  </P></p>

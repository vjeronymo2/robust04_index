			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Delay for Mosaic relisting MOSAIC Investments, the West Midlands-based mini-conglomerate whose shares have been suspended since last September, yesterday announced interim results for the period to October 31 1992 and said it hoped to get its shares relisted by the end of April. Mosaic had previously said its shares should be relisted by today. However, the complexity of discussions with bankers, Mr Rodney Day, the holder of Pounds 3m worth of preference shares, and other vendors of companies bought by Mosaic, have delayed the process. Worsening trading conditions meant earlier agreements had to be renegotiated. The interim results showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 207,000 (Pounds 3.2m). The sale of the engineering and automotive division cut sales by Pounds 4.2m and operating profits by Pounds 900,000 but boosted net assets from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.5m. Group sales fell from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 18.3m, and operating profits were Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 3.8m). Exceptional costs of Pounds 583,000 related to redundancy and reorganisation costs and more costs are expected in the second half because of the relisting. There was a Pounds 349,000 loss (loss Pounds 28,000) from the investment in European Licensing Group, the associate. The loss on the sale of the engineering and automotive business caused an extraordinary debit of Pounds 2.8m. Losses per share were 0.67p (earnings 12.8p).</p>

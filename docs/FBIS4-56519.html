			<p>BFN     [Text] The controversy on whether Carabineros Director  General Rodolfo Stange will resume his post continues. Stange's  lawyer has stated that the high-ranking officer has not  requested leave, yet the defense minister has said he has  already approved it.    Gen. Stange began his vacations on 8 April. His vacations  end on 16 May. Stange's lawyer, Pablo Rodriguez, has said that  Stange has not requested an extension. He added that the acting  Carabineros director has submitted a written communication to  the defense minister which states that Stange was to have taken  two months leave if a military judge was appointed to  investigate charges on military negligence. He said:    [Begin Rodriguez recording] As this is not the case, Gen.  Stange will not submit any leave request. A request is uncalled  for in compliance with Gen. Stange's original position. If a  civilian judge is appointed to investigate the case, there is no  legal, constitutional, moral, or ethical obstacles to prevent  him from resuming his post. [end recording]    Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, however, said that Gen.  Stange will not resume his post before July.    [Begin recording] [Rojas in progress]... This is the  situation right now. His vacation expires on 17 May and from  then on, he will start a 60-day leave permit that can be reduced  or extended.    [Unidentified reporter] You have to authorize it.    [Rojas] I have already authorized it. He has requested leave  and I have already authorized it. [end recording]</p>

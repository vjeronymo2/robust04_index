			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (12): Main centre for the Channel Islands  -There are about 3,000 moorings for yachts around the island. Size is no object  / Yachting ABOUT 15,000 yachts visit Guernsey each year. The money spent by the visitors makes a significant contribution to the island's tourism income. There are three marinas - the Victoria, the Albert and the Queen Elizabeth II - tucked inside the 100-acre St Peter Port harbour complex. The Victoria dates back to the eleventh century and is now used largely for visiting craft. In the 1850s, a vast expansion took place which meant the old four-acre harbour was increased to 70 acres. Two great breakwaters were started. The southern one linked the shore with Castle Cornet, ending its long history as an island. The 'pool' created by the breakwaters has been developed over the years for containers, ro-ro traffic, passenger ferries and the fishing fleet. A second marina, the Albert Marina, was developed next to the Victoria. Finally, in 1985, work was started on what was known as the North Beach project. Costing Pounds 15m this involved claiming 30 acres of foreshore next to the harbour to provide a marina, harbour facilities and parking for freight vehicles. The Queen Elizabeth II Marina was officially opened in 1989 and can accommodate 800 yachts. St Sampson's harbour, close to St Peter Port, handles private boats, fuel tankers and timber-carrying vessels. It has an active ship repair industry. It does not have a yachting marina as such. Further north, the private Beaucette Marina, constructed from a disused quarry, has all-year-round facilities for vessels as well as visiting yachts. In all, there are about 3,000 moorings for yachts around the island. Size is no object. There is a heavy tidal drop of 9m between high and low tide. In the 'pool' and two of the marinas there is a draught of 6m. The moorings can accommodate yachts of up to 100m comfortably. Captain Timothy Spencer, States Harbour Master, says: 'Yachts can get into the marinas at most states of the tide, certainly more than 70 per cent of each day.' Of the 3,000 or so moorings, more than 2,000 are taken up by locally-owned craft. It is the visiting craft which really contribute to the tourism economy. There are as many as 500 yachts visiting each day in high summer. The Victoria marina can take nearly 300 boats. The rest moor either in the pool or in the Queen Elizabeth II marina. In 1989 the Harbour Board of Administration commissioned a report on visiting yachts. It found that on average 15,000 yachts visited each year. There were 4.2 people on each yacht and they spent Pounds 80 a head - a total tourist 'spend' of Pounds 6m. Captain Spencer says: 'You would have to increase that figure now. You can safely say that if the total tourism spend in Guernsey is Pounds 100m, then visiting yachtsmen account for 10 per cent of it.' This is certainly a higher contribution than for neighbouring Jersey. Why has Guernsey become the main yachting centre for the Channel Islands? One reason is the deep water. Conseiller Roger Berry, president of the Harbour Board of Administration, says: 'Jersey is generally sandy while Guernsey is rocky. They (Jersey) built their marina on the south side of the island and it dries out to a greater extent than the marinas here.' Captain Spencer says: 'If you look at the map, Guernsey is much more strategically placed than Jersey. Jersey is tucked into the French coast. You are almost in France when you get to Jersey. Guernsey is the most convenient landfall between Britain and Spain and the Mediterranean.' Conseiller Perry adds: 'It takes up to 12 hours to reach here from the Solent. By the time the crews have moored and tied up they are ready to go out and spend money on a good meal.' Whatever the reason, Guernsey has developed a niche tourism market in yachting. Captain Spencer sees this business increasing further. He says: 'We are getting events like the Swan Regatta. In September we have the Guernsey International Powerboat week. This features the British powerboat grand prix. These kind of events extend our season.' But whether Guernsey will develop into a great international yachting centre along the lines of some of the Mediterranean resorts is highly debatable. A tentative proposal by Amec Civil Engineering to reclaim and develop a swathe of Bell Greve bay, which is between St Peter Port and St Sampson's harbour, has run into stiff opposition. Amec says that its plan to reclaim 150 acres of foreshore at a cost of Pounds 70m is consistent with the island's strategic and corporate plan. To make the project financially viable the Amec plan would include new marina facilities, housing areas, a hotel and golf course. The islanders staged a protest march earlier this month which led the the Advisory and Finance Committee to the States publicly to say that elements of the onshore development are probably 'unacceptable'. Amec, however, will persevere with its ideas. Ms Julia Bircher, spokeswoman for Amec, says: 'We are going the exhibition route. We are in close consultation with the authorities and we are going to set up a model to show that the proposals are environmentally safe and friendly.' Conseiller Roger Berry says that, in his view, the proposals are politically impossible - but that everything is at a very early stage.</p>

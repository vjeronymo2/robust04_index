			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Defence mergers With the prospect of submarine maker VSEL being taken over by British Aerospace or GEC, the rationalisation of the UK defence industry is moving into its end game. GEC has already collected most of rival defence electronics supplier Ferranti; GKN has bought Westland; now BAe and GEC are seeking to secure their position in naval engineering. At first sight some of these mergers lack coherence. Yet because the UK has reduced its defence industry to one aircraft manufacturer, a dominant electronics company, two large makers of land vehicles and a few shipyards, companies have to find cost savings from merging the companies which are left. The logical conclusion of this process would leave the UK with two giants: GEC, whose prime expertise is in electronics systems, and BAe which makes its money from engineering and project management. The question now is whether they themselves should merge or should seek alliances in a wider European context. There is something to be said for a merger. GEC's Pounds 2.8bn cash mountain would provide BAe with the cast iron financial stability it has always lacked, while BAe's marketing flair could help GEC succeed in export markets. On the other hand, the Ministry of Defence may object to merger if the two companies have already digested the remainder of the defence industrial base. The two companies' cultures could also clash in a way which turned the dream merger into a nightmare. It is not hard to imagine GEC's inflexibility combining with BAe's accident-prone nature to produce a disaster. The more attractive alternative, which both are already pursuing, is closer collaboration with continental partners. BAe has been negotiating a missile alliance with Matra of France and an ordnance merger with Giat. GEC is pooling its sonar business with the French electronics company, Thomson. Better still would be wholesale rationalisation of the European defence industry. Unfortunately this is being blocked by political objections. Britain, France and Germany in particular see their defence industries as vital security interests and status symbols. They should realise that the ideal of independent national defence industries is an illusion. Many key technologies come from US, Japanese or other EU countries. Some equipment is so expensive that European countries can only afford it if it is pooled in Nato. Such collaboration would be so much easier if full cross-border mergers were permitted. European politicians should seize the opportunity to remove the barriers obstructing mergers while the defence industry is still strong enough to compete with other suppliers. If that happened, companies such as BAe and GEC could decide in a free market whether their future is as national monoliths or international specialists with the scale to take on the best in the world.</p>

This new legislature  ruled on an amnesty which freed Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and other  organisers of armed resistance to Yeltsin's move to crush the  old Soviet-era parliament last October.    Rutskoy called for a spirit of reconciliation in Russia in a  statement faxed to Russian and foreign news agencies on  Wednesday. In the same statement he defended the armed  resistance to Yeltsin's move last autumn.</p>

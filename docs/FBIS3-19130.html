German Deputy Peter Reuschenbach greeted the rally.  Here is a report by Mimoza Cika:    [Cika] With their participation today in the protest under  the leadership of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] branch,  all Albanians who live and work in Germany showed that they are  living proof of the national and political determination and  devotion.    LKD Branch Chairman Afiz Gagica addressed the demonstrators  and stressed the motto of this protest.    Mr. Peter Reuschenbach, chairman of the parliamentary group  to the German Bundestag for Albania, also greeted the  demonstrators.    Various representatives of high-level German organizations  and bodies also greeted the rally participants. The petitions  addressed to the high-level German authorities are based on the  main demands to stop the violence and the Serbian systematic  state terror against the Albanian population in Kosova and to  prevent the eruption of an armed conflict in the Republic of  Kosova by withdrawing the armed police forces from the Republic  of Kosova. They also asked Germany and the united international  states to recognize the independence of the Republic of Kosova.</p>

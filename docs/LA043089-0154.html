			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW-KEY BUSH ABANDONS SLICK IMAGE STRATEGY  </P> <P> A few months ago, when Stephen Studdert signed on as an aide to newly elected  President Bush, he was put in charge of selecting something known in White  House jargon as "the theme of the week."  </P> <P> Studdert was supposed to sift through the President's agenda each week and pick  out a single point the White House would emphasize in everything it said and  did -- from speeches and press briefings to television appearances and "photo  opportunities."  </P> <P> The idea, developed by earlier presidents and raised to a high science by  Ronald Reagan, was to avoid internal babble and maximize the Administration's  impact on public opinion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diversity of Governing  </P> <P> Yet in the scattershot White House of George Bush, the task proved unexpectedly  tough. By the week of April 17, Studdert was about ready to give up. Surveying  the untidy bundle of unrelated matters the President considered important that  week, the only theme Studdert could come up with was no theme at all: He called  the week's schedule "the diversity of governing."  </P> <P> Studdert's experience reflects one of the most striking features of Bush's  young presidency: With little fanfare, the new chief executive and his team  have abandoned the elaborate, tightly controlled machinery developed in recent  years to project, manipulate and polish a presidential image -- machinery so  pervasive and ingrained that it came to seem an indispensable tool of national  leadership. Indeed, some considered it the soul of the presidency in the  television age.  </P> <P> Instead, Bush has returned to media-massaging techniques perfected years before  the audience of the television show "thirtysome-thing" were ever born --  inviting reporters to lunch, to play horseshoes, see a movie or coo at the  White House puppies.  </P> <P> In effect, some admirers say, Bush is posing a basic question: Can the  President of the United States really lead simply by trying to develop popular  policies -- without slick television packaging and elaborate schemes to  manipulate the news media? As a political consultant might put it, is substance  enough?  </P> <P> </P> <P> High in Opinion Polls  </P> <P> With public opinion polls showing Bush's popularity as high as 71%, the White  House argues that the approach is working. The Wall Street Journal even quoted  sources suggesting that Bush's low-tech approach was actually the height of  cunning, for it distinguished him from perceptions that Reagan was a shallow  actor.  </P> <P> But the Bush approach is not without its critics. Some question whether the  Bush team's failure to communicate its vision for the future reflects the lack  of anything to communicate.  </P> <P> "The one thing that's missing at this point in this presidency is a sense of  where this President wants to go," said Republican political analyst David  Keene of the American Conservative Union. "Being everyone's next-door neighbor  is, frankly, not sufficient for national leadership."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question Support  </P> <P> Others wonder whether Bush's aversion to grand themes and dramatic gestures  will leave him without a core of passionate supporters to fall back on if  things turn sour at home or abroad. The problem with not communicating a vision  is that it leaves you without a "political base for the long haul," said former  Reagan White House Communications Director David Gergen, now editor-at-large of  U.S. News &amp; World Report.  </P> <P> "We have seen presidents who were high up in the polls," Gergen said, "but  without a solid safety net of support there is an enormous potential to slide  very fast. . . . You need symbols, things that people can relate to."  </P> <P> Even now, he argued, people can remember moments about the Reagan era -- the  return of the hostages from Iran just after Reagan took office, his decision to  decertify the air traffic controllers union, the 40th anniversary of the  Normandy invasion. These came to represent something larger about the man and  the country.  </P> <P> While Bush has succeeded in demonstrating his warmth, Gergen thinks his  generally low-key approach may blend his message into the background. "It is  important for the White House to see presidential activities as more than  wallpaper and Muzak," he said.  </P> <P> Bush advisers profess puzzlement at such complaints.  </P> <P> "Eight years ago, the press was beating up on the White House for managing the  news," said a senior White House staff member. "Eight years later, that same  press corps is beating up on the White House for not managing the news."  </P> <P> The media tactics represented by the "theme of the week" evolved over the past  decade and more, but may have reached their zenith under Michael K. Deaver in  the early Reagan years. It was then that media strategy and tactics became  major considerations in almost every White House decision.  </P> <P> Reagan's public actions were meticulously choreographed for maximum media  impact. Moreover, to enhance White House influence over what subjects would  dominate the news, his public appearances, comments and availability were  strictly rationed and controlled so that the news media often had little choice  but to use the images and comments Deaver and his lieutenants had planned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreshadows Reagan  </P> <P> Reagan was not the first President to travel that road. Jimmy Carter brought  advertising executive Gerald Rafshoon into the White House as an adviser on  media and politics -- the so-called "Secretary of Symbolism."  </P> <P> Bush himself followed the advice of such experts during his campaign last year.  He stuck with themes carefully scripted to work well on the emotional medium of  television, such as the Pledge of Allegiance and the prison furlough program  that released convict Willie Horton.  </P> <P> But with the campaign over, Bush began to change, arguing that running for  office is different from governing.  </P> <P> In the early weeks of his presidency, advisers talked about Bush's wanting to  establish his "values" and themes. He spoke frequently about education, drug  abuse and ethics in government and business.  </P> <P> But once he had done that, even this pattern to his activities -- and thus too  the message he sought to leave with the American public -- became less clear.  </P> <P> To hear senior aides tell it, communications strategy is something that no  longer always comes up in the morning session of top staff members. Rather, it  is often catch-as-catch-can.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small-Scale Activities  </P> <P> Bush has devoted much of his schedule to small-scale activities with which he  feels comfortable: frequent trips outside of Washington that generally do not  involve major speeches, ceremonies in the Rose Garden and personal encounters  with reporters.  </P> <P> The result has been a less visible President.  </P> <P> According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington, during his  first 60 days in office, Bush received about one-half the network television  coverage Reagan received during the same period in 1981, and about 57% of the  coverage given Jimmy Carter during the first 60 days of Carter's tenure.  </P> <P> When Bush announced his much-anticipated plan for education, for instance, he  did so with only a Rose Garden ceremony at which no children were even on stage  -- and the New York Times put the story inside. When he delivered on a campaign  promise to help working parents meet child-care needs, Bush left it to  spokesman Marlin Fitzwater to disclose the details on camera.  </P> <P> Bush aides say their approach to communications is designed for the long haul.  </P> <P> First, Bush's approach fits the man. Just as the previous Administration's  media strategies were developed to take advantage of Reagan's singular talents  for delivering a script on television, Fitzwater said, "What I have tried to do  is develop techniques for communicating that take advantage of President Bush,  and they're quite different."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outlines New Approach  </P> <P> Viewing Bush as "good on his feet" and comfortable with "the give and take of  dealing with the press," Fitzwater wrote a memorandum in December outlining new  ways that the President could be accessible to the media. Since then, Bush has  used such approaches as conducting interviews with small groups of reporters,  dropping into the White House pressroom on short notice and inviting reporters  to impromptu lunches.  </P> <P> The idea, in part, was to avoid some of the episodes of the Reagan White House  that Bush had thought undignified, such as having questions shouted at the  President during photo sessions with foreign dignitaries and over the whirring  roar of a waiting helicopter.  </P> <P> Second, Bush's relatively low profile suits his more quiet and conciliatory  approach to governing.  </P> <P> Where Reagan as a Washington outsider used the club of public opinion to  pressure Congress to support often-controversial programs, Bush so far has  relied on face-to-face meetings, often in private, and usually involving  compromise. The back-room agreement to sustain aid to the Nicaraguan Contras  and the negotiations on the federal budget are two examples.  </P> <P> White House Communications Director David F. Demarest talks about the  small-scale events over time creating "a mosaic of impressions the public will  have of the presidency."  </P> <P> Or as White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu put it: "The President's agenda  has a long-term perspective in it." And he and his colleagues are certain the  public will see it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doubt Persists  </P> <P> Yet doubt persists over how well-thought-out Bush's approach to communications  really is.  </P> <P> "There was never a conscious decision made initially to present Bush  differently from President Reagan," said one senior aide privately.  </P> <P> "The communications plan for this Administration is not in the files," said  another.  </P> <P> Instead, it is a practical matter -- the only approach that Bush will allow.  And for Bush, news media manipulation is simply not a high priority.  </P> <P> He is a man, as one aide put it, with "a healthy ambivalence toward the  headlines."  </P> <P> It is no surprise. To get to the White House, this President overcame the tag  of being a wimp, a verbal bumbler and a certain loser to, at various times, Bob  Dole and Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> Like others who have entered the White House by defying the consensus, Bush has  developed a natural skepticism toward the conventional wisdom about how to  build public support through communications. Some at the senior levels at the  White House seem almost scornful of letting media strategy dictate overall  planning.  </P> <P> When asked why the President had not considered touring the devastation of the  Alaska oil spill, for instance, one senior adviser said: "I don't think he has  to embrace an oiled-up sea otter. . . . There is something tawdry about going  up there and posing with an oil spill. There is a show business aspect that has  nothing to do with cleaning it up."  </P></p>

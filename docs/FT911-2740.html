			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / De Klerk addresses British businessmen Time to invest: South Africa's President FW de Klerk told British businessmen yesterday that his country was ready politically and economically to restore full trading links with the world. He urged the 300 executives at the Confederation of British Industry to be part of the fundamental changes taking place in South Africa 'We want you to profit by what is happening,' he said. He offered the prospect of expansion to investors already in his country and invited others to share in 'the new South Africa'. Mr de Klerk was invited by the CBI to address members at the end of his week-long tour of European countries, during which he sought to encourage trade and investment and end remaining sanctions. 'The time is now, if we really wish to capitalise on the window of opportunity history has given us,' he said. 'Now is the time to invest in reform.' The audience sought assurances that South Africa would remain stable and viable as it transformed to a multi-party and multiracial system of government. The president said all parties realised there would have to be a strong economy offering jobs and prosperity for everyone. He accepted that South Africa faced a lack of skilled labour and said it would welcome immigrants with appropriate training to help economic progress.</p>

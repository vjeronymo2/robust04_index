			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Dorrell spells out lottery prospects The number of outlets selling tickets for the National Lottery, which go on sale from November 14, would rise to 40,000 from a start of 10,000, and its turnover was expected to equal that of the confectionery industry, Mr Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, told conference. He envisaged that the lottery would provide Pounds 9bn over seven years to boost expenditure on the arts, national monuments and other projects. Mr Dorrell said this demonstrated the government's commitment to developing cultural and artistic life. He condemned the 'offensive suggestion' by Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, that Buckingham Palace should be sold off, and the royal family removed to a designer palace. Mr Dorrell said this would involve divorcing the royal family from its roots, and would amount to a form of 'cultural vandalism'.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEVICES LET THE DISABLED SEE WORLD EYE TO EYE;  </P> <P> WHEELCHAIRS: EQUIPMENT THAT UNFOLDS TO ALLOW THE USER TO STAND MAY OFFER  MEDICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS BOOST SELF-ESTEEM.  </P> <P> Three months after she got out of therapy for a broken back at Newington  Children's Hospital here, Sheri Martin returned to work at Windsor Federal  Savings and Loan.  </P> <P> Martin was paralyzed from the chest down after a snowmobile crash in January,  1989. Before the accident, she was a teller at the bank. When she returned to  work in August, she rolled her wheelchair behind a desk to work as a  customer-service representative.  </P> <P> "The bank set up the desks differently for me, and they already had a  handicapped bathroom," Martin, 22, said.  </P> <P> She worked at the desk for nearly a year, but now she wants to train tellers at  the new computer terminals the bank has set up "behind the line," where tellers  wait on customers.  </P> <P> The terminals are at eye-level -- eye-level for tellers who stand up. So Martin  has to stand up, too.  </P> <P> That is what brought her to Seamus Donnellan, owner of A&amp;L Mobility in  Windsor, Conn., and distributor of wheelchairs that unfold to allow the user to  stand. After seeing a demonstration of different standing devices at the  hospital, she decided to buy Donnellan's product.  </P> <P> Like Transformers -- those children's toys that convert from a car or plane to  a robot -- the wheelchairs lose their traditional look with a tug on two  spring-loaded bars.  </P> <P> Martin first folds the padded chair arms around her chest. Then she reaches  back to grasp the two bars near the back of the chair's wheels, and tugs  gently.  </P> <P> The metal frame begins to move and change shape. Martin's tug is aided by a  gas-filled spring that resembles a miniature shock absorber. The spring helps  her push. The back of the wheelchair rises, with the seat sliding up so her  lower back rests against it.  </P> <P> The small front wheels lift off the ground, and an L-shaped stand replaces  them. The large back wheels are braked to keep Martin firmly in place.  </P> <P> She is not quite erect: She leans at a 75-degree angle, her arms resting on  what used to be the chair arms, her knees getting an extra lift from padded  braces. But a lot of her support comes the old-fashioned way: from her feet.  </P> <P> "It's not gimmickry at all," said Cindi Jones, publisher of Mainstream, a San  Diego-based magazine for consumers with disabilities. "It has medical benefits,  and there are self-esteem issues."  </P> <P> Phyllis Zlotnick of West Hartford, an advocate for the disabled, agreed: "For  multiple sclerosis and certain spinal-cord injuries, it has validity."  </P> <P> For someone paralyzed by a spine injury, standing can improve blood  circulation, lessen muscle spasms and contractions, and prevent calcium loss in  bones, or osteoporosis, which makes the bones brittle. ("I couldn't do this  with someone who had been paralyzed for 20 years. His leg bones would snap,"  Donnellan said.)  </P> <P> It also helps reduce the risk of pressure sores, once known as bed sores, which  extended sitting can produce on the behind; reduce bladder infections; and  reduce the occurrence of kidney stones.  </P> <P> As for those self-esteem issues, "If you stand up, you can look someone in the  eye," Jones said.  </P> <P> Donnellan's Lifestand, invented in France, is one of several brands in what  Jones calls "a growth industry" among the 2 million to 3 million wheelchair  users in the United States. There's also Levo U.S.A., IMEX Healthcare Inc. and  the all-electric HiRider, a $12,000 to $16,000 device that can roll you down  the street in a standing position.  </P> <P> Lifestand chairs cost $4,800 to $4,900, depending on the model and size,  Donnellan said, compared with $1,000 to $2,500 for a "standard" wheelchair.  </P> <P> Jones warned: "Disabled consumers tend to be at the mercy of their durable  medical equipment dealer." Her magazine tries to give consumers an idea of the  alternatives, she said, and has published articles comparing stand-up frames  and wheelchairs.  </P> <P> The standing wheelchairs must be prescribed by a doctor; they should not be  used if there are any cardiac or orthopedic problems or bone brittleness.  Donnellan said that 75% to 80% of the chairs are bought through health  insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and workers' compensation.  </P> <P> Devices for standing are not new: Stationary "standing frames," available for  years for residential or office use, have allowed disabled people to lift  themselves to their feet. Such frames resemble tall tables with straps or other  supports to hold a user up.  </P> <P> Although Dr. Philip Arnold, director of the Department of Rehabilitative  Medicine at Newington Children's Hospital, prescribed the chair for Martin, he  is wary of the newer devices.  </P> <P> "They're a lot more expensive and a lot more mechanically complicated than a  simple standing frame," Arnold said. "They are usually prescribed when they can  help in terms of business or the workplace."  </P> <P> They are heavier and more awkward and harder to get in and out of a car than a  lightweight chair, he said.  </P> <P> Asked about physiological benefits, he said, "There is no benefit they have for  circulation, osteoporosis or anything else that cannot be accomplished with a  lightweight wheelchair accompanied by a simple standing frame."  </P> <P> He said standing frames cost one-tenth the cost of a standing wheelchair.  </P></p>

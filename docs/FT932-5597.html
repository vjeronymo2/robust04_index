			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Price supports in EC hamper eastern reform FORMER Soviet states' plans to liberalise their farm sectors are being thwarted by the European Community's distorting policies of price supports, intervention purchasing and export subsidies, the OECD said yesterday. In its first study of the farm sector in the former planned economies of central and eastern Europe and China the OECD is disturbed by 'back tracking' from liberalisation, particularly in east Europe and the former Soviet bloc. This is due to a desire to harmonise farm policies with those of the EC, with which most of the countries seek eventual membership, and short-term aid to farmers to help them through disruptions as economies are restructured. 'The difficulty of removing these short-term policies once this process is complete has mostly been overlooked,' the study says. It describes a big growth in subsistence farming on inefficient small farms as unemployment soars. At the same time, severe drought across parts of central and eastern Europe in 1992 damaged farm output - grain production fell by 30 per cent from 1991 to 58m tonnes. In the former Soviet Union, the OECD reports a 10 per cent fall in agriculture production last year, largely due to a collapse in livestock production. Grain output nevertheless rose by 20 per cent to 194m tonnes following a collapse in 1991, making the farm sector less traumatised than the economy at large, which contracted by 18 per cent. The organisation predicts that the former Soviet Union will continue to import grains, sugar and oilseeds this year although imports 'will increasingly depend on the availability of western credits and assistance packages'. The OECD saw the fall in livestock production as an opportunity to rationalise an inefficient sector, where feed grain use is at virtually the same level as in the US but producing a quarter of the meat. China's farmers face different challenges, with natural disasters and a preference for investing in rural housing rather than farming weakening the production system. Farming generated 4m new jobs during 1991 and 1992, the OECD says. This was insufficient to cope with 11m people pouring on to the rural job market, and left the country with a 'floating population' between urban and rural areas of about 70m. The OECD predicts that China will remain a significant wheat importer, but notes that grain imports have fallen from 11m tonnes in 1989 to 'probably less than 3m tonnes in 1992'.</p>

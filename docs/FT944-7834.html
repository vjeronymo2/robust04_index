			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Shake-up of accounting rules urged More than 90 per cent of companies could be released from having to follow accounting standards under a radical plan published yesterday. The accountancy profession's working party on standards, commissioned by the Accounting Standards Board, said small companies should be exempt from most rules. The working party suggests in a consultative document that future accounting standards should not apply to small companies unless a specific reason is given by the regulators. If the document wins wide approval it will be submitted to the standards board. Exemption for small companies would represent the most radical reform of the scope of accounting standards for half a century. While the proposal may be popular with small companies and their auditors, the response from other interested parties, such as bankers, regulators, and the Inland Revenue, may not be as supportive. Mr Ken Wild, chairman of the working party set up under the auspices of the six professional bodies, said: 'The working party is suggesting that the methods of reporting that have been developed as wholly appropriate to large companies may sometimes be inappropriate for small companies. 'We hope that if we relieve such companies of the need to follow some standards we will improve the way in which they communicate what has happened to their businesses.' Mr Wild said many accounting standards were now incorporated in the Companies Act. More complex standards were a burden which often prevented small companies from communicating clearly through their accounts. The working party's research identified costs carried by small companies as a result of standards, including audit fees and the loss of competitive advantage due to the need to disclose information not already public. The consultative document suggests that small companies should be as defined under the Companies Act - a business should not exceed two or more of three criteria: a turnover of Pounds 2.8m, a balance sheet total (assets) of Pounds 1.4m, or an average of 50 employees. The document suggests that small companies should comply with five standards  -as opposed to four suggested in an earlier leaked version of the report: those covering government grants, stock and long-term contracts, research and development, post balance-sheet events, and contingencies. The consultation period will run to the end of February next year. Exemptions from Standards. PO Box 433, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ. Pounds 5.</p>

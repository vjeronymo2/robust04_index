According to Boris Vostry,  company vice president for foreign operations, Kozeny can  directly influence events in the company without having to  change the members in its supreme bodies and without being a  member of the board.    Even after his resignation from the board, Kozeny remained  in  the five-member executive committee, which operatively controls  Harvard Capital and Consulting.    "Harvard is Kozeny's family business, and speculations about  his position are therefore irrelevant," Vostry said. The fact  that Viktor Kozeny resigned from the Harvard Capital and  Consulting board has changed nothing regarding his position of  majority owner of the firm, Vostry added. Officially, it is  impossible to precisely verify the property situation in Harvard  funds because their shares are not tradable, and this  information is protected by law. According to a source from  another privatization fund, who did not want his name to be  revealed because he wanted to avoid possible problems, Kozeny  owns the majority of the shares, and another part (of the  company) is controlled by his grandfather, Frantisek Stehlik.    Kozeny, he affirms, has resigned from the board for health  reasons. Ivan Kralik, a former employee of the Presidential  Office of Husak [Czechoslovak president under the communist  regime] and a member of the company's board, has been entrusted  with chairing the board. Kralik also worked at the Castle for a  certain time after Havel assumed office.</p>

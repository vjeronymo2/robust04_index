			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares on the </F> occasion of being officially proclaimed the winner of the 8 May  presidential elections at the Atlapa Convention Center in Panama  City--live]    [Text] Members of the National Vote-Counting Board,  magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, candidates here with us  this evening, ladies and gentlemen:    Regardless of who has been the protagonist, Panama's  democracy and the people of Panama very much wanted an event  such as today's, an event in which a group of trustworthy  citizens have clearly confirmed the verdict of the polls.    In Panama, thanks to men and women like you, the democratic  consolidation process, which in other regions takes decades, has  been accomplished in a very short period of time and has been  built on very solid bases. This is the conclusion of an effort  that has earned the praise of the foreign media and has been a  surprise for some of our own fellow citizens.    Disputes, recriminations, confrontations, and arguments are  now behind us, and behind us are also, let's hope forever,  political campaigns stained by violence and elections blemished  by doubts.    The country began to change beginning early Monday morning,  not because one or another candidate had secured the majority of  the votes of the Panamanians, but because everybody accepted  unaffectedly and like a gentleman the results of the previous  day.    Those of us who have acquired the commitment of promoting  reconciliation in the country, accept it with joy but calmly,  enthusiastically but without any intention of boasting before  others about this privilege from the voters.    I must also say, and let this be a public tribute of  respect,  that our adversaries exhibited the patriotic altruism and the  political generosity of closing, on the elections night, the  wounds that the political confrontation could have opened.    They also deserve our homage. [applause]    In January 1990, taking a step that at that time was not  understood, I visited President Endara to express our  dissatisfaction with some measures that had been adopted. I told  him that I categorically would initiate an opposition to his  government. He told me that during his mandate, a democratic  opposition would enjoy broad guarantees.    Today I must acknowledge, very sincerely, that I opposed his  government and that President Endara showed respect for the  opposition. This acknowledgment is necessary today because all  of us have witnessed his effort to pave the road to an orderly  transfer of power.    I cannot mention all the persons who made the democratic  fiesta we now enjoy possible. But it would be unfair of me to  fail to point out the exemplary behavior of the Public Force,  yesterday arbiter of politics, and now the guarantor of  constitutionality. The Justice and Peace Commission and the  electoral delegates deserve the same public admiration. The  respect they earned and the impartiality they exhibited were  enough to quench infrequent outbreaks of violence and to  guarantee to the citizens that this electoral struggle would see  only three weapons: ideas, enthusiasm, and votes.    Since all the citizens, regardless of age or sex, were the  true heroes of this democratic event, I want to conclude my  statement by paying homage of respect and admiration to the  three forefathers who, to the satisfaction and pride of  everybody, comprise, and let us hope, will continue to comprise,  the Electoral Tribunal. [applause]    They made us get used to listening to a song whose words are  now a beautiful truth: We are the builders of the fatherland!    Thank you! [applause]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429)]    [Text] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui went on a "holiday  diplomacy" tour during the Spring Festival season. Under the  pretext of "going on holiday," he took dozens of senior  officials with him and visited three countries in Southeast  Asia, namely, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Though  all the host countries had cut diplomatic relations with Taiwan  and established diplomatic relations with Beijing, and  undertaken to adopt the "one China" policy, President Ramos,  President Suharto, and King of Thailand Phumiphon went so far as  to ignore Beijing's objection and insisted on meeting with Li  Teng-hui, making Beijing very frustrated. According to informed  sources in Beijing, in order to prevent the spread of Taipei's  "holiday diplomacy," the CPC authorities have instructed  relevant departments to work out countermeasures, which should  include the review of its reunification tactics.  <H3>  Li Kills Three Birds With One Stone by Carrying Out "Holiday  Diplomacy" </H3>   Informed sources said that a recent "restricted publication"  circulating among high-ranking cadres ran a commentary on Li  Teng- hui's "holiday diplomacy." This commentary believes that  Li Teng- hui's "holiday diplomacy" is a materialization of  Taiwan's "southward policy" (formulated to encourage Taiwan  businessmen making investments in the mainland to channel their  funds to Southeast Asia, in a bid to break the mainland's  blockade with economy as an open sesame and expand Taiwan's  diplomatic space) and an implementation of the "wild geese  formation theory" (a Japanese economist's theory highly  recommended by Li Teng-hui, which maps out an Asian economic  scenario with Japan, the most advanced country, in the lead,  followed by the "four little dragons" and then Southeast Asian  countries, with the Chinese mainland and North Korea taking up  the rear). To conduct "holiday diplomacy" toward Southeast Asia  had been decided by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee  last December according to a motion made by Lien Chan, premier  of the Executive Yuan, for a shift in diplomatic strategy. Lien  Chan pointed out: South East Asian nations are now in need of  money and technology, and Taiwan is capable of providing various  kinds of assistance in this respect. "Taiwan has an exchange  reserve of $80 billion. Can we not knock open the gate to  Southeast Asia with it?" He argued that the time is ripe and  Taiwan should not continue to give up what is within reach and  seek after something unreachable, but should switch over from  marching into Latin America to marching into Southeast Asia  (countries surrounding China). Lien Chan not only put forward  the motion, but also practiced it. He took the lead and went to  Malaysia and Singapore to conduct "holiday diplomacy" toward the  end of last year and at the beginning of this year, to open a  way for Li Teng-hui and gain some experience. This effort made  possible the instant success of Li Teng-hui's "holiday  diplomacy" during the Spring Festival season, which fulfilled  the purpose of "killing three birds with one stone:" It  expanded headroom for Taiwan's diplomatic activities in the  international arena, opened up new prospects for Taiwan business  investment and development, and reduced Taiwan business  dependence on the mainland market to prevent the increase of  such dependence that might put Taiwan authorities in a passive  position politically.  <H5>  Host Countries Ignore China's Objection </H5>   The sources continued: The CPC authorities showed grave  concern over Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" from the very  beginning. Before Li went on the "holiday," the Chinese foreign  ministry spokesman said: Taiwan authorities are attempting to  develop "substantive relations" with some countries on the  pretense of "holiday-making," trying to create "two Chinas" in  the international arena. The Chinese Government and the Chinese  people are firmly against it and will never accept it. If the  governments of the countries that have diplomatic relations with  China accept Li Teng-hui's visit, regardless of the capacity and  way in which this visit will be made, it will severely hurt the  feelings of the Chinese people and impair the friendly and  cooperative relations the countries concerned have maintained  with China. Obviously, China hoped that the countries concerned  would treasure their relations with China as their priority and  guard against the political stratagem of the Taiwan authorities  to avoid disrupting and damaging their friendly and cooperative  relations with China that had been hard to come by. But the  host countries ignored China's statement and went ahead to  receive Li Teng-hui.    After Li went on his "holiday," the Chinese Foreign Ministry  spokesman again said: "The so-called 'holiday' diplomacy of Li  Teng-hui is in essence an attempt to practice `two Chinas' or  `one China, one Taiwan.' Practicing `two Chinas' or 'one China,  one Taiwan' is a violation of the fundamental interests of all  Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, and is therefore  doomed to failure. Countries that have diplomatic relations  with China should strictly observe the principles of the  communiques signed when such relations with China were  established and the undertakings they made at the time. Any  breach of the principle of diplomatic relations and the  undertakings given at the time will naturally have a damaging  effect on bilateral relations."    In the meantime, China canceled the arrangements for a  National People's Congress delegation to visit the Philippines  and Thailand, annulled an agreement on the import of timber from  Indonesia, and froze the anti-tank weapons to be exported to  Thailand. But the host countries turned a deaf ear and a blind  eye to it. Moreover, THE NATION, an English language paper of  Thailand which had enjoyed quite a good relationship with China,  published a special article entitled "Risking the Danger of  `Holiday Diplomacy'" on 20 February. The article pointed out:  All Southeast Asian nations understand that reiterating the  "one China policy" every evening may ensure a good night's  sleep, but it does not give a "full stomach." The special  article quoted a senior official of the Thai foreign ministry as  saying that this is a "win-win" situation: Taiwan may declare  to the world that it has conquered the last wall of the  Southeast Asian nations, while Thailand may reap benefits from  Taiwan investment.    The attitude of the host countries inspired Li Teng-hui. He  was determined to carry on with "holiday diplomacy." Li has set  the next targets of "holiday diplomacy" as India, Bangladesh,  and Burma and then Japan and the United States. There are  political personalities in both the United States and Japan  saying that Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" is acceptable. In  view of this, when he was visiting Japan in late February,  Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji issued a warning in Tokyo: "The  Taiwan issue is a very sensitive question between China and  Japan. I believe the Japanese Government will observe the  principle of the Sino-Japanese joint declaration and will never  do anything that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people."  But how the future unfolds remains to be seen.    The sources also said: Because Li Teng-hui's "holiday  diplomacy" came to the fore after Beijing took the initiative to  give in and make it possible for the "Tang-Chiao meeting" to  reach an understanding, the CPC finds itself in a state of  attending to one thing while losing sight of another and feels  that it has been misled by the "Tang-Chiao meeting."  Furthermore, the three countries playing host to Li Teng-hui  went so far as to go their own way and ignore Beijing's  objection, which has deeply convinced the CPC authorities that  they cannot change the predicament they are in if they fail to  break "holiday diplomacy." Therefore, CPC authorities have  instructed the relevant departments to work out a  countermeasure. Some think tanks based in big cities, such as  the Institute for International Strategic Studies, have recently  recommended tactics for dealing with Li Teng-hui's "holiday  diplomacy," including short-term and long-term actions.  <H5>  Think Tanks Recommend Countermeasures </H5>   The proposed short-term actions include the above-mentioned  objections and cancellations of visits.    The long-term actions refer to the formulation of some  proposals for dealing with Taiwan and Hong Kong [as published]  and solving the problem thoroughly.    One of the proposals is to use military means to attain  reunification. The provider of this proposal believes that  Taiwan is a free trade zone with scarce resources and relies on  importation for raw materials. Once a blockade is imposed at  sea, Taiwan's economy will dry up within three months. The  purpose of the blockade is to push Taiwan into talks with the  mainland on reunification. If the talks are held when the  blockade is imposed, the process of reunification can be greatly  shortened. If this move is made after Hong Kong and Macao  return to China, the reunification of the two sides may come  true at the turn of century. Then one can say the 21th century  will be the century of Chinese people!    The second proposal is: first economy, then politics;  first nongovernmental contacts, then official contacts.  The key point here is to create a situation in which Taiwan's  economy depends on the mainland and its politics cannot avoid  being swayed by it.    The third proposal is to take both political and  military measures at the same time. That means  strengthening dialogue in politics while looking for an  opportunity in military sense (e.g. taking the island back if  and when Taiwan declares independence). It is unwise to wait  till the advanced weapons that the United States and France sell  to Taiwan have arrived, otherwise it will be even more difficult.    Taiwan studies experts in Beijing pointed out: Though CPC  authorities have so far adhered to the stand and principle of  "one China, coexistence of two systems, high degree of autonomy,  and peaceful reunification" on the Taiwan issue, they have never  promised not to use force of arms. It is believed that the  shock caused by Li Teng-hui's "holiday diplomacy" will spur the  CPC to further review its new tactics for reunification. This  is a noteworthy new development.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Paulo Chipilika by </F> announcer Mariana Ribeiro in Luanda; date not given--live or  recorded]    [Excerpt] [Ribeiro] Justice Minister Paulo Chipilika  recently visited the United States. He will talk to us about  his visit. Minister, a very good evening.    [Chipilika] A very good evening.    [Ribeiro] What made you visit the United States, and what  was  the outcome of your visit?    [Chipilika] Good evening, viewers. I would first like to  thank TPA for giving me this opportunity to talk about my visit  to the United States.    First, I would like to note that I was invited by two  agencies -- namely, USIA, the United States Information Agency  [preceding four words in English], and the Afro-American  Institute. The invitation came through the U.S. Embassy in  Luanda. With permission from his excellency the prime minister,  I visited the United States for two weeks. The main goal of my  visit was to see how the U.S. judiciary functions. I can say it  was an extraordinary experience from all aspects. I was able to  see a judiciary with prestige and reputation, a well-organized  and independent judiciary. In fact, this is enshrined in the  U.S. Constitution. The people we spoke to, either from  district, state, or federal courts as well as the Supreme Court  [preceding two words in English] stressed the independence of  the U.S. judiciary from the legislative and executive branches.    We visited prisons in Washington and in Alexandria,  Virginia.  We also exchanged views about our intention to establish a  National Institute for Judiciary Studies, INEJ, and the training  of magistrates for the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney  General and Public Prosecutor.    We were in Atlanta, Georgia, where we visited a number of  prisons. We were in Springfield, Illinois, and in San  Francisco, California, where we visited district and federal  courts. We went to the Law College of Stanford University. We  were also in (?New York). So, those were the goals of our visit.    [Ribeiro] Your visit suggests that changes have been  introduced within your ministry.    [Chipilika] It is obvious that we cannot....[pauses] We are  a  new democracy and, as we have stated time and again, the Angolan  judiciary was negatively affected over the last few years. But  there are common aspects. We have been calling for the  independence of the Angolan judiciary. We are in favor of a  dignified judiciary and that calls for suitable legislation and  a sound remuneration. We saw that in the United States the  judiciary is the foundation of democracy, and magistrates in  that country are well remunerated--sometimes better than state  governors. We were told that that was designed to prevent any  form of corruption because there can be no justice with  corruption. [passage omitted]</p>

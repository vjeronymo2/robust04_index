			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> WAREHOUSE PROJECT AGREEMENT REACHED  </P> <P> After a lengthy dispute with area residents, Alloy Die Casting has been granted  permission to build a $4-million building at 6560 Caballero Ave.  </P> <P> Mayor Donald L. Bone praised Alloy representatives and residents of the nearby  Poet housing development for reaching compromises involving building height,  landscaping and operating hours.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of the way this situation has been handled by all parties,"  Bone said.  </P> <P> Originally, Alloy wanted the warehouse height to be 32 feet, 5 inches, but  agreed to reduce the height to 30 feet, 3 inches. Alloy also agreed to set the  building eight feet back from the rear property line and surround the  70,000-square-foot building with trees.  </P> <P> Construction is expected to begin this spring.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast] </F>   [Text] Here in Mexico, there are many reactions to the bill  sent to the U.S. Congress by Democrats David Bornier [name as  heard] and Robert Torricelli. The bill states, among other  things, that the U.S. Congress should support political reforms  in Mexico in view of the upcoming 21 August elections. The two  Democrats also proposed the presence of international observers.  I repeat, this bill has sparked a number of reactions in Mexico  by Mexican senators, Congress leader Maria de los Angeles  Moreno, and Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo. Elvia Moreno  has the story:    [Begin recording] [Moreno] Government Secretary Carpizo  today  rejected the idea of foreign intervention in Mexico's internal  affairs by saying only Mexicans will manage and supervise the 21  August federal elections. He was interviewed after he opened  the Radio Broadcasting Commission Production Center of the  Federal Electoral Institute [IFE]. The center was designed to  support political parties in their mission to broadcast and  spread the political culture. He stressed the following:    [Carpizo] As a Mexican, I reject any foreign intervention in  Mexico's internal affairs. As for the elections, it is very  clear that only Mexicans will manage and supervise the electoral  process. We will let no foreigner intervene for any reason  whatsoever. I am sure we Mexicans are united on this, for we  believe in sovereignty and nationalism. The only thing these  U.S. congressmen will achieve is to unite us even further. The  final outcome will be that all Mexicans, as one entity, will not  accept any interventionist principle.    [Moreno] This is how the government secretary replied to the  interventionist attempt by two U.S. Democrats to observe the  Mexican electoral process.    As for the debate on electoral registers between Samuel Del  Villar, representative of the Party of the Democratic Revolution  at the IFE, and Carlos Almada, Federal Voters Registry director  general, Secretary Carpizo pointed out that the interest shown  by Mexicans on the electoral lists reveals the citizens'  determination to be better acquainted with electoral issues.    Carpizo also noted that the National Radio and Television  Chamber is in charge of making the technical preparations to  hold the electoral registry debate, whose date and place have  yet to be determined.

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Wellcome may scale back share offer to under Pounds 3bn WELLCOME, the UK drugs company, will today be advised to keep the size of its planned international share offer at the lower end of expectations. As a result, the offer may seek to raise between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 3bn, rather than a possible Pounds 4bn. While Wellcome rejects any comparison between itself and the GPA Group, the Irish aircraft leasing company forced last week to abandon an Dollars 800m (Pounds 432m) international share offer because of poor demand, the UK group's advisers are determined to avoid being over-confident by offering too many shares. Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of Wellcome, has said it planned to reduce its holding by selling between 25 per cent and 48.6 per cent of the company's shares. Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank which is global co-ordinator for the Wellcome sale, will today recommend the company to be cautious. Mr Laurence Banks, deputy chairman of Robert Fleming, said yesterday: 'We are moving towards the lower end of what the trust has said it is planning to sell. One thing we are not going to do is to announce the sale of 48.6 per cent.' Under the terms of issue, it could be increased by about 10 per cent should demand warrant it. Mr Banks added: 'It is better to build up the size of the issue than to be over-confident.' At today's meeting of lead managers, brokers to the sale, which have gauged interest worldwide, will report encouraging signs from institutional shareholders. But one broker explained: 'GPA's advisers also expressed interest at this stage which obviously makes one nervous. I firmly believe the expression of intent to buy from institutional shareholders is serious but it would be wrong to be over-confident and issue too many shares.' As a secondary offering, Wellcome is being priced against an existing share quote. GPA's pricing was more difficult. Advisers to the sale would also feel more comfortable with a smaller issue because they are determined to maximise the price received by the charity. The shares go on sale by tender offer on July 6. The only special deals will be certain priority arrangements for existing shareholders and early applicants. New structures that keep stags at bay, Page 18</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Leading Article: Old wine in new bottles THE NEW French government's policy statement, presented by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, to parliament on Thursday, was intended to herald an era of 'reform and renewal' after years of Socialist mismanagement. Yet the economic policies announced by Mr Balladur, apart from a privatisation programme, are not very different from those of his Socialist predecessor. That, after the electorate's clear vote in favour of change, is the most significant feature of the current French situation. The political consensus on close links with Germany within a European Monetary Union is now so complete that a new government has little flexibility in its choice of economic policies. Mr Balladur's declaration that the preservation of the current parity between the franc and the D-Mark, the so-called franc fort policy, remains an absolute priority, is tantamount to an admission that the Bundesbank holds the key to France's economic prosperity in the coming months. Economic recovery in France, which is expected to experience negative growth this year, is dependent on lower French interest rates. Given the franc fort policy, that will be allowed to happen only if the Bundesbank leads the way more decisively than it has done so far in reducing interest rates. Nor can a substantial fall in the exceptionally high level of unemployment, now exceeding 3m, or 10.6 per cent of the active population, be expected until such a recovery takes place. Paris-Bonn co-operation It is clearly with an eye to future Franco-German co-operation within Emu that the prime minister announced plans to make the Bank of France more independent, though the extent of that independence remains unclear. In France, the governorship of the central bank is traditionally held by former treasury officials, so the government's grip on the bank's policies will certainly remain greater than that of the Bonn government over the Bundesbank. Mr Balladur, however, hopes that, once both central banks are able to talk to each other as independent equals, the Bank of France will have a much greater influence on German interest rates than it has now. That is by no means a forgone conclusion. The Bundesbank's stubborness in defending purely German interests should not be underestimated, as its recent interest rate policy has demonstrated only too clearly. In spite of his generally moderate and conciliatory tone, Mr Balladur fiercely defended France's national interests in the Gatt trade negotiations, particularly in the agricultural field. Stressing that France had no intention of losing its place as the world's second largest exporter of farm products, the prime minister demanded that agricultural problems should not be singled out from other issues in the talks. Uruguay Round His emphasis on the harm that had been done to French agriculture by the reform of the European Community's common farm policy and on the further damage that the Gatt talks could cause, do not appear to bode well for either the Uruguay Round or relations between France and some other EC members, such as Britain. Yet it was significant that he stopped short of demanding a renegotiation of the CAP, calling merely for adequate compensation for farmers in return for price cuts. The widely forecast clash within the EC on this problem may thus still be avoided. Mr Balladur was given a standing ovation by the conservative-dominated parliament, in spite of his Churchillian warning that it would take five years of blood, sweat and tears to put France back on its feet. But the government's problem is that the electoral calendar to which it has to work does not give it that long. The next presidential election is only two years away. Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader and presidential candidate, for one, will want to see results much earlier to boost his prospects. If the Bundesbank does not come to the rescue fairly soon, the political pressures to abandon the central plank of Mr Balladur's economic policy, the franc fort, and to go for growth might thus become irresistible. It is within the next five months, rather than the next five years, that the die will be cast.</p>

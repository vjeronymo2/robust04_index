			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / South African reform talks likely to resume 'very soon' EFFORTS to end the deadlock in South Africa's constitutional talks are expected to resume 'very soon', Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, said yesterday. Although Mr Mandela, speaking in Oslo at the start of a visit to Scandinavia, expressed optimism about the outcome, an early breakthrough seems unlikely. A wide gap emerged between the two main parties attending the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for negotiations, which ended its second formal round of talks on Saturday. Hopes are now pinned on Codesa's multi-party management committee, which has been given a three-week target by the convention to resolve the impasse. The committee will resume talks on the creation of an interim government and interim constitution, as well as on the principles of a permanent constitution to be drawn up by an elected national assembly. Mr Mandela, stressed at the weekend that this must be a package agreement: 'There can be no question of installing transitional executive committees until there is clear agreement on the next phase,' he said. The government's plan, he said, was to 'create an interim government which would be made irremovable except by an excessively high majority'. The two-day Codesa session, the culmination of months of preparation, had been in danger of collapse on Friday. The ANC had rejected government demands for what amounted to giving whites, in alliance with other minority parties, a veto in a post-apartheid constitution. The government also called for a decentralised administration that would give wide autonomy to regional and local authorities, a structure that would also favour minority parties. At Saturday's closing session, President FW de Klerk angrily denied what he called 'accusations and innuendos that the government promotes continued minority domination or privilege'. But sceptical ANC officials pointed to a passage in the same speech in which Mr de Klerk spoke of the 'reality of South Africa', and referred to 'the concern in the hearts of specific language groups, cultural groups, interest groups and regions who wish to be assured that the space in which they live will be safe and protected'. The decision to authorise the management committee to continue talks ensures that the negotiating process remains alive, with all 19 parties at the convention expressing their support for Codesa. But the predicament of the ANC - frustrated by the slow pace of negotiations yet the seeing no immediate alternative - was illustrated by sharply contrasting comments on Saturday by Mr Mandela. In his final address from the floor, the ANC leader said: 'We have been able to save Codesa and the peace process. We are going back home full of strength and hope.' Less than an hour later, his assessment had changed markedly. He told a press conference: 'Despite all the hard preparatory work put in, nothing concrete has emerged. The negotiation process has stalled.' A damaging fall, Page 17</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> INMATE RELEASED IN RACISM-TAINTED CASE  </P> <P> Death Row inmate Clarence Brandley was freed on bond from the Ellis 1 Unit  prison in Huntsville, Tex., one month after an appeals court threw out his  conviction on charges of raping and killing a teen-ager in a case tainted by  racism. Brandley's release came after a state judge in Conroe, Tex., set his  bond at $75,000 and one month after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals threw  out Brandley's capital murder conviction. Brandley's attorneys had offered  evidence that police and Montgomery County prosecutors had set out to prove  that Brandley, the only black janitor at Conroe High School was guilty rather  than seeking the young white woman's killer.  </P></p>

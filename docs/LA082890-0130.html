			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4 SUITORS SCAN BOOKS AS SALE OF MERCURY NEARS  </P> <P> Federal regulators are preparing to sell Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and  sources on Monday said that at least four potential bidders are currently  reviewing the books of the $2-billion institution.  </P> <P> Industry sources said the suitors include Security Pacific National Bank of Los  Angeles, Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly Hills, American Savings Bank  of Irvine and Santa Monica-based First Federal Savings Bank of California.  </P> <P> Anthony Scalzi, western regional director of the Resolution Trust Corp., the  federal agency charged with overseeing the sale of government-run S&amp;Ls,  would not identify the potential bidders but said several major California  banks and S&amp;Ls are actively pursuing acquisition of Mercury.  </P> <P> "We hope to have a deal done before the end of September," he said.  </P> <P> Spokespersons for potential bidders declined comment, but at least three of the  four companies identified by sources have been active in the acquisition arena  in recent months.  </P> <P> Because of the growing number of S&amp;L seizures under the tough new financial  standards imposed by Congress in 1989, regulators are attempting to speed up  the sales process.  </P> <P> Mercury, which was declared insolvent in February, is just one of 18 California  S&amp;Ls put up for sale since June. If it is sold as early as next month, it  would be one of the quickest sales under RTC management.  </P> <P> With its 24 branches and loyal customer base, Mercury would make a good  addition to many major institutions' network of offices, financial institutions  consultant Edward Carpenter, head of the Southport/Carpenter Group in Santa  Ana, suggested.  </P> <P> Carpenter said several of his firm's large banking and S&amp;L clients are  among the institutions negotiating to acquire Mercury's branches, deposits and  some of its assets.  </P> <P> In an S&amp;L sale, the government typically retains the assets that got the  S&amp;L in trouble -- typically loans in default, repossessed real estate and  hard-to-sell high-yield corporate bonds.  </P> <P> Mercury, which was founded in 1964 and had grown to nearly $5 billion in assets  in the mid-1980s, was declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators in  February after posting a loss of nearly $40 million for 1989. At the time,  Mercury had about $2.2 billion in assets and $1.8 billion in deposits.  </P> <P> The thrift's problems didn't come from the insider abuses and speculative  investing policies that led many S&amp;Ls to ruin. Instead, the losses that ate  up its capital came mainly from two large commercial loans that went into  default last year and from accounting changes under the new federal financial  rules.  </P> <P> So while Mercury's capital was below the minimum required by law when it was  taken over, it was in much better financial shape than many other S&amp;Ls that  have been seized. That, Carpenter said, makes it an attractive acquisition  target.  </P> <P> Of the four institutions known to be interested, Great Western has been the  most aggressive in seeking to grow through acquisitions. The company, already  the 21st-largest financial institution in California, recently acquired a  number of branches on the west coast of Florida, spokeswoman Lynn Taylor said.  </P> <P> In May, Great Western acquired 13 Florida branches of Carteret Savings Bank of  Morristown, N.J., for a premium of $26.5 million. The branches had $700 million  in deposits.  </P> <P> A month later, Great Western bought 71 branches of CenTrust Savings Bank in  Miami for a premium of $61 million and 18 branches of the Gibraltar Savings  Bank of Florida, with deposits of $700 million, for a premium of $3.75 million.  </P> <P> At the end of June, Great Western had $39 billion in assets. For the six months  ended June 30, the company had net income of $152 million, compared to $109  million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Taylor said Great Western's acquisition strategy is to target markets with  growth potential in which the company is not represented and markets, such as  Orange County, where it can gain economies of scale from advertising.  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp., the Los Angeles-based parent of Security Pacific  National Bank and the state's fourth-largest financial institution, also has  been looking for acquisitions among troubled thrifts, spokesman Chuck Lemoine  said.  </P> <P> The company acquired 83 branches of Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan in June,  paying a premium of $141 million and acquiring assets of $5 billion.  </P> <P> Security Pacific has assets of $94.5 billion and reported net income of $383  million for the six months ended June 30.  </P> <P> American Savings Bank in Irvine has just entered the buyout business. The  company, acquired by the Robert M. Bass Group in December, 1988, for $500  million in capital and $1.7 billion in government assistance, in June acquired  two branches of Huntington Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> American Savings paid a premium of $1.5 million for Huntington Federal, which  had deposits of $112.7 million. The privately owned American Savings has assets  of $16 billion and reported net income of $214.2 million for 1989, spokeswoman  Dianne Nelson said.  </P> <P> First Fed Financial Corp., the parent of First Federal Bank of California,  could not be reached for comment. The company is the eighth-largest financial  institution in the state.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica-based firm reported net income of $7.1 million for the second  quarter ended June 30, up 73% over the same period last year. At the end of  1989, the company had $2.6 billion in assets and 15 branches.  </P></p>

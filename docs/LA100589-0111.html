			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> NEW LIBRARY HAS OLD TOUCH  </P> <P> A nine-week renovation project at Pasadena's Central Library downtown has  yielded a return to the past and a technological step forward.  </P> <P> With $2.4 million raised by the Pasadena Public Library Foundation, the library  was closed while workers removed light fixtures from the 1960s and shelving in  two rooms from the 1950s.  </P> <P> In their place went brass ceiling lights, reproductions of the original  fixtures when the library first opened in 1927, and dark-stained wooden shelves  in the two rooms matching the older shelving in the rest of the library.  </P> <P> The historically accurate touches were complemented with a computerized card  catalogue system and computer terminals recessed in the circulation desk. A  security system at the entryway was also installed and concealed in wood  paneling.  </P> <P> "We were trying to provide the most current technology but not in contrast with  the building itself," said librarian Victoria Johnson.  </P></p>

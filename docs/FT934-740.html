			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Building societies rap regulator Building societies have clashed with their regulator over the way in which the Cadbury code of corporate governance should apply to them. Draft guidance from the Building Societies Commission has been severely criticised by many societies. They say it goes beyond the recommend-ations put forward by the Cadbury committee - which in any case were intended for public limited companies - and fails to take into account their other regulatory and statutory obligations. More than a quarter of societies, including some of the largest, have channelled their complaints through the Building Societies Association, which responded to the draft guidance last week. Its comments reflected concern that the guidance did not take account of the different characteristics of the full range of societies, from smallest to largest. The association said that the commission's plans exceeded the Cadbury code in, for example, requiring that boards include at least one member with relevant professional expertise to direct a society's non-core activities, such as commercial lending or a treasury operation. The proposed guidance, issued as a draft prudential note, has also revived the recent argument between societies and the commission over the way in which it makes its recommend-ations. Prudential notes have a particular status in the way that building societies are regulated. Any society that does not comply with such a note normally has to explain itself to the commission, and might also find its credit rating affected. Some society chief executives have already criticised the commission for adopting too detailed and prescriptive an approach, for example in its draft prudential note on lending. Among other criticised aspects of the draft note on corporate governance were the proposals that societies should meet more extensive reporting requirements, and that audit committees should be made up entirely of non-executive directors. Societies said that requiring them to give details such as the term and notice periods of service contracts and pension arrangements for directors was undesirable. They argued that this would place them in a different regime from the one proposed by the Cadbury code or the one in force under Stock Exchange requirements. They also said that their audit committees performed a different role from companies' audit committees. Since they were primarily about inspection and control systems, it was right that chief executives should be able to be involved in their work.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1645 GMT on 22 March carries the  "Filatov Explains" program consisting of a 10-minute recorded  interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the president's  administration, with an unnamed interviewer. Filatov says that  81 decrees and instructions have been signed by the president  over the past week. He elaborates on three of these -- the  decree of 17 March on an increase in compensation payments for  caregivers, the draft law on additions to the law on pensions,  and the decree on citizenship status.    The interviewer then asks the "question of the week" on  media  reports of a "coup d'etat" during the president's vacation and  speculation on his health. Filatov says he doesn't regard these  matters separately but sees them as links in a chain. It all  began with the amnesty and the build-up of an opposition to the  president and his policies. "This became particularly manifest  this week by a whole number of factors after the president first  presented his message on strengthening the state, and especially  after the president came out with his major initiative -- one  that we have been waiting for a long time -- the creation of  civic accord, on the basis of which we would be able to embark  clearly on normal economic reforms. Against the background of  all this it was clearly necessary for some people to show their  particular stand, their particular position, and I don't believe  that this happened by chance."    Asked about Yeltsin's health, Filatov replies: "Quite  normal. I have already said that I think that these stores are  not by chance. Reports have been coming in that the president  has been up in a helicopter, and one could have shown him  playing tennis, but, unfortunately, the weather stepped in and  prevented it."    Regarding the scenario of an alleged plot, Filatov says that  some kind of new structure of a coalition, also calling for  accord, is apparently being created, but there cannot be two  "accords" in society. "If you look at it, then I think all of  this has been organized by one center, one group -- an  opposition group of course -- and one can see a certain attempt  to create an unpleasant atmosphere of fear and mistrust, and I  think one cannot love one's people very much to bring them to  such a situation."    The interviewer asks Filatov if media talk about possible  early elections is all part of the same chain. Filatov replies  that some sociologists are saying that this would be the best  time for Rutskoy to become president. Filatov does not think  that Rutskoy is ready to become head of state.</p>

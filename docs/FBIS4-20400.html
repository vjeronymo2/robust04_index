			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Ling (7559 1545): "Gold, Lifting the Veil </F> of Mystery"]    [Text] Taking a casual stroll along city streets, what one  sees everywhere rising like bamboo shoots after a spring rain,  in addition to sumptuous hotels and restaurants, seems to be  numbers of resplendent gold and silver shops. Incomplete  statistics for a large northern city show it currently having  over 300 gold shops, with 100-plus more awaiting approval,  presenting a phenomenon of more stores selling gold than rice.  Moreover, most gold shops are located in "golden areas" on busy  streets.    Gold, symbolizing wealth, luck, and well-being, is dazzling,  fascinating, and intoxicating. We working people have a  traditional and extreme fondness for it. Whenever we acquire a  litle money, we want to buy gold.    Gold is actually a very common metal with quite widespread  uses, being edible, spendable, and life-saving. It has long been  seen as a special commodity that can be either worn as jewelry  or invested as a hedge against inflation. During turbulent  times of war and chaos, gold not only is a commodity that can be  invested as a hedge against inflation, but even becomes at times  a life-saving "amulet." And when this precious metal that  sells for 120-150 yuan a gram was manufactured into exquisite  and tiny pieces to appear on the banquet menu in our southern  cities that were opened up first (according to "scientific  research," eating gold helps to prolong life), its  characteristic charm in China made it a great consumer marvel of  the late 20th century.    In short, gold in China has a huge consumption volume which,  according to statistics, was 250 tons in 1992, up 47 percent  from 1991. While this volume was estimated to be dowm somewhat  for 1993, at about 220 tons, there are still generally very  optimistic prospects. The most recent information is that gold  jewelry consumption for the first three quarters of 1993 was 920  million yuan, with all of the growth focused in gold jewelry.  Other data show China's gold demand at 350 tons, ranking first  in the world.    But we must note that the sharp increase in gold shops and  brisk sales of gold jewelry certainly do not mean that China has  a sound and developed gold market. The facts are exactly the  opposite, that China still does not have a gold market in the  strict sense, and that it can only be rated as:  <H5>  A Lopsided Market </H5>   A gold market in the narrow sense means a trading arena with  concentrated gold transactions and gold-coin exchanges. In a  modern market-economy system, it is a key component part of the  money market. Since the 1970s, the West has also seen the  appearance of a gold futures market, with gold markets having  become the key area in which Western countries apply economic  means of macroeconomic regulation and control to economic  operations, turning them to a certain extent along with stock  markets into Western economic "barometers."    But in China, gold production, operations, and management  have long been subject to our traditional planned-economy means,  characterized by a high degree of planning, monopoly, and  exclusion. Just like a beautiful lady, gold has been raised in  seclusion and covered with a thick veil, leaving it with  enigmatic mystery. As to output, the state issues orders of  the highest secrecy that absolutely must be kept from the  outside world. As to products, the PBC monopolizes buying and  selling on behalf of the state, with noone allowed to encroach.  And as to management, gold production, refining, and flow are  managed by the three sectors of metallurgy, light industry, and  banking, with the structural separation making coordination  difficult. As our domestic gold market is divorced from the  international one, our gold purchasing price is far lower than  the international market price, while our gold jewlery sales  prices are higher than international market prices, damaging the  interests of both producers and consumers.    And as our gold prices are so off-track, this creates severe  gold smuggling, with the state already concerned about runaway  gold purchasing. In 1990, smuggled goods actually made up as  high as 80 percent of our national sales of gold jewelry. He  Naihua [0149 0035 5478], president of the China Jewelry  Import-Export Corp, told the reporter that our 1992 domestic  gold jewelry sales were about 300 tons, of which less than 40  tons went through the official supply and marketing channel of  state-designated banking institutions. The implications of  this are obvious. By 1993, the sharp devaluation of the RMB  touched off a storm of gold panic-buying in all areas, with gold  prices rising again and again, and gold smuggling growing more  rampant, causing the state huge losses. The "gold-mining fever  in western China" described in some works confirms the gold  smuggling.    So some people of insight are raising a cry of warning that  gold must no longer be dissociated from markets, that our gold  industry must be commercialized, and that the establishment and  opening of China's gold market is so imperative that it brooks  no delay! The sooner our gold market is opened up, the sooner  the state will profit, without which financial reform will be  incomplete, and we will be unable to shoulder the heavy  responsibility of "GATT reentry." Some even ask, as the most  precious commodity of grain has been deregulated, how long must  gold wait?!    By now, our gold industry leadership, the public, and  economists involved with gold have essentially reached a  consensus on establishing and opening China's own gold market  and that, as to terms, such as society, technical services,  resources, and laws, the time has come and the conditions are  ripe for an open gold market. So our gold market could be said  to be:  <H5>  Already "In Labor," About To Be Born </H5>   An official at the State Administration of Gold Control has  disclosed that while gold production in China has always been a  special line, where opening to the outside world started later  that in others, the policy of bringing China's gold market onto  track with the international market is set.    In fact, the state has already taken definite steps to put  China's gold market on track with the international one.    First, in September 1993, the state abolished its former  style of fixed gold prices by administrative decision, changing  to a new gold pricing system of floating pricing through market  decision, or setting the domestic purchasing price 10 percent  below the London market gold price, with selling prices the same  as London gold prices, and domestic gold prices floating  regularly.    The state has also eliminated its preferential policies for  the gold industry, such as policy subsidies, low-interest loans,  and tax exemptions, as well as requiring gold-mining units to  pay for the use of geological prospecting data.    Our consolidation of RMB exchange and enterprise tax rates  has also created a key condition for the opening to the outside  world of our gold production.    Foreign firms have always coveted China's huge gold consumer  market. Starting in 1994, China will selectively introduce  foreign capital and technology to our goldmining. It is  understood that dozens of companies in countries such as the  United States, Canada, and South Africa, have made contacts with  China's responsible gold sector, expressing interest in  investing in Chinese goldmining.    The most secretive proposal is the news of the publication  of  our gold output, being a further signal about the opening of our  gold market. But while this will lift the veil of mystery  shrouding our gold industry, it will still be a case of "just as  the frown leaves, other worries come to mind." The experts have  new concerns, advising that:  <H5>  We Must Not Turn Our Gold Market Into a "Petty Commodity </H5> Market"    Gold in China is about to be withdrawn from the monetary  field, to be "reduced to" a market commodity. The experts are  concerned that due to the inevitable drive of profits, just as  in the previous opening of certain other industries, the opening  of our gold market might induce all areas to act out of their  own local, narrow interests, with precipitate action, each going  their own way, and the setting up of petty markets "with each  king occupying his own territory," to disrupt our overall  national market order.    The experts' concerns are certainly not overdone. In fact,  private mining and smuggling have long since brought "stealth  gold markets" to certain places. The most notorious of these  was in the town of Ganwangzhen in Haicheng City, Liaoning  Province, where peasant-mined and privately-bought gold was made  into jewelry and sold, turning the "stealth market" into an open  "secret." So the local government planned to establish a gold  market there to "standardize private gold transactions, to bring  them under government control." On 1 September 1992, the first  private gold jewelry shop in Ganwangzhen opened to the sound of  firecrackers. In a very short five months thereafter, 106  goldshops applied for business licenses, with 76 going into  business, of which 73 were private and the other three  collective. The PBC head office reacted to this very quickly,  issuing a circular to the Liaoning branch off the PBC on 28  December 1992, declaring Ganwangzhen's actions to be illegal,  and emphasizing that until state plans involving the opening of  the gold market went into effect, no locality or unit could  operate gold markets without authorization. After which,  Ganwangzhen's gold shops not only did not decrease in number,  but even increased somewhat. This also touched off a controversy  within financial circles.    But in any case, gold is still not an ordinary commodity. As  gold is also an international hard currency, with links to the  foreign exchange market, China's gold-market model must be able  to play a positive role in protecting our domestic economy,  while also being subject to state macroeconomic regulation and  control. As our gold-market transaction method is mainly  futures contracts, certainly not barter of cash for goods, our  establishment of gold markets must by all means not allow them  to spring up all over, for one after another of "petty commodity  markets."    The experts recommend that, based on current conditions, we  should select one or two large cities in which to set up  nationally standardized gold markets, with Shanghai undoubtedly  being the first choice. Shanghai is China's largest gold-jewelry  sales center, as well as striving to become an international  financial-center city. As it is understood that Shanghai is  establishing a trading center for gold and silver jewelry,  gradually making the transition to a standardized gold market,  it seems that there would not be too great doubts about choosing  Shanghai for China's first established gold market. As to the  other cities suited to the establishment of a gold market, the  experts hold that an ideal site would be Guangzhou. It is  understood that Guangzhou also has such plans, now studying the  possibility of setting up a gold market. Other news is that in  the plans for a financial street on Beijing's West Second Loop  Road, a gold market has been included as one of its projects.    Other experts recommend the organization of a  gold-transaction organ to train talent in and publicize  knowledge about gold futures trading. We could set up  independent gold exchanges in cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai,  and Shenzhen. Gold exchanges should use a membership system,  with members coming upon examination from banks, concerned  entities, and individuals.  <H5>  Pre-Birth Pangs </H5>   While China's pertinent sector decided in September 1993 to  reform our gold pricing system to put it on track with  international gold prices, other news is that the  gold-management sector has recently reemphasized the  monopoly-control system for gold to rectify and improve gold  markets in all places, stipulating that all gold produced by  goldmines must be sold to the PBC.    Concerned figures point out that this step is the result  mainly of the lag in the establishment and development of a  state gold market. As there is not a state gold market, the  state cannot regulate and contol gold markets, leaving gold  trading in disorder, and creating a large gold drain and rampant  improper trading behavior. In addition, as the relations among  all parties have not yet been rationalized, an immediate  transition to free trading would involve many unsuitable parts.  All such issues are keeping the policymaking sector's policy  orientation slanted toward retention of the monopoly-control  system.    I hold that both the reemphasis on the monopoly-control  system and the controversy over Ganwangzhen's gold markets are  actually merely gold market "pre-birth pangs," and that gold  will eventually have to be given access to standardized market  trading. Insiders predict that by 1995, China's gold-monopoly  management system will have been broken with somewhat.    Time will not wait, and the opportunity will not come again!  From the 1990s into the early 21st century, the world economy  will enter another period of sustained growth, setting off a  fifth worldwide modernization tide. So whether we can establish  a large international gold market will depend on the choices we  make now.</p>

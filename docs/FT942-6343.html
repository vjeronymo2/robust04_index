			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Support for Agnew Sir, Having attended the Lasmo annual meeting as a small shareholder, I feel the nicest word I can use to describe Robert Corzine's reporting of it ('Lasmo board comes under attack', May 25) is uneven. While there were a few carping voices, the majority of small shareholders were relieved that Mr Rudolf Agnew had assumed the chairmanship and there was an overwhelming vote in support for his appointment. As far as the alleged violations of the Cadbury Code and cosy rolling contracts are concerned, the bitterness of those small investors who prefer to dwell on the mistakes of the past is understandable. Nonetheless, Mr Agnew made it perfectly clear that there is a new hand at the helm and that a new philosophy of exclusive focus on shareholder value prevails. Lest the tone of Mr Corzine's article lend comfort to the Enterprise Oil camp, I am but one of the vast majority that has no intention of acceding to such a derisory offer. At current oil prices, there is no bid premium in the stock. Simon J Israel, 46 Deansway, Finchley, London N2 0JE</p>

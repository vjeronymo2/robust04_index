			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FRAZIER NAMED TRACK AND FIELD ASSISTANT AT NORTHRIDGE  </P> <P> Former UCLA All-American shotputter John Frazier has been hired as a Cal State  Northridge track and field assistant coach.  </P> <P> He will be in charge of the shotput, discus, javelin and hammer throw.  </P> <P> Frazier, the 1981 state shotput champion at Antelope Valley High, placed sixth  in the 1985 NCAA championships and eighth in 1986.  </P> <P> "We've been hoping for this for a long time," Northridge track Coach Don  Strametz said. "John is really going to help our program. He's very  knowledgeable about the throws and he has a great reputation in the track and  field community. His name alone will attract kids who wouldn't otherwise come  here."  </P> <P> A 1986 UCLA graduate, Frazier, 27, was an assistant at UC Irvine in 1989 and at  Humboldt State this season.  </P> <P> He has competed for the Stars and Stripes Track Club since graduating from UCLA  and improved his personal best to 65 feet 9 1/2 inches in 1987.  </P> <P> With Northridge moving to the NCAA Division I level in all sports except  football beginning in the fall, Strametz hopes that the hiring of Frazier will  shore up the Matadors' recent weakness in several weight events.  </P> <P> A Division II men's power in the weight events from the early 1970s to the  mid-'80s, Northridge has not produced an All-American in the shotput, discus or  javelin since 1985.  </P> <P> The Matadors have had four Division II All-Americans in the hammer throw in the  last three years, but that success hasn't carried over to the other weight  events.  </P> <P> "We definitely need to improve in that area -- especially in the shot and disc  -- if we're going to be a successful Division I dual-meet team," Strametz said.  "And I think the addition of John is a big step in that direction."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Northridge distance coach Bob Augello resigned his position to  become an assistant coach/director of the Escondido-based Subaru Cycling Team.  </P> <P> Augello, who coached City Section 3,200 champions Ian Alsen (1987) and Craig  Lawson (1989) at Granada Hills High, coached at Northridge for two years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> INNER VISIONS OF NOSTALGIA FOR PARADISE LOST;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: A DUANE MICHALS RETROSPECTIVE AT A SAN DIEGO MUSEUM MAKES A STRONG  IMPRINT ON THE PSYCHE.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is just coincidence that the simple title of "The Duane Michals  Show" seems more fitting to a comedy hour than a 30-year museum retrospective  of a New York photographer. But images of, say, Howdy Doody, persist when a  visitor is faced with a blow-up self-portrait of Michals using head and hands  to make a shadow image of a duck on the wall behind him at the entrance to his  show at the Museum of Photographic Arts in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> Guileless and often goofy, Michals seems contented to leave a first impression  of himself as an entertainer in this first American survey of his work. But as  the more than 200 black-and-white photographs quickly show, Michals is much  more. A mix of portraits and multi-image narratives with short written texts,  this wonderful show combines humor with nostalgia, religious commentary, astute  social observation and personal fantasy.  </P> <P> A bluntness and modesty pervade this work, a simplicity that leaves each viewer  to go further beyond the surface. To project and extrapolate. To be swept up in  the nostalgia, without being trapped in sweetness. To keep an eye on the  gimmick inherent in the medium, while still appreciating its enormous power.  </P> <P> An early work sets the tone of surrealist quasi-religious symbolism and  photographic manipulation that remains consistent throughout: "The Illuminated  Man," 1968, shows a shadowy man whose head has been transformed into a  featureless, glowing flash of light. "I Met God in the Subway," 1990 -- the  latest here -- takes the same theme further: A man is shown riding the New York  subway, his head lit from behind to look like a halo. Just below, the artist  has written: "I met God in the subway/He looked like you and me/I asked which  train went to Heaven/He said take number three./When I got off in Heaven/It  looked like Union Square/Seems when you go to Heaven/You don't go anywhere."  </P> <P> Constantly questioning reality in art and in life, in both of these works  Michals plays the mysterious powers of manipulation available to the  photographer against the mysticism of religion. Calling himself a "lapsed  Catholic," Michals has spoken often of his devoutly religious childhood. A  sense of paradise lost governs much of his work, imbued with a nostalgia for  the transcendent visions that can come through faith. There is a slightly  mocking tone to such quasi-religious work, but it is dryly mixed with the  possibility of optimism. That Heaven and Earth are equal, that death does not  transcend life.  </P> <P> Born in 1932 in blue-collar McKeesport, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb that was also  the birthplace of Andy Warhol, Michals has made many works that appear directly  autobiographical. His unresolved relationship with his father is often a  subject. Among these, one of the most subtle, yet most poignant, is the 1978  "Self Portrait Shaking Hands With My Father."  </P> <P> In a barren room, the two men shake hands at the extreme right side of the  photo and the contrast between them is striking. The older man, slightly bent  from age, wears a somewhat rumpled suit, a mark of formality that hides the  fact that he is a retired factory worker. The younger Michals wears a dark  turtleneck, casually formal as would befit an artist. In their handshake is the  symbol of resolution, across what appears to be significant distance. An open  door at the left of the picture appears as an escape route from these powerful  emotions.  </P> <P> Death comes up often in Michals' work, too, with a sense of both sorrow and  curiosity yet never morbidity. "Hamlet's" Yorick, for example, is remembered in  a memento mori picture of a young man holding a skull. Scrawled below in the  artist's rough hand is a short poem "All Things Mellow in the Mind . . . ."  about the brevity of life. "So let's hold tight, and touch and feel," Michals  wrote. "For this quick instant we are real."  </P> <P> There are lighter moments, too, belying Michals' Pop background and his links  to a post-modern real-life metaphysic similar to that found in the work of such  artists as John Baldessari and Edward Ruscha, among others. A group of  exquisite celebrity portraits -- many of them commercial work done for  magazines -- starts the show. Some are of well-known artists, like a rare pair  of portraits of Joseph Cornell, as well as images of Warhol, Marcel Duchamp and  Rene Magritte. Others are of movie and arts stars: Dennis Hopper lounging on  the floor in a smoke-filled room, Joe Dallesandro as a gargoyle on a New York  rooftop and a beautiful but apparently narcissistic Russian ballerina, Ludmila  Tscherina, shown just in the circular frame of a hand-held mirror in a  photograph from 1964.  </P> <P> And the narrative can be both sweet and borderline cute, like children's book  illustrations. One well-known work shows a child who looks up at a coat and hat  hanging on a rack, then falls asleep and dreams the bogey man has come to life.  </P> <P> A series of forays into painting show the artist painting on top of vintage  photographs, obliterating the precious images of photographic masters with  colorful, childlike imagery. Here, Michals exhibits a bad-boy daring  reminiscent of Robert Rauchenberg's erasure of a Willem DeKooning drawing.  </P> <P> Michals' 1989 work, too, takes a tongue-in-cheek jab at the pretentions of  photography. "There Are Nine Mistakes in This Photograph" shows a man reading  an upside down newspaper with an upside down top hat on his head, sitting  across a breakfast table from a blindfolded girl eating cake, among other  foolishness. "Can you find them?" the picture teases.  </P> <P> On the surface, all of Michals' art seems immediately accessible. A renegade  from the seriousness of both fine art photography and photojournalism, Michals  makes it all seem easy. But, again, there is more than meets the eye. Lighting  and darkroom techniques often add enormous subtlety to the beauty of the  prints.  </P></p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Observer: Remember Rodrigo 'Give credit where credit's due' was the watchword of Observer's grandmother. Accordingly, amid all the furore of what looks to be the most controversial 500th anniversary on record, it is surely time to acknowledge the first European known to have discovered the Americas. By now, of course, everybody has heard that it wasn't Christopher Columbus, who is authoritatively claimed to have been preceded by Vikings or even fishermen from Bristol. If so, however, nobody knows their names. Step forward, therefore, the shade of the first European identified as having set eyes on the new continent: Rodrigo from Triana, the look-out aboard the 50ft caravel Pinta who sighted the island of San Salvador a few hours more than half a millennium ago. While remembering him, we might also spare a thought for Joseph from Britain, designer of Santo Domingo's newly opened commemorative lighthouse - which, given the length of its gestation as well as its lack of practical utility, must rank high among the White Elephants of history. Joseph Gleave was still an architecture student when he won a competition for the design in 1928, He finally went to the site in 1946, only for work to be stopped five years later when funds ran out. The project was revived in the 1960s by Dominican Republic president Joaquin Balaguer. But by then the architect had died, having in the meantime set up a practice in Glasgow and designed, among other things, Prestwick Airport. So how do Gleave's successors feel about his transatlantic masterwork? His former assistant John McCulloch, who was at last week's opening, thinks the cross-shaped concrete structure will be a big tourist attraction. Gleave's son David is less enthusiastic. 'I think the problem is that it was designed 60 years before it was built,' he said.</p>

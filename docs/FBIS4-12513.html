			<p>BFN     [Text] Progress was made in the Cairo negotiations with  the Palestinians, which continued until very late last night,  although there is doubt the talks will be concluded by 13 April.  Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus reports that the  Palestinians are making efforts to reach an agreement by that  date.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0400 GMT on 11 April  adds that "from Tunis we have word that chances are slim for a  meeting in Bucharest this week between Foreign Minister Peres  and Yasir 'Arafat."]    In the discussions of the civilian affairs committee,  agreement was reached on archaeology, fuel, and environment  issues. The team is to discuss the water problems today. There  is still dispute regarding jurisdiction over temporary residents  and tourists.    The military committee resumed discussions on the deployment  of the Palestinian police, the foreign observers, and the joint  patrols. The Palestinians demanded that the closure be lifted  and that prisoners be released.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 11 April adds  in  a related report from Cairo by Udi Segal: "The PLO has asked  that Israel set a date for signing the Gaza and Jericho  agreement. The Palestinian delegates in Cairo made it clear  that until such a date is set, they will not begin the  deployment of the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho, but  the Israelis refused to set such a date. Furthermore, they made  it absolutely clear to the Palestinians that 13 April is no  longer a target date of any kind.    ["The Palestinians tried to apply pressure last night and  force Israel to make some gesture or symbolic move on 13 April,  but the Israelis stood firm, explaining that no move will be  made because the PLO has not taken even a single step to show it  is willing to implement the agreement. Had the Palestinians  started to deploy their police force and assume some control of  the territory, we could have considered such a move, an Israeli  delegate told us late last night. In the meantime, they have  done nothing of the sort.    ["Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the delegation, told  his Palestinian counterparts last night that the time when the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will complete its withdrawal from  Gaza and Jericho depends only on them. Shahaq said: on an  operational level, we are able to complete the withdrawal, but  until you take up your positions, we remain in charge."]</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> HOOD ORNAMENTS NOW WIRED TO PREVENT THEFT  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if you walk into a chic restaurant and find that the  customer next to you brought his Mercedes hood ornament to the table along with  his portable car stereo. And don't be too quick to touch that gold laurel  wreath ornament on your neighbor's new Cadillac. If he's like many Caddy  owners, he may have it wired for sound.  </P> <P> As thefts of automobile accessories increase across the nation -- about $1.3  million such crimes were reported in 1988 -- Southern California motorists are  going to great lengths to keep their hardware on their cars.  </P> <P> But it's not easy keeping a car intact these days. That's especially true for  Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac owners whose car emblems are most popular among  teen-agers who like to wear the Mercedes three-pointed star or the Cadillac  wreath as necklaces, belt buckles and key chains.  </P> <P> "It's somewhat of a craze, I think," Lt. Greg Vasquez of the Los Angeles Police  Department's Burglary Auto Theft Division said. "The kids wear them as  ornaments. It's like a status symbol, a trendy thing to have in your  possession. It's done in all segments of the city."  </P> <P> In the city of Los Angeles last year, LAPD statistics show there were 13,868  thefts from vehicles, which includes hood ornaments and hub caps. But some  police officers believe that figure is low, because hood ornament thefts often  go unreported.  </P> <P> The latest theft-deterrent device is an alarm that sounds the car horn if  someone tries to steal the wired-up hood ornament. Manufactured by Celebrity  Inc. of Placerville, it fits all American-made cars with vertical hood  ornaments; another model fits all Mercedes-Benz models.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Removable Emblem  </P> <P> For Mercedes-Benz, there also is a removable emblem available.  </P> <P> Responding to customer demand, Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories recently  began offering removable Mercedes-Benz hood stars. Gold plated models cost  $129; chrome, $99.  </P> <P> "We decided to offer removable ones, like the portable car stereos, because so  many customers requested it," Kathryn Johns of Beverly Hills Motoring  Accessories said. "It's really a big problem for the Mercedes owners. It's $100  every time they lose one. This way, they can just stick it in their pocket when  they leave the car."  </P> <P> Rolls-Royce's Flying Lady ornaments get ripped off, too, but they're too heavy  to be worn around the neck, leading some dealers to suspect that the stolen  emblems get sold into some auto parts black market, as do Rolls-Royce hubcaps,  which cost $1,200 a set.  </P> <P> "Locally, Mercedes stars are as popular as necklaces," Newport Auto Center  Rolls-Royce dealer Roger Fletcher observed. "But no one walks around with a  5-pound Flying Lady around his neck."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $500 to Replace  </P> <P> A Los Angeles exotic car parts dealer said: "Everybody I know with a Rolls has  had a Flying Lady stolen. They used to be made of solid silver, but they're  silver-plated now; even those cost $500 or $600 to replace. Five years ago, a  guy came in with 130 stainless steel knockoffs (of the ornament) made in Korea  and I bought them for $10 apiece. I just sold the last one for $225."  </P> <P> In Europe, both Rolls-Royce and Bentley autos have factory-made devices  attached to the Flying Lady and Flying B that make the ornaments disappear down  into the radiator if someone grabs them and tries to steal them. The devices  are not included on Rolls and Bentleys manufactured for American distribution.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Cadillac dealers report a flurry of emblem thefts, especially  since the ornaments -- also Cadillac grills and wheel covers -- became  available nine years ago in gold plate in addition to chrome.  </P> <P> "One night in the used car section, we lost every hood ornament in a whole  row," said Chuck Nelson, tire and accessories manager for Dixon Cadillac in  Hollywood. "Customers are always losing them. One guy lost four in a week. I  tell them 'Don't even bother to replace it unless you get an alarm.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Everybody Takes Them'  </P> <P> Dixon sales representative Bob Petrie, who had two emblems stolen from his  Cadillac Seville before installing an alarm, added: "Everybody takes them, the  kids on up to adults. If they don't get a gold one, they take the chrome ones  and get them gold-plated."  </P> <P> Cadillac's hood ornament theft problem is unique among General Motors cars. The  penta star Chrysler emblem is stolen only "occasionally," Los Angeles Chrysler  representative Chris Hosford said.  </P> <P> But for Mercedes owners, ornament theft is a big problem. "At some Mercedes  dealerships they're selling 20 hood ornaments a day," said Doug Furuye of D. F.  Auto Leasing and Sales in Culver City. "That's how bad the theft problem is.  One young lady picked up her 260E Mercedes from me late one afternoon and went  back to her office. When she came out that evening, the star had been ripped  off. She got another one the next day, and the following day, it was taken."  </P> <P> Since he heard about the hood alarm a few months ago, he has recommended it to  everyone who leases or buys a Cadillac or Mercedes from him. "People have tried  alarm systems for the whole car that are sensitive to motion," he said.  "They're about $250 to $600 if they're worth anything. But most of the time,  they're too sensitive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hood Ornaments  </P> <P> Many Cadillac and Mercedes dealers offer the hood ornament alarm, which  includes a 24-karat electroplated gold emblem, for about $195 installed.  Motorists who want to save money on the devices can buy them for $59.95 from  the Placerville company and take the 45 or so minutes it takes to install, said  Curt Rocca, executive vice president of Celebrity Inc.  </P> <P> Teen-agers, he said, "are stealing the ornaments to wear around their necks,  not for the value of the gold. We've heard about clubs at junior high schools  where you had to have a Cadillac or Mercedes hood ornament just to belong. You  needed one gold one or three chrome ones."  </P> <P> Stealing a hood ornament is "a three-second operation," Rocca added. "You pull  up on them and clip the cable with wire cutters. (But) the alarm comes with a  heavy duty cable that you'd need bolt-cutters to take. Plus, there's the added  surprise effect when the horn starts honking. One guy told me he saw a kid  start to steal his hood ornament and when the horn went off, the kid jumped  back 4 feet and ran."  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS  </P> <P> An IRS ruling and taxes.

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Shares in Siebe fall despite 17% gain Shares in Siebe, the inter-national controls and engineering group, fell 20p to 566p yesterday although the company announced a 17 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 94.2m in the six months to September 30. The shares enjoyed a strong run before the results. There was disappointment that Pounds 10m of the Pounds 14m increase in pre-tax profits came from currency translation, and concern about the impact of recession in continental Europe and Japan. However, Mr Barrie Stephens, Siebe's chairman and chief executive, was upbeat: 'These results are particularly gratifying at a time when many of the market places in which we trade are in recession. 'They also demonstrate the wisdom of building up our presence in the fast-growing process controls sector and in this regard our United States operations are especially important.' Group turnover rose 18 per cent to Pounds 895m, of which Pounds 118m was attributable to currency translation, and earnings per share advanced 16.2 per cent to 13.6p (11.7p). The interim dividend was lifted by 10 per cent to 3.66p (3.3275p). Sales grew 2.7 per cent in constant currency terms and net margins were maintained at 10.5 per cent, in spite of the impact of a Pounds 2m US healthcare charge, which will continue at a similar level, and an increase in severance charges from Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m, for redundancies in continental Europe. Siebe's worst performer was its specialist mechanical engineering. Sales in automotive and garage equipment to continental Europe fell 19 per cent, and profits fell from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 4.8m. This division bore most of Siebe's 400 job losses. In controls, operating profits increased from Pounds 78.4m to Pounds 96.7m. Temperature and appliance controls benefited from the recovery in the US and South America. Control systems increased sales, with gains in the US and Asia offsetting lower activity in Europe and Canada. An increase in cashflow from Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 44.4m helped cut gearing from 60 per cent at the April year-end to 56.2 per cent at September 30. Mr Stephens said Eckardt, the recent German acquisition, would fit well with the group's Foxboro process control business. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the 1993 legislative session, the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislature considered but did not pass legislation which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have authorized the upgrade of the Smog Check network. Citing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns over jobs and consumer convenience, state legislators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advanced a bill designed to improve the State's failing Smog  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Check system without fundamentally changing its test-and-repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure. Although the bill contained some important measures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA had to inform the legislature that the bill fell short of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the Clean Air Act's standards for an enhanced  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. EPA officials are continuing to work with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California legislative leadership in the hopes of achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consensus on a program design which would meet both the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act requirements and California's unique needs. EPA is proposing an enhanced  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M program design which incorporates the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sophisticated testing techniques with features to maximize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer convenience and to mimimize the cost of inspection. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State should develop and adopt an alternative program design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which meets the Act's performance standard for enhanced I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs prior to finalization of the FIP, then the alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program will be proposed for approval as a State plan revision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its reductions will be substituted for those which would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected from a federally imposed I/M program. EPA would propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional measures if necessary to provide equivalent emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions as part of the FIP attainment demonstration. Once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP I/M program is finalized, however, the State will need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet not only the requirements of the I/M rule, but will have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a plan that fills any shortfall between the State I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and the FIP I/M program, so as not to jeopardize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP's required attainment demonstration. This could be done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the State I/M program or other emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Summary of Proposed Federal Enhanced I/M Program.  The proposed program would cover all model year 1966 and newer onroad, gasoline-fueled vehicles_including heavy-duty trucks but excluding motorcycles_and would be conducted on a biennial basis to optimize the measure's emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential and cost effectiveness, as well as to minimize the disruption created by any transition from the current, state-run Smog Check program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed program would be conducted in a network of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test-only stations (i.e., stations in which both owners and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators are legally barred from profiting either directly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly from the sale and servicing of motor vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motor vehicle parts). The tests performed would include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient, mass-emissions tailpipe test known as the IM240 which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would measure hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrogen; purge and pressure tests to assure that the evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system is working properly; and a visual antitampering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection for the presence and proper connection of the positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crankcase ventilation (PCV) and air systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to enter into a legal agreement with one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities for the performance of all possible program activities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than enforcement of the motorist registration requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and oversight requirements which would constitute a conflict of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest. This entity shall hereafter be referred to as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``test provider.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The biennnial test is estimated to cost between $20 and $25,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the average wait time at the high volume inspection stations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should average less than ten minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed discussion of the FIP's proposed I/M program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and its various program elements follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Applicability.  The enhanced I/M requirement will apply to all vehicles registered, or required to be registered, in the counties listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Table IM&hyph;1 and to vehicles in commercial fleets which are primarily operated within these same counties. Vehicles which are operated on Federal installations located within the I/M program area must also comply with the I/M requirements regardless of their registration status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,s100,r100,xls100 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table XX&hyph;X._Counties Included in the Enhanced I/M Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Sacramento area    <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Ventura     <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1South coast <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Sacramento    <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Ventura    <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Los Angeles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Yolo             <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->     <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Orange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Placer (part)     <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->     <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Riverside (part). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Solano            <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->      <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> San Bernardino (part). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lSutter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lEl Dorado (part). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The portions of Riverside, San Bernardino, Placer, and El  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dorado counties to be covered by the FIP I/M program would be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same as are currently covered by the State's Smog Check program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current Smog Check program covers more than the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, and therefore carrying this coverage over into the FIP I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is sufficient to satisfy the Act's enhanced I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. EPA is requesting comment, however, on whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic coverage is sufficient to include all significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contributors to FIP area emissions and whether there is any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason that it should be expanded beyond the scope of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing I/M areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Enforcement. Under this proposal, the Secretary of State of California, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, its employees, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other persons representing the State of California are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited from registering any subject vehicle which does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present a valid certificate of compliance with or a valid waiver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the FIP's I/M program requirements. At Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installations, where vehicles may not have California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration, the vehicles may not be issued a base sticker or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other operating permit without evidence of compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced I/M program requirements. EPA or the test provider(s)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will issue these certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Post-money world on our doorstep A week in which the whole world has been waiting for a Federal Reserve meeting may seem a surprising one in which to express doubts on the power and importance of central banks. Some contrary souls may, however, suspect that just when an institution seems most triumphant, history will subsequently show that it has passed its zenith. The serious point is that the monetary system over which the central banks preside is changing so radically that eventually there may be little room for their present functions. It is indeed time to sit up and take notice when such a thesis is put forward not just by outsiders and free-banking fanatics, but by two serious and sophisticated economists from the Central Bank of Ireland. They are FX Browne and JPC Fell (shortly to move to the European Monetary Institute). Their paper is entitled Inflation - Dormant, Dying or Dead? (Central Bank of Ireland, POB 559, Dublin 2). Their thesis is that 'the newly-liberalised financial markets can render impotent monetary policy actions that are ostensibly inflationary'. Moreover 'over a much longer future horizon, payment system advances, already realised or in the pipeline, could push capitalist economies into a new post-monetary world without money or inflation'. The authors are adamant that inflation has up to now been caused by excessive expansion of the money supply. They explicitly reject structural, real economy, explanations of the kind put forward by Roger Bootle in an HSBC Greenwell paper. But unlike conventional monetarists they envisage the defeat of inflation, not by controlling the money supply, but by establishing an economy in which money as we now know it has ceased to exist. Readers who are suspicious of my gloss should refer to the original. The first and most familiar part of the thesis is that the the bond market is becoming the arbiter of monetary policy. The authors argue that the bond market will itself tighten policy by pushing bond prices down and yields up at the slightest whiff of an inflationary threat. I have myself argued that the bond market can be and often is wrong and that central bankers should not follow it blindly in setting short-term rates. The novelty of the Irish paper is the suggestion that borrowers will no longer be able to bypass the bond market by borrowing short term at officially determined interest rates. Bank depositors who regard bank interest rates as too low in view of likely inflation will quickly move into longer-term securities, thus forcing up the whole yield curve and closing off the option of borrowing cheaply at excessively low interest rates. They also suggest that past bond market overshooting and undershooting reflect hyper-sensitivity to inflationary developments, which will no longer make sense in the new post-monetary world. The second and still reasonably familiar part of the Irish thesis turns on 'securitisation'. This ungainly word refers to the tendency to borrow and lend to a greater extent via bonds, equities or other securities, which can be bought and sold in the markets, and thereby to bypass the banking system. The authors argue that central banks will find it more and more difficult to exercise leverage on interest rates through the influence of their operations on the commercial banks, because the latter will become less important. Third, because of financial liberalisation, the spending of both households and companies is becoming much less determined by either immediate income or money in the bank, than by wealth. Put more simply, people are more and more able to borrow their way out of temporary squeezes and insure against future shocks. Expenditure will in the end be limited only by wealth - which like most economists they define as the discounted total of expected future income streams. The Irish authors draw from this development the implication that money is just the most liquid form of wealth; and boosting or restricting its supply will become pointless as people will simply use other assets or borrow from each other. Fourth, and most radically, the authors suggest that cash will dwindle in importance and may eventually disappear. Currency and bank balances with central banks together make up what economists used to call cash. 'Electronic money' may eliminate the need for both types. Why do banks hold balances at central banks? Basically because such balances are default free. Such perfectly safe assets are essential when net settlements are made with other banks at the end of a working day, as some risks are being run. But in the brave new world there will be 'Real-Time Gross Settlement'. What this ugly piece of jargon means is that each transaction between banks will be settled instantaneously and the creditworthiness of the partner verified simultaneously. When this occurs banks will avoid tying up assets in central bank balances paying minimal interest rates. A parallel development at the retail end is 'Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale'. Customers will have debit cards which can be drawn down as they shop. Not only will these be cleaner and more theft-proof than notes and coins; there will be no technical reason why interest should not be paid on balances in credit. Fifth, and most far-reaching, when electronic money has gone far enough, the way will be open for the disappearance of money as a means of exchange and the settlement of all transactions in assets such as mutual fund shares. Such shares are not redeemable into dollars, sterling, marks, yen or Ecus. They are claims on the equities or bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial paper and other assets in which the funds have been invested. Their value depends on the value of these underlying assets. Sixth, the result will be, it is argued, a standard of value in which prices can be set and long-term contracts denominated, divorced from the means of payment. The Irish authors suggest that values will ultimately be measured in terms of a unit account defined in terms of a basket of goods. Before dismissing the Irish picture as fanciful, look at the many existing developments pointing in that direction. The growing influence of the bond markets on monetary policy does not need to be laboured. Securitisation has become a cliche. The buoyancy of UK domestic demand, in spite of large tax increases, suggests that expenditures are indeed becoming less constrained by income and cash flow. The technology for electronic banking already exists. Currency has become a much smaller part of the money supply; and, in the US, money market mutual funds have shot up to become nearly as large as bank deposits. One central banker remarked to me that the present very low growth of broad money would have been a pointer to recession in any previous period. The controversial part of the Irish thesis is not the move towards a cashless and policy-immune economy, but that the process will be benign. The authors have, for instance, only a couple of throwaway sentences on how the suggested basket-based unit of account will be created and maintained. The trend towards a post-monetary society will not solve the policy problems of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England while it is only a trend. Indeed, the Irish authors warn that, during the transition, monetary policy may only be able to operate by driving financial markets 'against solvency constraints'. Nevertheless a view of the possible destination must surely help. For policymakers need to think both about the problems of the transition and how to see that the emerging new monetary world is brave as well as new.</p>

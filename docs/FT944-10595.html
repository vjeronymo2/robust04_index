			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Bosnian Serbs strike back Bosnian Serb forces yesterday forced back the Moslem-led army in northwestern Bosnia, apparently recapturing the strategic heights round Bihac, a United Nations-designated safe area. The UN also confirmed that a jet aircraft, thought to have come from a base just over the border in Serb-held territory in Croatia, had fired two rockets at targets in Bihac. 'We understand an airplane fired two rockets at around 1110 GMT,' said Lieutenant-Colonel Tim Spicer, UN spokesman. The Orao ground attack jet, built in a joint Yugoslav-Romanian defence project, 'was outside the airspace of Bosnia-Hercegovina when it fired,' he said. Unconfirmed reports suggested that the first rocket hit a warehouse, possibly an ammunition dump which caused strong secondary explosions. After the Serb military gains, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, last night drew back from an earlier vow that his assembly would declare a state of war. 'It will probably not be an immediate state of war on the whole territory,' he said before a meeting in Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold above Sarajevo. The Bosnian capital yesterday suffered another heavy day of fighting with five people wounded in machinegun fire from a Serb-held part of the city. In an attempt to salvage a ceasefire which has broadly held since February around Sarajevo, General Sir Michael Rose, head of UN forces in Bosnia, yesterday 'urgently' summoned the commanders of the warring sides to the city airport.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Fees for Resubmitted Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 103. We have amended &sect;1.1107(d) of the rules, as proposed. Section 1.1107(d) governs fee payments relating to applications and other filings when resubmitted in the appropriate timeframe following a staff request for additional or corrected information. We have amended &sect;1.1107(d) to require persons submitting applications or other filings that have been returned for additional information or corrections and that do not require any additional fees to submit these applications and other filings directly to the Bureau/Office making the request. Applications requiring additional fees must be filed at our lockbox bank with the remittance for the entire additional amount due. In the event that the staff discovers, within 30 days after the resubmission, that the additional fee payment was not submitted, the application or other filing will be dismissed as deficient and the previously submitted section 8 fee payment will be retained under this proposal. A new fee payment (covering the entire amount of the revised fee) will be required with any future filing of the application or other filing. However, if the staff discovers the fee payment deficiency more than thirty days subsequent to the resubmission, the application or other filing will be retained, but a 25 percent late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if we have completed our action on the application or other filing involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Stale Checks <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 104. Our lockbox bank will not process a personal or business check dated more than six months prior to its submission. Therefore, we have revised &sect;1.1108(a) of the rules to make clear that these ``stale'' checks will not be accepted as fee payments. Under this revision, we will not accept any instrument of payment dated more than six months prior to the date of its filing with the lockbox bank, and we will return to the filer any application or other filing submitted with a stale payment instrument. Further, we will not accept any third party checks ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , checks with the name of any third party as the maker or endorser). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Receipts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 105. Our practice with regard to stamped receipts for application fee payments is to furnish receipts only upon specific request of the submitter rather than to provide receipts automatically for all fee payments received. We are clarifying these procedures by amending &sect;1.1108 of the rules. In order to obtain a receipt for a fee payment, section 1.1108 will require that the application and fee package include a copy of the first page of the application or other filing, clearly marked ``copy,'' submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing. The copy should be the top document in the fee payment package. The staff will date-stamp the copy immediately and provide it to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the date-stamped copy of the application. We will provide a receipt for regulatory fee payments, upon request, if we are furnished with a copy of Form 159 or the first page of an application in the private radio services accompanying the fee payment and the request otherwise conforms with the procedures we have adopted for receipts of application fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Electronic Application Fee Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 106. We are adopting rules regarding the submission of regulatory fee payments by electronic means. Revised &sect;&sect;1.1107 and 1.1108 of the rules allow the payment of application and other filing fees by electronic means, although our system for electronic payment is not yet fully in place. In our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , we stated our concern about matching electronically paid fees with submitted hard-copy applications. <FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>  If a party chooses to pay its application filing fee electronically, we will require that the entity follow existing procedures for filing its application at the lockbox bank. However, in lieu of the current payment methods, the party will indicate on its remittance advice (FCC Form 159 or the underlying application form with fee information incorporated therein) that payment is being sent to the bank electronically. The electronic payment must be made on or before the day the application is filed. Upon receipt of an application, the bank will confirm that a fee payment has been received electronically. If the electronic payment is not received on the filing date, the application or request will be returned without processing. We believe these procedures are necessary to ensure the most efficient processing of electronic fee payments (when authorized) and applications or other filings. Finally, during the pilot phase of our electronic payment program, regulatees will be required to obtain our prior authorization before making electronic fee payments. (See paragraphs 56 and 57, above.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that some parts of the Commission are currently experimenting with electronic filing of applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. One Check/One Application Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 107. We are modifying our rules to allow the use of a single payment instrument or method to cover multiple applications for the same or different applicants, so long as all the applications are filed at the same time at the same lockbox. Any applicant desiring to pay for multiple regulatory/application filings in the same lockbox with a single payment instrument, or when paying by credit card, must also complete FCC Form 159, FCC Remittance Advice. Each item must be listed separately on the form with its own Payment Type Code. If another space is needed for multiple filings, the applicant must use FCC Form 159&hyph;C, FCC Remittance Advice Continuation Sheet. <FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> All non-private radio section 9 regulatory fee payors must use FCC Form 159/159C when submitting single or multiple regulatory fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Payment by Cashier's Check <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 108. To ensure that payment instruments will result in a final payment being made to the Commission, we believe that our cashier's check safeguard should be strengthened. Accordingly, as proposed, when a person or organization has, on one or more occasions, submitted a payment instrument on which final payment is not received (and is not excused by bank error), we will immediately notify the party that future fee payments must be made by cashier's check until further notice. If, subsequent to such notice, payment is not made by a cashier's check (or cash), that party's other payment instrument will not be accepted and its application or other filing will be returned. 47 CFR 1.1108(d)(1)(i); see also 47 CFR 1.1110(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

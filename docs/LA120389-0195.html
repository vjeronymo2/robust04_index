			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NFL NOTES;  </P> <P> WALKER HASN'T MADE DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> The mere presence of Herschel Walker in their backfield has not transformed the  Minnesota Vikings into world-beaters or dramatically changed the nature of  their running game. If anything, the Walker trade has been just another  upsetting factor in a season of controversy.  </P> <P> They have lost two straight to Philadelphia and Green Bay to fall into a  first-place tie in the NFC Central with the Packers at 7-5. In the past four  games, the Vikings have managed just three offensive touchdowns to go with 16  field goals, and Walker's 42 yards rushing in a 20-19 loss to the Packers  Sunday was his low since leaving Dallas.  </P> <P> The mention of the Vikings' inability to put the ball in the end zone Sunday  brought a look of disgust to the face of Jerry Burns. "I've heard that all year  long," the coach said. "I don't want to comment. I know there's an inability.  What do you want me to do?"  </P> <P> Burns hinted he's unhappy with the play of quarterback Wade Wilson, but the  alternative of Tommy Kramer is no better. Wilson sounded critical of the play  calling near the goal line against the Packers, but he denied adjustments  caused by the Walker trade have much to do with the Vikings' offensive  problems.  </P> <P> "There's been a lot of speculation about the trade, but we haven't come  together as an offense all year long," Wilson said. "It's not the offensive  theory; it's the physical mistakes."  </P> <P> Considerable attention has been focused on the way offensive coordinator Bob  Schnelker has used Walker in tandem with fullback Rick Fenney. When Walker  joined the Vikings, there was talk of giving him the ball 25 to 30 times a  game. Walker, however, has gotten it an average of 19 times, including 15 pass  receptions, and he comes out of the game on most third-and-long plays.  </P> <P> Wilson said Walker is learning the offense "gradually," and the coaches have  indicated he's not as versatile as they thought he would be. "You can't feed  the ball to Herschel 50 times a game and think we're going to win the  ballgame," Burns said.  </P> <P> Since joining the Vikings, Walker has carried for 519 yards to help Minnesota  improve to 12th in the league in rushing, and he has added 138 yards receiving.  But the Vikings are 4-3 in seven games with Walker, which is not what they  expected.  </P> <P> "The person who's being cheated the most is Herschel," cornerback Carl Lee said  after losing to the Packers. "He's an excellent player, but he's human. When he  doesn't do certain things, everyone asks why. He's a key player, but he can't  do it all by himself. It's unfair that he has to bear the pressure of taking  the team to the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> No policy has been formulated, but it seems clear the NFL is prepared to accept  applications for the draft from a flood of underclassmen. "The word we're  hearing is that three dozen to four dozen players are coming out," league  spokesman Joe Browne said. "Agents are a big factor in campus life; the agents  are ubiquitous."  </P> <P> New Commissioner Paul Tagliabue is considering allowing those who have  completed their junior year of eligibility to enter the draft, as Pete Rozelle  did this year with the Detroit Lions' Barry Sanders, but he may oppose any  sophomores or freshmen who want to sign up for the draft. "At some point, you  have to draw the line and accept a court challenge," Browne said.  </P> <P> The possibility that management will impose a wage scale to hold down rookie  salaries has many underclassmen worried. "I would think there's paranoia  running rampant among college juniors relative to a wage scale," Ralph Cindrich  of International Management Group said. "I don't know if there is a basis for  that fear. As a general rule, a player is better off to play out the extra year  in college. But if I felt a wage scale was going to be implemented, it would be  most advantageous to come out (now). And I would advise him of that."  </P> <P> Around the League: -- The Chicago Bears are 2-6 in their past eight games. Only  the Cowboys, 1-7 in the same span, have played worse. After Sunday's 38-14 loss  to the Washington Redskins, Coach Mike Ditka said of the Bears' playoff  chances, "I think it's over." But after linebacker Mike Singletary called a  players-only meeting in which he challenged anyone who thinks it's over to  stand up and got no takers, Ditka backed off his own comments. According to  quarterback Mike Tomczak, Ditka told his squad, "Listen guys, what I said  (Sunday), don't take too much to heart." Discussing the Bears' next game with  the Vikings, Ditka said, "No, it's not really over. I still think we have a  shot, but this week is the ultimate game for us."  </P> <P>  -- The Vikings' Burns blasted cornerback Reggie Rutland and outside linebacker  Mike Merriweather for dropping potential TD interceptions, saying of  Merriweather, "What is a guy paid a million dollars a year for?"  </P> <P>  -- The race for the No. 1 draft pick appears to be coming down to the New York  Jets (3-9), Atlanta Falcons (3-9), Lions (3-9) and Seattle Seahawks (4-8), but  the San Diego Chargers (4-8) and New England Patriots (4-8) still have a shot.  </P> <P>  -- Bears' defensive tackle Dan Hampton on his 10th knee surgery: "I don't want  to confuse anybody with all these scars. I've got color-coded stitches so the  autopsy will be a lot easier for everybody."  </P></p>

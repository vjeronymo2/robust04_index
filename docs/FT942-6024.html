			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Prodi quits as Iri loses L10,230bn Iri, the Italian state holding company, yesterday said 1993 losses had reached a record L10,230bn (Dollars 6.4bn), more than double the L4,809bn for the previous year. At the same time, it was announced that Mr Romano Prodi, chairman, had handed in his resignation to Mr Lamberto Dini, minister for the treasury, the sole shareholder of Iri, which transformed in 1992 into a Treasury-controlled public company with a current capital of L15,000bn, Of the losses, L8,317bn was attributed to the reorganisation and restructuring of Iri's subsidiaries in the steel and construction/engineering sectors - Ilva and Iri-Tecna. But the heavy financial charges resulting from its L75,000bn debts, which include those of telecommunications and autostrada subsidiaries, also played a part. Debt directly attributable to the holding company was L18,085bn, against L20,000bn the previous year. Iri indicated that some L5,000bn of losses was due to the reorganisation of its Ilva steel group and at Iri-Tecna, its construction/engineering arm. Ilva is in the process of being privatised and an announcement is close on the sale of its special steels operations. Coinciding with yesterday's meeting, the Official Gazette published details of the decree approved by the previous Ciampi government allowing Iri to restructure some of its debt. This involves the issue of up to L10,000bn in bonds by the treasury-controlled Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. The departure of Mr Prodi has been widely foreshadowed. He agreed a year ago to return to Iri having been chairman from 1982-89. However he has found himself out of sympathy with the Berlusconi government. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new prime minister, has made no real effort to retain his services at Iri and is even reported to have offered him a European Commissioner's job in Brussels. Mr Prodi, who nurtures political ambitions, is expected to return to his economic research institute in Bologna in the short term. His departure raises big questions about the future direction of Iri, especially as the Berlusconi government is pledged to accelerate privatisation. During his chairmanship, Mr Prodi has overseen the privatisation of part of the foodstuffs group SME, and two banks - Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana.</p>

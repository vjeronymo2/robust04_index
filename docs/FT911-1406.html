			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Your way to avoid travel nightmares - Holiday insurance DO YOU dream of a romantic evening, sipping cocktails in front of a tropical sunset? If so, you may also have nightmares about finding out shortly afterwards that your holiday company, or airline, has abruptly folded. Surprisingly, many travel insurance companies do not provide cover for this, and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) only recommends policies which do provide such cover. One of these is Accident &amp; General's 'TravelGuard Gold', which will repay up to Pounds 5,000 of pre-paid money in the event of 'tour organiser failure'. If you are unlucky enough to be caught out of the country when this happens, you will be reimbursed the relevant proportion of your money after your return. It is worth reconsidering a policy that does not offer this cover. Some holiday companies insist that you use the insurance offered with their package, a practice which the Consumers' Association opposes. Which, the association's magazine, recommends that you should look for the following as minimum requirements in your holiday cover: Medical expenses (for Pounds 250,000 in Europe, and Pounds 1m in the rest of the world). This cover should include the option of a flight home by air ambulance. Cancellation or curtailment of your holiday (for the full cost of the holiday, including all subsidiary charges). This should mean you are not too much out of pocket if you suddenly fall ill, have to appear in court as juror or witness, lose your job - although insurers will insist you were in full-time employment for a year before you were made redundant - or your house is severely damaged. Belongings and money (for about Pounds 1,500). Note that the largest amount you can receive on any one item could be as low as Pounds 200. There is also sometimes a limit on 'valuables' alone, and it is worth checking up the insurance company's precise definition of this term. If it includes cameras and personal stereos you may not be fully covered. Delayed departure (Pounds 20 or more for the first 12 hours, and the full holiday cost if you cancel after waiting more than 24 hours). Very useful for those who do not enjoy the architecture of airport departure lounges, this should provide cover against bad weather, mechanical failure in the aeroplane, and strikes by flight controllers. Delayed baggage (Pounds 75 to cover emergency purchases). Makes it less necessary to carry all your bathroom kit with you as hand luggage Personal liability (up to Pounds 1m). There is a minimal risk that you will be held legally responsible for serious damage while you are abroad, but if it does happen you will be very grateful to have paid the tiny premium. Accident &amp; General charges a premium of Pounds 17.55 for the first 17 days of a holiday in Europe and Pounds 38 for the same length of time worldwide. Special rates can be negotiated for family holidays, and the retired or elderly will usually pay more. The Which cheapest buys, for those with no special requirements, are Pounds 13.30 for two weeks in Europe, and Pounds 31.40 (or Pounds 42.30 for the retired or elderly) for the same time spent worldwide. Family holidays weigh in at Pounds 34.50 and Pounds 94.20. Separate policies are offered if you intend indulging in winter sports or sub-aqua diving. Underwriters ghoulishly assert that 4 per cent of people who go skiing return with at least one broken limb. Trekking holidays in mountainous areas can also require higher cover - for walking in Nepal, you are advised to insure against a helicopter being called to evacuate you. A three-month expedition to the peak of Everest could be covered in full for Pounds 162 per person. Non-technical trekking could be insured for around Pounds 54 per person for up to six weeks. You may not have realised that you will not be covered for injuries sustained playing rugby abroad. Health insurance will not usually extend to HIV-related illnesses, and insurance against nuclear hazards is not available on the general market. Abta's advice is to contact Lloyd's underwriters if you are worried about any of these. Political risks are the jokers in the pack. Insurers' assessments tend to be based on the Foreign Office's judgment. Up-to-date warnings are available from the Foreign Office information office, on 071-270-4129. Reading the list of countries where the FCO recommends particular caution is a sobering experience and you are categorically advised not to visit the following countries under any circumstances: Chad, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Togo, Somalia and Sudan. You are advised to take out extra insurance for going to Nepal if you plan leaving Kathmandu; large areas of Peru and Kenya are unsafe; there is diphtheria in the Soviet Union; and meningitis in Tanzania. Other nations where certain precautions are currently advised by the FCO include: Afghanistan, Albania, Cameroon, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Israeli-occupied territories, Kiribati, Kuwait, Nicaragua, Niger, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Romania, Rwanda, Saudia Arabia, Senegal, Tibet, Turkey, Uganda, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yugoslavia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Check for the latest information before planning a trip to any of these countries. Insurance cover may be more expensive, or unobtainable, if the FCO warns against going. You certainly will not be covered if you do anything which the FCO specifically proscribes.</p>

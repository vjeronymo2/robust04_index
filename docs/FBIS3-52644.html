The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali,  while briefing the committee on Pak-India talks in Islamabad  today, said that the talks focused on the Kashmir issue. The  Pakistan side emphasized that India must take visible steps to  reduce repression in the Indian-held Kashmir, including  deinduction [reduction] of troops from the valley, release of  political leaders, and their unhindered access to the human  rights organizations and foreign governments. The committee was  informed by the foreign minister that although the talks failed  to achieve any results, the fact that Kashmir remained the focus  of attention during the talks and acknowledgment by India that  Kashmir was a disputed area amounts to a diplomatic gain for us.</p>

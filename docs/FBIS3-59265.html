			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Jiyun (0719 4480 0061), Survey and </F> Statistics Department, Jiangxi Branch, People's Bank: "Problems  and Suggestions Stemming From Changes in the Wake of  Deregulation of Grain Prices and Dealings"]    [Text] This is the first year of decontrol of grain prices  and dealings in Jiangxi Province, and it is also a year of  intensification of reform of the grain circulation system.  Recently, the People's Bank in Jiangxi Province made a special  survey of the effect on agricultural production and the  peasants' income following decontrol of grain prices and  dealings, what new circumstances and new problems might occur in  the procurement, marketing, transportation, and storage grain  enterprises may face under the new system, and what effect these  new problems may occasion for the bank. Results of the survey  show that cancellation of command style plans in agriculture and  decontrol of grain markets have played a positive role in  stabilizing grain production, increasing the peasants' income,  and systematizing grain procurement and marketing. Nevertheless,  some problems remain in production, procurement, and marketing.  <H3>  I. Current Status of Grain Production, Procurement, and  Marketing Throughout the Province </H3>   With the establishment of a socialist market economy, the  former highly centralized system in which the state controlled  the allocation of all grain is no longer in keeping with the new  situation in rural villages where contract procurement that  expresses the deregulation of grain procurement and marketing  has come about in response to the times. Surveys everywhere show  that the new grain production, procurement, and marketing system  exhibits new vitality.    A. Restructuring of agriculture continues, the grain growing  area decreasing. With the cancellation of command style planting  plans, the peasants enjoy greater authority to make their own  production decisions. They are free to plan production  rationally on the basis of market supply and demand, as their  own circumstances require, growing whatever they like. This has  greatly stimulated a restructuring of rural industry. Survey of  the farm crop growing area shows a decline in the area planted  to grain. Statistics show a 20,469,300 mu area throughout the  province sown to grain in the spring of 1993, 7.8 percent less  than in 1992. The percentage of the total crop area planted to  grain decreased from 72.8 percent in 1992 to 68.7 percent in  1993. This included a 18,477,000 mu area planted to early rice,  1,956,000 mu less than in 1992. The area planted to superior  hybrid grain varieties increased, more high yield, premium  quality, and high economic benefit varieties being sown. Survey  statistics for nine counties in Ji'an Prefecture show a 12,417  mu increase in the area sown to premium quality early rice, up  3.8 percent from 1992. Premium quality rice was planted in 54.5  percent of the total early rice growing area. In Shangrao  Prefecture, 1.5 million mu was planted to premium quality rice.  This was 60 percent of the total rice growing area, and a 25  percent over the same period in 1992. The early rice growing  area increased from 15 percent in 1991 to 60 percent in 1993. In  Jingdezhen city, 165 peasant households planted 1.96 percent  less grain in 1993 than in 1992 while increasing the area sown  to hybrid varieties 19.44 percent over 1992.    B. Grain marketing has become livelier, the amount of grain  in storage "deflating" markedly. Jiangxi is an agricultural  province that has suffered from "difficulty selling grain" in  recent years. Granaries throughout the province are filled to  overflowing, grain storage tying up a large amount of bank  credit. Following decontrol of grain sales markets, grain  companies seized the opportunity to transform their operating  mechanisms in an effort to stimulate sales and develop marketing  farther afield, grain marketing becoming livelier in  consequence. During the first quarter of 1993, Fuzhou Prefecture  marketed 524 million jin of trade grain, 341 million jin of it  parity price grain, and 201 million jin of it negotiated price  grain. This represented a respective 78.4, 40.4, and 229.3  percent increase over the same period in 1992. As of the end of  the first quarter of 1993, the prefecture's granaries contained  1.87 billion jin of grain, 406 million jin less than at the end  of 1992. Grain loans decreased by 24.81 million yuan, 40.7  million yuan more than for the same period in 1992. As of the  end of May, grain in storage throughout the province decreased  by 4.273 billion jin.    C. The price of grain rallied, peasants anticipated income  rising, and their interest in growing grain increasing.  Following grain market decontrol, prices rallied everywhere. In  Nanchang markets, the price of premium grade early crop long  grain and premium grade late crop long grain rice increased more  than 17 percent. The trend continues strong and the outlook is  good. Currently, the early crop market price is 27 yuan per 50  kilograms, and the late crop market price is 33 yuan per 50  kilograms, both exceeding the sum of the floor price and the  excess price. In addition, individual grain dealers are  numerous, grain marketing channels widening. Competition with  the state-owned grain sector is intense, and expectations are  that grain prices will continue to rise. Thanks to the upturn in  the grain market, grain prices have picked up tremendously and  the peasants have received tangible benefits. Comparison of  February 1993 with July and August of 1993 shows a 72 yuan per  mu increase in peasant income from the upturn in prices alone.  The People's Bank in Fuzhou Prefecture reports that the peasants  are happy to grow grain following the upturn in grain prices.  Formerly a 420,000 mu reduction in the grain growing area was  planned, but only a 380,000 mu reduction occurred.  <H5>  II. Several Existing Problems </H5>   The decontrol of grain prices and grain dealings occurred  against a background of a still not very highly developed grain  market. Consequently several problems remain in the contract  procurement of grain that are manifested in "four difficulties  and one low."    A. "Difficulties in implementation" of grain procurement  contracts. Ganzhou, Yichun, Fuzhou, and Yingtan prefectures, and  Jingdezhen City report that since the deregulation of grain  procurement, some peasants are resentful for various reasons.  They suppose that now that fixed procurement quotas have been  abolished, it is no longer necessary to sign contracts. As of  the end of May, contracts signed in the three prefectures and  Jingdezhen City numbered 83.5, 76.4, 90, 82.7, and 66.0 percent  of the planned number. The reason for this poor showing is that  the basis for the "market price" in contract procurement is not  clear. The peasants have misgivings. They fear that contracts  may not be honored. The contracts that grain departments sign  with peasants explicitly provide that when the market price of  grain is lower than the floor price, all grain covered by the  contract will be purchased from the peasants at the floor price;  and when the market price of grain is higher than the ceiling  price, all grain covered by the contract will be purchased at  the market price. This is a fine means for protecting the  peasants' personal welfare, but it is difficult to live up to in  practice. Since no document stipulates the time of the market  price that is to be used, the market price of what department or  jurisdiction, or who is to subsidize the "inversion" that this  method pricing causes, disputes are inevitable. Second is  favoritism in the issuance of downpayments on porocurement,  which damages the peasant's interests. The Fuzhou Prefecture  People's Bank reports that Nanyue County issued 4.44 million  yuan in advance payments during 1993, 2 million of which was in  cash, the remaining 2.44 million being issued in the form of  "fertilizer" coupons. In Dingxi County, 4.25 million yuan of  payments in advance was entirely in the form of supply and  marketing cooperative credit on sales. Since they are unable to  sell it or the available kinds or quality of the fertilizer is  poor, the peasants were very resentful and even created  problems. Third government departments interference and  deductions are numerous, the peasants' burdens remaining fairly  heavy. The Ganzhou Prefecture People's Bank reported that the  peasants still must pay more than 90 assessments of various  kinds. In order to meet their payment quotas, when governments  at all levels sign grain contracts with peasants, they attach a  schedule showing taxes and fees to be deducted. After the grain  is sold and accounts settled, the peasants obtain almost no cash  at all. A survey conducted in a certain village in Ningdu County  showed the contract ordering of 9,400 kilograms of grain, but  10,050 kilograms was needed to offset the payment of various  taxes and fees. Obviously, the peasants do not want to sign such  contracts.    B. Grain enterprises will face "difficulty buying grain."  Grain market decontrol demolished the "monopoly" position of the  state-owned grain units. It produced a situation of multiple  economic components, multiple ways of doing business, and  multiple circulation channels all competing with each other.  Because of their own limitations, grain departments may face  future procurement difficulties. The first problem is that only  85.7 percent of the planned contract procurement contracts for  the province have been concluded. Second, is the dispersal of  sources of grain. Not only do collectives and individuals  compete for grain, but people from neighboring Fujian,  Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces stream to Jiangxi to buy  grain. They go from door to door to buy it; they pay high prices  for it; they pay on the spot, and they make no deductions.    C. Difficulties obtaining grain procurement money. Pressures  on grassroots level banks have increased. No issuance of  I.O.U.'s for grain in 1993 is an important guarantee the state  has made to gain the peasants' confidence. However, owing to the  the high speed growth of investment in fixed assets this year,  and the craze for buying stocks and bonds, and for pooling  funds, savings have grown only slowly, funds have dispersed in  many directions, and banks have trouble finding money to pay  out. At the same time, because of local governments' fiscal  straits, grain enterprises' serious losses and accounts owing,  and the sluggish turnover of bank funds, money is in short  supply throughout society and banks find the going difficult. A  survey of the Fuzhou Prefecture People's Bank shows that up  until 1991, the prefecture government was able to allocate 287  million yuan to subsidize losses in the grain sectors, but now  it is unable to provide a cent. Instead it must increase  interest payments by 14 million each year. As of the end of  1992, grain enterprises had posted losses of 347 million yuan,  an amount equal to the prefecture's fiscal receipts for 1 1/2  years. Since more than 60 percent of the Bank of Agriculture's  total credit was tied up in loans for the purchase of  agricultural and sideline products, and thus did not turn over  rapidly, the banks were operating under an overload. Thus, a  situation occurred very easily in which the People's Bank alone  had to ensure the funds needed for grain procurement. The  Shangrao Prefecture People's Bank reports an abnormal shortage  of Bank of Agriculture credit funds in the prefecture at the  present time. As of the end of May, it still owned banks at a  higher level a net 15.31 million yuan. Meanwhile, more than 780  grassroots level banks throughout the prefecture had only  somewhat more than 20 million yuan in People's Bank contingency  savings accounts. Some grassroots level branches that even had  trouble paying the salaries of enterprise staff members and  workers and paying out funds held in savings accounts, had to  supply the money for the procurement of 530 million jin of  contract grain as well. Finding the money needed to buy 265,000  dan of cotton and 120,000 dan of tobacco is very difficult.  Unless banks at a higher level are able to allocate quickly the  funds needed for procurement, the issuance of I.O.U.'s for grain  procurement will be virtually unavoidable.    D. Authority over grain is highly centralized; grain  marketing is decontrolled but not open making "invigoration  difficult." The method of handling the buying and selling of  grain under the planning system long prevented grain enterprises  from making their own decisions about grain dealings. Today,  although the state has deregulated grain prices and dealings,  the deregulation applies only to grain sold at negotiated  prices, but authority for plan procurement grain and grain that  the government uses to regulate the market, which still accounts  for the bulk of grain procurement, is still centralized in the  hands of the central government and the provincial governments.  Grassroots grain agencies still lack the authority to make  decisions about this grain. A Xinyu City People's Bank survey  shows that as of the end of April the city had 233.01 million  kilograms of grain in storage, 118.47 million kilograms of which  was being stored for the state, 22.6 million kilograms of which  belonged to the State Council for use in regulating grain  markets, and 65.53 million kilograms of which was parity price  grain. The negotiated price grain over which grain enterprises  could really exercise authority amounted to only 26.41 million  kilograms, or 11.3 percent of the total. This high  centralization of grain authority has resulted not only in  swollen granaries, the accumulation of old grain, and serious  waste, but it has also dampened the interest in grain dealings  of grassroots grain units.    E. Returns from grain farming remain fairly low; the number  of peasants going elsewhere to work is on the rise. Abandonment  of the land should be a cause for serious concern. A Jingdezhen  City People's Bank survey shows a peasant income of 344.20 yuan  and expenses of 263.90 yuan per mu of grain for a net income of  80.3 yuan per mu. This net income does not include tractor,  water, electricity, and fuel expenses, and various withholdings.  After a further deduction for grain retained for their own  consumption, the peasants have virtually no cash income. Their  income is far lower than what can be made from growing cash  crops or leaving the land to work. Because of the relative low  returns from the growing of grain, the number of young members  of the work force who are leaving the land to work elsewhere has  risen sharply. As a result, some farmland has been abandoned and  allowed to lie fallow. During 1993, more than 70,000 people in  Shangrao, Guangfeng, Boyang, Yugan, and Yongxin counties have  left the land to work elsewhere. Ruichang City reports the  departure of 38,000 people for jobs elsewhere during 1993,  double the 1992 number and approximately 33 percent of the  city's rural manpower. Thirty-one of the 51 able-bodied workers  in Team 4 at Xiaban Village in the same city have left for jobs  elsewhere, leasing to peasants in nearby townships 320 of the  village's 600 mu of farmland, which is unintensively farmed.  Dexing City reports that 10 mu of wetlands lie fallow because of  the departure of peasants from the city. In several townships  and villages, between 20 and 30 percent of paddy fields were not  being farmed in May. It is estimated that the city's early paddy  crop will be 3 million kilograms less than in 1992. The  Jingdezhen Municipal People's Bank reported that 12 percent of  the reduction in the early paddy growing area is attributable to  growing only a single rather than a double crop.  <H5>  III. Several Suggestions </H5>   Bread is the staff of life. Grain is a strategic commodity  that has a bearing on social tranquility and the development of  economic stability. It affects the personal well-being of 1  billion Chinese. Further good implementation of grain  production and marketing policies, and doing a good job of grain  procurement are of major importance in ensuring stable grain  production and long and peaceful governance. Some problems  remain in the wake of the deregulation of grain prices and grain  dealings. All departments concerned should take action and work  steadily to solve them.    A. The implementation of all policy measures regarding grain  production must be ensured to gain the confidence of the people.  First, all possible must be done to make down payments on grain  procurement to households so that the peasants will have the  funds they need for production. Second is the need to adhere to  contracts and to ceiling and floor prices in the procurement of  grain , halting the deduction of various fees in grain  procurement, allowing money from the sale of grain to reach the  peasants' hands. Third is the need to control the steady rise in  prices of agricultural means of production, and to lower the  cost of seed grain for further increase in peasant interest in  growing grain.    B. Completion of grain procurement and marketing system  reform to invigorate enterprises. In the sale of grain to  regulate markets, provinces should delegate directly to  grassroots grain units all plan allocation grain quotas, grain  sales outside plan being centrally regulated by the province.  This would not only ensure the province's plan procurement, but  would also help deregulate and enliven grassroots grain units.    C. Grain units should improve their service attitude, change  their work methods, overcome current difficulties, and continue  to maintain and develop their roles as principal channels.    D. A good job should continue to be done specialized  household administration of grain procurement funds to ensure  that adequate funds are available on time, and to prevent their  draining away or diversion to other purposes. As an  accompaniment to grain circulation system reform, a gradual  change should be made from grain procurement funds to a grain  regulation fund, setting up special grain regulation fund  administration agencies to replace the specialized household  administration of grain procurement funds.</p>

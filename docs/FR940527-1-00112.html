Section 413.134 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. In paragraph (d)(1), the phrase ``where permitted under &sect;413.134(a)(3),'' is revised to read ``when permitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section,''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2)(ii) are revised, and paragraphs (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv) and (e)(4) are added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revisions and additions are to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;413.134 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation based on asset costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Incentive.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an incentive for funding, investment income on funded depreciation is not treated as a reduction of allowable interest expense. Investment income earned on deposits before the 6-month period elapses are not offset unless the deposits are withdrawn for an improper purpose during this period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Borrowing for a purpose for which funded depreciation account funds should have been used makes the borrowing unnecessary to the extent that funded depreciation account funds were available at the time of the borrowing. Available funds in the funded depreciation account, to the extent of the unnecessary borrowing, are called ``tainted'' funds. Interest expense incurred on borrowing for a capital purpose is not an allowable cost to the extent that funded depreciation account funds were available at the time of the borrowing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A provider can remove the ``unnecessary'' characterization of borrowing, and thereby cure tainted funded depreciation, by using the tainted funds for a proper purpose described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. However, any funded depreciation that existed at the time of the unnecessary borrowing and is not classified as tainted must be used before any of the tainted funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) When only a portion of the borrowing is considered unnecessary under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, subsequent repayments of such borrowing from general funds is applied first to the allowable portion of the borrowing and then, when all of the allowable borrowing is repaid, to the unallowable portion of the borrowing. When funds from the funded depreciation account are used for the repayment of the unnecessary borrowing, an equivalent amount of tainted funds is cured without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section. Similarly, where general funds are used to pay for the unallowable borrowing after the necessary borrowing has been repaid, an equivalent amount of tainted funded depreciation is cured without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Loans from funded depreciation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) When the general fund of the provider borrows from the funded depreciation to obtain working capital for normal operating expenses to furnish patient care, interest incurred by the general fund is an allowable operating cost only if the interest expense is supported by documents that evidence that the funds were borrowed and that payment of interest and repayment of the funds are required, is separately identified in the provider's accounting records, and meets the necessary and proper tests described in &sect;&sect;413.153 (b)(2) and (b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Loans from funded depreciation to the general fund are considered investments of funded depreciation, but do not have to meet the readily marketable test described in paragraph (e) of this section. Loans made from funded depreciation are subject to the requirement that funded depreciation must be available for the acquisition of depreciable assets used to furnish patient care, or for other capital purposes related to patient care. Costs incurred to secure lines of credit from lending institutions to ensure such availability are not allowable costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Funding of depreciation from general funds will not be recognized to the extent of any outstanding loans from the funded depreciation account to the general fund. Deposits from the general fund into the funded depreciation account must be first applied to reduce any loans outstanding from the funded depreciation to the general fund. When the loans are repaid in full, general funds deposited in the funded depreciation account are considered as repayments of the general fund. Therefore, any subsequent interest expense of the general fund paid to the funded depreciation fund is not an allowable cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. In &sect;413.153, paragraph (d)(2) is revised and a new paragraph (d)(3) is added to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;413.153 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Interest expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In determining whether a loan was made for the purpose of acquiring a facility, we apply any owner's investment or funds first to the tangible assets, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goodwill. If the owner's investment or funds are not sufficient to cover the cost allowed for tangible assets, we apply funds borrowed to finance the acquisition to the portion of the allowed cost of the tangible assets not covered by the owner's investment, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the goodwill. Repayments of the funds borrowed are applied first to the tangible assets, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the goodwill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When a provider borrows funds for a purpose related to patient care, but only some of the funds are necessary, repayments of the loan are applied first to pay for the necessary portion of the loan. Only after all of the necessary portion has been repaid are any repayments applied to the unnecessary portion of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart H_Payment for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

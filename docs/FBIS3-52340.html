			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd arrived in  Beirut at 1900 and left for Israel at 2200 yesterday. He began  his talks in a meeting with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz at the  Foreign Ministry. After a news conference, the two proceeded to  the Presidential Palace, where a meeting was held with President  Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. President al-Hirawi held a  dinner banquet in honor of Hurd, which was attended by Birri,  al-Hariri, Buwayz, and a number of ministers.    At a news conference following his talks with Buwayz, the  British foreign secretary said that his visit to Beirut has two  goals: The first is to learn all the latest developments  regarding the peace process that pertain to Lebanon. He said:  We in Britain realize that peace must be comprehensive and  involve an agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well as the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 to open the  way for the implementation of the al-Ta'if Agreement and to  enable Lebanon to regain its full independence. This is  important to us.    Hurd added: The second goal goes beyond the peace process.  You in Lebanon are embarking on a reconstruction process after  the war with skill, enthusiasm, and dynamism, as anyone would  expect from the Lebanese on economic issues. I am anxious to  understand what is happening so that we in Britain can translate  this into cooperation and assistance, and this is what I did. I  am pleased to note that our British exports to Lebanon increased  quickly in the last month of last year. I am very pleased that  British companies are interested in the airport project. I hope  that the increasing exchange of trade and ministerial visits  will help promote such cooperation.    He added: I want cooperation to expand to include the  cultural field, cooperation between our armed forces, and  cooperation in combating drug trafficking.    Hurd explained that he did not come as a mediator in the  Middle East negotiations. But Britain has an interest in the  success of the peace process, and if it can do something to  help, it will do so without becoming a mediator.    Hurd said: Lebanon is a principal partner in the Middle East  peace process. Peace must be comprehensive. We welcomed the  September agreement between the PLO and Israel. We think that  this is a very important step forward. But it is clear to me  that it will not become final until agreements are concluded  between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. We are  maintaining close contacts with the Jordanians, the Israelis,  and the Syrians. He noted that the summit meeting between  Presidents Clinton and al-Asad is very important and expressed  the hope that it will advance the negotiations on the  Syrian-Israeli track and make it possible to overcome the  difficulties. He noted that he is in touch with the U.S.  secretary of state on the peace process.    Hurd affirmed Britain's support for UN Security Council  Resolution 425 and said: All these matters are linked to the  al-Ta'if Agreement, which we strongly support. These matters  must be implemented in stages. Resolution 425 and the al-Ta'if  Agreement-- which we support--are the basis for progress and for  Lebanon regaining its complete freedom.    Minister Buwayz said:    [Begin recording] [Buwayz] I would like first to welcome His  Excellency Minister Douglas Hurd on his visit to Lebanon. As  you know, and as I have already said during my visit to the  United Kingdom, Britain has a long history that qualifies it to  understand the problems of this area. There is no doubt that as  Arab foreign ministers we have repeatedly called for effective  participation by the European countries. When we refer to the  European countries, we include Britain, of course. We think  that in view of Britain's historical role in the Middle East, it  is qualified to play a role in bilateral negotiations and in the  peace process.    The talks between us dealt with the regional situation, the  peace process, and ways to promote economic and cultural  cooperation between Lebanon and Britain. We think that  Lebanon's democracy, its free economic system, and the  effectiveness of the Lebanese private sector provide numerous  common denominators between the two countries and peoples and  make it possible to discuss ways for fruitful cooperation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did Secretary Hurd suggest  anything new to advance the peace process?    [Buwayz] Mr. Hurd is closely following the peace process.  There is no doubt that as a result of his visit and becoming  acquainted with the Lebanese views on the occupied territory in  the south, he will be able to play a role in one way or another.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct]  implementation of Resolution 425?    [Buwayz] I think that you have heard Mr. Hurd clearly state  Britain's frank position on this resolution. I imagine that  Britain is known for its firm views and positions.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you regard the British role  today as complementing the U.S. role [words indistinct]?    [Buwayz] I imagine that there is cooperation between  Britain,  the United States, and a number of European states to promote  the peace process.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what about the British role in  the reconstruction of Lebanon? Were there new developments on  this matter?    [Buwayz] Of course, we held talks on this matter. As you  know, British companies specialize in various sectors. I think  that Britain is interested in Lebanon because of its democratic  system and free economy and because of the things we have in  common. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Tax hopes for staff insurance premiums: New Inland Revenue proposals go to consultation Directors and employees would no longer be taxed on insurance premiums paid by their companies under proposals unveiled by the Inland Revenue yesterday. Taxpayers would also be able to seek rulings from the Revenue on the tax treatment of transactions before they submit their annual returns, according to details in a separate wide-ranging consultation document issued yesterday. The first Revenue document considers extending tax relief on some or all areas of risk covered by directors' and officers' (D &amp; O) insurance policies. The proposals are topical at a time when there is growing litigation against directors and others in connection with corporate collapses in the wake of the recession. At present, any such premiums paid by companies are taxable as a benefit in kind. The Revenue estimates that providing full relief would cost about Pounds 5m a year. The idea was raised by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, in the finance bill debate in March. The Revenue said yesterday that if the consultation exercise suggested the need for reform, the changes could be proposed in November in time for the next finance bill. The document questions whether all risks covered by D &amp; O policies - such as breach of trust or duty, neglect, error and mis-statement - should be eligible for relief. It suggests tax relief might also be extended to cover the costs of the defence of those charged and acquitted of fraud, dishonesty and malicious conduct, which are not normally covered by insurance policies. It proposes extending the tax reliefs to premiums paid by directors and officers themselves, as well as those paid by their companies - which it estimates as negligible. It also suggests exemptions to meet uninsured liabilities by directors and employees, which it says might very tentatively amount to Pounds 30m a year. The second consultative document issued yesterday proposes details of a system for 'pre-return rulings' for income, corporation and capital gains tax. It followed an announcement of the idea by Mr Dorrell at the annual dinner the previous evening of the Association of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Taxes and Senior Revenue Officials. The Revenue said that taxpayers would be able to apply after a transaction but before filing their tax return to obtain a ruling on how it should be assessed for tax. In exchange for a fee reflecting the cost of the service, they would also be able to seek guidance on tax treatment before they undertook a transaction. The idea ties in with the move towards self-assessment on personal income tax and pay and file by companies. Comments on the insurance document are due by June 23 this year and on the pre-rulings document by July 18.</p>

Four citizens in the camp were killed. Firing  continued for over (?an hour).    The report states that the Zairian forces succeeded in  capturing one of the rebels, after which the group of rebel  Garang threatened to kill the official in charge of (Dango), the  police officer, and the official in charge of the refugees,  unless a detained rebel who had participated in the attack was  handed over.    The Zairian authorities have condemned the aggression  inflicted by the rebels on refugee camps and refused the rebel  demand. In response to the rebel provocations, they have sent a  large force of Zairian soldiers to secure the camp and the  surrounding area. UNHCR headquarters in Geneva has been  informed about the incident.</p>

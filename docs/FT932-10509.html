			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Winners shun talk of election deals LABOUR AND the Liberal Democrats distanced themselves from pacts yesterday, but their gains in former Conservative strongholds heightened expectations that a way will be found to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote in the next general election. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said that gains for Labour councillors in counties such as Berkshire, Hertfordshire and Essex proved there were no longer 'no-go' areas for the party. 'This shows that those who still claim that Labour cannot win the next general election by itself are talking nonsense,' he said. 'I am not in favour of going into pacts.' Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president, dismissed Mr Smith's claim as implausible, and was equally swift to reject the idea of pre-election deals. 'We don't think electoral pacts work,' he said. 'We didn't have pacts on Thursday night. The voters are increasingly sophisticated as to how to use their votes'. The Liberal Democrats were at pains to emphasise that some of their gains were at the expense of Labour, and that there was a positive vote for their distinctive policies. Each party would have presentational difficulties with a formal arrangement. For Labour, it would be seen as an admission that alone it could not defeat the Conservatives. For the Liberal Democrats, too close an association with Labour might alienate their 'soft Tory' support. But there were signs that the question of co-operation will loom increasingly large. Mr Kennedy said: 'Labour must recognise that we have a pluralistic system and that it is absurd to go on talking about a two-party system.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, is to take up the theme in a speech next Wednesday intended to develop his emphasis on a 'new language of politics'. The Labour leadership will not change its language - although individual MPs might do so - but changes being made in their own right, in particular the loosening of the ties with the unions and work of the Plant commission on electoral reform even for elections to Westminster, are bound make the informal co-operation between the two parties a more likely prospect.</p>

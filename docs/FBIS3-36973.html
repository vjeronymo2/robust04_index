A  resolution adopted by the Duma has proposed to the executive and  legislature to form a working group jointly with trade unions of  the north for promptly adopting decisions to find a way out of  the social and economic crisis that prevails in northern  regions, and also to monitor the implementation of these  decisions.    While preparing a draft budget for 1994, the government has  also been recommended to foresee the purposeful formation of  economic mechanisms for finding a way out of the crisis and to  ensure social guarantees to citizens living and working in the  northern regions.    The State Duma has instructed the Federal and Political  Affairs Committee of the house, in particular, to prepare a  draft concept of a federal law on state policy in northern  regions of the Russian Federation and present for consideration  of the Duma by April 20 this year.    This State Duma has made it binding on this committee to  prepare and present for consideration of the house proposals  about introducing changes and addenda into the Russian  Federation law "on state guarantees and compensations to people  living and working in areas of the farthest north and equated to  them localities." The Duma considers to give priority to review  this draft bill in this year, and also other documents, which  will be prepared in context of the social-economic situation  created in the northern regions of Russia.</p>

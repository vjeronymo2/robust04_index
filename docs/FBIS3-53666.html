			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 Jan (MENA)--The Sudanese weekly newspaper  AL-MASIRAH claimed in its issue published yesterday that the  MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY-MENA is providing the Sudanese  opposition newspaper AL-ITTIHAD AL-DUWALIYAH with a newscast  free of charge after being instructed by the Egyptian Government  to do so.    MENA says that this claim is not true. The news agency  challenges anyone to prove that it is distributing its casts  free of charge upon instruction from any side. Such a move goes  against its policies and traditions as an independent media  institution with a commercial base. Therefore, it does not  provide any media services free whether to a Sudanese or  non-Sudanese newspaper, or even to an Egyptian newspaper.    The news agency affirms to the Sudanese newspaper that  published the report that the Sudanese opposition newspaper has  no agreements with MENA to provide it with news reports.  Therefore, the Sudanese newspaper's report is part of attempts  to discredit Egyptian media.    MENA hopes that the Sudanese newspaper will confirm its  reports before publishing them so that it will not lose its  credibility.</p>

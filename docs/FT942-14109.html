			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Lockheed turns in 21% lift for quarter Lockheed, the US defence group, reported a 21 per cent increase in first-quarter net earnings. It attributed the performance mainly to good results in its aeronautical systems and electronic systems divisions. The company made Dollars 92m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, compared with Dollars 76m, or Dollars 1.22, in the same period of last year. Revenues totalled Dollars 3bn, up 21 per cent on last year's Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, said the company had also produced 'significant positive cashflow and continued the rapid improvement in our financial position'. It had generated net free cashflow after dividends of more than Dollars 240m. At the end of the period, its net debt-to-capital ratio was 38 per cent, down from 48 per cent a year ago. Programmes which had particularly strong first-quarter results included the F-16 fighter, the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and the F-22, the new-generation fighter under development. The total backlog at the end of the quarter was Dollars 28.2bn, down from Dollars 28.9bn at the end of December. Business other than US defence contracts rose to 39 per cent of sales at the end of the quarter, compared with 34 per cent a year ago. This amount included the group's sales to foreign governments, which made up 16 per cent of total revenues, compared with 10 per cent a year ago.</p>

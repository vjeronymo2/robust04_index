Constantly giving top priority to agricultural development and  invigorating the rural economy in all fields is a matter of  major importance concerning the overall situation. In the  eighties, remarkable achievements were made in our country's  agriculture and the major breakthroughs made in the following  six aspects created favorable conditions for the acceleration of  reform and opening and the accelerated development of the  national economy.    --Agricultural operations broke through the long-standing  old  pattern of unified management under a large public ownership  system. The double-tiered management system, based mainly on the  household output contract system adopted since the beginning of  reform and opening, greatly aroused the peasants' initiative and  enthusiasm for developing production and emancipated the  productive forces in agriculture.    --Agricultural production broke through the long-standing  situation of slow growth. Between 1980 and 1990, the gross  national agricultural output value increased by an average  annual rate of 6.4 percent; the outputs of grain, cotton,  oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops, vegetables, fruits,  pork, beef, mutton, and aquatic products all increased by big  margins; peasant incomes increased by 6.4 percent in comparable  terms and peasants, on the whole, had sufficient food and  clothing for themselves; and the food supply for urban residents  was also greatly enriched.    --The rural economic structure broke through the  long-standing single-cropping and single-farming pattern. The  proportions of forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing  increased. Rural industrial enterprises rose as a new force.  This gradually changed the situation for more than 30 years  past wherein agricultural production was limited to crop farming  and crop farming was limited to grain production.    --The comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture broke  through the long-standing situation of slow growth. Investments  made by the central government, the local governments,  collectives, and individual peasants totalled 151.9 billion  yuan, which was mainly used to strengthen the construction of  basic facilities for agricultural production. The flood  prevention facilities along major rivers and around major lakes  were improved; about 26.7 million hectares of low-yield fields  were transformed and 2.5 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed; a  large number of production bases for various farm products,  improved seeds cultivation bases, and fine breed multiplication  bases were set up; the forest coverage rate increased from 12 to  12.9 percent; the ability to monitor and forecast disastrous  weather for agriculture was enhanced; and various applicable  crop farming, forest-caring, animal farming, and aquicultural  techniques were adopted and spread extensively; and the  comprehensive grain and cotton production capacities increased  from 300 billion kg and 2.5 million tonnes in the early eighties  to 425 billion kg and 4.5 million tonnes in the early nineties.  The comprehensive meat production capacity was also markedly  increased.    --The agricultural economy broke through the pattern of a  natural economy and the level of commercialization and  specialization was greatly enhanced. In the eighties, the  central government and various local governments jointly  invested nearly 5 billion yuan in building a number of  production bases for supplying grain, cotton, meat, and  vegetables. The commercialization rate of farm produce  increased from 54 to 63 percent and the value of exported farm  produce and processed products increased by 150 percent.    --Agricultural development broke through the model of  single-item development [dang xiang kai fa 0830 7309 7030 4099]  and created a new situation of comprehensive development.  Beginning in 1988, the state allocated large amounts of money  for comprehensive agricultural development projects, mainly  aimed at increasing the production of such major products as  grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, meat, and sugar. According to  the principle of comprehensively arranging the building of  forests, roads, fields, and water channels on plains and hilly  land, thus comprehensively utilizing natural resources, 41  comprehensive agricultural development zones were successively  set up in the country. They increased the effective supplies of  farm produce and played a major role in strengthening the  lasting momentum of agricultural development.    In the nineties we must stabilize and sustain agricultural  development to better satisfy the needs of the high-speed  economic growth and the increasingly better-off people in their  daily lives. At present, some difficulties still exist in the  course of stabilizing and quickening agricultural development in  our country. First, agriculture is a sensitive industry, facing  both natural and market risks, and is also a basic industry  which produces vital social effects but only yields modest  economic returns. While the economic structure in our country  is changing into a socialist market economy, because the  economic control and regulatory mechanisms are imperfect, the  economic activities are apt to be driven by immediate economic  returns and funds and materials are apt to be placed in  nonagricultural fields. This is unfavorable to agricultural  development. Second, farmland and other agricultural resources  are continuously decreasing but the population is steadily  increasing. The load on agriculture is getting heavier and  heavier. Third, the material foundation for agriculture remains  rather weak, and the capacity to resist natural disasters  remains inadequate. Fourth, the economic efficiency of  agricultural production is rather low and this affects the  peasants' production enthusiasm. Fifth, in trying to progress  to a more advanced stage, agricultural production lacks low-cost  improved seeds and low-cost new techniques for cultivating  improved varieties and breeds with high efficiency; and the  technological conditions are not suited to the needs of  production development. Therefore, from the long-term and  overall point of view, the task of agricultural development in  the nineties will be extremely arduous.    There still exists great potential for agricultural  development in our country. Of the existing over 95 million  hectares of farmland, intermediate and low-yield land accounts  for about 60 percent. If the soil of such land is properly  treated, the per-mu grain output can be increased by several  hundred jin. Of the existing grassland, second- and third-class  grassland accounts for 80 percent. After being improved, such  grassland can feed several times the current number of animals.  The per-mu aquatic product output of the current water area is  only 95 kg and the return rate of the feed in animal farming is  still quite low. After feeding techniques are improved, the  meat output can be increased substantially. In the whole  country, there are over 33 million hectares of wasteland which  could be reclaimed for agricultural purposes. In addition, over  76.7 million hectares of waste hills and slopes, over 1.3  billion hectares of beaches land, and some 12 million hectares  of fresh water surface can all be developed and used for  agriculture. With the adoption of effective measures and the  increase in agricultural input, and with the accelerating  comprehensive development of agricultural resources, we will be  able to substantially enhance the comprehensive productive  capacity of agriculture.  <H3>  I. Objectives and Guidelines for Agricultural Development in  the Nineties </H3>   First, the main objectives of agricultural development in  our  country in the nineties are to: Comprehensively develop the  rural economy, increase production of major agricultural  products in a stable manner, and to ensure that their quantity,  variety, and quality meet the needs of the comparatively  well-off people in the whole country and the needs of the  developing national economy. By the year 2000, grain output  will reach 500 billion jin; cotton output will reach 5.25  million metric tons; and the production of oil-bearing crops,  sugar-bearing crops, and other cash crops, as well as the  production of meat and aquatic products, should continuously  increase. The rural economy should maintain an appropriate  growth rate. In 2000, the gross national agricultural output  value (calculated according to 1990 constant prices) will reach  1,210 billion yuan, effecting an average annual increase of  about 4 percent. The total output value produced by township  and town enterprises throughout the country will reach 5,290  billion yuan (1990 constant prices), increasing by an average  annual rate of 18.5 percent. The peasants' living standards  will reach the level of being comparatively well-off, with their  per capita net income reaching 1,200 yuan and increasing by 5.8  percent each year. The pace of economic development in poor  areas will be quickened and the masses there will basically have  sufficient food and clothing by the end of this century.    Second, the guidelines for agricultural development in the  nineties are to: Continue to stabilize the production  responsibility system mainly in the form of concluding the  household output contracts; continue to improve the double-tier  management system which combines individual household operations  with unified collective arrangements; greatly develop the  community service systems for agriculture; and to gradually  build up the strength of the collective economies according to  the actual conditions in the various localities. It is  necessary to continuously strengthen the agricultural  foundation, increase input to agriculture, improve the  infrastructural facilities for agriculture, and ensure that  agriculture moves up to a new stage and satisfies the needs of  the national economy's sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu  kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development.  The rural reform should be deepened in the light of the  requirements of establishing and improving the socialist market  economy and the basic facilities and various community service  systems in the fields of rural markets, transportation, storage,  information, and consultation should be built up more  intensively. Agricultural scientific research should be  advanced and technological results should be promoted and spread  extensively, thus guiding agriculture to develop in the  orientation of "high yield, good quality, and high efficiency."  Efforts should be made continuously to organize comprehensive  agricultural development and the comprehensive agricultural  production capacity should be enhanced through the development  of such reserve agricultural resources as waste hills, waste  slopes, waste water areas, waste beaches, and waste sandy land.  The rural production structure and economic structure should be  optimized; great efforts should be made to develop agriculture  oriented toward export and agriculture should be gradually moved  onto the path of "being oriented to the market, more effectively  utilizing resources, optimizing the structure, and enhancing the  efficiency." Crop farming, animal farming, and product  processing should be properly integrated and agricultural  production should be linked with commerce and industry. New  trades and industries should be developed in the rural economy.  The development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and  fishing and the development of the secondary and tertiary  industries should be properly coordinated. The scope of rural  employment should be broadened. Peasants' income should be  increased and peasants' living standards should be raised to the  level of comparatively well-off.  <H3>  II. General Arrangements for Agricultural Development in the  Nineties </H3>   Third, agricultural production must follow the principle of  being arranged according to the local conditions and giving play  to the local advantages in natural resources and the local  economic and technological advantages. Crop farming, animal  husbandry, forestry, and fishing should be developed as long as  the local conditions are suited to such operations. Efforts  should be make to promote the comprehensive development of  agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industry, and  fishery and also to promote regional coordination,  specialization, and commercialization of agricultural production.    Fourth, the state encourages and supports the development of  grain production. Grain production and marketing in the whole  country should be arranged according to the principle of making  all provinces and autonomous regions effect self-sufficiency  first and then transfer surplus grain to nearby areas according  to a reasonable distribution plan. By the end of this century,  most provinces and autonomous regions should be able to  basically effect grain self-sufficiency. A small number of  provinces and autonomous regions that need to take grain from  other areas should establish long-term and stable grain supply  relations with nearby grain-supplying provinces and autonomous  regions. Provinces and autonomous regions that transfer their  grain products to other areas should give play to their  advantage in grain production and properly organize grain  production and marketing according to the actual needs of their  own localities, the state, and other provinces and autonomous  regions; they should do this by bearing the overall national  interests in mind. Provinces and autonomous regions which can  effect grain self-sufficiency should make efforts to develop  grain production and strive to produce sufficient grain for  themselves. All localities should build up their own commodity  grain production bases according to their local conditions. The  variety of grain crops should be adjusted according to the  market demand. Good-quality varieties should be greatly  developed. The production of grain used to feed animals should  also be increased. The middle and lower valleys of the Chang  Jiang and the southeast coastal areas should increase the  production of good-quality rice; the valleys of the Huang He,  Huai He, Hai He, and the northeast region should develop the  production of wheat, corn, and soya bean.    Fifth, the production of cash crops and other crops should  be  concentrated appropriately and arranged according to the local  conditions so that local advantages can be brought into better  play and disadvantages avoided. The cropping arrangements  should be further readjusted according to this principle.  Cotton production should be developed mainly in the plains  between the Huang He, Huai He, and the Hai He; in the plains of  the middle and lower valleys of the Chang Jiang; and in  Xinjiang. As for the production of oil-bearing crops, rapeseed  should be planted mainly in areas south of the Chang Jiang and  peanuts should be grown in areas north of the Chang Jiang. The  production of other oil-bearing crops should also be properly  arranged. As for the production of sugar-bearing crops, sugar  cane growth should be stabilized and developed in the southeast  coastal areas and sugar beet should be grown in the northeast  and northwest regions. At the same time, sugar cane production  in Yunnan and Guangxi should also be increased.    Sixth, forestry production should proceed from fostering  forestry resources, increasing the forest coverage rate, and  increasing the timber and forest product supply capacity.  Production layout should be readjusted. A batch of windbreak  forests, soil conservation forests, and field protection forests  should be planted along the Chang Jiang and along the coastline,  and in northwest China, the northern part of north China, and  the west part of northeast China, the Taihangshan area, and the  plains where strong winds and sandstorms produce harmful effects  and soil erosion is serious. Timber production bases should be  built to rapidly and intensively increase the production of  timber mainly in east China, central and south China, and  southwest China. Areas with favorable conditions, especially  those to the south of the Chang Jiang, can build bases for  oil-bearing trees, perfume, medical materials, and dried fruits.  In hilly areas where there is a shortage of firewood and in the  dry areas of north China, as well as in some coastal areas, fuel  forests should be planted in order to mitigate the short supply  of energy sources in the rural areas. Straw and crop stalks can  be used as fertilizer and as raw materials for generating  methane.    Seventh, animal farming should focus on pig raising and  great  efforts should also be made to increase the feeding of  grain-saving herbivorous animals and poultry. The suburban  areas of large and medium cities should mainly develop the  production of animals, poultry, eggs, and milk in order to meet  the consumption needs of urban residents. Agricultural areas  should continue to promote the production of pork, strive to  increase the supply rate of pigs [chu lan lu 0427 2936 3764],  and increase the production of pigs with leaner meat. At the  same time, it is necessary to spread the technique for making  ammoniac stalks [jie gan an hua ji shu 4447 4427 8637 0553 2111  2611], and greatly develop the feeding of cattle in crop farming  areas. In half-crop-farming and half-animal- farming areas,  attention should be paid to giving play to the favorable  condition of having rich feed and forage grass and we should  more rapidly develop the production of such herbivorous animals  as cattle and sheep. Pastoral areas should attach importance to  the building of grassland and should improve the quality of  forage grass. They should prevent the grassland from  retrograding and becoming eroded by sand and should enhance the  meat production capacity. Efforts should be made to increase  the production of wool in order to meet the needs of the  developing textile industry.    Eighth, freshwater and seawater aquaculture should be  greatly  developed as should oceangoing fishing. Importance should be  attached to the processing and comprehensive use of aquatic  products. The 11 key projects of developing freshwater  aquaculture in the Zhu Jiang Delta area and other areas should  be properly handled. Reservoirs should also be used to produce  aquatic products. Seawater aquaculture should be focused on the  use of coastal beaches. The intensity of offshore fishing  should be strictly controlled and efforts should mainly be made  to catch fish in the middle and upper layers of the East China  Sea and the outer scope of the Huang Hai as well as in the South  China Sea. At the same time, oceangoing fishing should also be  developed more rapidly.  <H3>  III. Relying on Agricultural Scientific and Technological  Progress, Enhancing the Unit Output Rate of Land and Other  Agricultural Resources </H3>   Ninth, to realize the objective of increasing agricultural  production in the nineties, we must grasp the key link of  enhancing the unit area yield of the land. It is necessary to  rely on scientific and technological progress to improve the  conditions for agricultural production and to continuously raise  the unit area yield. In these 10 years, the per-mu output of  grain and cotton should increase by 50 kg and 12 kg  respectively, close to the increases in the eighties.    Tenth, effectively organize adoption of the new water-saving  irrigation techniques and raise the utilization rate of  irrigation water. The water-saving irrigation techniques should  be actively spread in various localities according to their  specific conditions and water-saving farming should be promoted.  The techniques of carrying water through pipes, building water  channels with liners [qu dao chen qi 3255 6670 6000 4265],  preventing leakage, irrigating fields by means of spraying and  dropping should be spread broadly. The maintenance and  management of water conservancy and irrigation works should be  strengthened and the use efficiency of the facilities should be  raised. The utilization rate of irrigating water in our country  should be raised from 40 to about 50 percent.    Eleventh, raising the level of using fertilizers and  pesticides scientifically. It is necessary to adopt the  techniques of using chemical fertilizer deep inside the soil,  applying fertilizer according to the soil-testing formulae, and  combining the use of organic and nonorganic fertilizers. The  utilization rate of chemical fertilizer should be raised from  about 30 to 40 percent. Training should be given to peasants so  that they can use various types of pesticide in good time,  reasonably, and scientifically, thus improving the condition of  preventing and curing plant diseases and wiping out insect  pests. Efforts should be made to spread the use of biological  pesticides and the adoption of biological prevention techniques,  thus reducing the losses caused by plant diseases and pests to  agricultural production.    Twelfth, comprehensive measures should be adopted to improve  the quality of the existing farmland. Sloping fields should be  transformed into terraced fields; fields should be leveled; soil  should be improved; the irrigation and drainage conditions  should be made better; the fertility of the land should be  increased; and scientific farming techniques should be adopted  to transform the low-yield fields which now account for  one-third of the existing farmland. Thus, the unit area output  can be raised substantially.    Thirteenth, It is necessary to make full use of the light,  heat, water, and soil resources; improve the farming techniques;  increase the multiplecropping index; and increase the sown area.  In southern areas, the rate of winter cropping in idle fields  should be raised as should the area intercropping area. In the  southern areas where the light and heat resources are  insufficient for two seasons and more than enough for one  season, the measure of planting ratooning rice should be  adopted. By the end of this century, the multiplecropping index  in the whole country should be raised from 150 percent in the  late eighties to about 160 percent and the sown area should be  increased by an average of some 730,000 hectares every year.    Fourteenth, cultivating, spreading, and popularizing the  adoption of improved seeds and varieties. The agricultural  basic research and applied research should be strengthened. A  number of high-yield, good-quality, disease-resistant, and  pest-resistant varieties and breeds of trees, crops, and animals  should be reserved and cultivated. At the same time, it is  necessary to introduce a number of improved varieties and fine  breeds from abroad in a planned way. While great efforts are  made to spread various types of improved varieties, special  attention should be paid to the cultivation of good quality  high-yield hybrid rice, hybrid corn, and hybrid rape. The breeds  of lean-meat pigs and the fine hybrid breeds of cattle, sheep,  and poultry should be spread more quickly. In the whole  country, the seeds for grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops  should be changed once or twice in the nineties. The rate of  adopting fine breeds of animals, poultry, and aquatic animals  should be further raised.    Fifteenth, making great efforts to spread applicable  agricultural techniques. The use of improved seeds should be  combined with the adoption of advanced techniques. A batch of  markedly effective applicable techniques and technologies should  be selected and spread as key measures. By the year 2000, the  application rate of agricultural scientific research results  should be raised from around 40 to about 50 percent. Efforts  should be made to further advance the "Harvest Plan," the "Spark  Project," the "Spreading Programs," and other activities of  spreading scientific research results and advanced techniques  and technologies. The techniques of model cultivation, dry land  farming, plastic film covering, cultivation on protected land,  optimized farming methods, forecasts of plant diseases and pests  and comprehensive preventive measures; the advanced animal  feeding techniques and the methods of making animal feed,  including the technique of making ammoniac stalks; the  techniques of high-efficiency production of freshwater and  seawater aquatic products, including the methods of  proliferating resources and preventing animal diseases; and the  technologies of keeping farm produce fresh and processing,  storing, and transporting farm produce should be spread broadly.  It is necessary to give extensive technical training and  education to peasants and to increase their scientific and  general knowledge so that they can better master the scientific  farming methods.  <H3>  IV. Reinforcing the Construction of Agricultural Commodities  Production Bases </H3>   Sixteenth, reinforcing the construction of the commodity  production bases for supplying grain, cotton, cooking oil, and  sugar. On the basis of consolidating and improving the existing  commodity grain production base counties, we will build 226 new  bases so that the number of commodity grain base counties  reaches 500. The comprehensive commodity grain production  capacity should reach half of the total national output of  commodity grain and should be built into high-yield,  good-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural bases mainly  producing commodity grain. At the same time, the state-owned  farms in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia should be  turned into agricultural commodity bases mainly producing  commodity grain. In addition, we will set up 150 high-quality  cotton production base counties and a number of new sugar  production bases. A number of state-owned farms producing  cotton, sugar, and rubber will be turned into sample bases for  the specialization and commercialization of agriculture.    Seventeenth, quicken the establishment of bases for  fast-growing and high-yield, special, quality timber forests and  cash-earning forests.    The state needs to establish a number of fast-growing,  high-yield timber forest bases in the provinces and autonomous  regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian,  Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan as well as in the  northeast and Inner Mongolia, planting 5 million hectares of new  trees to increase timber supplies in the early 2000's.  Moreover, it will establish 500 special and quality  cash-earning forest production bases all over China.    Eighteenth, consolidate the development of the "shopping  basket project."    1. The establishment of meat, egg, milk, and vegetable  production bases. We will build 200 new lean pig production  bases and increase the number of butchered pigs by 50 million  annually. We will vigorously promote the technique of raising  cows with ammoniated straw, set up a number of lean cow  production bases and increase the number of butchered cows to  900,000 annually. We will set up milk cow and milk buffalo  production bases in the northeast, Inner Mongolia, and the  southeast, increase the number of milk cattle to 200,000 capable  of supplying 600,000 metric tons [figures as published] of milk  each year. We will set up sheep and goat bases in the northwest  and Inner Mongolia. We will establish a number of intensive and  modern egg and chicken farms as well as a number of vegetable  production bases in some large and medium cities and industrial  and mining areas. We will set up a number of poultry farming  bases in some areas in the south where there are plenty of water  and grass resources.    2. The establishment of bases for the breeding of aquatic  products. For freshwater breeding, we should pay good attention  to the transformation of medium- and low-yield ponds and to the  construction of their supporting projects, improving their yield  per unit of area. We should vigorously develop aquatic product  breeding in large and medium rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and some  low-lying land along the rivers and lakes, building a number of  new bases producing aquatic products. While paying good  attention to the establishment of seawater aquatic product  breeding bases in the Liaodong and Shandong Peninsulas and Bohai  Bay, we will quicken the exploitation and utilization of the  shorelines of southern provinces, vigorously develop the  breeding of valuable marine products, and gradually set up a  number of new bases producing valuable marine products. We will  continue to improve the construction of fishing bases in West  Africa, North America, South America, and South Asia, and the  construction of the deep-sea fishing bases in the South Pacific  and other areas.    Nineteenth, strengthen the construction of export-led bases  for agricultural and sideline products. We will develop  foreign- currency earning agriculture, strengthen international  cooperation and exchanges, push China's agriculture toward the  international market, and quicken the pace of agricultural  modernization. On the basis of consolidating and perfecting the  existing export-led bases for agricultural and sideline  products, we will continue to set up a number of new export-led  bases for agricultural and sideline products. We will develop  the export of good-brand, special, quality, and new products and  finely processed and highly wrought goods by fully utilizing the  abundance of China's rural work force and agricultural and  sideline products, and actively open up the international market.  <H5>  V. Strengthen Comprehensive Agricultural Development </H5>   Twentieth, the main tasks of comprehensive agricultural  development in the nineties are:    1. We will basically stabilize the area of China's total  farmland and ensure that the new reclaimed area is no less than  the area of occupied farmland. We will adopt strict management  measures to control the occupation of farmland and stick to the  principle of reclaiming one mu of land to recover one mu of  occupied land and set the target of land reclamation at 2.1  million hectares or above nationally.    2. We will transform 18 million hectares of medium- and  low-yield fields, plant 6.6 million hectares of trees, create 20  million hectares of artificial grassland and improved grassland,  and improve 1.67 million hectares of medium- and low-yield paddy  fields.    3. We will increase the comprehensive grain production  capability by 38 billion kg and the comprehensive cotton  production capability by 400,000 metric tons.    Twenty-first, the important points in comprehensive  agricultural development are:    1. We will reclaim a total of 1.9 million hectares of land  and transform 14.67 million hectares of medium- and low-yield  fields in 10 state-level key development regions including the  plains along the Huang He, Huai He, and the Hai He, and in the  Sanjiang Plain [san jiang ping yuan 0005 3068 1627 0626], the  Songliao Plain [song liao ping yuan 2646 6697 1627 0626], the  Huanghe Delta, and the plains at the middle and lower reaches of  the Chang Jiang.    2. We will reclaim 280,000 hectares of farmland and  transform over 3.3 million hectares of medium- and low-yield  fields in 12 provincial-level key development areas, including  the plain at the foot of Yan Shan, the area bounded by the  northern part of the Wei He and the eastern Long Shan, in the  Nanyang Basin, and in the hilly areas of Hubei.    3. We will create 13.3 million hectares of artificial  grassland and improved grassland, of which over 3.3 million  hectares will be high-standard artificial grassland, in the six  key pastoral and semi-pastoral areas including the grassland in  northern Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Ili and Altay in  Xinjiang, the grasslands in the northwest of Sichuan and  southern Gansu, the grassland along the Qinghai Hu, and the  agricultural and pastoral areas in northeast China.    4. We will strive to enable over two thirds of the poverty-  stricken counties in the karst areas of the southwest, and in  the hilly gullies on the loess plateau, to possess approximately  one mu of basic farmland per capita.    5. We will reclaim 2.33 million hectares of desert along the  western corridor to the west of the Huang He and in the oases of  Xinjiang and exploit and utilize one million hectares of  resources in the desert areas.    Twenty-second, for comprehensive agricultural development,  we  need to strengthen the concepts of the market, quality, and  returns, attaching importance to improving the quality and  production returns of farm products while making efforts to  boost the output of farm products in keeping with market needs.  We will really take economic returns as the center and optimize  resource allocation and the structure and layout of production.  Based on the comprehensive exploitation and utilization of all  land resources, we will launch the comprehensive development of  hills, water, fields, forests, and highways, developing them in  width and in breadth at the same time. It is necessary to  promote the circulation of farm products, improve storage  facilities, and develop the infrastructural construction of  rural markets.    Twenty-third, stabilize and perfect the comprehensive  agricultural development policy. The policies pursued for  comprehensive agricultural development areas during the Seventh  Five-Year Plan will be continued and remain unchanged during the  nineties. For example, for five years, we will not arrange for  the state purchase of grain increases after the improvement and  transformation of medium- and low-yield fields and the grain  produced in newly-reclaimed farmlands and we will not levy  agricultural tax on the newly-reclaimed farmlands; the state  will arrange some discount-interest loans, set targets, and  grant funds while the local authorities pay the discount  interest; the state will continue to increase investment in  large-scale water conservancy projects including the harnessing  of rivers; and priority will be given to making arrangements for  the distribution of such agricultural means of production as  diesel oil, chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and agricultural  plastic film.    Twenty-fourth, strengthen the management of the capital for  comprehensive agricultural development and improve its use  efficiency. The existing sources of capital used for  comprehensive agricultural development must be ensured, while a  certain proportion of the fees for the use and transfer of  state-owned land, and a certain proportion of the income from  the land in various types of economic development areas, will be  used on comprehensive agricultural development. For  comprehensive agricultural development we should use market  mechanisms and employ such means of competition as inviting  public tenders for projects, referring to and using the project  management methods of international financial organizations,  such as the World Bank, and improve the efficiency of capital  use. Comprehensive agricultural development must be closely  integrated with, and mutually matched by, the construction of  farmland and irrigation and water conservancy works, assistance  to and development of poverty-stricken areas, the comprehensive  harnessing of the small valleys in hilly areas, afforestation,  and work-relief programs, forming an overall large-scale  integral development project.  <H5>  VI. Energetically Develop Township and Town Enterprises </H5>   Twenty-fifth, developing township and town enterprises is  the  only way to boost the rural economy, increase the incomes of  peasants, shift the surplus rural work force elsewhere, and to  promote agricultural modernization and the development of the  national economy. In the nineties, on the basis of  consolidating the agricultural foundation, it is necessary to  place township and town enterprises in an important strategic  position. It is necessary to continue to implement the  principle of "actively rendering support to them, making  rational plans for them, giving them correct guidance, and  strengthening their management"; energetically develop new  agriculture-related trades and industries; and unswervingly  support the development of township and town enterprises.    Twenty-sixth, township and town enterprises must be  organized, planned, and rationally laid out and must have their  structures adjusted and their returns improved in keeping with  the national economic development plan and the industrial  policy. It is necessary to arrange for the processing of urban  and rural farm products in keeping with the principle that  processing is near raw materials production areas and is  rational economically. As many newly-added farm product  processing industries as possible should be run in rural areas.  Cities with the conditions should gradually shift farm and  sideline product processing industries to rural areas. Township  and town enterprises must maintain a stable rate of development  on the premise of continuously improving product quality and  economic returns. We should treat and guide the township and  town enterprises in different areas differently. For those in  the west and in ethnic minority-inhabited areas, we should fully  use their special resources and labor advantages, vigorously  introduce professional people and technology, develop horizontal  association, and set up a number of resources-processing  enterprises to nurture omnidirectional development. Central  China must make use of the grain and other farm product  resources, carry out comprehensive economic development, enhance  the processing expertise, and give comprehensive compensation  for the production of grain and other farm products. Coastal  areas must base themselves on their existing foundations,  quicken technological transformation, and develop high-tech  products and export-oriented products to earn foreign currency.  It is necessary to strengthen enterprise management and spur  township and town enterprises to improve both product standards  and quality and to improve the quality of enterprises.    Twenty-seventh, formulate policies and measures and  vigorously guide and support the healthy development of township  and town enterprises. It is particularly necessary to  energetically support the development of the township and town  enterprises in central and western China. The special loans  arranged by the People's Bank of China for central and western  China and for ethnic-minority-inhabited areas should be  appropriately increased each year to mainly help the major  grain-producing areas in central and western China develop  township and town enterprises. Loans offered by international  financial institutions for township and town enterprises should  mainly lean toward central and western China. We should  encourage eastern, central, and western China, and  ethnic-minority-inhabited areas to develop horizontal economic  association and cooperation. Areas with a comparatively  developed economy should help poverty-stricken areas to develop  their economies so that they can supplement each other with  their advantages and promote each other for common development.    Twenty-eighth, it is necessary to continuously implement the  principle of "developing agriculture with industry" among  township and town enterprises. We should enhance the  construction of basic agricultural facilities by developing  township and town enterprises and increasing investment in  agriculture. We will strive to enable township and town  enterprises to absorb another 50 million of the surplus rural  work force by the year 2000, on the premise of meeting the needs  of agricultural production.    Twenty-ninth, strengthen guidance for the development of  small towns in rural areas. As for the development of small  cities in rural areas, they should rely on their existing market  towns, plan their development in a scientific way, work out a  rational layout, and gradually implement plans to nurture the  development of tertiary industry and the shift in the surplus  work force. It is necessary to guide township and town  enterprises for their relative concentration geographically and  for them to integrate with the development of small cities. It  is necessary to formulate preferential policies and attract  peasants to small cities so that they will engage in industry,  business, the construction industry, transportation, services,  and others.  <H3>  VII. Consolidate the Establishment of the Support System for  Agricultural Development </H3>   Thirtieth, irrigation and water conservancy works are an  important guarantee for the sustained and steady development of  agricultural production. Both the central and local authorities  should concentrate their energies on constructing a number of  major irrigation and water conservancy works. Major projects  for the nineties are:    1. Flood-prevention projects. We will: Construct the Three  Gorges Project for the Chang Jiang and the key water works at  the bottleneck of the Li Shui; continue to increase the height  of, and consolidate the flood dams on, the middle and lower  Chang Jiang; harness Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang; and  construct water conservancy projects like the Honghu Project.  We will construct 10 projects in Lake Tai, including those at  Taipuhe and Wangyuhe and the Hangjia Drainage Project. We will  construct a small-tide, low-water key water work project for the  Huang He and increase the height of and consolidate the flood  dams in its lower reaches. We will widen the floodwater  passages in the middle reaches of the Huai He and widen their  outlets to other rivers and to the sea in the lower Huang He.  We will construct the Xinhe Flood Prevention Project, the  project diverting the floodwaters of the Yi He, the Shu He, and  the Si He to the east and to the south; and the Shimantan  Irrigation and Water Conservancy Project. For the Zhu Jiang, we  will construct the Feilai Gorge Waterworks Project in its  northern tributary and the Dateng Gorge Waterworks Project in  its western tributary. We will continue to construct  flood-prevention projects on the Hailuan He and the Songliao He  to enhance their flood- resistant capabilities.    2. Water resources projects. We will emphasize the  construction of the projects which divert water from southern  provinces to Beijing, Tianjin, and northern China; the key  waterworks at Wanjiazhai along the Huang He, and the water  diversion project which diverts water from the Huang He to  Shanxi, Hebei's Taolinkou Reservoir Project, and Xinjiang's  Uruwati [wu lu wa ti 3527 7627 3907 2251] Waterworks. We will  begin the Daliushu project along the Huang He. We will quicken  water diversion from the northeast to the south and strive for  the earliest possible construction of the preliminary stage work  for water diversion from the Jiang He, the Ji He, and the Huai  He to Anhui.    3. Irrigation and drainage works. We will construct and  transform a number of large irrigation and drainage works, which  mainly include Sichuan's Wudu and Shengzhong irrigation works  and Dujiangyan transformation project; the irrigation and  drainage works at the Great Bend of the Huang He in Ningxia and  Inner Mongolia; Shaanxi's Donglei Waterworks; Henan and  Shandong's large-scale water diversion and irrigation projects;  the waterworks in the irrigated areas of Anhui's Pi He, Shiguan  He, and Hangbu He; the waterworks at the Chaersen Reservoir and  irrigated areas in Inner Mongolia and Jilin; Gansu's project  which diverts water from the Datong He to the Qinwangchuan area  to the north of Lanzhou, and the Qingtai irrigation project; and  Hainan's Songtao irrigation project. We will strive to increase  the effective irrigated area by 5.33 million hectares within 10  years so that, by the year 2000, the total irrigated area across  the country will reach 53.3 million hectares or more.    4. Hydropower projects. Increase China's hydroelectric  systems by a total installed capacity of 15 million kw, of which  2.8 million kw comprise the installed capacity of medium and  large hydropower stations; 6.2 million kw are from medium  hydropower stations; and 6 million kw are from small hydropower  stations. We will enable 500 counties in rural areas to  basically have access to electricity.    5. Water and soil conservation. We must put an end to soil  and water losses over a total area of 400,000 square km in the  nineties, with the emphasis on stopping soil and water losses in  the middle reaches of the Huang He and in the upper reaches of  the Chang Jiang. At the same time, we will pay good attention to  conserving soil and water in other rivers including the Zhu  Jiang, the Hai He, the Huai He, and the Liao He. We will  harness small rivers in the northwest and improve the ecological  environment by adopting engineering and biological measures at  the same time.    Thirty-first, quickening the development of agriculture  support industries is an important condition which guarantees  the upgrading of agriculture. The major tasks in this respect  are:    1. Strengthen the development of the chemical fertilizer  industry. In the nineties, we will build Guizhou's Wengfu  Chemical Fertilizer Factory whose annual output of double  superphosphate will reach 800,000 metric tons; Hubei's Dayukou  Project whose annual output of double superphosphate will reach  560,000 metric tons; the second-phase project of Qinghai's  Potash Fertilizer Factory whose annual output of potassium  chloride will reach 800,000 metric tons; Yunnan's  highly-concentrated phosphate fertilizer project; and a number  of large and medium chemical fertilizer production plants and  support chemical and mining projects in Hainan, Inner Mongolia,  Shaanxi's Weihe, Jiangxi's Jiujiang, and Hunan's Dongting. We  will quicken the transformation of small chemical fertilizer  factories and promote the introduction of new generations of  products. We will strive to produce 150 million metric tons of  chemical fertilizer by the year 2000.    2. Quicken the development of agriculture-related industries  such as those producing pesticide, agricultural plastic film,  and farm machinery. As for pesticide, we need to quicken the  readjustment of the product mix, develop and transform a number  of large and medium enterprises, energetically develop  high-efficiency and low-waste pesticide varieties, and set up  China's pesticide research center. We will boost the pesticide  output to 240,000 or 250,000 metric tons by the year 2000. It  is necessary to set up and transform a number of enterprises  producing agricultural plastic film materials and to produce  more standardized varieties of agricultural plastic film. We  will boost the output of agricultural plastic film to 800,000  metric tons by the year 2000. It is necessary to quicken the  development of the farm machinery industry so that by the year  2000, we will be able to produce annually 200,000 large and  medium tractors, 500,000 small tractors, 10,000 combined reaping  machines, and internal combustion engines totalling 80 million  hp. Diesel oil for agricultural use and electricity used in  rural areas must be gradually increased and we will make great  efforts to create conditions for agricultural modernization.    Thirty-second, forestry is the ecological defense of high  and stable agricultural yield. In the nineties, we must pay  attention to the following key construction projects of forestry:    1. The "three north" shelter-forest project: The task of  afforesting a total area of 7.18 million hectares must be  fulfilled by the end of this century.    2. The first phase project of building a shelter-forest  system in nine provinces and 145 counties along the upper and  middle reaches of the Chang Jiang. A total area of 6.67 million  hectares will be forested.    3. The first phase project of building a shelter-forest  system in 11 provinces, regions, and municipalities along the  coast. A total area of 2.44 million hectares will be forested.    4. We must continue to accomplish the Taihang Shan  afforestation project and the plains afforestation project in  major grain-producing areas in our country, such as the Sanjiang  Plain, the Songliao Plain, the Huabei Plain, and the plains  along the middle and lower reaches of Chang Jiang.    Thirty-third, efforts must be made to strengthen the  construction of a meteorological forecasting system. In the  nineties, we must accelerate the pace of meteorological  modernization, with the core being the construction of system  projects related to the business of medium-term numerical  real-time forecasting, the reception and processing of ground  information from geostationary meteorological satellites, the  business of the comprehensive application of meteorological  satellites, the automation of atmospheric monitoring, a  comprehensive meteorological information network, and the  application of meteorological satellite monitoring. We must  strengthen the monitoring of disastrous weather and short-term  weather forecasting, improve the effectiveness and precision of  forecasts, and reduce losses brought on agriculture by natural  calamities.    Thirty-fourth, efforts must be made to strengthen  construction of the feed industry. In the nineties, a number of  new enterprises developing and utilizing rapeseed will be  established in oil-producing areas. Two 5,000-tonne lysine  enterprises, one or two 100,000-metric tons calcium phosphate  producing bases, and a set of large feed-grade vitamin A and E  installations will be built. By 2000, the national mixed feed  processing capability must be over 70 million metric tons and  the yield of mixed feed must exceed 55 million metric tons.    Thirty-fifth, efforts must be made to strengthen the  construction of livestock vaccine and pharmaceutical factories.  In the nineties, as far as prevention and treatment of epidemic  diseases in livestock is concerned, we must continue to uphold  the principle of "relying mainly on prevention" and devote our  energies and financial resources to doing a good job of  preventing epidemic diseases which are very harmful to livestock  and mankind. We must focus on the construction and  transformation of a number of biological pharmaceutical  factories which will serve the whole country. During the Eighth  Five-Year Plan, projects for making animal health care products  will be arranged in Jinan, Shandong, and Shanghai and a new  capability of producing vaccine for 6 billion poultry will be  added. Technological transformation must be carried out in key  bio-medical factories.    Thirty-sixth, efforts must be made to strengthen the  construction of agricultural scientific research. We must  enhance international scientific and technological exchanges and  cooperation and organize the research work of major domestic  agricultural scientific and technological projects properly. We  must strengthen the construction of key state laboratories and  professional research institutes and enrich and improve the  conditions for scientific research into agriculture. We must  strive to add more funds to tackle key problems, carry out  experiments, and develop new technology in scientific research  in agriculture. The state will focus on the construction of  scientific research institutes in agriculture, forestry, and  water conservancy which are serving the whole country, including  the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Forestry  Sciences, and the Academy of Water Conservancy Sciences. We  must strengthen basic scientific research of biological projects  (including gene projects, cell projects, enzyme projects, and  fermentation projects) as well as research of application  sciences, such as fine-breed reproduction, cultivation  techniques, irrigation techniques, water and soil conservation  techniques, prevention and cure of plant diseases and insect  pests, and skills in processing, freshening, storing, and  transporting farm produce. Governments at all levels must take  effective measures to support and promote close integration  between scientific research in agriculture and the work of  popularizing agricultural technology. We must not only devote  our energies to supporting basic scientific research in  agriculture but also attach great importance to the application  and popularization of scientific and technological achievements  to speed up the transformation of scientific research  achievements in agriculture.    Thirty-seventh, we must do a good job in rural elementary  education and higher education in agriculture. We must  vigorously promote rural elementary, vocational, and adult  education to bring about close integration between education and  economic construction. The authorities at the county and  township levels must bring education into the local economic and  social development programs; supervise elementary, vocational,  technical, and adult education at different levels; and  popularize education on agricultural technology in higher  primary and junior secondary classes in rural areas. Efforts  must be made to coordinate and plan economic, scientific and  technological, and educational development and to basically  popularize nine-year compulsory education. We must further  accomplish the construction of a number of key universities,  colleges, and courses in agriculture, forestry, and water  conservancy; devote our energies to building a number of key  secondary schools in agriculture, forestry, and water  conservancy which have a higher standard. We must help colleges  and secondary schools in agriculture, forestry, and water  conservancy accelerate the process of building up teaching bases  and set up teacher training centers for colleges in agriculture,  forestry, and water conservancy. To fully promote the rural  economy, we must rely on education because "education is the  foundation of our plan for generations." Hence, governments at  all levels must truly cultivate this ideology and take practical  and effective measures to speed up educational reform and  development.  <H3>  VIII. Widely Opening Up Agricultural Investment Channels,  Increasing Agricultural Construction Funds </H3>   Thirty-eighth, huge investment is needed if we want to  fulfill the task of agricultural construction for the nineties.  We must try to broaden agricultural investment channels and  drastically increase agricultural investment. Budgetary  investment in agricultural capital construction, state financial  aid-agriculture funds, agricultural credit funds provided by  banks, and funds for providing relief in exchange for work are  current channels of agricultural investment which must be  stabilized for a long time and increased gradually. In order to  ensure meeting the needs of agricultural investment, all  departments in charge of planning, finance, and credit from the  central to local levels must guarantee, in the first place, the  supply of agricultural funds and must be determined to alter the  situation of the small proportion of agricultural investment in  overall investment. We must vigorously open up capital channels  and more frequently absorb and utilize foreign investment in  accordance with the orientation of reforming state taxation,  monetary, investment, and foreign trade systems. We must  capitalize on the support of departments in charge of foreign  trade to vigorously widen the scope and increase the amount of  utilizing foreign investment in agriculture, constantly upgrade  the standards, and work out preferential policies.    Thirty-ninth, efforts must be made to urge rural collectives  and individuals to make more investment in agriculture. We must  work through such measures as developing township and town  enterprises to enhance the economic strength of rural  collectives. We must work out corresponding laws, regulations,  and policies to ensure that rural collectives will use a certain  proportion of accumulated capital in agriculture and guide  peasants to make more investment in agricultural construction.  Governments at all levels must, in accordance with local  conditions, further perfect the labor accumulation system and  fully utilize our country's superiority of having an abundant  rural labor force to strengthen the construction of agricultural  infrastructures.    Fortieth, forces from all social sectors must be mobilized  to  make more investment in agriculture. A certain proportion of  social funds must be put together through various forms and used  in the construction of large and medium agricultural  infrastructures. We must vigorously integrate the development  of agriculture with that of industry and commerce and create  conditions to promote processing of farm produce and to enable  enterprises engaging in transportation and marketing to invest  in agriculture.    Forty-first, agricultural investment must be managed and  used  well and the efficiency of utilizing agricultural investment  must be improved. Budgetary capital construction investment at  the central and local levels must be managed in strict  accordance with the state's administrative method of capital  construction investment and used mainly in the construction of  agricultural infrastructures, such as the work of harnessing  large rivers and lakes, important state-level agricultural  commodity production bases, large-scale key shelter-forest  projects, the meteorological forest system, and the agricultural  socialized service system. We must ensure that financial  aid-agriculture funds, funds for providing relief in exchange  for work, and bank loans for agricultural construction at the  central and local levels must be used in strengthening  agricultural production. Funds used by rural collectives in  agricultural construction must be controlled by rural  collectives and these funds should never be indiscriminately  diverted to other uses. Efforts must be made to encourage  peasants to use their funds in production-oriented construction.  Nobody is allowed to violate state regulations and increase  peasants' burdens by raising funds and apportioning expenses  from them in any form. Nobody is allowed to seize and misuse  peasants' funds invested in agricultural production. As far as  the administration of funds utilized in agricultural  construction is concerned, we must not only give play to the  enthusiasm of departments at all levels in making more  investment in agriculture but also establish an effective  macroscopic regulation mechanism and lay down an overall plan  and coordinate agricultural investment made through various  channels, thus making joint efforts in agricultural  construction. We must strengthen the early-stage proof of  agricultural construction projects and take gradual steps to  implement the project owner responsibility system and the tender  system to improve the efficiency of utilizing agricultural  investment.  <H3>  IX. Strengthening Construction of the Agricultural  Socialized Service System </H3>   Forty-second, efforts must be made to strengthen  construction  of the agricultural socialized service system, which plays an  important role in upholding the responsibility system with the  household contract linking remuneration to output as the main  form; perfecting the system of unified management combined with  independent management; promoting the development of the rural  socialist market economy; and advancing agriculture to a new  stage. By the end of this century, a service system with  multiple economic components, forms, and levels must be  gradually established on the basis of rural collective and  cooperative economic organizations and with the support of  specialized economic and technical departments while being  supplemented by services run by the peasants themselves.    Forty-third, the foci of agricultural socialized service  work are: 1) to do a good job in the integrated services  provided by collective economic organizations at the village  level, which mainly include tractor-ploughing, irrigation and  drainage, crop protection, harvesting, and transportation; 2) to  perfect organizations at the township level, such as those  related to farming techniques, agricultural machinery, water  conservancy (water conservation), forestry, animal husbandry and  veterinary science, aquatic products, management and  administration, and meteorological services, and to do a good  job in service work; 3) to run supply and marketing cooperatives  and credit cooperatives well. Concerned state and collective  technological and economic organizations must vigorously help  peasants develop key services, such as buying and selling farm  produce and agricultural means of production, storing,  processing, transporting, and exporting farm produce, and  raising funds, and insurance; 4) to do a good job in  technological information, staff training, technological  contracting, and other services provided by departments in  charge of scientific research and education, information, and  consultation; 5) to encourage the development of such  organizations as specialized technological associations and  research institutes and provide specialized mutual- aid  services; 6) to set up "front-runner-type" service organizations  for key industries in township and town enterprise and to  provide services ranging from production to supply and marketing  to domestic and foreign buyers. In this way, agriculture is  provided with comprehensive services before, during, and after  production through various service organizations.    Forty-fourth, all trades and departments must have the idea  of serving peasants and agricultural production, constantly  improve their work style, and upgrade service quality. It is  necessary to integrate agriculture with science, education,  industry, and commerce. Multisectoral services and functions  must be coordinated to develop a series of comprehensive  services which integrate agriculture with trade and industry, as  well as with supply and marketing, and help agricultural  socialized services develop into industries, specialties, and  enterprises.    Forty-fifth, we must vigorously support peasants in  individually and jointly running service organizations.  Governments at all levels must support socialized service  organizations individually and jointly run by peasants and  protect their legitimate rights and interests. Departments in  charge of finance, science and technology, and domestic and  foreign trade must give their support in the forms of capital,  technology, and material supply.    Forty-sixth, we must further lay down and implement polices  which support agricultural socialized service work. We must  support the construction of an agricultural socialized service  system in the form of capital and bring into effect preferential  policies in business administration and taxation enjoyed by  concerned scientific and technological departments when setting  up service entities.  <H3>  X. Strengthening Leadership, Creating a Good Social  Environment For Agricultural Development </H3>   Forty-seventh, governments at all levels must strengthen  their leadership over agriculture and rural work, firmly  cultivate the ideology of stressing the foundation role of  agriculture, and insist on treating agriculture as the top  priority in economic work. We must frequently carry out  investigations and studies to solve real problems related to  agricultural development. We must take measures in light of  local conditions, give specific guidance and, in particular, pay  attention to supporting economic development in impoverished  localities. We must strengthen macroscopic administration and  regulation, ensure the supply of essential agricultural funds,  make good arrangements for the work of producing, purchasing,  and supplying farm produce and agricultural means of production,  and strive to create a social environment which is favorable to  agricultural development.    Forty-eighth, we must safeguard agricultural production and  protect peasants' interests. The state implements practical  protective policies towards agricultural production,  particularly grain, cotton, and other farm produce with a  bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood.  Various trades and professions must wholeheartedly serve  agricultural production and the peasants, protect the peasants'  interests, and vigorously support agricultural development.    Forty-ninth, we must strengthen construction of the legal  system and gradually realize the goal of using the law to rule  and promote agriculture. We must set the propaganda and  popularization of a number of relevant laws as the focus for  strengthening the people's legal concept. The laws are: The  "PRC Law on Land Administration," the "PRC Law on Forest," the  "PRC Law on Water," the "PRC Law on Grassland," the "PRC Law on  Fisheries," the "PRC Law on Water Conservation," the "PRC Law on  Agriculture," and the "PRC Law on Popularization of Farming  Techniques." We must perfect rural legal organs, do a good job  of implementing laws in rural areas and vigorously provide legal  consultation services in rural areas. We must speed up the work  of formulating a complete set of laws and regulations to protect  agricultural resources, promote agricultural production and  circulation of farm produce, and lighten peasants' burdens. We  must employ legal means to sternly fight against various  practices which disrupt agricultural production, such as  manufacturing and selling fake and inferior chemical  fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and other agricultural means of  production, thus bringing about stability in agricultural  production and in the market.    Fiftieth, leaders and executive and administrative  departments at all levels must, under the guidance of the  National Program for Agricultural Development, formulate  programs for agricultural development in light of local  conditions and conscientiously organize forces to implement them.</p>

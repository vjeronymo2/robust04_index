			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Closure costs behind fall at Robert Lowe AS PREDICTED at the interim stage, a sharp reduction in demand in the second half left Robert H Lowe with an increased pre-tax deficit of Pounds 667,000 for the year to end-October. That compared with a loss of Pounds 297,000 last time and with a deficit of Pounds 162,000 at the halfway stage. Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 32.2m. Losses per share came out at 2.85p (9.3p). In August last year the Cheshire-based maker of sports, leisure, baby and children's wear and which also has interests in printing and packaging, warned that action had to be taken to reduce production capacity because of the fall in demand. This led to exceptional expenses of Pounds 529,000 and an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.31m. Mr David Sebire, chairman, said the group would not be in a position to pay dividends until there was a return to profitability. The company also announced that Mr Colin Greenhalgh had replaced Mr Tony Cant as chief executive. Mr Cant will be leaving the company.</p>

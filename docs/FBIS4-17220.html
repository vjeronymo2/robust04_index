			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Geronin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 22 TASS -- A high-ranking Russian  diplomat praised Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who has  been nominated for the post of the prime minister, for promoting  normal relations with Russia.    "The Russian side considers that relations with Japan are  developing normally, at a good speed. This is a big merit of  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata",  Director of the Asian Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry  Nikolay Solovev told TASS on Friday.    He added that Hata had supported Russian reforms during his  recent visit to Moscow. Our two countries, he said, should  proceed in developing relations which will give a possibility of  solving problems on which it is hard to reach agreements so far.    A new Japanese prime minister is expected to be elected by  parliament on Monday. The ruling coalition which nominated Hata  has a majority of 265 out of 511 seats in the House of  Representatives.</p>

According to the chief of staff, the three analytical  centers  that used to work separately to the president will shortly be  reorganized into a single unit. This unit, or council of  experts, will concentrate all analysis coming in from the  various research structures and draw up recommendations for the  president, the government, and Russian regional leaders.    The council of experts, as the prototype for a future  administration of the head of state, will work on the  president's special programs and on his yearly greetings  messages.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UN Security Council seeks troops for peacekeeping THE UN Security Council yesterday proposed that member states offer peacekeeping troops to the world body for rapid deployment in international emergencies, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. This was the first substantive response to detailed recommendations by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, at the request of council members at their summit session last January, presided over by Mr John Major, UK prime minister. Since then, various states have offered rapid deployment forces, including a 1,000-member elite contingent from France, while some other member countries have continued to have reservations about the idea. The number of peacekeepers around the world has increased from 11,000 to 50,000 in the past year alone, with the majority stationed in Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. But the UN currently recruits peacekeepers only after authorisation by the Council and approval of the financing of such operations by the UN General Assembly. That has led to lengthy delays in their deployment, as in the case of Yugoslavia and Somalia. In the statement which it adopted yesterday, the Council urged members to inform Mr Boutros Ghali 'of their general willingness to provide forces or capabilities to the UN for peacekeeping operations and the type of units or capabilities that might be available at short notice.' Stressing that the provision of stand-by troops should be voluntary, the Council recommended members hold talks with the secretary-general so he could determine what troops might be available for particular operations and over what periods. The council endorsed Mr Boutros Ghali's view that the UN needed more military staff in its secretariat. He was urged to consider creating an enhanced peacekeeping planning unit and an operations centre. Member nations should also make available experienced military and civilian staff for a fixed period to train personnel for peacekeeping operations.</p>

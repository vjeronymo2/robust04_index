			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Retailers display renewed evidence of strong Christmas Evidence continued to build yesterday of a strong performance by retailers over Christmas, as three retail groups reported sales increases of between 4 and 7 per cent. Sears, the group which includes Wallis, Richards, Olympus, and Adams and several high street shoe chains, said like-for-like sales - which exclude store openings and closures - were up 7 per cent in the six weeks to January 8. Sales were particularly strong at Selfridges department store, but were down in childrens' wear in spite of strong trading in Christmas week. The Body Shop said like-for-like sales for the nine weeks to Christmas were up 4 per cent, while total sales were up 6 per cent. International sales grew 14 per cent, with Asia up 22 per cent, Europe up 20 per cent, and Canada and Australia together up 7 per cent. Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said like-for-like sales for the financial year so far were down only 1 per cent on last year, compared with 5 per cent reported at the half-year. Amber Day, now renamed WEW Group, said like-for-like sales in the five months to the end of December were up 4 per cent, and total sales up 16 per cent. After a poor August and September, trading had improved from October to December. Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the Poundstretcher discount chain, said like-for-like sales increased below expectations by only 2.7 per cent for the 13 weeks to December 24. The pre-tax loss for the year to December was likely to be bigger than current market expectations of about Pounds 4m.</p>

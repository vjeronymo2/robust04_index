			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Battered Porsche recalls its image for urgent repairs: The car importer's effort to reverse its reputation for arrogance PORSCHE IS seeking to re-establish traditional customer loyalties in the UK after acknowledging that it has paid a high price for past arrogance. In 1987 a record 3,700 of the German-built sportscars found their way to UK customers. By last year sales had fallen to 945. The importer, which has its headquarters in Reading, Berkshire, has completed a restructuring of its operations. As a result it has started a campaign to return to its roots in the sportscar enthusiast market and away from its former 'status symbol' image of the 1980s boom years. The perception of arrogance within the carmaker and its wholly owned UK sales subsidiary, Porsche Cars Great Britain, emerged in market research commissioned by Mr Kevin Gaskell, managing director of the British operation for the past 15 months. The study was 'the first customer research we had commissioned for years', Mr Gaskell said. 'But in concluding that we were perceived as arrogant it was only telling us what we already knew. There was a time when not only were we not listening to what the world was telling us, we weren't even listening to ourselves.' The image portrayed in the research was that Porsche and its 28 dealers were aloof purveyors of high-priced cars rapidly losing their competitive edge against a growing number of rivals, particularly from Japan. It was seen as increasingly out of touch with the enthusiast market which has sustained Porsche for most of its history following its creation soon after the second world war. Even the Porsche Cars GB headquarters give the impression of a status symbol. The high-tech, Pounds 13m building clad in black smoked glass was erected on Reading's outskirts in the mid-1980s and designed to be capable of preparing and distributing 6,000 new Porsches a year. Its full capacity as an import centre has never been much more than half-used. Nor does Porsche expect 6,000 sales a year in the UK in the foreseeable future. Thus, as part of the restructuring, it has turned part of its headquarters into a dealership and has set up a new division, Porsche Special Products. An important function of PSP is to provide a renovation and maintenance service for the 36,000-strong Porsche population in the UK. More than half of all Porsches built are still on the road. Staffing levels have been cut dramatically. The headquarters employs only 90 people on all activities compared with more than 200 in 1988. In terms of the import business, financial breakeven has been reduced from 2,200 annual sales two years ago to 700. The company is also launching initiatives to make parts and service costs more competitive in an attempt to wrest back business lost to non-franchised parts and service outlets. Mr Gaskell acknowledged that there were 16 such enterprises operating in the greater London area alone. He said: 'It's up to us to find that crossover point between quality and cost where that business will come back to us'. Porsche Cars GB is on course to lift sales back above the 1,000 mark this year. Sales of the 911 model, heavily updated in its 30th year, are up sharply. The next really substantial sales boost is likely to come with the 986, an all-new car based on the Boxster concept car - which Porsche unveiled late last year - to be launched in the mid-1990s. Mr Gaskell said the company could have sold 2,000 cars in the UK last year, but that would have meant embroiling itself more heavily in discount wars with the risk of further damage to resale values. Little could be more indicative of the new humility at Porsche than one of the first cars waiting for renovation by the Special Products division. It is a decrepit, badly rusted 911 Targa. 'Its owner has given us a budget of Pounds 4,000 to restore it. We welcome the work and will turn it back into something he can be proud of,' Mr Gaskell said. He readily acknowledged that there was still a public perception that a Porsche dealer would barely bother to hold a door open for such a sum. But that image, he insisted, was out of date. 'We can do a lot for Pounds 4,000.'</p>

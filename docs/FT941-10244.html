			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Abbey's frugal life Some Abbey Life shareholders thought they got a poor deal when Lloyds Bank injected five financial services businesses into it in 1988 in return for a 58 per cent stake. They may think again after studying the company's 1993 results. The sharp rebound in Lloyds Abbey's non-insurance businesses generated enough distributable profits to justify a 4 per cent dividend increase after four years of flat pay-outs. Lloyds Abbey now promises a progressive dividend policy. It may even be able to lift its dividend faster than the market average over the next few years. Lloyds Bowmaker has achieved a sharp fall in bad debt provisions as the rate of house repossessions has slowed, enabling profits to climb from Pounds 16m to Pounds 38m. Even Black Horse estate agencies have substantially reduced losses. The marginal growth these businesses provide is vital given the uninspiring outlook for the life business. The dividend yield of more than 5 per cent will provide the company's mainstay considering the group's earnings prospects are so dull. Low inflation and the regulatory clamp imposed on life companies have seriously undermined the sector's appeal - although Lloyds Abbey's powerful distribution arm gives it greater opportunities than most. The company has also felt obliged to swallow an unspecified provision against inappropriate pension transfers. Unfortunately, Lloyds Abbey was not prepared to share its assumptions with its shareholders. Until the Securities and Investments Board has concluded its investigations, the market will therefore fear the worst - even though the financial damage seems likely to prove slight.</p>

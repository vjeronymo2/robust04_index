			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "Studies of Northern Ethnic Minorities Make </F> Headway"]    [Text] Hohhot, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China has made major  headway in the research of the history of its many northern  region ethnic minorities, marked by the publishing of many new  and important research works and the deepening of the extent of  research.    Since 1985, Chinese scholars have completed such voluminous  works as "The General History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in  Northern China", "The General History of Mongols", "The History  of the Relations Between Northern Ethnic Minorities" and "The  Cultural History of Northern Ethnic Minorities".    Three books by Lin Gan, the noted scholar of ethnic  minorities -- "The General History of Xiongnu", "The History of  Donghu" and "The History of Tujue" -- have roused the attention  of historians, as it cleared up the western migration line of  the north Xiongnu, the tribal institution of the western Xiongnu  and the activities of the early Donghu people, all of which  previously posed major difficulties for historians.    In his latest work, "New Points About the Ethnic Minorities  in Northern China", Lin explored the relations between the  northern minorities and the Hans in central China, the  assimilation of the minorities by the Hans and the origin of the  northern tribes and pushed the research of such significant  issues to a new height.    The history of northern China's ethnic minorities has been a  topic of great interest to the international historical society.  Since some 2,000 years ago, in the wide region ranging from the  northeastern to northwestern ends of China, there have existed  dozens of ethnic minorities. While many of them, such as the  Qidan, Nuzhen and Xiongnu, had established their own regimes,  the Mongols eventually united all of China and started the Yuan  Dynasty (1279-1368).    The history of the northern ethnic minorities is an  important  part of the history of China as well as that of the world.    In its earlier period starting from the mid-18th century to  late 1940s, research of the northern ethnic minorities had  resulted in the publishing of fewer than 200 papers.    The 1950s saw the beginning of a new era for the research.  The three decades thereafter produced many important scholars  and works, with Ma Changshou and his works on the history of the  Xiongnu and Tujue as the representatives.    The period from the early 1980s represents a golden time in  Chinese ethnic studies. Publications of the period include 49  research works, 26 collections of research papers, 12  collections of historical documents, the Chinese version of 19  works by authors from Russia, Iran, France and Japan, as well as  12 books on archaeological discoveries in the region and how  they reflect on northern ethnic minorities.    Based on the findings of an extensive social and historical  investigation, scholars have completed the histories of major  nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including  the Mongols, the Daur, Oroqen and Ewenki.    Besides the writing of two books on the history of the  Mongols, Chinese scholars of Mongolian history also published  hundreds of research papers in the period.    Of these works, the one of the greatest value is the Chinese  version of the "Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty", translated  into Chinese by Professor Yi Linzhen from the University of  Inner Mongolia.    Besides providing numerous annotations based on the  knowledge  of voluminous ancient documents, Yi has also written a lengthy  foreword in the Chinese and Mongolian languages for the  classical historical work written in ancient Mongolian language  in the 13th century.    The work has been partly translated into Japanese and  published in Japan.    In the latest development, a work by the title of "The  Cultural History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in North China"  has been completed by scholars from nine Chinese regions and  recently published. The book, containing 1.2 million Chinese  characters, represents the first systematic cultural research of  the northern nationalities from the angles of folklore,  archaeology, history, comparative linguistics and art.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Bonds: 3i shrugs off uncertainty with Pounds 125m paper issue Despite continuing uncertainty over its future ownership, 3i, the venture capital group controlled by the UK clearing banks, yesterday launched a Pounds 125m five-year floating-rate note issue in the international bond market. The group plans to float on the stock exchange, with the current owners, including the Bank of England which holds a 14.67 per cent stake, relinquishing control. This could affect the amount of capital which banks, the main buyers of floating rate note issues, have to set aside against holdings of 3i bonds. The group is currently recognised under UK banking law, which means that its bonds carry a low 20 per cent risk weighting. Banks must set aside only one-fifth the amount of capital required against holdings of bonds issued by companies, which carry a full 100 per cent risk weighting. If the change in ownership also entailed a loss of banking status, 3i's bonds will be more expensive for banks to hold. The company argued that the change in ownership will not affect its status as a bank, but the residual uncertainty was reflected in the pricing of the deal. Yesterday's deal pays a margin of 37.5 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered rate but was launched at a discount to par for an effective margin of 47 basis points. Having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price 99.61, the paper traded up to 99.70 bid by the close. When 3i made its last floating-rate note issue four years ago, the margin was little more than 12.5 basis points. Elsewhere, Credit Foncier priced its Ecu750m 12-year deal launched on Wednesday at a fixed reoffered price of 98.70, for a yield 7 basis points more than French government Ecu bonds. Most syndicate officials were satisfied with the progress of the deal, although market conditions remain poor. The deal closed at 98.55 bid, with the yield spread steady. Caisse Central Desjardins du Quebec, the Canadian co-operative bank, launched a well-received CDollars 100m offering of five-year bonds. The paper carries a coupon of 8 3/4 per cent and was priced to yield 76 basis points more than Canadian government bonds - a more generous spread than other Canadian dollar bond issues this week.</p>

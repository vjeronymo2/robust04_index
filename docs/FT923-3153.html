			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / BT to sell security arm to AA BRITISH Telecom is expected to announce this week that it is selling Telecom Security, its burglar alarms business, to the Automobile Association, Michael Skapinker writes. The business, acquired in the wake of BT's privatisation in 1984, is likely to sell for less than Pounds 1m. BT announced last January that it wanted to sell the business, in which it has a 90 per cent stake. The sale is part of BT's strategy to divest itself of peripheral businesses. It has already sold its catering business, its cable television interests and a telephone factory in Wales. Telecom Security employs about 200 people. BT is believed to have held discussions with several leading security companies before settling on the AA.</p>

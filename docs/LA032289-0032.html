			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THE ANNALS OF BLOOPERDOM  </P> <P> Oops. Or: Pardon my blooper, legal variety.  </P> <P> At the urging of the city attorney, the San Diego City Council on Monday  quietly adopted an emergency ordinance to amend Division 95 of Chapter 5 of the  Municipal Code, effective immediately.  </P> <P> The amendment substitutes "division" for "chapter" in a section adopted in  February, 1988, to ban housing and job discrimination against people with AIDS.  The anti-discrimination ordinance allows victims to sue for damages.  </P> <P> However, the original language mistakenly said that no criminal penalties shall  be attached to this "chapter" -- not just the AIDS division as intended -- thus  seemingly extending the no-criminal-prosecution provision to a raft of  miscreant behavior covered by all divisions of Chapter 5.  </P> <P> Such behavior includes nude dancing, shooting a gun within the city limits,  public urination, liquor sales violations and failure to abate loud noises or  weed-clogged property -- in short, the tacky stuff that coarsens modern life.  </P> <P> When the division/chapter mix-up was spotted, the city attorney immediately  asked the council to set the code straight, lest a sharp-eyed defense attorney  spot a loophole.  </P> <P> Stu Swett, senior chief deputy city attorney, says prosecutors could probably  have persuaded a judge that the council never meant to lift criminal penalties  for all of Chapter 5.  </P> <P> "With the amount of legislation we adopt, the possibility of something like  this (the mix-up) happening is always there," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tony on Tour  </P> <P> Attention all cars: Be on the lookout for a furry adult male, with orange,  black and white stripes, often heard to say "Grrrrrrrreat."  </P> <P> The Kellogg Co., manufacturers of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, has deployed its  </P> <P> "famous spokes- character" Tony the Tiger on a national tour, giving away  bicycles for those lucky enough to have a box of his favorite Cornflakes on  hand when he comes knocking.  </P> <P> The tour comes to San Diego for a week starting Sunday. To ensure that Tony  isn't pinched by the police as he goes door to door, the corporate headquarters  in Battle Creek, Mich., sent a letter of warning to Police Chief Bob Burgreen.  </P> <P> Enclosed was an autographed picture of the suspect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Prayer Meeting  </P> <P> Don't look for the opening session to open with a prayer, but the 19th annual  Convention of American Atheists commences Friday at the Marriott Hotel in  Mission Valley. A record 500 conventioneers are expected.  </P> <P> Among the topics will be creeping creationism, introducing children to atheism,  the use of "anti-blasphemy" laws to silence atheists in Austria and Germany,  and a psychological look at "What Makes Religionists Tick."  </P> <P> The opening-day highlight will be a "Bimbos for Satan" lecture by Arizona  atheist leader Conrad Goeringer. He says that discovering satanic messages in  rock music by playing Guns 'N Roses records backward, etc., is a thinly  disguised try at censorship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Downey for the Count  </P> <P> The crowd for Monday night's World Wrestling Federation show at the San Diego  Sports Arena was even more excited than usual.  </P> <P> Not only was there a full card of favorites, but it was announced that WWF has  added Morton Downey Jr., the razor-tongued talk show host, for WrestleMania V  on April 2 at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, N. J. Downey will debate/accost a  WWF character called Brother Love, with wrestler-turned-actor Rowdy Roddy Piper  as referee.  </P> <P> "Three of the loudest loudmouths ever seen on television," promised a WWF  spokesman.  </P> <P> WrestleMania V can be seen locally on a pay-for-view basis through cable  operators. In the wake of Monday's tour stop, sign-ups (at $24.95) were brisk.  </P> <P> "WrestleMania is big," said Sandy Cochran, director of public affairs for  Southwestern Cable, which serves San Diego north of Interstate 8.  </P></p>

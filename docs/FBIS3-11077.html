			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vaticano's Network"] </F>   [Excerpts] In the purist Cali Cartel style, the web of the  relationships of the organization headed by Vaticano covers  every flank--financial, police, military, terrorist, judicial,  and operational.    A comparison of information from various sources has made it  possible to determine the table of organization that is detailed  on these pages. It is very striking to see the levels of  closeness since apparently even the agents of the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) have been the subject of  intelligence leaks pertaining precisely to the control  operations carried out in Huallaga.    One of the brothers of Vaticano (so-called because he is the  head of all of the "churches," or firms), namely Elias Chavez  Penaherrera (aka Lan Chile), was the man in charge of the  "payments" made to the military. This was because his work--the  coordination of the receipt and dispatch of drugs by air--could  only be carried out in this way. One of these payments may have  been the gray automobile delivered to a general whose  involvement in this relationship has been proven,, according to  reliable information. Elias, who was formerly in charge of  logistics in Campanilla, is now reported to have replaced his  brother and to be in Cali. [passage omitted]  <H5>  "I Know Nothing" </H5>   The statement "I am his brother, but I know nothing," which  was made by Manuel, the brother of Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, at  the time of his arrest, has become famous.    Vaticano has said the following about his brothers:    "...Humberto lives in Campanilla, and he devotes his time to  livestock breeding and music. He has a group called "La Banda  del Caribe" (The Caribbean Band). Emilio lives in Campanilla,  and is engaged in farming and livestock breeding. Berzabeth  lives in Campanilla. She devotes herself to her housekeeping,  and is married to a former policeman, Silverio Cardenas. Bertha  lives in Lima and works in a grocery. Elias lives in Campanilla,  but I do not know what he does." Where the others are concerned,  he says that he has not seen them in a long time.    His sister Bertha, for her part, also said in her statement  to the police that "I have not seen my brother for more than 10  years now."    But her relationships were business ones, even more than  family ones. Bertha (La Calena) was the general director of the  organization, and she was apparently in charge of the process of  laundering the money. The operations of "LR y Asociados" (LR and  Associates) are being traced in an effort to prove this.    This business, which was established in March of 1992 by  Mrs.  Lucila Emetria Rivera de la Cruz, a housewife (55,100 shares),  and her daughter, Claudia Luna Victoria Rivera, a student (2,900  shares), was engaged in the construction of commercial centers  in Lima. Vaticano has said that in May of 1991, he sold a plot  of land measuring 1,100 square meters that he had purchased in  Block 51 of the Benavides Extension, Surco, "to a woman whose  name I do not remember."    This woman was none other than the mother-in-law of his  sister Bertha. Mrs. Lucila Emetria is the mother of Marcos Ivan  Luna Victoria Rivera, Bertha's common-law husband, who also  lived at Bertha's minimarket and home complex at 3373 Avenida  Aviacion. Her son was sentenced this week to 12 years in prison  by the First Criminal Court of Callao for illegal trafficking in  drugs. "La Calena" has told the police that she never realized  she was living with a drug trafficker.  <H5>  Figureheads </H5>   Having set up their business in the commercial center they  had built on the 1,100-meter plot in question, the mother and  daughter hired a manager, Yuri Marcel Munoz Rivera. He too is  one of Mrs. Lucila Emetria's sons, and, having been linked with  Luna Victoria in this way might also have played other roles.    In the first place, it has been proven that he visited  "Panama," Bertha's minimarket on Avenida Aviacion. In November  of last year, he traveled to Trujillo. There he is reported to  have collected money (the sum of $40,000 has been mentioned),  which he brought back to Lima and delivered to his sister  Terlinda. She made a trip to Iquitos, presumably to pay off  Judge Jaime Cardenas Fonseca, the brother of "Mosca Loca" (Crazy  Fly), for the release of Bertha. It was Vaticano, who met with  Terlinda in Iquitos for purposes of coordination, who gave the  order for the operation.    LR y Asociados SRL (LR and Associates, Ltd.) built the "Las  Gardenias" commercial center on the plot of land purchased from  Vaticano, and leased all of the shops. In this way, the property  (land and buildings) was valued at more than $1 million. In  1992, however, LR sold the entire complex to two men for a  little more than $100,000. And the land alone had cost $65,000  when they bought it from Demetrio.    It is suspected that this unusual sale was made as a means  of  laundering the money obtained from Huallaga.    A short time thereafter, the business purchased another plot  of land two blocks farther along. On that plot, the company  built the "53 Shopping Center," in which 79 shops have been  offered for lease thus far. The sales manager chosen on this  occasion was Elias Rojas Boltan.  <H5>  The Polvos Rosados Trade Fair </H5>   Terlinda's trip to Iquitos was not the only one she would  make. She traveled to Arica, Chile, in May of 1993 (Vaticano  said she left Peru via Tacna-Arica). And in November of that  year, she made another trip to Medellin, Colombia, where she  stayed at the Hotel Capitolio.    A number of telephone calls were made from her home, located  in Unit A at 4660 Avenida Arequipa, in Miraflores, to Cali,  Colombia. The calls were made to the "Holguines" development  company, to Maria Escobar, to Jairo Frisneda Granada, and to  Enrique Rocha.    The trip to Medellin was nothing unusual, although it is  known that this was the headquarters of Escobar's cartel, and  there were sometimes dealings between the two. Proof of this is  the presence of Juan Chavez Penaherrera, one of the brothers, in  that city from time to time "on business."    Terlinda also managed Booth 151 in Polvos Rosados. Although  this seems to have happened infrequently, this trade fair also  served as a meeting place for the members of the organization.  It is known that Berzabeth, the other sister of Vaticano who was  arrested, had some booths there.    In order to understand the operational plan of the  commercial  "facade" completely and to establish further links, a total of  180 homes and offices throughout Lima, including those of a  number of offices of aviation companies that make flights into  the jungle, are being investigated.</p>

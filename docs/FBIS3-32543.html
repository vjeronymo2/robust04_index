Included among the documents is a video that  shows a cartel member asking Escobar not to kill him and  reminding him of his involvement in terrorist attacks,  kidnappings, and alleged intercessions in Cuba before someone  identified as Raul Castro.    Although the video does not mention the contact's position,  it is believed to be Raul Castro, brother of Cuban President  Fidel Castro and commander of that country's Armed Forces.    It also mentions without naming them some people close to  former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, according to  the television newscast.    The documents, which include photographs, videos, and  letters, reveal the irregularities committed at Envigado's La  Catedral prison, where Escobar was held for almost a year with  14 of his most sinister lieutenants, who held loud, bawdy  parties with hundreds of persons illegally entering the  facility. Trials were even held against members of the Medellin  Cartel. Escobar also had secret documents belonging to the DEA  and various Colombian state entities. He had the names,  addresses, and telephone numbers of people who testified against  him and reports on bribes he paid to judges and politicians.    The authorities also found among Escobar's possessions  documents belonging to the Cali Cartel, but the greatest share  of the papers consisted of letters from people and institutions  asking him for money for different purposes, among them a letter  from a community of nuns requesting his "good offices" for a  social project. The father of the killer of presidential  hopeful Bernardo Jaramillo went to La Catedral to ask for money  to purchase a home and thus reward the "courage" of his son, who  was barely 15 years old when he was killed in the ensuing  reaction by bodyguards of the Patriotic Union candidate.    With the discovery of Escobar's personal files, the  authorities have been able to clarify many deaths, kidnappings,  and attacks perpetrated on the orders of this major drug  trafficker and terrorist, who was killed in a shoot out with  police on 2 December in Medellin.</p>

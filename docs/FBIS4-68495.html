			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by V. Koptyug: "Attempts To Resolve the Question in </F> Parts Is Doomed to Failure (Speech at the Scientific-Practical  Conference `Strategy of Stabilization of the Economy of the  Region: Problems and Resolutions'"]    [Text] A feverish search is going on today at the level of  state and territorial structures for extricating industries and  territorial multibranch complexes out of the profound crisis in  which they find themselves. Programs are being considered and  formed on how to stop the slump and to restore the most  important spheres of the economy of Russia (the fuel-energy  sphere, enterprises of the military-industrial complex, the  agro-industrial sector, the municipal economy, etc.) and its  regions, krays, and oblasts. These programs are being lobbied by  representatives of industries and territories in the Federal  Assembly, in the Russian Federation Government, and on the  president's staff. In the process, someone succeeds in  extracting something, but the situation, on the whole, is only  getting worse.    To do justice to the significance of today's conference on  problems of the development of Novosibirsk Oblast and the  efforts of the Siberian Accord interregional association  throughout Siberia in general, which is important for the  future, I would like to note immediately that the efforts to  resolve the question in parts are doomed to failure. The  question of "how to survive" can be resolved in part, but it is  impossible to find an answer to the question of "how to live and  develop?"    If we go along with the "reforms" conducted in recent years,  if fundamental changes are not introduced in the strategy of  socio-economic transformations in the country, then it simply  would be daydreaming to count on the fact that, with the help of  industrial and territorial programs, we will succeed in averting  a further drop into the abyss of a crisis and in improving the  situation in the regions.    Why? Let us analyze it.    The pivotal point of the reforms being conducted in our  country is the attempt to introduce comprehensive market  relations and private property across the board, even on the  land on which we all live and feed ourselves. To expect that the  market and general privatization in property will themselves  regulate everything is ridiculous. Russians have already felt  the full impact on themselves of just what a "wild market" is,  but a civilized market is built over decades. It is impossible  to build a civilized, regulated system of market relations in  500 or 1,000 days. And this must be clearly understood. The  country is reaping the fruit today of the "revolutionary" effort  to join the market.    Why do I think that today's attempts to resolve the problem  in parts is hopeless? First of all, because the country at all  levels of management--state, branches of industry, and  local--was deprived of the basic part of investment resources.  And the matter here is by no means only in the catastrophic  slump in the volumes of production, although there was no such  production crisis in the entire history of the development of  industrial countries in peacetime. The sharp slump in production  is not so much a reason as a consequence. The consequence of the  kind of policy that was conducted in Russia during the last two  years.    What then do we have as a result of the clumsy reformation?    The introduction of elements of the market system were  absolutely correctly reasoned as a need to arouse the initiative  of the people, and with the help of entrepreneurial structures  to ensure a rise in the output of products for the spheres of  consumption and production. But for this, the levers of state  stimulation of private-entrepreneurial production should be  engaged, not even to mention the state sector. Did the state  guarantee this? No. Although the support and protection of the  domestic producer is the sacred obligation of the state and of  those who formulate policy.    Today, as a result of the disproportion of prices for raw  materials, energy, transport, and industrial articles, and the  incredibly high credit interest, to produce something in the  overwhelming majority of production sectors means to operate at  a financial loss. What kind of an entrepreneur will begin to do  this? It is precisely for this reason that the entrepreneurial  structures in Russia went mainly (by 90 percent) along the path  of trade, and, more specifically, speculation. Playing on the  already mentioned price disproportions, they are amassing  enormous capital that is not invested in domestic production,  but is exported abroad. The accumulation of capital in the  countries to which capital is exported makes it possible to  lower credit rates there and thereby expand investment in  production. It is embarrassing for me to call things by their  name. Ask Western economists how they would characterize the  actions of their government, if they would permit a similar  situation. In the system of market relations, the principle of  "self comes first" works especially distinctly. But so that the  concept of "self" include not only personal, but also national  interest, developed countries have built a very tough system of  regulators and limiters.    But how much capital "flows away" abroad? According to the  estimates of the experts, about $30 billion have been exported,  and about $1.5 billion are exported monthly at the present time.  This is an enormous blow against the economy of Russia.    Judge for yourself. An attempt is being made to draw up the  state budget of Russia for 1994, which is being discussed at the  present time, with an increase in expenditures over incomes by  approximately 10 percent, or, in a monetary expression, by 60  trillion rubles [R], which is equivalent to $33 billion, and the  annual export of capital is valued at the present time at $18  billion; i.e., more than half the budget deficit. According to  official data, $15.5 billion out of the $48 billion value of  exports did not return to Russia. But through channels that are  not monitored?    In similar situations, civilized countries conduct strict  control over the export of capital in order to force it, with  the help of economic and legislative measures, "to work" in  their own country.    While not undertaking the necessary measures in this  direction, Russia at the same time is trying to cover the  chronic deficit of the state budget at the expense of foreign  loans. But, first, two-thirds of foreign credits usually remain  in the crediting countries to support the production of that  product (be it grain, industrial articles, or technology) that  is later delivered to Russia owing to the credits. Thus, we are  once again stimulating the development of production and the  creation of jobs most of all not in our own country, but among  our neighbors, burdening our state budget with foreign debt  interest payment obligations. Second, that third that does come  to Russia disappears "in the sand," as a result of the chaos in  the spheres of management and control. Third, the real sum of  financial resources that came to our country during two years  (1992-1993) because $15 billion in foreign credits amounted to  $4 billion, which corresponds to the total export of capital for  two and a half months.    No less a powerful blow to the economy of the country was  delivered and is being delivered by the insane policy of  privatization. I cannot call the privatization that is being  conducted at government level anything other than a fantastic  swindle. I will not talk about the enormous disorganizational  role of this policy with respect to industry, agriculture, the  municipal sphere, etc. I will dwell only on the financial side  of the matter. What is a voucher from a financial standpoint?  Nothing more than a small share of a monthly wage. Anatoliy  Borisovich Chubays, at the beginning of the "division" of state  property, gave assurances that every voucher is at least  equivalent to a passenger car. But no matter how much you try,  you will not succeed in finding a commercial structure that is  ready to take a voucher in exchange for a passenger car or other  motor vehicle. One voucher is nothing, but thousands and tens of  thousands of vouchers in the same hands, this is considerable,  inasmuch as they give the owner the right to acquire large  property at a favorable price, and in this case the voucher can  really be "converted" into a passenger car.    Did the people win as a result of voucherization? No. Did  the  state win from it? Also, no. I will explain why the last answer  is also negative. Toward the beginning of 1994, somewhat more  than half of the state enterprises in the country were  privatized, principally small and average ones. Now, in order to  complete the privatization program before the summer of 1994,  the privatization of large enterprises is unfolding at an  increased pace. The "revolutionary" nature of the pace and  methods of privatization is akin to the "revolutionary nature"  of the shock construction of the system of market relations. The  privatization program allegedly pursued economic objectives,  but, in fact, they were purely political. Now, these objectives  are no longer concealed--to quickly create a class of large  property owners who would not allow the policy of capitalization  of the country to be stopped. And it must be said that the  achievement of this objective is not far off. And perhaps it has  already been achieved, which I will talk about below.    Did the state receive anything on an economic plane from the  implementation of the privatization program? As an answer to  this question, I will quote an excerpt from a March article of  John Ross, an economic adviser to a group of Laborites of the  British Parliament, which was published in DELOVOY MIR.    "...In order to understand what this means for state  incomes,  it is necessary simply to note that the privatization of one  large steel foundry in Brazil--Usiminas--gave the state $1.17  billion. In Mexico, the privatization of 950 enterprises (and in  Russia by the start of 1994, 85,000 enterprises were  privatized--V.K.) gave the state $23 billion. But,  after all, both the Brazilian and Mexican enterprises are  incomparably smaller than, for example, ZIL. Nevertheless, in  Russia the income from privatization was practically zero in  comparison with the value of the removed funds.    "The implementation of this program had an exclusively  macroeconomic consequence. The squandering of state property  made it qualitatively difficult to finance the budget deficit.  Thus, this privatization program from the beginning deprived the  country of income from property that belonged to it, and  afterwards the possible profits from its potential sale. The  indirect consequences of this policy, operating through the  budget, will lead to a reduction of credits and, as a  consequence, to the closing of enterprises.    "Unquestionably, it was not the Central Bank that was the  biggest creator of the budget deficit in Russia, but the  privatization committee."    Thus, the objective that was really pursued by the authors  and implementers of "shock" methods of introducing the market  system and privatization, and specifically, the formation of a  class of large owners of capital and property, was achieved.  According to official data, 10 percent of the most well-to-do  people in Russia on the average have incomes that are 11-12  times greater than 10 percent of the people who are least  provided for. In a number of regions, this ratio is two to three  times higher, and if the unaccounted for and concealed incomes  are considered, it undoubtedly is even more. Such a  disproportion cannot help but prompt social disruption.    For the reasons talked about above, the new class will not  invest its capital in Russia's economy in the near future. Their  prime task now is to take power into their own hands, real  power, and not official, window-dressing power. The answer to  the question "Can something still be done to stop the fall of  Russia into the abyss?" depends on how far they have already  moved ahead in this direction.    It is a difficult question. Judging by certain signs, they  have moved ahead far. Remember, for example, how many times a  resolute struggle was proclaimed against organized large-scale  economic and physical crime and against that without which  organized crime cannot exist--against corruption of the state  apparatus--but it turns out in practice that despite the  measures that are being proclaimed, these monstrous ulcers on  the body of the country are only spreading. Not only is trade  shifting to the control of criminal structures in increasingly  greater measure, but also such very important spheres as the  system of money circulation, foreign economic relations, and  privatization. The state allows the swindlers in the sphere of  business to collect enormous amounts of money from the  population through fake banks and funds and to disappear with  them without a trace.    But what is to be done, if some chances of saving the  economy  still exist? It follows from what was said above that the  resolution of economic problems today lies most of all in the  political sphere and in the sphere of government management.    The failure of the "shock therapy" policy in Russia is  obvious. The consequences of this are very grave. It is  necessary to admit this courageously and to display the will for  a decisive correction in policy. This is required of both the  leaders of the country and society. I will mention in this  connection the winged phrase of Academician L.I. Abalkin:  "Christ was crucified on the demand of the masses!" By whom and  how such a demand of the masses is formed is another question.    I fully agree with the words the president of the Russian  Federation uttered at an expanded meeting of the government at  the beginning of March of this year: "A policy is required of  the government today that is calculated to have promise. To  reform the economy at any price is an erroneous slogan. The  people can reject a reform that is too burdensome" (which, in  fact, occurred in the elections to parliament of Russia in  December of last year). "In the end, the government must  realistically develop a structural-investment policy. There is  no other way to stop the technological roll back of Russia's  industry. Otherwise, we can lose what little we  have--industries, retained personnel, technological and other  positions on the world market, and a native intellectual  potential."    Correct words, only they are pronounced with a big delay. If  deeds follow words with just as much of a big delay, then it  will already be late.    What steps have to be taken now to create the conditions for  restoring production in Russia? The same ones spoken by that  outstanding president of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt,  who was elected to this post at the beginning of the 1930's,  when the country was rapidly plunged into the abyss of an  economic crisis that resulted from "a wild market"--he  introduced tough state regulation and began to ease it when the  country was once again on its feet. Borrowing from the Country  of the Soviets the experience of strategic planning and state  regulation, after adapting it to the capitalistic system, he  saved this system.    But over the course of three-quarters of a century, we have  closed our eyes to the experience of the development of  capitalist countries, ignoring the fact that state regulation  can be implemented not only by the command method, for which we  paid or plunged ourselves (or we were pushed) into another  extreme, but by more effective economic methods. Perhaps, at  least now, while sliding toward the abyss of a crisis, we will  see clearly and we will borrow from the history of the United  States the path suggested to them by our country for getting out  of the crisis. But this requires the firm will of the leaders of  the country and an understanding of their actions by the people.  Persuasions according to the principle of Leopold the cat have  little promise today.    In a speech at the expanded meeting of the government, the  president of the Russian Federation, while characterizing the  actions planned for 1994, declared: "I will begin by bringing  order and strengthening state economic principles." It would be  very nice, if this did not remain just a declaration.    If we are talking about a correction of the economic sphere  as such, then one of the paramount questions here is the  monstrous disproportions in prices, and the key elements are the  prices in the fuel-energy complex and in transport. On the one  hand, the fact that domestic prices for energy sources are below  world prices leads to the current conditions of criminalizing  the sphere of their removal to the foreign market and to an  increase in the already mentioned accumulation of capital  abroad. On the other hand, an increase in domestic prices for  energy sources will result in an industry that is already  collapsing without this and will increase the total amount of  mutual nonpayments.    Let us imagine that the prices of energy sources will be  increased to world prices. Inasmuch as the energy and material  consumption of our industries, as a rule, is higher than in  developed countries, and labor productivity is lower, the prices  for the products of these industries will increase higher than  world prices, and, given open national borders (with respect to  foreign economic relations), this production will turn out to be  noncompetitive not only in the foreign market, but in the  domestic market as well. The consequences are obvious--industry  and agriculture will be utterly ruined    Consequently, to raise domestic prices for energy sources to  world level without erecting customs barriers for imports of key  types of products is impermissible. But inasmuch as our  industrial production should be brought onto the world  market--otherwise we will always only sell raw materials and  become a raw material appendage of the developed countries--then  it is obvious that before industry is reconstructed and its  indices approach those of the West, domestic prices for energy  sources must be lower than world prices.    The level of favorable prices for energy sources should be  tied strictly to a program of phased reduction of the specific  (per unit of product) energy consumption of an enterprise. The  wage fund of the workers of the enterprise should also be tied  to this and other programs for increasing the efficiency of  production. As long as the market mechanism is not working, the  state is obliged to regulate the price of manpower; i.e., wages,  at least in the main industries of the economy. But, today, the  lack of coordination on wages in our country is unbelievable.    As for the fuel-energy complex, at least at first, it will  have to be subsidized, while simultaneously cutting the Gordian  knot of mutual nonpayments.    No less important for Siberia with its enormous territory is  the level of the cost of transportation services. Expenditures  on railroad transportation render many types of raw materials  unsuitable for extraction, inasmuch as the processing complexes  are usually located in other points of Siberia. Even without  this, transportation costs greatly weaken cooperative relations.    And, finally, the last thing I want to talk about, while  contemplating the future of the country. Knowledge will be and  is already becoming the main capital in postindustrial society  in the developed countries. The destruction at all levels of  education, fundamental and applied science, and culture will  deprive our country of the future.    Therefore, it is necessary to consider the plans of the  economic development of Novosibirsk Oblast and Siberia, but only  the nearest events can be predicted. As for long-term projects  and programs, without resolution of the aforementioned global  overall state problems, there is a great probability that they  will turn into harebrained schemes.    Territorial efforts today must be combined and directed at  changes in the strategy of socio-economic reorganizations. The  details of the strategy can be argued, but its outline is  generally apparent. There is a whole series of sensible  documents and reports bearing on this question, and pertinent  decisions must be made. The time is short.    The adoption of such decisions can really only be achieved  by  the united efforts of the regions. The attempts of certain  territories to extract resources or benefits only for themselves  will turn into losses for everyone. Siberia needs economic  integration of the territories on the basis of resourceful,  technological, and economic mutual replenishment of each, and  not disintegration. There is a need for the collective defense  of a worthy place and role of Siberia in the economy of the  country. It will be sad and vexing if the "Siberian Agreement"  does not fulfill the hopes placed on it.    On occasion, one hears reproaches of separatist tendencies  directed at Siberians. I do not think that there are objective  grounds for this. It seems to me that an understanding prevails  in Siberia that a sensible combination of regional and national  interests can be achieved only given the unconditional supremacy  of the federal legislative authority and the simultaneous  transfer of a significant part of executive authority functions  to the localities with a guarantee of economic opportunities to  fulfill these functions. At the same time, the general federal  policy with respect to the regions should take into account  their main features and the significance of their development of  the country as a whole.    As for the predictions and recommendations for the economic  development of Siberia and its territories, we presented them at  the appropriate All-Russian conference in June of 1993. They  will also be given with an amendment to the events of recent  months in this congress in speeches of representatives of the  Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences.    Without going into detail, I will say that the core of these  recommendations is the position that it is precisely Siberia  with its very rich resources, production, and scientific  potential, and special territorial situation, that can play the  "role of the locomotive" that will pull the country out of the  crisis. This can be done by implementing the conditions  mentioned above and by declaring Siberia a zone of strategic  interests of Russia.    The alternative is that Siberia can become a zone of  strategic interests of the United States. After all, fantastic  ideas of purchasing Siberia from Russia for about $3 trillion,  with the payment of this sum over 20 years, are already being  nurtured; moreover, half with "payment in kind"; i.e., with the  goods and services of the producers of the United States. The  delirium of a madman? I would grade similar proposals precisely  as delirium, but the fact is that the Western mass media only  publishes "delirium," when there is a demand for it, and when it  is necessary to sound out the opinion of those whom this might  concern. This should be kept in mind when encountering similar  delirious ideas.</p>

Semenov, Russian  Academy of Sciences, Moscow, under the rubric ``Investigation of  the Sequelae of the Chernobyl Disaster''; UDC 614.876:621.038.58]    [Abstract]Studies were carried out on  (DBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] and DBA mice exposed to radiation in  cages placed on radionuclide-contaminated soil for 1, 7 or 14  days in the village of Yanov; dosage of gamma rays constituted  0.024, 0.168 and 0.336 Gy. Proliferation of T lymphocytes was  activated with all these doses. With the two lower doses there  was accumulation mostly of the T helper type and with the  highest dose, of the N suppressor type. In some cases mice were  exposed to x-rays in single doses of 0.25-1.0 Gy. Changes in  antibody production, relative weight and cellularity of the  thymus and spleen, T lymphocyte content of peripheral blood and  spleen, subpopulations of T lymphocytes in the spleen, ratio of  Lyt1[.sup]+[/]/Lyt2[.sup]+[/] cells in peripheral blood  and spleen. Labeled monoclonal antibodies and phenotypic  markers, immunization with ram erythrocytes, lymphocyte  cultures, [.sup]3[/]H-thymidine uptake and other methods were  used to test humoral immunity, hemolysin and hemagglutinin  titers, proliferative activity of splenocytes, blast formation  and radioactivity of samples, at different post-exposure times.  With lower doses there was activation of some immunological  effector functions and with higher ones they were inhibited. The  demonstrated proliferation of lymphoid cells, including  suppressors, as the dosage of ionizing radiation builds up in  the case of prolonged exposure to low levels thereof, triggers  autonomous control attenuating the induced increase in  lymphocytes and inhibiting effector manifestations of immunity.  More precise interpretation of immunological responses of humans  who had been in the zone of the Chernobyl accident or other  contaminated regions is recommended, since use of  immunostimulants is not only inadvisable, but even harmful in  such cases.

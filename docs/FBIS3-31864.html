			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Vesna Arsenic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, February 24 (TANJUG) -- In one month's  time of its implementation, the government's program aimed at  reconstructing the monetary system and invigorating the economic  recovery has revived optimism amongst people in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.).    The elimination of a hyperinflation is the most obvious  success of the program makers, awaiting confirmation by official  statistics for February. Between December 24 and January 24,  the prices were growing at a rate of two per cent per hour. In  the past month's time, however, the prices have constantly  declined.    Before the program was enforced, one kilogram of meat sold  for 50 deutsche marks (DM). Now, however, the price fell to  around 6 dm (one DM to one dinar).    Confronted with shortages of ready money, which can no  longer  be obtained from primary issue, the shops and factories opened  the doors of their storages, re-marketing the articles hitherto  in short supply.    The new dinar superseded the "inflationary dinar," the  purchasing power of which was next to nil. Old dinar bills,  denominated in millions and billions, only were the money  collector's attraction abroad.    The convertible new dinar is on a par with the DM, but  because of the lack of new dinars, German currency circulates at  the green market and restaurants. Since the foreign currency may  be bought and sold freely, the government reserves have  increased by 160 million DM in the past month's time.    Bankers announce the return of a variety of credit cards,  while retailers begin to grant short-term consumer credits.  These are the signs that inflation has been under control,  while the value and the purchasing power of the national  currency has stabilized.    The program makers have evidently won the first round in  eliminating hyperinflation and regaining confidence in the  national currency. What they face now is the re-start of  production, the success of which is to determine the future of  the program.    "The F.R.Y. implements this program relying upon itself,  without any foreign support and under the conditions of economic  sanctions imposed on it by the U.N. Security Council on May 30,  1992."</p>

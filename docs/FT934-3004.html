			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Low rainfall hits Scottish Hydro Scottish Hydro-Electric yesterday increased its interim dividend by 10 per cent as it reported pre-tax profits at the lower end of expectations. The 12 per cent profits rise, from Pounds 40.6m to Pounds 45.6m, follows unusually low rainfall which restricted its ability to generate hydro electric power. However, Mr Roger Young, chief executive, said he did not expect the rain shortfall to affect its final dividend and the company expected to stick to its target of 6 to 8 per cent real growth for the full year. That implies an 11 per cent increase at most, against market expectations for the recs of at least 14 per cent. For the six months to September 30, Hydro increased operating profits by 4.4 per cent to Pounds 52.5m on turnover up 14 per cent to Pounds 343.8m. Earnings per share were 11 per cent ahead at 8.81p (7.93p); the interim dividend is 3.96p (3.6p). Mr Young said low rainfall reduced pre-tax profit by about Pounds 1.6m from the normal level. Rainfall has remained low in the second half of the year. Unlike Scottish Power, Hydro chose not to include the benefit of improved coal contracts in its half year results. The contracts are for five years, backdated to April. The contracts would have increased pre-tax profits by about Pounds 400,000 but Hydro wants to finalise the deal before reporting the improvement. If, as seems likely, the deals are concluded by the end of the year, the full year effect will be about Pounds 1.2m Hydro has committed Pounds 69m to projects in England and Wales and by 1995, when the Keadby power station is expected to be operational, over 15 per cent of capacity will be in England. Gearing fell from 20.6 to 14.9 per cent. If the effect of Keadby, which is not on the balance sheet, was included that would be 31.7 per cent. Mr Young said gearing would rise to 18 per cent by the year-end, excluding Keadby, and 40 per cent including it. COMMENT It may sound like a lame excuse but Hydro has every right to blame its unspectacular performance on the weather. In only three years in the last 25 has rainfall been so low. Effects on the pre-tax rise are severe because last year's rainfall was unusually high. On fundamentals Hydro is doing well enough, and the policy of using the balance sheet to provide future unregulated earnings in England and Wales is sound. Hydro also faces less regulatory threat than regional power companies south of the border. Assuming a 12.5p full year dividend, the shares are on a prospective yield of 3.6 per cent following yesterday's share price fall. The potential problem for Hydro, as for Scottish Power, is that investors may be more tempted by the higher yielding English generators if the regulator decides against referring the English generators to the MMC.</p>

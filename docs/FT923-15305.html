			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Citicorp in Dollars 175m disposal of assets CITICORP, the leading US bank that is seeking to bolster its capital base, said last night it had raised Dollars 175m by means of the sale of assets related to its merchant processing unit for credit cards. The asset disposal, part of the bank's efforts to lift its main Tier 1 capital ratio from its present level of 4.06 per cent to the range of between 5 and 5 1/2 per cent, is the latest in a string of fund-raising security issues and sales of assets defined as non-strategic. Citicorp said that since the beginning of 1991 - when Mr John Reed, the chairman, first announced a plan for strengthening the company's capital position and restoring profitability by the end of 1992 - it had raised the equivalent of about Dollars 2.8bn in Tier 1 capital. The total amount of capital at the end of March 1992 was Dollars 9.1bn. Citicorp's target is capital of Dollars 12bn to Dollars 13bn. Yesterday's disposal of certain assets in Citicorp's credit card processing business does not mark a withdrawal from the sector. Citicorp emphasised it would continue to focus on providing credit card services to consumers, who presently hold 41m Citicorp-issued cards. The business affected by the sale, which is known as Citicorp Establishment Services, processes an annual sales volume of about Dollars 30bn in the US and provides authorisation, processing and settlement to merchants who accept credit cards. The buyers of the assets are Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, Prudential Equity Investors and William Blair &amp; co.</p>

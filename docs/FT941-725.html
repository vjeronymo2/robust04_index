			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Big savings in the details - Cost cutters are seeking to trim in the least obvious areas You have cut staffing levels by so much that further surgery would impair the company's ability to function. Yet more fat must be trimmed if margin improvement and growth is to be maintained while sales are static. Alternatively, you are planning the sale of a company at a price, for instance, of 10 times earnings. Every Pounds 50,000 cost-saving would lead to a Pounds 500,000 increase in the price the company would fetch. As the areas in which savings can be made become less obvious, so companies are increasingly turning to specialist cost cutters. Not only does this allow the managers to focus on those core areas of business development where they can add most value, but consultants can also frequently do a better job of finding savings for the very reason that it is what they do all the time. Turning to specialists is not new. UK consultants, such as National Utility Services, help companies find ways to control the cost of items like electricity, gas and water bills. And groups like Proudfoot design and implement cost-cutting programmes, often aimed at finding productivity increases which involve a cut in the workforce. But businesses can now get help in cutting costs, particularly overheads, in parts of their businesses where savings may previously have been seen as too small to bother with. Importing an idea that has taken off in the US, one London-based company, Expense Reduction Analysts, offers to scrutinise the least obvious areas within a business to find savings which nevertheless drop straight to the bottom line. The office stationery supplies, courier services and printing bills are prime targets. 'The amounts we are looking at are not significant in terms of the sales of any company. 'What we do is look to see what a company of that size should be paying for its services,' says Frederick Marfleet, the executive director of ERA. Stephen Dunsdon-Mash, chairman of ERA, says he has saved one company with sales of Pounds 300m more than Pounds 1m by reducing the amount of material delivered by unnecessary overnight delivery services. Many companies with sales of more than Pounds 100m will still be buying their stationery from catalogues, a notoriously expensive source of supply. Per Troen, a partner in a small international law firm, Abbott, King and Troen, said some of the areas ERA identified did not yield savings. But other recommendations saved the firm 10-15 per cent on its annual stationery, postage and courier bills. When senior managers bring in outside consultants to look at costs they can create serious tensions. For this reason, Dunsdon-Mash makes his first approach to the board level of companies, over the heads of those implicitly criticised if savings are found - the purchasing managers. The ERA service is provided purely on a contingency basis. ERA's low overheads allow it to charge only if it realises savings for its clients, as is the case for companies offering the service in the US. 'For us to be able to find Pounds 10,000 in savings is zero risk to the company,' says Dunsdon-Mash. If it does identify savings, its fees are steep - 50 per cent of the savings in the first year. ERA returns to the company three months after making recommendations to re-audit its position. Clients then have a contractual obligation to share any savings in the first year. For companies seeking immediate reductions in costs the idea has obvious attractions. But it can also accelerate the trend towards companies shedding what BET calls the 'chore businesses' and focusing on the core areas where they have a distinctive competence.</p>

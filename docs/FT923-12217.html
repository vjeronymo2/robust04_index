			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: South London football stadium plan SEVERFIELD-REEVE, based in Thirsk, has won over Pounds 3.5m worth of orders. The largest (Pounds 2m) from Tilbury Douglas is for the superstructure for the new Millwall football ground in south London. The contract involves the fabrication and erection of about 2,000 tonnes of steelwork to form four stands and a sports complex, together with the erection of concrete terrace sections and stairs. It is believed that this is the only new football ground currently being constructed in the UK. Shepherd Construction has awarded a Pounds 500,000 contract for a new student accommodation block at Sheffield Polytechnic. In Scotland, Severfield-Reeve has received two contracts from Tarmac totalling Pounds 500,000 for regional offices for British Gas and for a retail park. In Bristol, Pearce Construction has awarded the company a Pounds 250,000 contract to construct a factory for STC.</p>

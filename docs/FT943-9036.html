			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness defies sale talk Busy turnover in Guinness excited speculation that one of the group's big shareholders might be looking to sell its stake. There was good two-way business for most of the session with dealers reporting Salomon Brothers prominent among the sellers - prompting speculation that the US-owned investment bank was attempting to dribble part of a large order into the market. Some observers even suggested that Salomon was selling on part of a large bought deal, perhaps intending to retain a significant stake after worries over a stock overhang had been removed and the shares rallied. LVMH was being mooted as a possible seller, the French group having agreed earlier this year to reduce its stake in Guinness from 24 to 20 per cent, a total of 80m shares. A deadline of June next year has been set for the sale. Another investor being mentioned as a candidate for baling out was US investor Mr Warren Buffet. Having traded sideways, Guinness shares enjoyed a strong afternoon session, ending the day 8 ahead at 455p on turnover of 6.6m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (AFP) -- Chinese Prime Minister Li  Peng left Beijing on Tuesday for a two-week European tour which  will take him to Austria, Germany and Romania, the foreign  ministry said. Li is accompanied by the vice-premier  responsible for external trade Li Lanqing and a large delegation  of economic experts and state industry leaders.    The aim of the tour is to strengthen economic cooperation  with the three countries, particularly Germany its main economic  and commerical partner in Europe, said Li in a brief press  conference before leaving. "During my visit (to Germany) I will  sign some contracts and letters of intent," he added. He said  he would also have an exchange of views with leaders in all  three countries on the international situation, but did not  elaborate.    It is the second major European tour Li has undertaken in  the  past two and a half years. Early in 1992 he visited Spain,  Portugal, Italy and Switzwerland. "China attaches great  importance to its relations with European countries," said Li.    Due to serious heart problems Li, 65, did not travel abroad  last year. But in May this year he undertook a 10-day tour of  centrial Asian countries. "I have completely recovered. I work  eight hours a day, sometimes longer," he said. During his  absence vice-prime minister Zhu Rongji will be in charge of the  government.    [Hong Kong RTHK Radio Four in English at 0500 GMT on 28 June  reports: "Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng says cool political  relations with Britain are bound to affect economic ties. Mr Li  blamed Britain for the strained relations over the question of  Hong Kong. He said he hoped Sino-British economic and trade  relations would develop, but it was not possible to free them  from the adverse effects of the cool political relationship. Mr  Li, who was speaking at a news conference before leaving for a  visit to Austria, Germany, and Romania, pointedly praised  Germany for its long-standing cooperation with China."]</p>

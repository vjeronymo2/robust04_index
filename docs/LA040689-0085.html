			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PALISADES PROPOSAL;  </P> <P> BUILDING LIMITS TAKE AIM AT 'MANSIONIZING'  </P> <P> After nearly a year of study, the board that sets building design guidelines  for most of Pacific Palisades is expected to vote on a plan later this month to  curb the rash of massive homes being built in the community.  </P> <P> The Pacific Palisades Civic League will vote on a proposal to set a maximum  single-family house size of 2,000 square feet plus 28% of the lot size. The  plan would also restrict the height of new and remodeled homes to 28 feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Efforts Applauded  </P> <P> "We're not proposing the ultimate guidelines, we're just trying to make them  more restrictive than they are now," said Lila Gordon, president of the  19-member board. "We recognize that people want to build bigger houses. But  it's apparent that the current guidelines are not working."  </P> <P> Although many of the 70 homeowners who attended a Monday night meeting to  discuss the plan applauded the board's efforts to address the problem, several  complained that the guidelines hampered their ability to expand their own  properties. In addition, they said, the plan offered no guidelines for specific  neighborhoods, where in some cases large two-story homes would not be out of  character.  </P> <P> A few of the property owners also expressed concern that the proposed  restrictions would make potential buyers wary and might lower home values.  </P> <P> Yet the homeowners agreed unanimously that some stricter guidelines were  necessary to stem the wave of "mansionizing" plaguing communities throughout  Los Angeles County and particularly in the affluent areas of the Westside, such  as Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica.  </P> <P> For example, if the plan is approved, a homeowner with a 5,000-square-foot lot  would be limited to a 3,400-square-foot house. The biggest home allowed on a  10,000-square-foot lot would be 4,800 square feet. The guidelines also call for  a maximum second-story addition of 800 square feet plus 12% of the lot area.  </P> <P> Current guidelines, approved by the board last year, restrict the height of  houses to 32 feet. But there are no other restrictions on the size of new and  remodeled homes, and several developers have been tearing down existing homes  and building massive houses that nearly fill the lot.  </P> <P> During the past three years, the trend toward erecting huge homes has forced  city councils and planning boards throughout the Los Angeles County to begin  grappling with the difficult issue of size restrictions for single-family  homes.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Planning Commission is studying a proposal to place a  25-foot height limit on house lots of less than 7,500 square feet. Homes on  lots of up to 15,000 square feet would have a height limit of 35 feet. In the  city of Los Angeles, the height limit for all single-family homes is now 45  feet.  </P> <P> The palisades civic league's proposed guidelines are similar to restrictions  studied by the city of Beverly Hills, where officials are looking at a cap of  1,500 square feet for homes on small lots plus 35% of the lot size. Two years  ago the Beverly Hills City Council adopted a temporary ordinance limiting the  size of houses to 55% of lot size and made the ordinance permanent last June to  allow the Planning Commission more time to study the proposal.  </P> <P> The palisades board is responsible for design and building guidelines for about  60% of the commercial and residential property in the community, with the rest  governed by private deeds. In some areas, there are no restrictions at all.  </P> <P> However, one neighbor complained that restrictions would be almost impossible  to enforce.  </P> <P> "It's like gun control," said the man, who declined to give his name. "You can  pass any laws that you want but, unless you enforce them, people just (flout)  them."  </P> <P> The civic league maintains that it can seek a court injunction to stop any  construction that doesn't conform to its guidelines.  </P> <P> Gordon said that the guidelines may be altered slightly before the board votes  on the plan.  </P> <P> "But I think these guidelines are flexible," Gordon said. "If we don't provide  something that is reasonable, then we will find a bunch of people who just  choose to ignore them. We just need to get some guidelines in place, and then  we can refine them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BUILDING GUIDELINES  </P> <P> The Pacific Palisades Civic League is expected to vote on a plan later this  month to curb the rash of massive homes being built in the community. The  proposal would:  </P> <P> * Set a maximum single-family house size of 2,000 square feet plus 28% of the  lot size.  </P> <P> * Restrict the height of new and remodeled homes to 28 feet. Current guidelines  restrict heights to 32 feet.  </P> <P> * Limit second-story additions to a maxiumum of 800 square feet plus 12% of the  lot area.  </P></p>

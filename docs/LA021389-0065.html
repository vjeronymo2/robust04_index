			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SEXUAL AGGRESSION STUDIED  </P> <P> Some young men are so strongly attracted to sexual aggression that more than a  fourth of those responding to a scientific inquiry said they would be at least  somewhat likely to commit rape if they could get away with it, a UCLA  researcher reported last week.  </P> <P> Writing in the current issue of the Journal of Sex Research, UCLA psychology  professor Neil Malamuth said there is a substantial number of men who have  never committed such an act, but who do not find sexual aggressiveness  reprehensible.  </P> <P> "The data suggest that to actually commit sexual aggression, several  personality tendencies have to be present," Malamuth said. "But there is a  profile of people who are attracted to sexual aggression and another profile  for those who actually commit it."  </P> <P> To make his assessments, Malamuth and his colleagues developed a 14-item  questionnaire that allowed them to clearly separate sexual aggressiveness from  other forms of aggressive behavior, he said.  </P> <P> Twenty-six percent of the men surveyed, all of whom were university students in  Canada, ranging between ages 18 and 25, said they would be at least somewhat  likely to commit rape if they could escape punishment.  </P> <P> "More men said they would force a woman to commit a sexual act against her will  than (would) rob a bank," Malamuth said of a two-part question asked of the  test subjects.  </P> <P> But only 1.7% of the respondents said they would be very likely to commit rape  if they could get away with it, Malamuth said.  </P></p>

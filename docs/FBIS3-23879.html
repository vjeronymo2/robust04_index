Sabirov, prime minister of  Tatarstan, received a delegation of representatives of a number  of major companies, firms, and banks of the FRG headed by Herr  H.-G. Pohl, director of the Board of Guardians.    Dependable relations were established with them during the  recent visit to Germany of a government delegation of Tatarstan.    M. Sabirov notified the visitors that a notable historical  event--the signing by the leaders of the Russian Federation and  the Republic of Tatarstan of an interstate treaty--had taken  place in the life of Tatarstan. Eleven important  intergovernmental agreements have been concluded within the  framework thereof. One of them is in the sphere of foreign  economic relations; it legally enshrines, in particular, our  republic's right to engage in independent foreign economic  activity with states of the world community.    The head of the delegation congratulated the prime minister  on this event and expressed the hope that the treaty would lend  new impetus to the development of mutually profitable trade and  economic cooperation between Tatarstan and the Federal Republic  of Germany.    During the negotiations the parties exchanged opinions on a  number of matters of mutual interest. Paths of an expansion and  intensification of the charted relations in the sphere of the  conversion of defense plants located on the territory of  Tatarstan, the privatization of enterprises of industry, trade,  and services, and the use of German technologies in the  republic's agricultural production and mutually profitable  commodity exchange were outlined. Great attention was paid to  the realization of a number of joint projects. Modernization of  the capacity of the Nizhnekamskneftekhim production association  and others, for example.    Possibilities of the long-term allocation of loans for  republic programs thanks to government credit of the FRG of up  to DM10 billion were determined.    Prime Minister M. Sabirov and Herr H.-G. Pohl signed a  statement of intent on cooperation between the Government of the  Republic of Tatarstan and the FRG Board of Guardians.    The program of the German guests' visit to Tatarstan  includes  a visit to a number of enterprises, firms, and banks of our  republic and familiarization with their product for the purpose  of the establishment of close, mutually profitable relations  with a view to the future.

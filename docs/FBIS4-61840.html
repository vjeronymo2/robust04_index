			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has proposed a three-stage plan for a  settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over  Nagorno-Karabakh. Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia's  ambassador-at-large, told journalists in Baku that a cease-fire  and disengagement of the warring sides are envisaged under the  first stage, which would last six days. A withdrawal from all  occupied territories, except for the towns of Shusha and Lachin,  must take place during the second stage, which would last 34  days. During this stage there would also be an exchange of  POW's and refugees, who must return to their homes. Withdrawal  from Shusha and Lachin will be tackled separately. Finally, the  status of Nagorno-Karabakh will be examined during the third  stage of the settlement.</p>

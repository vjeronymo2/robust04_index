			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The Channel tunnel and competition Sir, The impact of the Channel tunnel on the logistics industry ('Opinion divided over tunnel', 5 October) may well be disputed. What is clear is its minor, anticipated impact on company and industry competitiveness in those regional markets whose relative accessibility is most likely to be affected. A multi-sectoral study of the competitiveness implications of the tunnel has recently been completed by the Centre for Management Research at the University of Ulster. Interviews with some 150 manufacturers in Northern Ireland, south-east England, France and Belgium make it clear the tunnel, and the logistics options it provides, will have little impact on companies' inter-regional competitiveness. This is as true for peripheral companies serving southern England and European markets as for companies located in those markets. Non-price factors, notably product quality and design, and service reliability, will continue to dominate. What is particularly striking, and ultimately worrying in an assessment of the long-term competitiveness of UK industry, is the reliance of continental European companies competing in north European and UK regional markets, on design, technical ability and quality for competitive edge. UK companies remain reliant on straightforward price competitiveness. In this context, the opening of the Channel tunnel is an irrelevance, which may deflect attention from more fundamental concerns.

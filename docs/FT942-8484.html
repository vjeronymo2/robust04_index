			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Date set for award of lottery licence The winner of the UK's National Lottery licence to run an operation that will probably be the world's largest single lottery will be announced at 10am on Wednesday. At 9.50am seven of the eight applicants will receive a fax informing them that their bid has been unsuccessful. The eighth will get a press release from Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the Office of the National Lottery, due to be issued at 10am to the media and the Stock Exchange. Mr Davis will then hold a press conference at the Institution of Civil Engineers in Great George Street, Westminster. At stake is the right to run a lottery that could be launched before the end of this year and which many specialists believe could have revenues of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn a year. It is not inconceivable that as much as Pounds 1bn a year could be raised for five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport. Mr Davis is the only person who knows the outcome of the highly complex bidding process and has been in purdah for the past few months. The fact that he alone has had access to all information on the bids has made the lottery decision leak-proof so far. However, two groups have emerged as firm favourites through a mixture of hunch, judgment and gossip: Camelot, a consortium including Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue and G-Tech; and Lotco, Rank Organisation's in-house bid. The UK Lottery Foundation - a bid put together by Mr Richard Branson and Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary - has emerged as the bookmakers' favourite. But specialists are not so confident of its chances. In the absence of hard information, few are prepared to rule out completely bids from Games For Good Causes, which groups Ladbroke and MAI; The Great British Lottery Company (Granada and Carlton Communications), or the Rothschild Tattersalls Lottery Consortium.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: Marketing domination that inhibits the small airlines Sir, It comes as a shock to learn from your leader, 'Favourite airline' (October 26), that British Airways European fares are cheap. Perhaps they are to the 'ENO' (expense no object) market segment, but the other half resent being forced to pay business-class fares by the European flag carriers, now that they have eliminated economy fares on nearly all the routes. Since 1970, the ferries' share of UK business travel to Europe has risen from 11 per cent to 29 per cent, including a sharp 6 per cent rise since the slump started. Many of the European airlines' costs are about twice US levels, and yet they make a margin of more than 15 per cent on the business fares, while losing about 12 per cent in the much larger rear cabins, as a result of excessive discounting. Staff productivity in America and Australia is up to twice European levels, and airline salaries high, too. The reason that the small low-cost airlines have made so little impact is that the 'big brothers' dominate the marketing channels. Via incentive ('override') commissions they persuade travel agents to book with them. They meet the fares of the newcomers on the very few routes where they operate, while maintaining their high fare structure on all the other routes ('spoke biasing'). They persuade the hungry small airlines to carry their connecting traffic at less than economic rates. A 1990 Civil Aviation Authority report showed that Dan-Air was receiving 16 per cent less than the lowest inclusive tour fare - ie only 20-25 per cent of the on-demand fare - for London-Paris connecting traffic. Big tour operators, particularly when traffic is weak, use their buying muscle to force down the non-public fares charged for big groups. The smaller companies are more vulnerable than the large, which are by no means exempt - an important reason for the losses in their rear cabins. In his February Brancker memorial lecture, the chairman of the CAA predicted that the continental flag carriers would not compete for the local European traffic, but only for the 'feed' to their profitable intercontinental services. Hence, the demise of Dan-Air, a truly independent airline, is especially bad news. A J Lucking, 20/17 Broad Court, London WC2B 5QN</p>

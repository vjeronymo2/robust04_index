			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Group 4 hunts big share of penal market: The company's growing ambitions to 'release the police from time-consuming duties' GROUP 4, the private security company, although defeated last week in the competition to run Manchester's Strangeways prison, is still enthusiastic to expand in the criminal justice market. The fact that there is such a thing as an embryonic market for criminal justice services owes a good deal to Group 4. Last year it became the first private company to manage a prison - Wolds on Humberside - and in April took on the first private contract to escort prisoners to court. Yet the company has paid a price for being the first in a sensitive area where, penal reformers and opposition politicians believe, there are moral objections to private-sector involvement. The escape of prisoners in the early days of the escort contract made the company the subject of both criticism and jokes. Fresh attention will be focused on Wolds when the report on the prison's first official inspection is published soon. But Mr Jim Harrower, UK chief executive of Group 4, is convinced that public spending pressures and the trend for governments to contract out delivery of services will lead to further private-sector involvement in criminal justice activities, both in Britain and elsewhere. Group 4, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, operates in more than 30 countries worldwide. It has recently started to expand in Australia, Canada and New Zealand - partly because of market opportunities that match its core security activities, but also because Group 4 sees these countries as likely to follow the UK example of contracting out criminal justice work to the private sector. 'I envisage the private sector eventually financing, designing, building and operating prisons,' said Mr Harrower. 'But if this is to happen, the sector must take a serious and responsible view of prison management. 'Running a successful prison means establishing effective education programmes, drug and alcohol programmes, training programmes and industrial activities. I want to see Group 4 making a real contribution to addressing the problems of offending behaviour and trying to get reoffending levels down,' he added. He recognises that the private security industry does not always enjoy the high public reputation to match such high-sounding ideals. Mr Harrower has, as chairman of the British Security Industry Association, urged the government to legislate for statutory regulation of standards in the industry. Ministers have so far advocated self-regulation instead. 'The industry is extending its codes of practice and developing standards to demonstrate that it can regulate itself,' he said. 'But the problem is that self-regulation is viewed with suspicion by the public.' Group 4 got to the shortlist stage in the competition to run Strangeways. With the contract awarded to the public-sector in-house team, the next big prize for the private companies is the new prison at Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Invitations to tender for this contract, worth about Pounds 15m a year, are likely to go out next month. Doncaster will definitely go to the private sector - there is no in-house team there - and Group 4 would particularly like to manage it. The prison is in the same region as the Wolds and the company's prison escort contract, and would open up the prospect of Group 4 providing an integrated range of criminal justice services throughout the area. Mr Harrower, as well as bidding for the contract to provide escort services in London when they go to private management next year, sees further scope for the security industry in the government's drive to increase police efficiency. This could lead to activities as varied as shopping centre patrols, criminal records, escorting wide loads on the roads and operating motorway speed cameras being considered for contracting out. Such moves would again raise questions about the regulation of standards, and the relationship between the police and the private security industry. 'There are areas where the industry can release the police from time-consuming duties,' said Mr Harrower. 'But there must remain a clear dividing line between security companies and the police. We can gather evidence of possible offences, but must not get involved in decisions to prosecute. So it would be legitimate for private companies to gather information by operating motorway speed cameras, although I would not want Group 4 doing it - we have our reputation to consider.' Until the acquisition of Intergarde Monitor Security in Belgium in 1991, Group 4's UK operation was by far its largest. The UK and Belgium operations are now of broadly equal size - UK turnover was Pounds 142m last year, up from Pounds 127m in 1991. Turnover worldwide was Pounds 414m - an increase of 35 per cent over 1991, of which 15.4 per cent represented growth in sales turnover. Manned services such as security guarding are Group 4's main activity - these contributed Pounds 266m of worldwide turnover.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Reforms fail to cut the cost of bribing voters: Japan's long and dishonourable tradition of 'money politics', thought to have been banished by voter disgust and political change, may be reviving Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the leader of one of the smaller factions in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, threw a party for several thousand of his closest friends. The ostensible purpose was to celebrate the publication of his book. Nothing was left to chance in ensuring the gathering's success, though  -former ministers in the faction were each encouraged to sell 1,000 tickets at Y30,000 (Pounds 190) to their wealthier supporters, and even first year members of parliament were expected to palm off 200 tickets. But there was, of course, an ulterior motive - fund-raising for the faction. When the last book had been signed a total of Y135m had rolled in, less than had been hoped for, but a useful addition to the group's coffers. The event was just one of a sudden rush of fund-raisers in the last month. After a long lull in parties' revenue-raising efforts, the political cash registers have been ringing again. The demand for funds is considerable - next year will see a rolling programme of elections in japan - local elections in the spring, followed by national upper house elections in summer, and throughout, the threat of a general election at any time. But the recent round of political money-spinning events has raised fears that Japan's long and dishonourable tradition of 'money politics', thought to have been banished by voter disgust and political reform, may in fact be enjoying a revival. A succession of revelations of corruption in the last 20 years hardened the cynicism of the Japanese towards their political bosses - from the Lockheed affair in the 1970s to the Recruit affair of the 1980s and recent construction-related scandals. But while these were the most lurid of the cases of corruption, what came to trouble the Japanese more was the fact that a myriad of unpublicised cases testified to the fact that the entire political system ran on money. But all that was supposed to have been ended by the voter backlash last year that swept the LDP out of office for the first time in nearly 40 years. The political articulation of the popular disgust was the reform package instigated a year ago and passed into law last month, with the backing even of a chastened LDP. These reforms come into effect on Christmas Day, but there are widespread doubts about precisely what effect they will have in ridding the country of 'money politics'. The problem cannot simply be ascribed to the venality of politicians. Like everything else in Japan, politics is an expensive business. In order to get elected politicans have to spend vast sums of money on a pliant electorate. For decades the unchallenged dominance of the LDP meant that political competition was based not on ideological lines but on pecuniary ones - who could spend the most money to buy the most votes. The reforms were supposed to have taken away both the cause and the effect of this demand for political 'hot' money. Japan's system of multi-member constituencies was identified as the cause. Because more than one politican from the same party could run against each other, the election often became a race between war chests. The politican who could spend more lavishly on the voters would be the winner. Replacing that with predominantly single-member constituencies means only one candidate from each party can run, so, the theory goes, the election turns not on money but on ideological and policy differences. Cynics always regarded the likely benefits of the new system as doubtful. The progress of Japanese politics in the last six months makes it highly unlikely that the system will change substantially. The nominal coalition government of socialist and Liberal Democrats is in fact dominated by LDP members and policy and it will be the principal governing party in the next election, faced by an assortment of forces under the banner of New Frontier Party. What these opposition parties have in common is that they were mostly once parts of the LDP. 'The idea that there is an ideological divide in Japanese politics is even more far-fetched now than it was in the past,' says Mr Rei Shiratori, head of the Japan Institute for Political Studies. 'The next election will be fought essentially between the current LDP and an opposition made up of former LDP members. 'That means the differences will again be marginal and will come down to who spends the most.' And the battle is actually set to become more expensive. The reform cuts the number of individual constituencies by half, replacing them with members elected from a national list. So there are now fewer constituencies. 'That means the number of votes required to win an individual seat has risen sharply,' says Mr Dan Harada, a political consultant, 'So even more money will have to spent on bribing the voters.' But, argue the supporters of reform, that ignores another change that will reduce political donations. But here too there is scepticism. Though the new law envisages a phasing out of contributions to indivdual politicans within five years, politicans are starting to get around the prohibition by simply shifting their funding vehicle from themselves to their branch party. The law does not forbid such donations. 'In effect, politicans will go on receiving money, but in the name of their loacal party,' says Mr Shiratori. This may be too cynical a view. One pro-reform member of parliament says: 'Last year the voters voted for real change. If they don't get it they will punish the politicians again.' That blithe view will be tested in the next year by the arrival of the new system at Christmas. The voters will get a chance to express their distaste again for the past political order. But for the time being, as the LDP holds firmly onto the reins of power, the book launch spree seems likely to run and run.</p>

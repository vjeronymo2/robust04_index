			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: ART TO RIVAL DESIGN  </P> <P> For nearly four decades photographer Marvin Rand has been documenting the  architecture of Southern California for a variety of popular and professional  books and journals.  </P> <P> Particularly celebrated are his exquisite photographs of the early-20th-Century  designs of Irving Gill and the brothers Charles and Henry Greene, many of whose  buildings have since been demolished.  </P> <P> In a pleasing coincidence, Rand's distinctive photographs of the works of these  architects will be on display in separate exhibits:  </P> <P> The Greenes at Kirsten Kiser's Gallery for Architecture, 964 N. La Brea Ave.,  from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays, until April 29; and Gills,  at the Modern Living gallery, 4063 Redwood Ave., 10 to 7, Monday through  Friday, and 12 to 5, Saturday and Sundays, from March 25 through May 1.  </P> <P> Rand, ever the diplomat, won't say whose architecture he prefers, saying that  each has its genuis.  </P> <P> "What I try to do is abstract the content from the details of the design that  express the indigenuous creativity of the architect." It is the sort of  statement that architects love, and has made Rand one of the more popular  practioneers. SAM HALL KAPLAN  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Barisic: "Approving of International </F> Diplomacy Mistakes"]    [Text] Had the Lasva Valley, the Croatian enclave in  central Bosnia, fallen into the hands of the Muslim army during  their Christmas offensive, Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian (Muslim)  prime minister, would not have sent the letter of accusation to  the United Nations in which he asked for sanctions against the  Republic of Croatia for the alleged participation of its army in  clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina alongside the Bosnian Croats. The  European Union and UN mechanisms that put the issue of a  possible introduction of economic sanctions against Croatia on  the agenda would not have been set in motion. Silajdzic  mentioned 10,000 to 12,000 members of the "regular Croatian  Army" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali mentioned 3,000 to 5,000 Croatian Army members in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in a letter to the UN Security Council  chairman dated 2 February 1994. Apart from that, Butrus-Ghali  also wrote that, at the beginning, Croatian Army soldiers,  mostly groups of volunteers, directly supported the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] with equipment and weapons, and concluded:  "Since the offensive of the army of the government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina grew stronger, it seems that the number of  Croatian soldiers has increased."    Butrus-Ghali did not mention in his report that this  offensive of the "government forces" expelled approximately  120,000 Croats from their homes in central Bosnia, that several  towns and many villages were completely destroyed or burned down  (not to mention the massacres committed on civilians), that the  Croats from Central Bosnia were pushed into three enclaves  (Lasva Valley -- 80,000 people, Kiseljak-Kresevo -- about  100,000, Zepce -- 50,000 and Usora -- 20,000), and that the  Croatian people are facing complete extinction because of  constant Muslim attacks (with the exception of Usora, which is  constantly being attacked by Serbs). Mr. Puljic, the Bosnian  archbishop, realized this and said in a sermon some time ago  that "a propaganda machine is being created in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aim of which is to completely destroy  the Croatian enclaves." He made this statement although it is  known that he is inclined to support Izetbegovic. He asked the  world to exert pressure on the Muslim leadership in order to  prevent them carrying out their goal.  <H5>  Illegal "Legal Organs" </H5>   Since the Croats in the Central Bosnian enclaves are  defending their territory, trying to save their existence in the  places in which they had a majority according to the last census  (see the table at the end of the text), and since the Muslim  leadership is, at the same time, trying to destroy the Croatian  Army in order to take land from the Croats -- as was proven  during peace negotiations (in the talks on territorial  partition, Izetbegovic told Tudjman that he would sign the Bonn  proposal on condition that the whole territory of Central Bosnia  became a part of the Muslim republic) -- it is not clear why the  international community shows understanding for these politics.  Even more, since there is no multicultural element in the  Muslim politics, they are motivated exclusively by the national  idea -- it wants to gain as much territory as possible for its  state, even territories in which other peoples have lived for  centuries, as is the case in Central Bosnia.    Silajdzic's letter to the United Nations is an act of  revenge  because the Muslim forces failed in their attempt to seize the  Croatian enclaves or to begin their breakthrough to the south.  Silajdzic knows that he cannot count on a victory in Central  Bosnia, because the HVO have strengthened their positions there  (it could happen that the Croats will take some Muslim  territories), so he is now trying to reconstitute  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unitary state in order to get  international support. According to its Constitution,  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a state of three constituent nations,  which means that all three have to reach consensus when  decisions are taken. Since first the Serbs and then, after the  Muslim offensive, the Croats also left the government and the  Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are now no legally  elected representatives of these two nations in the legal bodies  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Silajdzic was incorrect when he told Mr.  Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy: "We are a UN member and  there are not three sides in Bosnia, there is only one side and  that is the government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the other  legal bodies that represent Bosnia-Herzegovina as a UN member."  Akashi knows, however, that the government and "other legal  bodies" of Bosnia-Herzegovina are composed of Muslims only.  Since they represent only one nation, and the Constitution says  that Bosnia-Herzegovina is a state of three nations, Silajdzic's  bodies do not have legitimacy. For this reason, Silajdzic can  represent only Muslims, not Bosnia-Herzegovina. His wish is  similar to that of Milosevic, who claims for Serbia the  continuity of the former Yugoslavia. International law  (Badinter's commission) contested Milosevic's wish, so that  there is no reason to doubt that Silajdzic will receive the same  answer.   <H5>    Right to Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>   The international community is afraid of the unfolding  events  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since Bosnia-Herzegovina is a UN member,  its collapse could, so it is claimed, become an argument that  other states, especially in Eastern Europe, could use in order  to annex territories of other states under the pretext of  protecting their national minorities. This opinion prevailed  during the discussion on Bosnia-Herzegovina in the U.S. Senate  when it was decided that the U.S. President should propose the  introduction of sanctions against Croatia. It was clearly  stated in the resolution that "although the Croatian aim might  be the protection of the ethnic Croatian community from the  Muslim offensive in the short run, there is the doubt that  Croatia might wish to change the borders in the long run." This  doubt is not unfounded, but it is not correct that the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are an "ethnic community," as is stated in  the resolution adopted by the U.S. Senate. The Croats are one  of the constituent nations. This is stated in the Constitution  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so that the relation of the Republic of  Croatia to the Croats in Bosnia cannot be an example for other  countries (Russia, Serbia, Iran...) that are starting, or have  already started, aggression against other states, trying to take  territories from them and change borders by force. The Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina are not a minority, but a nation, they  have the same rights as the most numerous nation there -- the  Muslims (and the Serbs, too). This makes it clear that  Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive only if its three nations reach  an agreement, as has already been stated thousands of times. In  other words, Bosnia-Herzegovina will not survive unless the  legitimate representatives of its three nations find an  acceptable concept for its survival. Through intervention from  outside, Bosnia-Herzegovina can be saved for some time if a  protectorate, in other words a certain kind of occupation, is  introduced.    From the Turkish occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the  present day it has existed only as a province of an occupier.  The occupiers were first the Turks, who granted it a certain  autonomy within their empire. Bosnia-Herzegovina was then  occupied by the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, and, in the end,  there were the periods of the greater-Serbian (Yugoslavia  between the two world wars) and communist (Tito's Yugoslavia)  dictatorships. When Yugoslavia was dissolved, the population of  Bosnia-Herzegovina decided in a referendum that their country  should become a sovereign state (the Croats also voted for this  proposal), which was later recognized by the international  community. Milosevic committed an act of aggression against it,  occupying around 70 percent of its territory. He also carried  out ethnic cleansing of the Muslims (but also of Croats in  Bosnian Posavina). Since the international community was not  able to force the Serbs to stop the aggression and to return the  territories they had cleansed, the Muslims adopted the Serbian  concept and started occupying the territories with a Croatian  majority (Central Bosnia, Vares), as well as those areas in  which the Croats were a minority (Travnik, Bugojno, Konjic,  Jablanica...). The Croats were expelled from their homes. They  no longer control a single town in which the Muslims had the  majority before the war (approximately the same number of Croats  and Muslims lived in Stolac).  <H5>  Failure of Peace Offers </H5>   It is true that during this war the political leadership of  the Bosnian Croats and their army made certain moves that cannot  be justified (they were accused by the leaderships of both the  Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosna and of Croatia), but  regardless of how significant they might have been, they still  cannot justify the Muslim offensive, the aim which is -- as was  expressed by the Sarajevo archbishop -- "a complete destruction  of Croatian enclaves" and -- as politicians warn -- a  breakthrough toward the south in order to cut the Croatian state  into two parts. These intentions of the Muslim leadership  cannot be regarded benevolently by the political leadership of  the Republic of Croatia, the state that is taking care of half a  million refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina (mostly Muslims).  Croatia simply cannot allow the Muslim army to expel 200,000  Croats from the enclaves in Central Bosnia. The Croatian  leadership was aware of the danger that sanctions could be  introduced against it, so it did not want to send its army to  the territory of another state, although there were requests for  help and although it did not have the intention of occupying  territory, but of protecting the people in the enclaves and in  northern Herzegovina. Supported by the international community,  the Croatian leadership tried to break the Muslim offensive  through various peace initiatives and compromises offered to  Alija Izetbegovic, but to no avail. Since Izetbegovic and  Silajdzic did not want to give in, and since the Muslim army  continued its attacks, volunteers from Croatia born in  Bosnia-Herzegovina joined the HVO in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This  was, however, not enough to stop the Muslim aggression, so the  associations of Bosnian Croats active in Croatia compiled lists  and carried out an informal mobilization of Croats born in  Bosnia-Herzegovina (about 1,500 people), who went to Bosnia as  volunteers.    On 7 February, when deciding on the introduction of  sanctions against Croatia and on the proposal they will submit  to the United Nations, the foreign ministers of the European  Union will hopefully not forget that the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are neither a minority nor an ethnic  community, but a nation, that they are fighting in Central  Bosnian enclaves against the Muslim forces ("government forces")  that want to carry out ethnic cleansing there (as has already  been done to 120,000 Croats). They will hopefully not forget  that Croatia is taking care of 700,000 refugees, half of whom  come from Bosnia-Herzegovina, that Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be  an example for some countries that may try to annex the  territories of other countries on the pretext of protecting  their minorities. Apart from that, the European Union has to  bear in mind that Bosnia-Herzegovina can survive only if the  European Union establishes a protectorate over it, as was done  by Austria after the Berlin Congress.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Structure of the Croatian Enclavesin Central Bosnia According to th-|  |e 1991 Census                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Commune     |Inhabitants |Croats      |Muslims     |Serbs       |Others      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Busovaca    |18,883      |9,064       |8,497       |566         |755         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kiseljak    |24,091      |12,527      |9,977       |723         |964         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kresevo     |6,699       |4,756       |1,541       |--          |402         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |N.

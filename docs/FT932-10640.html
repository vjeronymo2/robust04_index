			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nedcor reports 22% advance to R234m for half NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth-largest bank, yesterday reported a 22 per cent increase in net income to R234m (Dollars 74m) for the six months to March 1993. The interim dividend is to be increased. The result was achieved despite heavier provisions. Mr Chris Liebenberg, chief executive, said the bank has reacted to the volatile operating environment by making generous risk provisions and by not taking the full benefit of various deferred tax benefits. This was a time to be conservative, he said The weak state of the South African economy was reflected in an 8 per cent decline in interest income to R3.1bn, a function of lower-than-expected volumes and declining interest rates. Net interest income rose 11 per cent to R881m. Other income improved by 22 per cent to R574m. Specific and general risk provisions rose by 33 per cent to R120m (R90m). Mr Liebenberg conceded that, if current trends continued, the bank would have over-provided for the loan book of the Perm, the group's home loan arm, and some provisions would be returned to capital. He presented figures to show that concern about the Perm's exposure to lending in segregated black townships - described as a very difficult market  -were misplaced. Perm advances represented 22 per cent of group assets, while and township advances were 5 per cent of the total. He said only 0.15 per cent of group assets were in arrears. The increase in provisions was partly offset by a modest 2 per cent increase in the tax bill to R167m. Shareholders who prefer can elect to receive a cash dividend of 25 cents per share, a 19 per cent increase over 1992.</p>

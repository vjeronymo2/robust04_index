			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Private funds sought for rail project THE government announced yesterday that another in a long line of badly needed transport projects was to be funded and carried out by the private sector. It has appointed Hambros Bank, the merchant bank, to develop a plan involving the private sector in the Pounds 300m resignalling of the London Euston to Glasgow line, one of the busiest InterCity routes. The move comes amid growing criticism of the government's progress in its attempts to involve private-sector finance in public-sector infrastructure projects. Some private companies and critics in government spending departments say the private- sector initiative has become an excuse for delaying projects such as the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link and the Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme for London's east-west rail link. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, yesterday sought to counter scepticism by emphasising the London-Glasgow line modernisation marked a new approach by the government in its attempts to involve private sector funding. He said the government had previously invited the private sector to put forward proposals which had then been considered on their merits. But now, he said, the government was taking the initiative. Hambros has been given until September to develop the funding proposal. Provided the package was acceptable to the private sector and the Treasury it will form the basis for tendering between private-sector contractors for the signalling project. Last month Eurorail, a consortium involving GEC, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, said it wanted to become involved in rail projects such as the upgrading of the London-Glasgow line. Whichever company wins the contract will recover investment by charging Railtrack, the public-sector body that will own the tracks after privatisation, a toll for each train using the resignalled line. Mr Freeman said private-sector finance would enable the resignalling to be carried out much more quickly than if the state undertook it, with the cost spread over the lifetime of the investment. If the formula proves successful, he added, it could be extended to many other rail projects. If Hambros does not come up with a package acceptable to the private sector and government, Railtrack would have to find the funds for investment.</p>

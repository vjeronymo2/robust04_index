Filali, who led the Moroccan delegation to the 101st  ordinary  session of the Arab League Ministerial Council held here March  25-26, told MAP bureau here he was confident that the Arab  world, thanks to the wisdom of its leaders, will overcome the  difficult situation it is going through.    Filali underlined the importance of the issues tackled by  the  league session recalling that participants have called on the  Security Council to take measures to guarantee the security of  all the states in the Middle East and to enable them contribute  to the promotion of a new era based on understanding, mutual  trust and cooperation in the social and economic realms.    Pointing out that the discussion of a number of issues such  as security in the Arab world and the boycott of Israel was  postponed, Filali however deplored the postponement of the item  related to the Arab League Charter amendment. He said the  Charter, signed in the forties by seven Arab countries which  were then independent, must keep pace with the changes taking  place on the Arab and international scenes.    He added however that Morocco backs the idea to revise the  Charter rather than the idea to amend it, as claimed by some  member states.    Filali, who [words indistinct] had conferred with several  Arab foreign ministers on the fringes of the league session. He  thus met with peers from Egypt, the Comoros Islands, Iraq,  Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia.    He also attended Saturday a coordination meeting between the  foreign ministers of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) meant to  coordinate Maghreban states' stands on the items slated on the  agenda of the league ministerial session and to review issues of  concern to UMA. UMA gathers Algeria, Libya, Mauritania,  Morocco and Tunisia.</p>

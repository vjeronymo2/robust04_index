			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A recent OECD study of the Czech economy  positively assesses its current condition and foresees continued  improvement. The OECD report, which was summarized in the 25  March edition of the Prague business daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY,  credits the Czech Republic's recent success in part to its  "surprisingly smooth" separation from its former sister republic  and to the stabilization and privatization policies of the  government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The report notes that  the Czechs have succeeded in compensating for a sharp decline in  sales to Slovakia since the separation by increasing exports to  Western countries by 19.5 percent last year, while, at the same  time, allowing imports from the West to rise by only 5.2 percent.    The OECD experts attribute the Czech Republic's abilities to  maintain strong foreign currency reserves and to achieve a  favorable trade balance to its exceptionally stable fiscal and  monetary policies and its low inflation rate. They warn,  however, that the Czech Government should exercise caution with  its wage regulation policy, even though this acts as a brake on  inflation, because pent-up demand for wage increases could  eventually lead to an explosive situation, especially in areas  of labor shortages.    The OECD report praises the Klaus government's  coupon-privatization policy for permitting the rapid  privatization of over 36 percent of state-owned properties  without arousing popular discontent, but it warns that the  government's efforts to keep down the rate of bankruptcies (only  20 were declared in the first five months after the government's  new bankruptcy law went into effect in mid-1993) could backfire  as the number of insolvent firms accumulates.    The general macroeconomic picture is seen as promising,  aided  by a balanced government budget, a foreign-payments surplus, and  the neutral monetary policy of the Czech National Bank.  Industrial production is expected to increase, although only at  a modest rate, while growth of 2 percent in 1994 and 5 percent  in 1995 is predicted for the overall GDP. Nevertheless,  unemployment will probably increase as the expected wave of  bankruptcies starts to have an impact. (A study by the Vienna  Institute for Comparative Economic Studies also warns of  increasing unemployment this year, according to the 6 April  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. The Vienna Institute attributes the current  low unemployment rate to a sharp drop in the size of the labor  force, from 5.7 million in 1989 to a current 4.8 million. The  drop is mainly the result of ending the artificially high  work-force participation rate of 87 percent under the communist  regime and of absorbing displaced industrial and agricultural  workers in the rapidly developing service sector. The study sees  both of these trends as essentially played out, making a  doubling of the unemployment rate possible in 1994.)    The OECD experts said they expect a small surplus in the  1994  balance of payments, particularly due to net income from  services and tourism. They warn, however, that this surplus may  drop to near zero in 1995 as a result of increasing imports due  to an expanding economy and continuing improvement in living  standards. Their report notes that foreign currency reserves of  $6.5 billion have been accumulated so far. (This was criticized  by economic journalist Jan Kukacka, who described the foreign  currency reserves as "dead" capital that is not being used for  economic development and must, on the contrary, be "subsidized"  by Czech citizens because it earns no interest and leads to  higher prices. Writing in the 5 April HOSPODARSKE NOVINY,  Kukacka also suggested that the surplus could be an indication  of undervalued currency, a conclusion that was also reached in  the Vienna Institute study.)</p>

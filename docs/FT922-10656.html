			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: A statement of intent The latest salvo from the Accounting Standards Board is not quite as radical as usual, in that the changes proposed are not strictly compulsory. But it will do to be getting on with. The new operating review which UK companies are to include in their annual reports should discuss such novel matters as cash flow by operating segment and the effect on earnings of inflation. The financial review should cover peak borrowing requirements and confirmation that the company can cover them without breaching covenants: or if not, it should give details of the covenants. It should also specify any restrictions on moving cash from one part of the group to another, which in the case of a company like Lonrho might make interesting reading. The snag is the lack of an enforcing mechanism. Since the proposed statement does not form part of the accounts, it does not strictly fall within the remit of the auditors. Without that sanction, the risk is that those very companies whose statements would be most revealing will fail to produce them. One answer would be for the Stock Exchange to make statements compulsory: but the Exchange has not been notably valiant in such causes in the past. With luck, there would be pressure from the market, which would take note of the absence of a statement and price the risk accordingly. But in one or two companies one can think of, lack of information has been in the price for years without any noticeable effect on management thinking.</p>

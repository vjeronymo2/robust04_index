			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Housebuilders optimistic on sales recovery HOUSEBUILDERS are more optimistic about prospects for a recovery in housing sales next year, the House Builders Federation said yesterday. It reported that 43 per cent of builders questioned just before the Autumn Statement expected to sell more homes next year. A further 27 per cent expected sales to remain steady. Interest rates have fallen further since the survey, making house prices the cheapest they have been in real terms for more than a decade, the federation said. Some builders expect prices to continue to drift downwards for a while even when sales start to pick up. That is because of the backlog of properties to be sold and concern about the economy. The federation believes, however, that its survey indicates that the market now may be near the bottom. 'The main pointer to recovery is that, in almost every region of the country, housing is more affordable than at any time in the last decade,' it said. A two-income household in south-east England with an 80 per cent mortgage and a likely interest rate of 8.5 per cent by next year could expect to pay only 19 per cent of their total post-tax income in repayments, the federation said. That compared with 57 per cent in 1989 and 23 per cent 10 years ago. A similar couple in Wales, on the same basis, could expect to spend just 14 per cent of their combined post-tax income on repayments by early next year compared with 35 per cent in 1990 and 15 per cent in 1983. The federation's Housing Market Report also shows that court orders for house repossessions were 29 per cent lower in the third quarter of this year than in the corresponding period last year.

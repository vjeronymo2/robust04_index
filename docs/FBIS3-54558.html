			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian Ambassador in  Cairo Sa'id Kamal has said that during their meeting this  morning Palestinian and Israeli negotiators for the first time  reached a formula listing points of difference and points of  agreement in the disputed issues of border crossings and the  size of the Israeli withdrawal from Jericho.    He said the negotiations, which continued over six long  sessions, identified 12 points of difference. These are now  being worded to be presented to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres before their  upcoming meeting in the Swiss city of Davos Saturday [29  January] night and Sunday on the sidelines of the World Economic  Forum.    If 'Arafat and Peres reach an agreement on those points,  Kamal added, a committee will meet in Taba next week to work out  the final wording of a protocol on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, to be signed by 'Arafat and Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, so that there will be a complete  Israeli withdrawal before 13 April in accordance with the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.    MENA has learned that the formula includes an agreement to  raise the Palestinian flag outside the administration building  that will control the border crossings. Other points are: No  Palestinian security man in military uniform shall be seen on  the same crossing leading to King Husayn (Allenby) Bridge. The  Israeli security man watching arrivals in the Palestinian  autonomous region of Gaza and Jericho shall stay inside the  building behind a dark glass barrier.    The Israelis agreed that the arrivals be inspected  electronically. In case of suspicion, however, anyone can be  inspected by Palestinian security men while the Israelis watch.    Some differences remain. The Palestinians want Israel to  give the self-rule authority administrative as well as religious  supervision over the areas of Jabal al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis  on the River Jordan and Maqam al-Nabi Musa on the main road to  Jerusalem.    The Israeli delegation will leave Cairo later today  immediately after the working session, which is scheduled to  last until evening.</p>

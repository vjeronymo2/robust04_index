			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / MPs to probe Whitehall role A WIDE-RANGING inquiry into the role of the civil service has been launched by a Commons committee concerned with the impact of recent reforms in Whitehall. The Treasury and Civil Service committee says it has heard evidence from a variety of 'respected sources' of disquiet over the consequences of government initiatives such as market-testing and the creation of agencies. This has raised questions about the implications of these reforms for the integrity of the civil service and its accountability to parliament. The inquiry will consider 26 questions, including whether the civil service has been politicised by 14 years of single-party government. It will examine the need for a code of ethics in the light of episodes such as the use of public money to pay some of the legal expenses of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in evicting a tenant, and the events surrounding the sale of arms to Iraq. It will also consider whether the role of ministerial policy-advisors could be improved, including the open advertisement of top civil servants' jobs and fixed-term contracts. Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, which has advocated such reforms, yesterday welcomed the launch of the inquiry. 'The length of the list of questions to be answered suggests that Whitehall reform is now forcing its way onto the political agenda,' he said. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / British Rail White Paper: Proposals signal more of the same  -Past Sell-Offs THE creeping denationa-lisation heralded by the white paper may sound like something new, but in many ways it is just more of the same. The privatisation of British Rail has been going on for more than a decade. Even before the first Thatcher administration in 1979, BR had started selling off the station hotels it had inherited from the former private railway companies. Then privatisation moved up a gear with the 1981 Transport Act, which set the scene for the outright sale of the non-core businesses. First to go was Seaspeed, BR's cross-Channel hovercraft business, which was sold to Hoverlloyd in 1981 to form Hoverspeed. Next came Sealink, the ferry operation, sold to Sea Containers in 1984. Several more sales went ahead through management buyouts. British Transport Advertising was sold to its management in 1987, followed by Travellers Fare, the station catering business, in 1988. British Rail Engineering, the rolling stock manufacturing arm, was sold to a management-led consortium in 1989. In spite of these sales, some non-core businesses remain. The oddest one is Meldon Quarry, near Okehampton, Devon, from which BR extracts ballast for its tracks. Others include British Rail Telecommunications, which runs BR's internal telephone services but has ambitions to provide telecommunications services to the public. On these, the white paper is silent. But while these have so far escaped privatisation, BR's involvement with the private sector has grown in other directions. One is through participation in joint ventures. For example: The British Rail Property Board has joined with the private sector on several large station redevelopment projects, such as Broadgate in the City. BR's Railfreight Distribution subsidiary has taken equity stakes in Charterail and Combined Transport, two private companies developing road-rail distribution businesses. The private sector has also encroached on to the railways in other ways. Although InterCity provides the catering on all its trains and some of the longer-distance Network SouthEast trains, the rest of BR's train refreshments are provided by private concerns. There have also been limited inroads into BR's core rail operations. Two companies - Foster Yeoman and ARC - own their own locomotives, which haul trainloads of aggregates on BR's lines. BR also allows access by privately owned passenger trains, though until recently only in the leisure market. A new turn for privatisation came in May when Stagecoach, the bus operator, took over two carriages on the London-Aberdeen sleeper service, repainted them in its own livery, and started selling tickets under its own name. Stagecoach and other companies have only gained access to BR's tracks where it suited BR to permit it - and even then, only with BR staff driving the trains. The effect of the white paper will be to allow private operators to make greater inroads into BR's core business by giving them access to its tracks by right, using their own staff.</p>

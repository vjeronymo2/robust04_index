			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Personal-distress awards sharply up in bias cases AWARDS for injury to feelings in discrimination cases have more than doubled since 1988, according to a study by Industrial Relations Services (IRS), the independent research organisation. However, IRS said the increase masked wide variations within the sex and race jurisdictions, with tribunals much more likely to award aggravated damages in race cases than in sex cases. The report showed that few industrial tribunals made exemplary awards that were punitive rather than compensatory and so aimed to deter employers from similar action. Injury-to-feelings awards began to rise in early 1988 after the Court of Appeals set new parameters for the level of such awards in discrimination cases. It said awards should not be nominal and may include aggravated damages, putting Pounds 3,000 at the top end of the range. Equal Opportunities Review, Number 41. From IRS, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP. By subscription.</p>

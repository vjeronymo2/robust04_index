			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: La Gioconda - Opera In the current, outstandingly successful season at Opera North, the mixture of rare and repertory operas seems to have been calculated with greater boldness than ever. With the new staging of La Gioconda, an opera not given in any mainstream British house for more than 60 years, the company and its departing general administrator, Nicholas Payne, demonstrate once more the tonic wholeness of their artistic vision. They understand that the blood-and-guts enjoyment afforded by Ponchielli's 1876 potboiler is not to be despised, since it can provide  - when delivered with all the zest and enthusiasm of Saturday's performers - a strong, savoury complement to the more substantial experiences supplied by this season's Gerhard, Mozart, Verdi, Britten and (still to come) Berg. This opera is often clamoured for by audiences hungry for elemental operatic thrills, seldom tackled outside Italy and beyond the New York Met. Both clamour and opera-house reluctance are easily understood. The demands Gioconda makes are Grand-Operatic in the Meyerbeer sense - six front-rank voices cased in house-filling personalities, not to mention substantial choral and dance troupes and scenic effects, all fully employed through four long acts. Yet the elevated music-drama already worked up by Verdi (in Don Carlos and Aida) out of similar Meyerbeerian forces and theatrical propositions remains obstinately out of Ponchielli's reach. It is no less easy to be dismissive about this opera. In a memorably snooty sentence Shaw regretted 'the mischief which great men' - he meant here Verdi  -'bring upon the world when small men begin to worship them'. Boito's adaptation of the Victor Hugo play Angelo, Tyran de Padoue bursts with the overblown language that he would use again in Otello and Falstaff, but desperately lacks the taut, coherent scene and character-planning of those two Verdi masterpieces; with the benefit of hindsight one can recognise in the operatic Iago a 'fulfilled' version of Barnaba, the spy whose tiresome one-note villainy moves the Gioconda plot on each of its jerky stages. Yet in a small theatre, with a cast brilliantly chosen for the particular revival context, with an elegantly designed production (by Philip Prowse), charged to distil suggestive Venetian atmosphere and fantasy from lamps, swags of cloth and coloured streamers, and with a conductor (Oliver von Dohnanyi) refreshingly responsive to the needs of singers, orchestra, chorus and production team all at one go - in these circumstances, the tremendous vitality of La Gioconda became harder to gainsay with each passing moment. Opera North's is not an 'ideal' revival: ca va sans dire. Cuts dictated by budgetary constraint remove 'The Dance of the Hours' and splice together, ingeniously and naughtily, the first two acts. Prowse's Victorian-era updating adds its own special appeal but also, in Act 1, an additional element of confusion. On Saturday the veteran Australian Clifford Grant, back in Britain after an absence of nearly two decades, sounded below form as Alvise, though still in command of a sizeable bass voice. Keith Latham, Barnaba, is a capable baritone short on tonal 'spice' and uncomfortable in Italian (altogether, an English translation is badly missed). But the others went through their scenes and routines with excellent vigour, making one admire the individual stamp of the applause-wooing melodies Ponchielli shared out between them. Catherine Wyn-Rogers, a quietly glowing Cieca, and Sally Burgess, a lustrous, glamorous Laura, both wanted only the final degree of punch at the top - Miss Burgess's marvellously succulent shaping of words and notes was continual compensation. Edmund Barham's tirelessly ringing Enzo discovered much, not all, of the romance in his phrases. And Rosalind Plowright, having weathered a period of vocal troubles to emerge with dramatic soprano newly malleable and colourful, brought to the title role a handsome measure of the required sumptuousness. Operatic pleasure comes in many kinds; on Saturday, the response of the Opera North audience left no doubt that full-blooded Italian opera offers some of the most simply gratifying of all.

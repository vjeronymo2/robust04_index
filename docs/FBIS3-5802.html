As expectations mount and eyes begin to turn to Bangkok,  Asean officials are fretting over how to ensure the forum is a  success when it brings together at least eighteen ministers from  Asean, its seven dialogue partners and three observer countries.    Drawing from their experiences with the Asean Free Trade  Area, which was launched with much ceremony and high  expectations in 1992 only to run out of steam later, Asean  officials are setting deliberately low targets for the opening  round of the ARF.    At the heart of debate is what form the security dialogue  should take, whether to allow off-the-cuff discussions to enable  the attending ministers to develop a rapport or to prepare a  pre-arranged forum to ensure its smoothness.    Many security experts believe the forum will build its own  momentum given the unprecedented gathering of foreign ministers  from regional powers like Japan, permanent members of the UN  Security Council, and from states with conflicting territorial  claims such as Vietnam, China, Brunei, Malaysia and Philippines.    There were some concerns expressed by the admission of  countries like China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea because  they are new to regional security talks. Unlike Asean which has  a relatively long history of practising collective conflict  resolution such as in the case of Cambodia, these other nations  have traditionally discussed or solved their security concerns  on a bilateral basis.    "There should be some basis for them to start with," said  one  official involved with the preparations for the meeting. "The  most difficult thing is to make them feel easy to talk," he said.    Those officials who support a freewheeling discussion argue  that in order to set up an atmosphere of cordiality and mutual  confidence, the ministers attending the forum should be left to  decide and agree which model of dialogue to adopt and which  topics to discuss at the meeting.    "They can talk about anything from weather to health, any  topic that will enable them to achieve consensus. The fact that  they meet is significant and that they will meet again is a plus  for Asean," said the official.    Ambassador Tommy Koh, director of Singapore's International  Policies Study Institute, a government's security think-tank,  said recently that such a security institution should start with  something not too difficult but not too easy.    "The ARF is new. It would be foolish to take up difficult,  contentious issues that might sink it. But on the other hand it  must not chicken out," he said.    "We must prudently take on easy issues and later consolidate  them through the gradual gaining of self-confidence and mutual  trust," the former ambassador to the United Nations said.    In order to make the forum germane is another challenge. To  make it relavent the forum should take up issues of regional  interest and non-regional members' interests. But Koh said it  is the Asean way to take one step at one time. "We don't have  in mind how it is going to be. Let's see first how it starts,"  he said.    The 27-year-old grouping has existed as a successful forum  for political cohesiveness despite its 1967 founding goal as a  regional economic grouping.    For Thailand, the host of this year's Asean meetings and the  ARF, the dilemma is similar: Which is worse? To be too daring  or too cautious.    There is a risk of sinking the forum if discussants are  allowed to air what they want to say, which over time incites  antagonism rather than fostering mutual confidence, a necessary  precursor to the formalization of a security mechanism.    There were some concerns that picking a topic like the  Spratly Islands which are claimed by China, Vietnam, the  Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia will be tantamount to looking  for trouble even though the issue is well worth discussing in  the context of regional dialogue and in attracting the regional  powers' attention.</p>

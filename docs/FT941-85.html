			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Senior Engineering seeks Pounds 67m - Profits up at Pounds 24.2m / Acquisitions made in Germany and the US Senior Engineering Group, the air-handling, tubular products and thermal engineering company, yesterday launched a Pounds 67.4m rights issue to finance investment in its fast-growing flexible tubes business and fund acquisitions in Germany and the US. Senior also reported a sharp increase in underlying profitability last year, and forecast that although some European economies were still in recession, the group would have another satisfactory year. The 1-for-4 rights issue of 60.2m new shares was priced at 115p. Senior's shares closed down 8 1/2 p at 133p. The group is paying Dollars 15.3m (Pounds 10.2m) for Metal Bellows, a US maker of welded diaphragm metal bellows for the aerospace, semiconductor, medical and industrial markets. Senior is also acquiring Christian Berghofer, a German manufacturer of flexible hoses and expansion joints, for DM20.7m (Pounds 8.4m) from its private owners. Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said: 'Berghofer will promote the expansion of our flexible connectors business in Germany and eastern Europe, while Metal Bellows will complement Senior Flexonics' product range and will increase our market share in several important markets in the US.' Flexonics, which Senior bought for Pounds 28m in 1992, has a strong position in the US automotive market for flexible tubes and expansion joints, which are used to reduce exhaust vibration and cut emissions. Senior said Flexonics had opportunities to increase sales to the automotive industry in the US and Europe, with a likely increase in the number of components supplied from 3.2m last year to 7.6m in 1995. The group plans to invest some Pounds 28m in the business over the next two years. Following the purchases and the rights issue, Senior will have net assets of about Pounds 145m and net cash of about Pounds 16m. The rights issue is underwritten by Schroders, with Hoare Govett and Albert E Sharp acting as brokers. Under FRS 3, Senior's pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 increased from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 24.2m, but the previous year's figure was depressed by Pounds 12.2m of losses arising from its withdrawal from the mining equipment industry and closure of its power contracting side. Earnings rose to 7.14p (0.98p) per share under FRS 3, but the underlying earnings - minus exceptionals - emerged at 7.1p (6.26p). A final dividend of 2.1p gives a total of 3.36p (3.15p). COMMENT Senior believes it has found a gem in Flexonics, and has taken advantage of its strong share price to finance a big wave of investment in the automotive side of that business, which is being driven by tougher environmental regulations. The simultaneously announced acquisitions offer a wider spread of activities in the US and a potential route into the crucial German automotive market. The shares, which have outperformed the market by 80 per cent since the beginning of 1992, are on a prospective multiple of 18.5. That 15 per cent premium to the market does not look unjustified, but the shares are unlikely to advance significantly until the market sees how well the rights proceeds are used.</p>

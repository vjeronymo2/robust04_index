			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback follows US housing statistics - Market report Interest rate prospects continued to overshadow UK equities yesterday and a brief rally was sharply reversed after Wall Street and US Federal bonds reacted to an unexpected rise in the latest statistics on US housing starts. Markets focused unhappily on the chances of a rise in US rates at next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. The reversal of the market's trend in the second half of the session blotted out an optimistic response to the news that growth in German M3 money supply had moderated to 8.2 per cent in August, thus cooling, at least temporarily, fears that the Bundesbank might feel obliged to tighten rates. An improvement in UK government bonds had been largely eliminated by the close. At the final reading of 3,014.8, the FT-SE 100 Share Index showed a further loss of 22.5 points. Although trading volume was not heavy, the mood of the market appeared to become more gloomy yesterday. Kleinwort Benson Securities, the London securities house, sharply cut its forecast for 1995 UK corporate earnings to only 8 per cent - now the lowest in the City and barely half that of the consensus prediction. Mr Edmond Warner of Kleinwort fears that profit forecasts from market analysts will soon be tilted towards profits downgrades, as cost and pricing pressures affect company earnings. Kleinwort has trimmed 1994 growth earnings forecasts for non-financial companies from 17 per cent to 15 per cent. The Confederation of British Industries, predicting some slowdown from the consumer side, forecast growth of around 2.5 per cent in domestic GDP next year, slightly under forecasts from the UK Treasury. There were also suggestions in the stock market than one of the largest lenders to the property and building industries was reining in loan policies to the sector. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 14.4 to 3,570.1. Another sizeable trading programme, weighted to the sell side and covering a wide range of Footsie and non-Footsie stocks was reported. The previous session featured a similar sell programme, and there have been suggestions that fund managers, particularly from continental Europe have been switching out of UK equities and into British government bonds. Some analysts believe that domestic conditions are ripe for a rally in the UK gilt-edged market, although the worries over the outlook for rates in the US and Germany is seen as a severe problem for UK gilt yields. One analyst urged equity investors to 'pray' that value in the gilt-edged market is realised. However, Seaq volume of 594.8m shares yesterday was not unduly heavy, and compared with 602.8m on Tuesday. Retail, or genuine customer interest in UK equities, was worth Pounds 1.33bn on Tuesday, implying persistent, if not heavy, trading by the big investment funds. The market was hit by weakness in British Aerospace after the half time report found little favour with sector analysts. The dollar stocks gave ground as the UK market kept a close eye on the Dow Industrial Average, which was 19 points down in UK hours, following its heavy setback in the previous session. The general picture was fairly gloomy at the close, with only handful of special situations offering relief from the generally red picture on the screens in the City trading rooms. Strategists said that worries over the near term outlook for interest rates in the US are now likely to dominate a stock market increasingly nervous about the dangers that domestic base rates might be forced higher again before the end of the year. Doubts over UK company earnings prospects will also unsettle investors as the market moves into the final quarter of the year.</p>

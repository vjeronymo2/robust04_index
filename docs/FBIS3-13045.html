This was stated by PLO  representative in Brussels Shawqi Armali during a meeting with  Israeli Ambassador to Belgium Victo Har'el on Thursday monrning.  The meeting was organized by the Belgium-Israel section of the  Interparliamentary Union.    Mr. Har'el asked the Palestinians "to overcome the grief  caused by the Hebron massacre and to not allow this tragedy to  interfere with the progress made in the peace negotiations."  "If we stop the negotiating process now, we will play into the  hands of the extremists, of all those who want to maintain a war  situation in the territories," Har'el added.    Before discussing the measures taken Friday by the Rabin  government (disarming the extremists, setting up an  investigating commission, and releasing approximately 1,000  Palestinian prisoners), the Israeli ambassador declared that  "disarming the settlers is not conceivable because they must  have the means to defend themselves."    Mr. Armali agreed that "the grief must be overcome and the  repetition of such a massacre must be avoided. The measures  taken by Rabin are not sufficient, however. The settlers must  be disarmed."    Har'el and Armali warned that disenchantment is taking hold  among the Israeli and Palestinian peoples in view of the delay  in implementing the Oslo and Washington agreements in the  territories. "Public opinion on both sides is awaiting tangible  signs of these agreements. People should see a change," Har'el  added.    "Oslo was only the beginning of a long process. The  negotiations may yet be long and difficult, but peace is at the  end of the tunnel," the Israeli ambassador concluded.</p>

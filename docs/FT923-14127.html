			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Brazilian bank debt pact near THE BRAZILIAN government was said yesterday to be on the verge of an agreement in principle, with leading creditor banks, on restructuring and reducing its foreign bank debt burden. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, the US bank that leads the negotiations on behalf of the banks, said: 'We are only hours away from reaching an agreement, although we are not there yet.' The accord, the most complex under the debt reduction initiative launched three years ago by Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, would cover about Dollars 40bn in debt and substantial arrears of interest. The two sides have been negotiating for nearly a year. An agreement in principle is the first step towards a deal. A detailed accord or term sheet must then be negotiated with leading banks. Then agreement is required of all creditors. Mr Rhodes said an agreement 'will signal the final phase of Latin America's debt crisis.' Other regional big debtors have either completed a Brady deal (Mexico and Venezuela) or have negotiated a detailed accord with leading banks (Argentina). However, the political crisis around President Fernando Collor of Brazil, with continuing economic problems which may derail an International Monetary Fund programme, mean that doubts remain about whether the agreement will be realised. The Brazilian government aims to seek backing from the senate in Braslia for a detailed accord by the end of next month. The deal would allow banks to convert their existing debt into one of six types of instrument, each of which eases in some way Brazil's scheduled debt-service burden. Some of these instruments will carry collateral to guarantee interest or principal payments in the case of Brazilian default. The options include allowing banks to choose to exchange their existing debt for 'discount' bonds carrying a 35 per cent discount to face value, for 'par' bonds which carry pre-set concessional interest rates, and 'front-loaded' interest reduction bonds (FLIRBs), which reduce Brazil's interest payments in the early years of the accord. All carry collateral.</p>

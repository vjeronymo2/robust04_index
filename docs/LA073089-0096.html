			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BUSH UPSET AT CONGRESS OVER DEFENSE, S&amp;LS  </P> <P> President Bush expressed frustration Friday with the way Congress has treated  his legislative agenda, complaining that lawmakers are thwarting his ability to  negotiate arms control agreements and delaying resolution of the savings and  loan crisis.  </P> <P> "I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without as many cards in my  hand as possible," said Bush, referring to congressional cuts in his proposed  defense budget, "so there's an arms control dimension to what we're talking  about."  </P> <P> Bush's remarks were made during a wide-ranging, 30-minute news conference  convened to call attention to a switch by Rep. Tommy F. Robinson of Arkansas  from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vows to Keep Fighting  </P> <P> "Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment," Bush said, citing  Thursday's House vote on the defense budget. "But we're going to keep fighting  on for what we believe in."  </P> <P> Bush predicted that his military priorities would survive, even though the  House chopped funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-2 Stealth  bomber and the MX and Midgetman missile programs, all components of what Bush  described as his "strategic concept."  </P> <P> Bush said that he also believes he will prevail in final congressional action  on a proposed multibillion-dollar bailout of the troubled savings and loan  industry, even though House and Senate negotiators rejected his plan to keep  the initial cost off the books of the federal budget.  </P> <P> "It won't come to vetoing the S&amp;L (legislation) because we have 40-plus  votes in the Senate" in favor of the Administration's position, he said. If his  funding proposal fails, Bush said, "It would send a very bad sign to  international markets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No High Marks for Congress  </P> <P> Overall, Bush said, he "wouldn't give (Congress) high marks" for the way in  which it has responded to the Administration's legislative proposals. But he  insisted that he will not shift to a more confrontational approach and that he  will still seek cooperation and compromise.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure name-calling or questioning somebody's motives (will) be  successful," he said. "We have a Democratic majority in the Senate, a  Democratic majority in the House. I have to work with these people. I will work  with these people.  </P> <P> "I have never been too hot at being a name-caller, and I think they know the  principles upon which I stand. . . . It's a question of style, I think, and  I'll take a shot at them once in a while if they get too outrageous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open to Compromise  </P> <P> Bush also indicated that he is still open to compromise with lawmakers on his  proposal to lower the tax rate on capital gains, which involve sales of assets  such as stocks and bonds.  </P> <P> "If there's some compromise that can spur investment, spur jobs, increase  employment -- the cause of new jobs starting up -- I'd be interested in it," he  said. "I don't think I should ever say it's got to be done just this way."  </P> <P> Bush's plan would reduce the maximum capital gains tax rate to 15%. The  reduction would apply to stocks and most other income-producing assets, but not  to timber and real estate.  </P> <P> But a majority of the House Ways and Means Committee appears to be supporting a  substitute proposal by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) to cut the top rate to 20% for  two years for all assets, then raise it to 28% while ending taxation of gains  attributable to inflation. Democratic leaders have delayed a vote while  negotiations continue with the White House.  </P> <P> Bush called his plan "a good, solid proposal," saying that he believes "it will  stimulate jobs" and encourage business creation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supports Lucas  </P> <P> Bush also reiterated his support for former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff and  county executive William Lucas, his embattled nominee to head the Justice  Department's civil rights office.  </P> <P> "I strongly support Bill Lucas," he said. "I am convinced that much -- not all,  but much -- of the criticism of him is pure gut American politics. And it  started long before Day 1 of the hearings. And this is a man that served as a  Democrat, was widely respected, switched to the Republican Party, and then  people piled onto a fare-thee-well. He has my confidence."  </P> <P> Bush said he had made telephone calls to lawmakers on Lucas' behalf. "I feel  strongly about it," he said. "And I told Bill last night -- he was over at the  house for dinner here -- and I told him, 'I am staying with you 100%,' and it's  going to be right there and solid."  </P> <P> Bush refused to say if he would sign or veto a Democratic-sponsored statute to  outlaw flag burning, although he still favors a constitutional amendment. "I  will see what comes down here, but I will continue to push for the approach  that I think is the best, " he said.  </P></p>

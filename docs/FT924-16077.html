			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey shows output at low MANUFACTURING output is at its lowest level for more than a year and new orders remain weak, according to a survey of UK purchasing managers published yesterday. The survey showed that the purchasing managers' index - based on a weighted average of the movements of a number of variables - fell to 45.1 per cent last month from 45.4 per cent in August and 48 per cent in July. The Institute of Purchasing and Supply said the fifth successive monthly fall confirmed suspicions that the recession was 'far from over'. The survey, based on US techniques, was started in July last year, so has yet to establish a known record. The index covers variables such as new orders, output and employment. The latest results showed that output was at its lowest level since the survey began. 'It is clear from the survey data that the low level recorded cannot be explained by seasonal or other special factors and is simply a reflection of low levels of demand,' the institute said yesterday. The indices measuring the quantity of purchases, suppliers' delivery times, stocks of finished goods and employment all fell, reflecting depressed market conditions. The prices index rose slightly.</p>

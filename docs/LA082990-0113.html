			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENERGIZING ANAHEIM ELECTRIC-CAR FIRM;  </P> <P> ACQUISITION: TWO FORMER ELECTRONICS EXECUTIVES ACQUIRE TAYLOR-DUNN IN HOPE OF  DOUBLING SALES OF $23 MILLION A YEAR BY EXPANDING THE PRODUCT LINE AND SLASHING  COSTS WITH MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES.  </P> <P> Taylor-Dunn, a 41-year-old Anaheim manufacturer of electric vehicles, has been  acquired in an all-cash deal by two former San Fernando Valley electronics  executives with a strong belief in the future of American manufacturing.  </P> <P> The new owners, Arthur J. Goodwin and Milton L. Sneller, plan to keep  Taylor-Dunn in Anaheim and to double current sales of $23 million a year by  expanding the company's product line and slashing costs with new manufacturing  techniques.  </P> <P> Less than six weeks after completion of the multimillion-dollar deal, Goodwin  is reporting several successes.  </P> <P> By adopting manufacturing theories that give more decision-making authority to  factory floor workers instead of to one or more supervisors, Taylor-Dunn has  already seen a 15% reduction in the time it takes the company's 200 workers to  fill and ship customers' orders, Goodwin said.  </P> <P> The goal is to reduce the time for processing orders from months to days, he  said.  </P> <P> But more satisfying to Goodwin and Sneller is the first product to roll out of  the firm's new "skunk works."  </P> <P> The think tank was established to give employees at all levels a say in product  design, Goodwin said: "We put manufacturing people in the design environment,  we have them talk to the customers, and then they design products that the  customers want and that (can be manufactured) efficiently."  </P> <P> Citing competitive pressures, Goodwin would say only that the new product is "a  utility truck for a new niche in the market."  </P> <P> Goodwin said plans call for the company to have 30 or more products by 1992 --  up from 20 today -- with sales of $40 million and 300 employees.  </P> <P> Taylor-Dunn produces electric utility trucks and tow vehicles -- small versions  of the giant electric trucks used to move passenger jets around airports. The  company also imports and assembles Japanese-made golf carts.  </P> <P> For Goodwin and Sneller, both 45, owning Taylor-Dunn fulfills a longtime  ambition to put into practice the management techniques they have been  preaching for years.  </P> <P> Goodwin, a Northridge resident, founded a Chatsworth circuit board company that  he later sold to Data Design Laboratories in 1985. He stayed on under a  five-year management contract that recently expired.  </P> <P> Sneller, a longtime Anaheim resident, was Data design's chief operating officer  until he resigned late last year to join Goodwin.  </P> <P> The two men went hunting early this year "for a company like this," Goodwin  said.  </P> <P> He said he and Sneller put up a "substantial" amount of cash and gained more  financing from Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., the Los Angeles investment banking  firm.  </P> <P> "We wanted something that was manufacturing-intensive . . . with a reasonable  share of its market and an excellent name," he said.  </P> <P> Taylor-Dunn was not on the market when the two men approached the firm -- one  of about 20 companies they talked to. "But we made an offer, and they decided  to sell," Goodwin said.  </P> <P> R. Davis Taylor II, son of the company founder, has agreed to stay on as  president for a year to help with the transition to new owners, Goodwin said.  </P> <P> When he and Sneller moved into the administrative offices July 19, Taylor-Dunn  "was a good, solid company with a 30% share of the market nationally and decent  sales in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Australia," Goodwin said.  </P> <P> "The company is and was profitable but was run as a traditional, 1950s-style  manufacturing plant," he said. "It was well run, but it wasn't really able to  compete in the world market of the '90s."  </P> <P> To become the kind of manufacturing plant Goodwin and Sneller envision,  management now will focus on "five basic things," Goodwin said:  </P> <P> "The keys are employee involvement, total quality control, simplicity in design  and manufacturing processes, total preventive maintenance -- fix it before it  breaks down -- and just-in-time inventory control" that promotes rapid  inventory turnover to reduce costs.  </P> <P> "By doing this, we increase profits, increase competitiveness and satisfy  customer demands better than our competition, which is what American  manufacturing should be doing," Goodwin said.  </P></p>

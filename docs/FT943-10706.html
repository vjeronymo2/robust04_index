			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Agco impresses with a sharp rise to Dollars 21.7m Agco, the US farm machinery company which recently acquired Massey Ferguson, reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 21.7m, or Dollars 1.53 a share, on sales of Dollars 226m, up sharply from year-ago earnings of Dollars 13.6m, or Dollars 1.18, on sales of Dollars 152m, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. For the first six months of the year, Agco earned Dollars 36m or Dollars 2.56 a share, on sales of Dollars 405m, up from Dollars 18m or Dollars 1.87 a share on sales of Dollars 255m. Cost-cutting and sales volume generated by Agco's acquisition of White-New Idea, a US equipment maker, helped the result. Its Dollars 329m purchase of Massey Ferguson's European operations did not close until June 29, so second-quarter results reflect only one day of Massey's results.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the ANC issued on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 11 Mar]    [Text]  <H3>  A Realistic Programme for Real Jobs. A Press  Statement from the African National Congress. </H3>   The ANC [African National Congress] election manifesto is  titled: "For Jobs, Peace and Freedom". There is good reason why  `jobs' comes first. Without jobs to get the country's more than  3 million unemployed into work, there is little chance of peace  or freedom for any of us -- the main aim of all ANC policies.    Our election programme promises the creation of at least  two-and-a-half million jobs within five years! Real jobs -- not  charity handouts. Real useful work -- not useless "job creation"  schemes for digging holes and filling them in again.  Two-and-a-half million real jobs, which will provide a real base  for reconstruction and a new South Africa, and for the  development of its industrial, commercial and agricultural  sectors. Two-and-a-half million people taken from the ranks of  the desperate and the hopeless, and given the chance of dignity  and human development which only real, secure, full-time useful  work can provide.    This is the promise and the substance of the ANC  Reconstruction and Development Plan. It is not a glib  generalisation to fill the temporary demands of our election  campaign. It is a long-term plan which sets the social  parameters for an ANC government for years to come.    New jobs cannot be created by reckless spending on ephemeral  schemes. In our programme, the two-and-a-half million jobs will  be created steadily, through the unfolding over a five-year time  scale of an unprecedentedly massive programme of essential  public works.    These are the detailed focus points of that programme:    The building of up to 300,000 low cost homes a year,  totalling at least one million in the first 5 years. A national  network of primary health care centres with maternity care  services and safe supervised childbirth facilities for virtually  all women. Clean on-site water supplies to all households in  urban and rural areas, with first priority given to schools and  clinics. Electricity supply to 25 million households within  five years, with first priority for schools and clinics.  Tele-communications to all schools and clinics within two  years, and rapid expansion of the service nation-wide  thereafter. Immunisation against disease for 90 percent Of  children within three years. A range of free and nation-wide  health-care services for the aged, the disabled and the  unemployed. The training of three thousand community  development workers in 5 years, and half the nationally required  district health workers within 3. Expansion of the schooling  system, to give at least ten years schooling to all children, in  classes of not more than 40.    Those are the numerically determined elements of the  programme. There are further unquantified elements, such as the  building of road and rail networks, setting up vocational and  management training schemes, providing nation-wide sanitation  and refuse disposal services, and so on.    These projects will create hundreds of thousands -- perhaps  millions of new jobs, directly. The indirect spinoffs will  create many more, from such auxilliary activities as manufacture  and supply of materials, to transportation, training and  retraining, planning, marketing and so on.    This massive plan of development and construction cannot be  carried through by central and provincial governments alone. To  even attempt to do so would require the creation of an equally  massive bureaucracy and administrative apparatus. This is a  burden our country cannot afford.    We will therefore encourage the private sector, through with  special incentives, to take a large part of the financial and  material burden on themselves. We will encourage all portions of  the private sector to shift its focus from the area of  speculation and luxury production to the new opportunities to  enterprise contained in the ANC Reconstruction and Development  Programme.    We will encourage citizens everywhere to take full part in  the detailed planning of the programme through democratic  peoples' forums, and so tailor the programme to meet detailed  local needs. We will encourage citizens to volunteer to assist  the paid teams which will be providing the main man and  woman-power needed for the physical realisation of all the local  development projects.    We will set the same criteria for the planning and for the  execution of the whole programme, viz: preference to be given  to small private enterprises as contractors and suppliers before  the large monopolies favoured by the past NP [National Party]  regime. Preference to be given to labour intensive rather than  capital intensive methods of construction and service provision,  to maximise the number of new jobs. Priority in the  distribution of jobs and contracts to be given to the most  dispossessed and deprived sectors of the population, rather than  the rich favoured by the NP regime. Priority in the allocation  of labour, material and finance to be given to those regions  worst neglected by the NP regime. Priority in opportunity to be  given to women rather than men, and to blacks before whites, to  redress the inequalities left over from the NP, regime.    We will pay for this scheme without any general need to  raise  tax rates, partly through savings from by cutting back the NP's  swollen bureaucratic apparatus; partly by cutting out the waste,  the multiplication of administrative structures, and the  corruption which flourished in the NP era; but mainly with new  revenue created from turning thousands of unemployed into  employed taxpayers, and from taxes payable by private-sector  enterpreneurs on their new profits from the public works  programme.  This is the ANC programme for jobs. It is realistic, and it is  realisable.</p>

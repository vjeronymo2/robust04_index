			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Foreign company jobs lose allure: Robert Thomson on how a job-for-life tradition is being breached WHEN Northwest Airlines, the US carrier, offered prospective recruits a one-year employment contract, with a promise of more if business conditions improve, there was apparent confirmation this week of Japanese perceptions that working life at a foreign company can be brief and unpredictable. Northwest's plan, intended to reduce personnel expenses, follows the cancellation by Eastman Kodak (Japan) of an agreement to hire eight trainee engineers, and the introduction of early retirement schemes at NCR and IBM, the US technology companies, all of which received unflattering coverage in the Japanese media. The prominence of the reports has bruised the image of foreign companies, which have struggled to attract high quality Japanese graduates. During the US-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks, intended to remove cultural and other 'structural' barriers to trade, US negotiators complained that international companies are disadvantaged in graduate hiring, which is often influenced by old-boy networks and the corporate preferences of individual professors. Graduates wanting to join foreign companies also face pressure from their parents, who often argue they should play safe by joining a famous name such as Toyota or Matsushita in a country in which employees introduce themselves first by company name and then by family name - as in 'I am Toyota's Mr Sato'. Mr Mark Bedingham, chairman of the European Business Council In Japan, said students considering a career with a foreign company tend to have three worries: lifetime employ-ment; whether the company is big enough to offer a range of career experiences; and whether certain positions will always be reserved for foreigners. Having dubbed the trend the 'foreign company disease', Japanese business magazines have linked personnel policies to news of huge lay-offs at home by companies such as General Motors and Volkswagen. The presumption is that foreign companies under pressure in their home markets will increasingly need to shed staff in Japan. The Eastman Kodak case has received particularly heavy coverage, even though about 90 Japanese companies are reported to have breached naitei  - the agreements to hire students reached before their graduation. Public criticism of the breaches prompted the Labour Ministry and the Nikeiren, the employers' federation, to urge companies to honour the often informal contracts. Eastman Kodak said on Wednesday that the eight students had each been paid Y2.5m (Pounds 14,600) as compensation and the company has attempted to find alternative employers. Some of the Japanese companies which breached the agreements have yet to be as forthcoming, and one reportedly did no more than despatch a vaguely worded letter to students suggesting that their intake was 'postponed indefinitely'. 'We must accept some criticism. We feel sorry for the eight students, and we have honestly tried to find them new employment. Two have decided to continue their studies, two have new agreements, and another two are negotiating with companies introduced by us,' Eastman Kodak said. Labour Ministry officials say they are aware of 324 students affected by broken agreements, but the actual number is likely to be far higher. Cancelling agreements is in sharp contrast to the unseemly rush to hire graduates in the late 1980s, when the most pressing corporate concern was a labour shortage. The attention on personnel policies could also lessen opportunities for takeovers by US and European companies, whose acquisitions in Japan more than doubled last year. Mr Thomas Lynch, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, said Japanese employees tend to be nervous about their future on hearing of a foreign acquisition. 'Foreign companies should address the issue head on. We try to get our clients to emphasise what they have to offer on employment policies, and the reaction of the Japanese employees is often 'Oh, that's no so bad',' Mr Lynch said.</p>

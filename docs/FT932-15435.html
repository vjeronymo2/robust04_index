			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Further decline in bond yields lifts equities Wall Street ANOTHER big decline in bond yields, earned in the wake of more good inflation news, lifted US share prices across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31.61 at 3,428.09, near its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 6.12 at 447.96, while the Amex composite finished 1.84 higher at 418.08 and the Nasdaq composite up 6.79 at 673.12. Trading volume on the NYSE was 260m shares. Equity investors drew strength from the fixed-income markets, where last Friday's news of a 0.1 per cent increase in March consumer prices prompted heavy buying. The benchmark 30-year government bond rose sharply, pushing the yield down to 6.79 per cent. Two weeks ago yields were heading beyond 7 per cent on fears of revived inflation. Stock markets were worried that this might hinder economic recovery. In the last week, however, good news on consumer and producer prices has seen yields retreat convincingly. Enthusiasm was tempered, however, by concern about the approaching reporting season. A handful of companies has already posted first-quarter earnings, but until a fuller picture of corporate profitability, investors will remain cautious. Among individual stocks, banks were firmer in the wake of lower interest rates. Chemical rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/8 , Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 , First Chicago rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 , BankAmerica added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 52 1/2 and Banc One rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 60. General Motors fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 in busy trading as investors responded to Friday's news that a preliminary National Highway Traffic Safety Administration inquiry had found safety defects in GM pickup trucks built with 'side-saddle' fuel tanks. GM argued that its trucks were built to federal safety standards, and denied the administration's request that the company recall all 4.7m of the trucks built between 1973 and 1987. On the Nasdaq market, Intel jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 117 1/2 in heavy trading after it reported strong first-quarter profits. Canada TORONTO closed higher in quiet trading. The TSE-300 index rose 23.21 points to close at 3615.01 in volume of 40.3m shares. Trading value was CDollars 345.8m. South Africa was closed for a public holiday.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances as new year is awaited Wall Street For the second consecutive day US share prices traded close to their opening values as dealers and investors waited for the holiday week to end and a new trading year to start in earnest, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.56 at 3,794.33, a new record high. The more broadly based Standard&amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.36 at 470.58. Secondary indices put in a more robust performance, with the Amex composite ending up 2.16 at 472.16, and the Nasdaq composite up 3.92 at 768.48. Trading volume was 283m shares. Prices firmed at the start as investors reacted to more positive news on the economy. The good news was a 0.5 per cent increase in the November leading economic indicators, and a 29 per cent rise in November existing home sales. The data was sufficient to push the Dow close to 3,800, but by mid-morning, weakness among oil stocks, notably Chevron and Exxon, brought the Dow back from its early highs. The strengthening economy, combined with low interest rates and the expectation that share prices would end the year on a positive note as they usually do, were all working in the market's favour, and keeping stocks at or close to record highs. The selling in the oil sector was the main story in a featureless day, although the declines were not widespread. Exxon fell Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 63&lt;5/8, Chevron Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 88, and British Petroleum, Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 64 3/4 , some oil stocks escaped the sell-off. Phillips Petroleum rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 29 1/8 , and Mobil rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 79 1/8 . The latter was probably helped by the news that the company had sold off four pipeline systems, closed 10 product storage terminals and cut its domestic marine fleet by 33 per cent as part of a year-long streamlining of its US distribution system. Airline stocks underperformed after the brokerage house, Prudential Securities, cut its rating of Delta Air Lines stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Delta fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 5/8 , UAL gave up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 146, AMR, parent of American Airlines, slipped Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/8 , while USAir eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 3/4 . CompUSA jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 3/4 on the news that the technology goods retailer's same-store sales had risen 13 per cent in its second fiscal quarter. On the Nasdaq market, Intel gave up some of Tuesday's gains, slipping Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 63 1/8. Other big technology stocks were also weaker, with Apple down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 28 1/2, and Microsoft off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 81 1/2. Canada Toronto stocks hit a record high in continued light trading. The TSE-300 composite index gained 21.07 points, or 0.49 per cent, to 4,309.92, surpassing the previous record high of 4307.67 set on Dec. 8. Advances led declines 408 to 269. Volume was 34.50m shares compared with 35.49m. Hollinger's American Publishing Co. unit purchased 33 publications from Park Communications Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Hollinger shares were unchanged at CDollars 14. AGRA Industries reported much higher net income from continuing operations in the first quarter. Its A shares fell CDollars 1/8 to CDollars 9 7/8.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Question put to "main political parties" on "whether they </F> support a wealth tax and/or a capital gains tax"]    [Text]  <H5>  African National Congress </H5>   The main object of any tax system is to raise revenue as  effectively (at minimum cost) and as efficiently (with minimum  distortion of the economy) as possible. This can be achieved  only through a balanced tax system perceived as fair and  transparent by most taxpayers.    The ANC therefore wants to move away from the ad hoc  approach  of the past towards a coherent, consistent and predictable tax  policy. We are therefore not going to rush in and change the  system or introduce new taxes just for their own sake. The  constitution provides for a financial and fiscal commission to  be created. It will be asked to provide government with advice  on tax reform to bring about such a desired tax system.    The ANC will retain estate duties, donations taxes and  transfer duties -- each being taxes on the transfer of wealth.  These may well have to be rationalised, perhaps in the form of  one capital transfer tax. Wealth taxes should not be confused  with a capital gains tax which is a tax on income or profit --  albeit from the sale of a capital asset.    It is unfair to differentiate between that and "normal"  income, because people who can obtain their income in the form  of a capital gain would then not pay any tax on it.    An analysis of the tax system as a whole will have to  explore  the desirability and feasibility of introducing a capital gains  tax. The commission will also have to advise government on the  details of such a tax.  <H5>  Democratic Party </H5>   In general, the answer is "no". However, in SA [South  Africa] there is often a misdirected focus on a specific tax or  taxes. What is far more important is the total amount collected  in taxes and the level of government spending as proportion of  GDP. The share of our economy being appropriated by government  is already uncomfortably high, but it is unlikely that it can be  reduced rapidly. The danger is that it is allowed to increase  further.    Economic growth is fundamental, and taxation should not  hinder growth. A market orientated, enterprise-driven economy  in which private property is respected, in which enterprise is  recognised and encouraged, in which people are entitled to be  rewarded for initiative, risk and hard work, and in which it is  recognised that the private sector, not government, best creates  wealth in an economy which will prosper.    Wealth and capital gains taxes are likely to be  counterproductive.  <H5>  Freedom Front </H5>   SA needs entrepreneurs who produce wealth. Wealth will be  produced if the producer can enjoy the fruits of his efforts.  High taxes are no incentive to take risks or work harder.  Lower taxes will stimulate growth. ANC plans for  reconstruction and development do not provide hope for lower  taxes in future and strengthen the perception that they will  exploit all other possible type of taxes.    There is no doubt an ANC-dominated government will levy a  wealth tax. If, however, they want to encourage growth, this  should be introduced at a low rate. Redistribution should take  place in a manner that does not discourage investment. The  solution does not lie in the introduction of new taxes but the  better utilisation of present tax income.    Although SA has no formal capital gains tax, estate duty  acts  as such a tax. We do not favour any further capital gains tax.  It would not contribute much to revenue and would be difficult  to administer. And inflation would make it difficult to  determine the real value of a capital gain.  <H5>  Inkatha Freedom Party </H5>   The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] is not in favour of either a  wealth or capital gains tax. Generally speaking, the IFP is  against increasing the already high tax burden. High taxes  serve not only to destroy entrepreneurship and initiative, they  also encourage the hoarding of resources and thus stunt  potential for growth.    While the IFP is keenly aware of the need to narrow income  and wealth disparities between population groups, we are not  convinced that either a wealth or a capital gains tax will prove  effective in achieving this objective.    Importantly, the implementation of either tax, while having  negligible effect on total revenue collected, will have a  negative impact on the ability of this country to attract  foreign investment. One of the few benefits of such taxes would  be their symbolic value. However, the frightening away of  investment is a high price to pay to create the illusion that  there is a redistribution of income and wealth.    Further, a capital gains tax is neither equitable nor  "fair".  For it to be equitable and fair, all capital gains would need to  be taxable. Such an approach is needed especially since the  rich -- having access to better credit facilities -- can always  avoid asset sales which attract taxes. The middle and lower  classes, on the other hand, are most likely in times of need to  be forced for sell their assets and thus incur the tax.    Secondly, SA does not have the administrative capacity to  successfully implement a capital gains tax system which would,  in turn, demand greater tax administration without actually  substantially increasing government revenue.  <H5>  National Party </H5>   The NP [National Party] does not support a wealth tax  because  that would amount to double taxation -- the wealth in the hands  of a person or company has been taxed before by way of income  tax, estate duty and indirect taxes.    Capital gains tax is something that could be considered, but  it should be done very carefully because it could discourage  investment.  <H5>  Pan-Africanist Congress </H5>   The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] of Azania will use wealth  and capital gains taxation to address extremes of wealth and  poverty.    Wealth taxation and capital gains tax will be part of a  broader economic strategy. Capital gains and wealth taxes, far  from being punitive, are distributive and reconstructive in the  short and medium term. In the long term, the capital and wealth  base will be sufficiently broadened to ensure taxation is borne  by the Azanian society as a whole.</p>

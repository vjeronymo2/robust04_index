In an  interview to AIR correspondent Sebastian Roberts in the  Spotlight Program last night, the minister of state for external  affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, said bilateral discussion is the  only way to solve the problem, but Islamabad cannot expect that  India should concede all its demands. He made it clear that New  Delhi will do everything possible for the resumption of  bilateral discussions.    Replying to a question, Mr. Salman Khurshid said the  withdrawal of Pakistan's resolution in Geneva was unconditional  and there is no question of its postponement to the next session  of the UN Human Rights Commission. The minister said there is  no confusion, as the chairman himself made this clear at the  Geneva meeting.</p>

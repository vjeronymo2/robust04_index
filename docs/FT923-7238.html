			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cost-cuts help Quicks to Pounds 1.1m Quicks Group, the Manchester-based vehicles and parts distributor, turned in a more than three-fold increase, from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 1.11m, in interim pre-tax profits, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. Turnover for the six months to June 30 fell to Pounds 99.4m (Pounds 107.1m), but cost-cutting and moves to raise margins kept operating profits at Pounds 2.01m, only down Pounds 10,000. The strong performance ends two years' struggle to reorganise in the recession. The company made only Pounds 58,000 pre-tax in 1991 after losing Pounds 896,000 in 1990. It was hit by difficulties in its leasing division, from which it is disengaging. Earnings per share rose to 4.4p (1.4p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.75p (1p), payable from earnings of 4.4p (1.4p) per share.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DE LA CERDA TO SIT, THEN RUN AT NORTHRIDGE  </P> <P> Peter De La Cerda, a former Granada Hills High track standout, has signed a  national letter of intent with Cal State Northridge, according to Bob Augello,  an assistant cross-country and track coach at the university.  </P> <P> But the signing, which was announced Thursday, comes with a hitch. Under  provisions of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Proposition 48, De La  Cerda must skip both his freshman cross-country and track seasons because he  failed to score at least 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  </P> <P> De La Cerda placed 14th in the 3,200 meters at the state championships in June  and recorded personal bests of 4:01.9 and 9:20.88 in the 1,500 and 3,200 as a  senior at Granada Hills. De La Cerda, who transferred to Granada Hills for his  senior track season, was the Del Rey League cross-country champion for Alemany.  </P></p>

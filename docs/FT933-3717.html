			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Missing out on my own mugging: Michael Holman feels uneasy after an encounter with would-be thieves 'YOU CAN stop shaking now.' He looked about 12 years of age with a bright, alert face. A few minutes earlier he - or at least his teenage companions - had been about to mug me. He briefly took hold of my right arm, as if to steady me, a tender, incongruous gesture of concern. I looked down at him, dressed in loose-fitting baseball jacket, jeans and trainers. I did not want to tell him the truth about my condition. I probably looked bemused. He gave a little tug at my sleeve. 'You can stop shaking, honest. We aren't gonna hurt you.' 'I can't - that's the problem, that's what the illness does to me.' He looked perplexed. This was not how he wanted our encounter to end. The rest of the gang were moving on. He frowned, then his face cleared: 'Don't worry mate, you're safe now.' And they went on their way. I had first noticed the gang roaming the passages at Liverpool Street Underground station when I was waiting for a Tube at about 11pm. I took care to select a different compartment. Despite my caution the gang got out at my stop. I had walked part of the way home before I spotted the youths ahead of me. There is a taxi rank at the station so I could have taken a cab. But my journey is only 200 yards along a busy road, a left turn and I'm 30 paces from my front door. They were waiting by the public telephone box. I was half expecting it, but what happened still startled me. It seemed that suddenly I was surrounded. As I write, what happened next comes back in mental snapshots. The gang of about six, encircling me; the 12-year-old curious; one or two of the gang hostile and one in particular exuding menace. The next snapshot: a pale, intense face, about 17 years old with uneven small teeth, small bat-ears, close-cropped head which he shook vigorously from side to side, up and down, uttering a string of obscenities, unleashing an intense, intimidating rage. The young man radiated instability. I felt that he knew he could frighten, terrify, use his rage like a tool - as effective as a knife. As I wilted under the barrage of verbal abuse I feared that he did not know how dangerous he could be. Then I thought: perhaps he knows himself better than I think he does. He's playing Russian roulette with his personality, and it is pointed at me. Thankfully that night he could switch off, and he did. 'Why're you shaking?' The question came not from him but from one of the gang, as I stood transfixed and trembling, my briefcase under my right arm, my left hand gripping the case to steady my tremor. The question may have been a taunt, but I think not. 'I've got Parkinson's disease. It makes me shake.' The pale face, inches from mine, turned off the torrent of invective and threat like a tap. I do not think he had noticed my shakes because he was concentrating on my face, with a terrible intensity. And now not a snapshot, but a soundbite. 'What's that]' It was not a question. It was an expression of astonishment, with an undertone of something else. As my mind replays and rehears the episode, time slows. Until that point, the incident unreels before me, like a video cassette on fast forward. But that particular second seems to stretch. Each fraction of time contains a syllable which I analyse, and the analysis tells me that my relationship with my verbal assailant was going to change. 'What's that] My grandad had that]' I cannot fully account for the few seconds that followed. Until then I was vividly aware of what was happening, what was said. But these moments were suffused by relief to the exclusion of all else. I do remember that the tone of the sound around me had changed. Hostility had been replaced by murmurs, the mumbles and mutters that serve as words when taken aback by somebody's bad news. My verbal assailant turned into awkward, uncomfortable protector. 'Yeah, my grandad had it. Wouldn't have done you if we'd known, mate. We don't do sick people'n that, old people 'n such.' The 12-year-old, like a mascot among them, piped up: 'Yeah mate, we don't do that, not sick people.' An awkward moment for the gang and me, the let-off victim, followed. We all wanted to get about our business, but their route was also my route. It was almost comic. I was a nuisance, but they were too polite to say so. We had been thrown together, and now wanted to make our farewells - like guests at the end of a dinner party, wanting to disengage from someone who wants to prolong the bonhomie. Honour was at stake, theirs and mine. To turn back would have been to impugn their word that I was safe, and would have injured my pride. At last it was resolved. The gang set off ahead of me, but looked back after a few paces, then slowed, obliging me to turn tail or catch up. And so I started the next block home, the muggers became escorts as far as my street and the aggressor turned protector, now almost solicitous, was by my side. By then I felt I had to offer him reassurance: 'I manage alright, really . . .' He nodded. We walked on. 'My mum's got problems. Needs kidney dialysis, uses a machine, every week.' We got to the corner of my street, and it was at that point that the 12-year-old offered his own reassurance: 'You can stop shaking now.' I can not explain what I did next, because it was not necessary. Even as I did, I wondered if I was being tactless, or crass, or cowardly. I had a Pounds 20 pound note in my pocket. 'Can I pay your fare home?' They shook their heads. 'We don't want your money, mate.' And they continued their predatory journey east. I did not tell the police. I have been mugged before when credit cards and passport and briefcase were taken at knifepoint. I told the police that time. This time I lost nothing. The incident and my subsequent silence still makes me feel uneasy, but I felt bound by a code.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> PROCRA  </P> <P> INATION: Monday is the deadline for the first of two property tax payments, but  if you miss it, don't get upset. The county tax collector doesn't. . . . Late  penalties -- 10% for the first payment, 10% and $20 for the second, plus 1.5%  interest per month after July -- brings about $15 million into local government  treasuries each year. . . . And there's no question the taxes will be paid,  says Tax Collector Bob Citron. This year, 23,649 property owners were  delinquent, but all except 14 paid up before their property was auctioned.

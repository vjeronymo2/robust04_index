			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Helmut Loelhoeffel report: "Ordered `Deafness' Is a </F> Problem for the Federal Intelligence Service"]    [Text] Bonn, 18 May -- The Federal Intelligence Service  (BND) has warned against dangerous developments in the arms  trade and called for an expansion of its tapping rights to get  on the track of illegal deals.    During a hearing of the Economic Committee of the Bundestag,  the government's intention to extend the control of letters,  telephone conversations, and telexes of suspicious companies  until the end of 1996 was discussed. The Customs Criminal  Office is allowed to do that. According to its vice president,  Karl-Heinz Matthias, it prevented "several exports of sensitive  goods" on the basis of observation.    BND President Konrad Porzner told the committee that some  countries in the African, Arab, and Asian region are making  "massive" efforts to build missile systems. He cited Libya,  Syria, and Iran as examples. He considers this "the real  threat." Porzner believes that several states will possess  carrier missiles with ranges of up to 1,000 km in six to eight  years' time. Medium-range missiles of a range of up to 3,000 km  might follow "soon." The efforts of these countries to acquire  machines, parts, and specialists in the international market are  continuing at an "intensive level," the BND chief pointed out.  Particularly trade with the so-called dual-use goods --  products that can be used for civilian and military purposes --  "is developing in an increasingly problematic manner."  "Sophisticated acquisition networks" are being established.  Technically, the BND is in a position to provide "first hints"  as a result of the control of the telecommunications traffic,  but it is not allowed to evaluate findings in Germany. "We have  to pretend not to hear and see anything," Porzner regretted. He  demanded the expansion of the "instruments designed to discover  individual illegal deals" and to involve the BND.    Whereas representatives of the Customs Criminal Office and  the Stuttgart public prosecutor reported initial success in the  prosecution of violations of the foreign trade and the war  weapons law, Bielefeld jurist Christoph Gusy warned against  continued control of the post and telecommunications traffic.  Gusy is representing Rhineland-Palatinate in a lawsuit against  infringements of the secrecy of post and telecommunications  traffic with the Federal Constitutional Court.</p>

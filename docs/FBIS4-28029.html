			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bernie C. Perez] </F>   [Text] Davao City -- The Davao City Government, in  coordination with the Private Investments and Trade  Opportunities-Philippines (PITO-P), has identified the list of  preferred investment areas (PIAs) to further lure local and  foreign businessmen to the area.    BUSINESS WORLD learned PIAs included under the "Invest in  Davao" project are classified into five major groupings, namely,  agri-business, tourism and recreation, manufacturing and  assembly, transshipment infrastructure, and property development.    The Invest in Davao project is a short-term (three years)  development scheme for the city. It has a fund of P37 million  [Philippine pesos] of which P20 million was pledged by the city  government and P17 million from PITO-P.    The Service Group, a Washington-based consultancy group, was  also used to conduct the study or assessment on the investment  climate in Davao.    Being the biggest producer of agricultural products, a  reason  Davao was dubbed as the "Fruit Basket of the Philippines," the  city plays an important role in enhancing the agri-based  industry.    Agri-business development in the area focuses on fruit  processing using dehydration, vacuum or spray technologies, and  canned specialty vegetables.    The potential is large for the agriculture and agri-based  industries in Davao and in the whole of Mindanao due to the  relatively favorable climate throughout the year, available  skilled and professional manpower supply, high literacy rate,  and low cost of labor.    Davao City's role as the regional commercial center will be  boosted anew with Mindanao gearing up to become one of Asia's  tourist destinations.    Records show that within six years, tourist arrivals in  Davao  jumped to 193,000 last year from 150,000 in 1987, a reason to  develop international standard hotels and beach resorts, sports  complexes, recreational facilities such as golf courses, and  marine/wildlife parks.    The manufacturing sector earmarks potential investment areas  in garments, footwear, toys, bulky kitchen and house wares,  among others. There is also a need to invest in common and  bonded warehouses to support agricultural productivity.    Roberto Arquiza, Invest in Davao assistant project manager,  told BUSINESS WORLD there is a need to develop the manufacturing  industry in Davao. "In spite of the rapid progress of the area  (Davao), most of the goods are still coming from Manila," he  said.    Councilor Aristeo Albay, chairman of the city council urban  planning and development committee, added, "It's about time that  Davao develop its manufacturing industry so that it will be less  dependent from Manila."    In terms of transshipment infrastructure, there are seven  private piers operating in Davao. Four investors (two Filipino  shippers, a Greek firm, and a British company) have also shown  interest to set up shipping operations in Davao.    The Greek shipping company, Hellenic Shipyard of Perama  S.A.,  is also planning to improve the maritime school by upgrading the  teaching facilities.    With the rise in industries and business activities in Davao  City, investments are needed to finance the construction of more  commercial office buildings, residential villages, industrial  estates, and convention/seminar centers.    As a come-on for prospective investors, the city government  included in the investment priority plan provisions for fiscal  and non-fiscal incentives.    These privileges are in addition to incentives granted by  law  and the Local Government Code.    The incentives provide that a new enterprise will be fully  exempt from mayor's permit fees, building permit fees, and local  business tax imposed by city ordinances. The incentives are  good for two years from the start of commercial operation.    There will also be tax reductions in the gross sales or  receipts taxable base for a given period after a tax holiday.  <H5>  Deductions </H5>   The following deductions for business sales taxes will be  allowed as deductions from gross receipts during the preceding  calendar year for three years starting from the date of  registration:    -- a non-cumulative operating loss equivalent to 25 percent  of losses of the preceding year as indicated in the financial  statement submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue;    -- 20 percent of expenditures from annual wages paid to  newly  hired employees who are residents of Davao City;    -- 25 percent of expenditures on infrastructure and/or  facilities built by investors which are accessible to and used  by the public; and,    -- 25 percent of expenditures on human resource/skills  training based on a training program.    There are also incentives on real property tax (RPT) such as  tax exemption for two years from the start of commercial  operation, reduced RPT rates for new investors for two years,  and two-year exemption on machinery and equipment used for  pollution control.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON: FROM TRADITIONAL TO EXOTIC, CHAIN PROVES ANYTHING  CAN BE PIZZA  </P> <P> Alice Waters first served designer pizza at Berkeley's Chez Panisse Cafe;  Wolfgang Puck popularized it at Spago. Now it is being mass-marketed with an  almost evangelical intensity. Gone are the days of having to elbow through  crowds of celebrities to get at slices of pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, duck  sausage and herbs that even your grandmother didn't keep around. California  Pizza Kitchen is seeing nicely to that.  </P> <P> This wildly successful chain has proven to be one of the hottest concept  restaurants of the '80s. The operative idea behind the range is that anything  can be pizza. If four people get together and find themselves unable to decide  between Thai, Chinese, Italian or Mexican food, they can go to California Pizza  Kitchen and have all four . . . on pizzas.  </P> <P> Somebody must like the idea. Just 4 years after it was founded, the chain  boasts eight stores from Hawaii to Georgia, with plans for several more in such  faraway places as Japan and Australia.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Fashion Island location opened last fall and has been packed  since day one. And why not? It features all the trappings that made the  restaurant popular in the first place: the open kitchen; the antiseptic white  tile motif; the young, good-looking staff, and a menu featuring many of the  decade's hot, exotic dishes piled atop circular platters of dough. It's the  kind of place that makes you feel young and foolish -- young when you're in the  company of all the gorgeous, well-dressed couples; foolish when you're cutting  into something as absurd as a moo shu chicken calzone. But don't worry;  traditional cheese pizza is the first item on the menu.  </P> <P> All the pizzas are baked in a specially designed wood-burning oven, which gives  them a slightly smoky taste that lovers of conventional pizza may not be used  to. Five-cheese with tomato is one of the best; it comes topped with  fresh-sliced tomato, basil leaves, buffalo mozzarella, Fontina, smoked Gouda  and two kinds of Romano cheeses, which all ooze and mingle brilliantly. Goat  cheese pizza with bacon, red onions and sweet bell pepper also works well -- no  sensory overload from strange and unnatural combinations.  </P> <P> Of course, much of the menu is, well, non-traditional. How about a Thai chicken  pizza with spicy ginger-peanut and sesame sauce, green onion, bean sprouts,  carrots and roasted peanuts? Yarggh. How about Chinese, in the form of a Peking  duck pizza with mushrooms, slivered green onions and an indiscriminate glob of  Hoisin sauce? Not much better. And Pritikin? Yes. It's cheese-less with grilled  eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes and a bag full of shredded spinach -- sort of like  eating the spray from a lawn mower.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the original barbecue chicken pizza with cilantro and sliced  red onion is really delicious. There is a finely textured mozzarella calzone  with sweet cherry tomatoes, sauteed red and yellow peppers, and a layer of  salty Fontina for good measure. Vegetarian pizza has a simple, straightforward  appeal, with broccoli, grilled eggplant, mushrooms and lots of oregano. And the  two-sausage pizza, perhaps the Kitchen's best marriage of trend and tradition,  succeeds because of excellent mild and sweet Italian sausages. Pass on the  average duck and chicken sausage, incidentally.  </P> <P> A variety of salads and pasta dishes are available. For instance, there's a  well-mixed romaine and watercress salad in balsamic vinaigrette with walnuts  for crunch and Gorgonzola for sharpness. The mixed-leaf salad in a Caesar  dressing with fat croutons and shaved Romano is good too. The only salad  letdown is a boring tuna salad that tastes of nothing more than canned tuna and  mayo.  </P> <P> Pasta here is not perfect. I sampled three: linguine with a flavorful Bolognese  sauce, angel hair with a rough tomato-basil concoction, and a nondescript  garlic cream fettuccine. All were on the gummy side, as if the noodles had not  been properly rinsed after cooking.  </P> <P> Which brings me to the many lapses in service I've experienced. Angel-hair  pasta arrived without the promised goat cheese. I asked the server to put some  on. And back it came with unappetizing hunks of cheese frazzled to a charred  tomato-basil coulis. I ordered a bottle of wine at the bar while waiting for my  table. The bartender was too busy to open it. So how did he solve the problem?  Simple. He produced a wine opener and wordlessly slid it over to me. But hey, I  didn't mind. I'm a casual kind of guy. And who knows? It might be the next big  trend.  </P> <P> California Pizza Kitchen is moderately priced. Salads are $3.50 to $7.50.  Pastas are $6.95 to $8.50. Pizzas are $5.95 to $8.95.  </P></p>

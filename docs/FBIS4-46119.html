			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Lebanese Government and the </F> Iranian Hostages in Israeli Captivity"]    [Text] Yesterday the country's newspapers reported that  sources close to the Lebanese Government have stated that the  four Iranian hostages who were taken captive in Beirut in 1982  have been handed over to officials of the Zionist regime. [see  item LD0905163994 in previous Terrorism Report] The unofficial  nature of this report prevents the officials of the Foreign  Ministry to question officially the Lebanese Government on this  issue.    Following the arrest of Samir Ja'ja', SALAM carried a  commentary discussing the responsibility of the Lebanese  Government at a time when it has gained relative control over  the affairs of its country. The commentary underlined the need  to clarify the fate of the Iranian hostages. The Iranian  ambassador in Beirut also met with Lebanese officials to discuss  the issue. Public opinion and the concerned families of the  Iranian hostages are anticipating an answer from a government  which has undertaken the affairs of Lebanon.    Basically speaking, with increased control by the Lebanese  Government over various areas and especially over Beirut, it is  only natural for the [Israelis] to have considered it dangerous  -- security-wise -- to look after the Iranian diplomats who were  taken hostage. It is possible though, that the Iranian hostages  were taken from the very start to occupied Palestine and  directly questioned by the Zionists. The Israelis were  confident that with the border conflicts and their presence in  South Lebanon, they too would have hostages. Thus, they  considered the exchange of the valuable Iranian hostages for  other hostages as one of the solutions.    At any rate, it is now the duty of the Lebanese Government  to  clearly state that the Iranian hostages are being held captive  by the Zionists. Following this step by the Lebanese  Government, ways for freeing the Iranian hostages from the  clutches of the Zionists will be found.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-Salih: "Hamas Denies Secret Negotiation </F> With Israel"]    [Text] London -- A senior official in the Palestinian  Hamas movement has denied the existence of any secret contacts  between his movement and Israel. He also denied that the  initiative launched by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the  movement's Political Bureau, indicates the existence of such  contacts or any change in the movement's policy and strategy.    Abu-Hamdan, Hamas representative in Tehran, told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that this information is untrue and designed to distort  the movement's position.    Abu-Hamdan added that "the attempt to leak this false  information is aimed at trying to provoke the negotiating  Palestinian side into offering further concessions, especially  as Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated after his  recent meeting with Yasir 'Arafat that the agreement could be  somewhat delayed."    As is known, contacts have been made in the past between  Israel and Hamas officials held in Israeli jails, including  Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the movement's spiritual leader. On this  question the Hamas representative in Tehran said that "past  contacts had their own circumstances and were made with the  detained brothers." He added that "Israel asked some detained  brothers to convey messages to the movement's leadership abroad.  Their reply was clear, namely that there could be no  negotiations or contacts between jailer and prisoner. Hamas  explained its position on these contacts at the time."    Asked whether the truce initiative to which Dr. Abu-Marzuq  stressed his commitment means Hamas' recognition of Israel and a  willingness to accept the principle of negotiating with the  Hebrew state, especially as the initiative was announced in the  wake of operations carried out by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  battalions inside the green strip in 'Afula and Hadera and  Israel's moves to tighten the noose around the movement in both  Jordan and other Arab and foreign states, Abu-Hamdan said that  "the truce that Dr. Abu-Marzuq announced does not mean  recognition of Israel's right to occupy or remain in any part of  the Palestinian territories."    He went on: "Dr. Abu-Marzuq's proposal is very clear: It  means accepting a truce in order to hold free elections and, if  Hamas wins those elections, it means accepting its program,  which rejects Israel's existence."    Abu-Hamdan added that "Hamas did not request the truce. What  Dr. Abu-Marzuq said was that, if Israel wants to extricate  itself from its dilemma and if it requests a truce, we will  agree."    Asked whether Hamas should extricate its enemy from his  dilemma -- if Israel is in fact suffering one -- Abu-Hamdan said  that "we are not interested in extricating Israel from its  dilemma. Israel tried to extricate itself from the dilemma  following its failure to protect its security after our  operations, which hurt it, by trying to turn the conflict with  it into an inter-Arab conflict, but it failed."    Asked whether the new initiative is not an attempt by Hamas  to escape pressures which face it in Jordan and those which it  might face in other Arab and foreign countries, Abu-Hamdan said  that "there is understanding in Hamas of Jordan's and Syria's  circumstances, because any harm inflicted on their stability  weakens the Palestinian cause. Thus we are interested in this  question, and the statements made by the head of the Political  Bureau indicate that."    Asked why he is not interested in the PLO's stability in  the way that he is interested in the stability of these two  states, which are also participating in the peace process,  Abu-Hamdan said that "the PLO is abandoning the Palestinian  people's cause as a whole and granting legitimacy to that  abandonment by considering itself their representative. What I  am interested in is for my issue not to be abandoned. The  problem with the PLO is not personal; it revolves around the  nature of the settlement and the abandonment of rights."    He added that "Hamas' position is against the settlement and  only accepts negotiation if that negotiation is going to lead to  the restoration of the Palestinian people's rights to their  territory from the river to the sea. But it is unacceptable to  negotiate over something unknown that might or might not be  achieved. This is what the PLO is doing. In this context it is  offering one concession after another."    On the possibility of a meeting between 'Arafat and the  Hamas  leadership, as reported recently, Abu-Hamdan said that "our  position on a meeting with 'Arafat has been very clear since the  signing of the Oslo agreement, namely that we will not meet with  him unless he backtracks on the agreement and returns to a  struggle program around which all Palestinian forces can rally  for the sake of liberating the land and recovering all  Palestinian rights."    On the agreement signed between Hamas and Fatah in the  occupied territories yesterday, he said that "this agreement is  a field agreement prompted by conditions. It is aimed at  solving problems between the two sides and averting Palestinian  infighting. That is the essence of the movement's strategy,  which prohibits infighting."</p>

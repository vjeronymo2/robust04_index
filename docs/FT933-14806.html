			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: City office space boost for Macao MR Stanley Ho, Macao's casino tycoon, has unveiled a Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 930m) plan to develop the Portuguese colony's central business district which will increase the size of Macao city by 20 per cent, reports Simon Holberton from Macao. The three-stage Nam Van Lakes development will cover an area of 130 hectares and provide 46 development sites for offices, housing and hotels, as well as two fresh water lakes. It is due to be completed by 1999, the year in which Macao reverts to Chinese sovereignty. Work on the project's first stage, worth Patacas 3bn (Pounds 248m), is due to be completed in 1995 and will provide fully serviced reclaimed land suitable for eight office towers, three residential developments and a luxury hotel. The project is owned by Nam Van Development, 60 per cent controlled by mainland Chinese interests. Mr Ho's Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau (STDM) owns 25 per cent of the company, which is capitalised at Patacas 800m.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Survey of Swindon (3): Wide open space to expand / A look at land available for future development THE Thamesdown Borough Council claims there is enough land set aside to ensure Swindon's continued growth for at least another 10 years. Yet some estate agents and developers argue that there exists a pent-up demand for new greenfield sites over and above the council's planning allocations. It is almost impossible to tell who is right because the recession has had a becalming effect. There is little construction, few lettings and many of the planned developments are on hold. On paper, however, it looks as as if there are sufficient development projects to continue the growth which has characterised Swindon for more than 20 years. Tarmac is involved in a big development in Churchward next to the station. About 45 acres of this is a conservation area. It features 11 listed buildings some of them reputed to have been built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. On the remaining acres (the total development could be 137 acres), there are plans for more than 1m square feet of business space (B1 light industrial, B2 heavy industrial and B2 warehousing and distribution), some 160,000 sq ft of retail and 100,000 sq ft of leisure. To the north of Swindon, in the so-called Northern Development Area at Haydon there are plans for a 10,000-unit housing project over a 1,500-acre area. This would be combined with an 80-acre industrial site earmarked for a campus of the Cranfield College of Technology. Elsewhere, there are at least seven industrial estates which still have land available. These include the Interface Business Park which covers nine acres and the Lydiard Fields (92 acres with 50 acres available for industrial and commercial space and in which Hilton Hotels is interested. There is also space on the Delta Business Park, and on Burderop Wood, a 28-acre park. In addition, there is at least 1m sq ft vacant in the town centre. Some of this is hanging over from the last speculative spurt of building in the mid 1980s. But Nationwide Building Society has exacerbated the situation by vacating around 250,000 sq ft of office space in six blocks and moving its employees to a new site outside the town. There are also hundreds of acres available for housing development and if the housing programme were to go ahead the population could swell by at least 30,000 by the end of the century. The Haydon programme is on hold at present because one of the developers pulled out because of the recession. But it is likely the houses will be built in a better economic climate. Estate agents say there might be enough space available to meet expected demand, but the property may not be the right kind. Mr Mark Wightman, a partner in agents Dreweatt Neate, says: 'All the inquiries we have been getting in this office have been for designer-built and owned properties on new sites. There is very little interest in the existing office stock in the new town.' He adds: 'Much of the office space in the town centre was built in the 1960s and 1970s. It has become outdated in terms of what companies want now. I think even without the recession it will be difficult to move some of the space on offer. It will take a long time. 'Much of the stock will have to be refurbished and in some cases it might be a question of tearing them down and starting again. Swindon does have a problem with the town centre. Apart from the office overhang, the shopping centre, the Brunel, badly needs upgrading.' Mr Wightman cites the 'Honda effect'. Honda is nearing completion of its 1m sq ft car assembly plant, north-east of Swindon close to the A419. The feeling is that once the plant is off and running it will draw dozens of subsidiary companies. They, Mr Wightman believes, will be looking for space on new sites close to the Honda works. He says: 'The general feeling of the local business community, backed by the Swindon Chamber of Comm-erce and Industry, is that while acknowledging that there are sites to be developed within the existing urban area, it is inevitable that further land will have to be released for employment purposes to balance the housing approvals already granted.' Mr David Griffin, a partner in J P Sturge another leading agent in Swindon, argues along the same lines. He says: 'There is an overhang of second-rate space. This space is failing to attract occupiers. 'But it is vital to distinguish between this and new space. Appearances to the contrary, Swindon has not seen excess-ive speculative development of office and industrial space seen elsewhere along the M4. 'We are only just beginning to see the Honda effect. Some 140 companies have been designated as suppliers to Honda. Not all of them will be Swindon, of course, but many will. I think it is important that more greenfield land be released if Swindon is not to lose out to other locations in the 21st Century.' The official position of the Thamesdown Borough Council is that there is plenty of land available for any expansion of business at least until the end of the century. It is opposed to giving planning for any new greenfield sites. But, as Mr Jim D'Avila, the deputy leader of the council, says: 'We are not against reviewing the situation, say in 1996, if circumstances change.'</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Strike ballot looms on firefighters' pay TALKS in London to avert industrial conflict in the fire service this autumn failed to produce an agreement yesterday. As a result, today's special delegate conference of the Fire Brigade Union is expected to endorse the calling of a strike ballot among its 49,500 members. The ballot would begin on October 4. Speaking to 4,000 chanting firefighters outside the local authority employers' offices yesterday, Mr Ken Cameron, the FBU's general secretary, said he had 'no doubt that 80 per cent of firefighters would back the strike call'. He said the 'train was speeding down the hill' and a conflict, though tragic, would be hard to prevent. Union leaders are planning a series of one-day nationwide stoppages if they secure the approval of the members. The result of the firefighters' ballot will be announced on November 1 and the stoppages would begin after seven days' notice to employers. Mr Cameron said the employers had failed to change their bargaining stance since June. They had told the union they could not honour the firefighters' 15-year-old pay formula this year, but had to make a pay award in line with the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector wage limit. Mr Laurie Conlan, chairman of the local authority employers, blamed the government for the threatened strike. 'We fully support the firefighters' pay formula. It has kept the peace for 15 years,' he said. 'It has never been our wish to suspend the formula. That has been imposed on us by the government. 'We have told the union their members will have the formula in 1994, come what may.' Mr Conlan added: 'We have made an absolute commitment to them. We sympathise with the FBU, though we can't support any strike action. The union is going to tremendous lengths to avoid a dispute.' He said the employers were to talk to Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, on Tuesday, and intended to hold further negotiations with the union in Glasgow next Friday on the eve of the strike ballot. Mr Conlan added that a strike would be 'an economic disaster' for the fire service. Firefighters outside the talks said they were ready to compromise with a staged deal if it gave them 1.5 per cent in November and the rest of the increase calculated by the pay formula next April. Both sides believe that the actual sum of money proposed by the formula for this year would not be much above the government limit. The formula is based on an updated and adjusted link to the upper quartile of male manual workers' earnings, which is compiled each April in the government's earnings survey. This year's survey is due to be published next Thursday. FBU leaders believe public opinion is on the firefighters' side. More than 250,000 people have signed a petition back-ing their demand for the full implementation of the pay formula this year.</p>

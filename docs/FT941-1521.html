			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Devro at Pounds 18m and sees growth Devro International, the sausage casings maker which came to the stock exchange last June, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m for the year to the end of December, against Pounds 13.1m. Turnover was up from Pounds 82.7m to Pounds 94.4m. On a pro-forma basis, assuming the post-flotation capital structure was in place, pre-tax profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 20.1m). Mr Leon Allen, chairman, said Devro was 'moving forward in a very satisfactory manner, despite the worldwide recession'. Mr Graeme Alexander, chief executive, said that half the sales growth of 14 per cent was due to windfall currency gains arising from the effect of sterling's devaluation. Sales volumes increased in Europe, the US and the Asia Pacific area, with the South Korean market being particularly strong and expansion in Japan, he added. The company's new line in collagen film, used for coating hams, saw sales rise to Pounds 4m. Thanks to the float net borrowings of Pounds 69.2m at the beginning of 1993 were paid off. The company generated Pounds 27.9m in cash flow and had net cash of Pounds 4.2m at the end of the year. Devro said it expected to grow organically, especially in Asia, and to profit from the introduction of new products, of which it gave no details. 'The time may be approaching to give careful consideration to acquisitions,' the company added. Earnings per share were unchanged at 10.5p or on a pro forma basis 14.8p (10.5p). A final dividend of 4.17p is proposed. Devro, based near Glasgow, is a maker of casings made from the edible protein collagen, which is gradually gaining market share worldwide from gut casings. The company was floated after being acquired by its management from Johnson &amp; Johnson. COMMENT The results reflect the quality of a company which grew steadily while achieving greater efficiency and investing Pounds 3.5m in R&amp;D. It enjoys high margins, faces no single competitor worldwide and its market is protected by the high barriers to entry stemming from its technological lead. Devro was floated at 170p and peaked at 294p as the market worked out how to place it in the food manufacturing sector. Yesterday its shares fell 12 1/2 p to 244 1/2 p, apparently because of profit-taking on a bad day for the market, but perhaps also because of nervousness about the build-up of cash balances, which could hinder fast earnings growth. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits for 1994 of between Pounds 28m and Pounds 30m, suggesting prospective earnings of about 16.5p, putting the shares on a multiple of 14.5. Given Devro's underlying strength and the undisclosed new products in the pipeline the shares may be underpriced.</p>

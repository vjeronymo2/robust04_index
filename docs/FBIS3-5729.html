Exactly what kind of guests they will be has yet  to be determined. The junta's representatives could be arriving  as special friends of Thailand or as guests of the regional  grouping as a whole.    The invitation, which has been agreed to in principle by  senior Asean officials meeting in Bangkok, is to be made despite  moves by the United Nations to censure Rangoon for its brutal  rule and continued detention of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.    The United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva was  recently told that a system of repression is still in place in  Burma which violates the fundamental rights of the Burmese  people. Nonviolent critics of the Rangoon junta are continually  being arrested and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and a  climate of fear prevails in the country.    Human rights are the same everywhere and their protection is  the responsibility of the international community. Ideologies,  national boundaries and local legal codes should not be  obstacles to speaking out on behalf of others. Sadly, Asean  seems to have overlooked this fact. As the saying goes, nothing  should be allowed in the way when there's a baht to be made.    Rationalizing the decision, Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwit  Simasakun said on Tuesday that "the isolation of Burma, as  suggested by the Western countries, won't contribute to the  development of this region".    The term "development" as espoused by the Foreign Ministry  has little to do with moral principles and obviously much to do  with economics. The current trend of thought among Asean  leaders is that individual countries have the right to tackle  human rights issues in their own way and that development has a  priority over civil and political rights.    Since crushing pro-democracy protests in 1988 and securing  its position in power, the reviled State Law and Order  Restoration Council (Slorc) has embarked on a programme to  revamp the economy, motivated by little more than  self-preservation. Recent visitors to Rangoon have said that  Slorc appears to be "succeeding" in breathing life into the long  moribund economy, but Burmese have testified that their lives  seem to be getting tougher with inflation running out of control.    The military junta itself has said that only when economic  rights have been looked after will they (if ever) think about  providing "political luxuries" such as a democratic government.  Clearly, Slorc is rationalizing its human rights abuses now  with the argument that it's all in the interests of economic  progress, and that the Burmese people would rather have a full  belly than a vote. But it has been indicated clearly that even  if the Burmese people are allowed to vote -- as in 1990 -- their  verdict will be disregarded if the security of the regime is not  enhanced in the country.    Sadly, the West's push for trade sanctions has failed  because  Burma has forged closer ties with its giant northern neighbour  China. Trade between the two countries, despite traditional  suspicions, is flourishing and China is now Burma's biggest  trading partner.    For Asean, rather disgustingly, nothing matters more than  profits and because of this they have obviously decided they can  no longer wait to bring Burma into their circle. With China  willing to run a trade deficit with Burma in return for the  development of a strategic "friendship", this would seem to be a  perfect justification.    But double standards prevail within the regional grouping,  especially when it comes to Malaysia and Indonesia. Both Kuala  Lumpur and Jakarta, which denounced the West for not doing  enough to protect Muslims in Bosnia, seem to have forgotten  their objections over Slorc's treatment of the Rohingya Muslim  minority. Of the 288,000 Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh in  early 1992, 230,000 remain in camps along the border in  Bangladesh because they fear military persecution.    Much to the disappointment of this paper, it seems Asean is  unwilling to reverse its decision with regard to Burma's  invitation to be in Bangkok in July. By this, the regional  grouping has hammered another nail into the coffin of the  pro-democracy movement in Burma. The generals in Burma marched  into power over the corpses of young pro-democracy protesters,  yet they are embraced with open arms by Asean. Frankly, such  things happen only in nightmares. In this region, however,  nightmares become realities when there's money to be made --  regardless of whether despots respect their own people.</p>

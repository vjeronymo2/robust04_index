			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Voyage' to nowhere / Review of the premiere of Philip Glass's opera at the Met, New York The Voyage, Philip Glass's new opera to celebrate the Columbus qincentenary, is a great big thing, but deeply uncertain, and uncertain most of all about itself. The work is at least true to the mood of the celebration of a momentous historical event which could not decide whether to remember it in celebration or in shame. Glass is reported as saying, with engaging candour, that he and his librettist David Henry Hwang had to find something about Columbus that they liked. Their ruthless solution was to cut the navigator's appearance to two scenes, in both of which he could be portrayed alone, mapless and troubled: at sea in the main part of the second act, and then on his deathbed at the end of the third. Elsewhere they replaced him with heroes nearer the modern heart's desire; a wheelchair-bound cosmologist in the prologue (hauling Stephen Hawking into the picture is a offensive piece of opportunism), and, for the whole first act and much of the third, a space-ship commander who is female. The discovery (out-word) of the New World is thus defused of all problems as it goes into the gravity-less domain of space fantasy. The authors' excuse would seem to be that The Voyage is not really about Columbus at all, but about the meeting of cultures (ostensibly the subject of Hwang's play M. Butterfly) and about the restlessness of the human spirit. Hence their decision to rendezvous with that meeting and that restlessness in diverse dramatic situations: in the figure of Columbus, in the mental excursions of the contemporary scientist, in the arrival on earth of extra-terrestrials 15,000 years ago, and in the embarkation on a new, celestial voyage into the unknown a hundred years from now, the lady commander belonging both to the prehistoric past and to the future. But one has to wonder whether The Voyage is properly about any of this at all, whether the enacted scenes are not just images suitable for stage spectacle to be going on while the music idles through vast tracts of time. It is, most particularly, odd that a piece with this title, and with this supposed subject matter, should undertake so little of a voyage within itself. The score begins in E minorish rotations, and there it still is at the end, three and a half hours later. Glass's music is now quicker in movement, more rhythmically supple and more chromatic than it was, say, in Einstein on the Beach, but this is not all to the good: because the framework is still, rhythmically and tonally, in unyielding stasis and repetition, the odd wandering detail easily sounds unmotivated and makes no difference to the rock-like immobility. This is music that is not going anywhere - Glass's only formal device is exchange of one texture for another. This is music, too, whatever the scientist may sing in his words, that makes no attempt to reach for the stars. The opera cheers up a bit in the last act, after it has given up any claim or wish to make sense (the long scene of Columbus's dark night of the soul in the second act, over a shifting, revolving bass like that of Pimen's soliloquy in Boris, was perhaps for Glass too a rite de passage). This third act begins with a silly scene for 'Space Twins' and 'Earth Twins', the latter accompanied by a hunchbacked bass line suggesting the Niebelung of Das Rheingold and Siegfried. Later there is a chorus in which 21st-century dignitaries - 'Prime Minister of the EEC', 'Executive Vice President of Coca Cola' - are absurdly saluted. Then the commander and her three fellow crew members lift off (luckily most of their words are inaudible), and there remains only the inevitable after-thought of the dying luckless Columbus. David Pountney, directing his first Met production, comes into his own when the piece starts to go haywire, bringing on the dancing girls and a characteristic vulgar comic energy. Otherwise the visual display is largely a matter of dimwitted choreography and design, the latter disappointing for the rumoured cost of Dollars 1 1/2 m: Robert Israel (sets) and Dunya Ramicova (costumes) have done much finer work, on much smaller budgets, for Peter Sellars. Bruce Ferden, the conductor, is creditably - and astonishingly - enthused and disciplined. The cast (and this is probably in the nature of the piece) is led not so much by Timothy Noble's gruff Columbus as by Patricia Schuman's ringing, imperious Commander, with Kaaren Erickson, Douglas Perry and Julien Robbins all excellent as her crew. Tatiana Troyanos makes two fearsome appearances as Isabella, the 15th-century voyager's stentorian and, as it turns out, so misleading muse.</p>

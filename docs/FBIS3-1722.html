			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ron Gluckman] </F>   [Text] Daya Bay experienced its first scare last Sunday  when a pump failure triggered an alarm at the Guangdong nuclear  power plant, 50 kilometres from Hong Kong. The incident was the  most serious at the plant since operation began on February 1.  Plant officials say the problem was minor, with no safety  impact, but strict rules meant the incident had to be reported  to the China National Nuclear Safety Administration under the  terms of international nuclear safety agreements.    Last Sunday's incident was the first problem of  international  classification scale to occur at Daya Bay. At least 59 similar  incidents had been reported at the plant since last April,  well-placed sources told the SUNDAY MORNING POST. The  disclosure of the first classified problem since Daya Bay went  on line sparked renewed Hong Kong criticism of China's nuclear  power programme and came only days after the announcement of a  planned expansion that would site reactors in a ring around the  territory. The mishap also underscored Hong Kong Government  efforts to reach an agreement with Chinese officials about  expanded information of on-site problems. The present agreements  only bind China to inform Hong Kong about accidents in which  there is likely to be an off-site release of radiation that may  affect the territory.    "People are very frightened and worried about Daya Bay,"  said  Legislative Councillor, the Reverend Fung Chi-wood. "More plants  will add to the worry. Legco [the Legislative Council] should  urge China not to build more so close, but I do not know how  much they will listen."    Fears about Chinese secrecy and plant safety are also of  international concern. American nuclear energy companies,  barred from doing business with China, are closely monitoring  the Daya Bay situation. Officials with the Hong Kong Nuclear  Investment Company insist the pump problem has been the only  reportable incident at the plant since operation began. They  said most of the other incidents occurred during Daya Bay's  testing phase, when equipment was purposefully pushed to the  limits to probe the efficiency of safety devices and monitoring  systems.    "This is a safe plant," said Dr Jacques Pretti, senior  nuclear technical adviser with the company. He said Daya Bay  had performed to or above expectations, despite the minor pump  problem. Dr Pretti said automated monitoring equipment  immediately detected the pump problem and triggered safety  shutdowns. However, the mishap has renewed calls for a  government nuclear watchdog committee to monitor China's growing  nuclear power industry. A second reactor is set to come on line  at Daya Bay next summer.    Environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth accused  Daya Bay officials of secrecy. "It just goes to show what we  suspect about nuclear power, that it's not safe," Friends  spokeswoman Lisa Hopkinson said. "If they can't be open and  straight about more minor incidents, you wonder whether they  will tell us about a real accident." "We would like to know  about all on and off-site accidents. If an accident occurs,  what follow-up action is taken? It may be minor but provided  operators can respond and deal with it, it provides reassurance.  If it occurs with regularity, it is indicative that things are  going wrong." Although Friends of the Earth believe the chances  of a meltdown at Daya Bay are small, the problem lies more in  the risks of chronic health problems from radioactivity that may  contaminate water and food supplies.    China last week announced plans for several other reactors  in  Guangdong province, including two just five kilometres from Daya  Bay. The mainland intends to build up to six additional  reactors at Yangjiang City, about 200 kilometres southwest of  Hong Kong. Chinese officials have talked of a massive investment  in nuclear power, with plans to boost nuclear energy production  twenty-fold to 20,000 megawatts by the year 2020.</p>

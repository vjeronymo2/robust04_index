Nearly  50 patients suffering from this disease were reported during  November.    As a spokesman for the Regional Health Directorate  announced,  the inhabitants hardest hit by this disease are from the  districts of Pueblo Nuevo, Pitipo, and Mesones Muro, and also  from the populated centers of La Traposa, Laquipampa, and Senor  de la Justicia.    He revealed that all the cases involve malignant malaria,  and  that the majority are persons living in the rural section of  Ferrenafe.    The source remarked that people engaged in agricultural work  and in contact with the countryside are most prone to contract  this disease, because farming areas are considered a habitat for  its vector, namely, the anopheles mosquito.    He claimed that Ferrenafe's chief problem is the lack of  medical care for all its inhabitants, because the health sector  has only one properly equipped establishment, which must treat  all the residents comprising the province.    He explained that there are many districts with small  medical  stations and health centers, but none of them have medicines or  medical professionals. Hence, those stricken have been evacuated  to the city itself.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish on 17  February publishes on page 6 a 500-word unattributed article on  a cooperation agreement signed by the Andean Development  Corporation, CAF, and the Latin American Integration  Association, Aladi, which will enable CAF "to identify  investment opportunities" in 11 Aladi member countries.    CAF Chairman Enrique Garcia Rodriguez told LA MANANA that  the  agreement will be instrumental in helping Aladi member countries  in their integration drive. The article quotes Garcia Rodriguez  as saying: "We believe we can play a support role in trade  exchanges between the different integration areas like the  Andean Group; the Common Market of the South; the group of three  -- Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela; the Central American Common  Market; and Chile, which even though it is not a member of these  groups, furthers an open policy toward integration."    Garcia Rodriguez noted: "Seventy percent of CAF credits are  earmarked for bolstering private initiatives."</p>

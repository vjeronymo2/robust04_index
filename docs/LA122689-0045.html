			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM DRAWN INTO DISPUTE OVER COMPUTER IMAGING;  </P> <P> PATENTS: NEW IMAGE LETS COMPANIES GIVE A PREVIEW OF THEIR WORK. BUT A RIVAL  FIRM PLANS TO SUE OVER RIGHTS TO THE SYSTEM.  </P> <P> One recent day at the Michael Berg Beauty Salon in Encino, Catalina Ramirez  looked into a computer screen and liked what she saw. For a $35 fee, a  hairstylist was using a computer imaging device called the New Image Salon  System to show Ramirez a video picture of what she would look like if she tried  a couple of new hairdos.  </P> <P> Holding a lock of her reddish-brown, shoulder-length hair, Ramirez said: "Than  this, anything is better." But she wasn't about to leap into a new hairstyle  without a preview and some coaxing.  </P> <P> "You look like Meryl Streep there," urged stylist Mia Bakewell, pointing to an  image of Ramirez with dark brown hair in a "layered bob" cut. "I'm serious. You  have similar bone structure."  </P> <P> For Ramirez, it was a sale. She was hooked by Streep's bones, the new cut, and  the computer system. "It's really fabulous," she said.  </P> <P> Some investors have been just as easily charmed by New Image Industries Inc.,  the company that makes the salon system, and several other computer-imaging  systems for landscapers, builders, cosmetic surgeons and weight-loss clinics.  New Image's stock has soared after it went public in August, from an offering  price of $6.50 to about $11 recently.  </P> <P> Based on results for the company's fiscal year that ended June 30 -- when  profits increased nearly twenty-fold to $804,000 -- the latest stock price runs  about 30 times annual earnings-per-share, or better than double the average on  Wall Street.  </P> <P> New Image has been profitable since it incorporated in February, 1987. Indeed,  in the most recent quarter that ended Sept. 30, profits tripled to $229,000  from the same period a year before. Sales, meanwhile, increased 36% to $2.1  million.  </P> <P> And some forecasts for the company are rosy, because it's selling more and more  hairdressers on their computer system. Richard Edelman, senior vice president  of research for Southwest Securities in Dallas, predicts that New Image's  profits will increase 50% to 100% each year for the next three years. New Image  chief executive Robert Gurevitch says if all goes according to plan, the  company will sell computer systems to 10% of the nation's 250,000 salons within  about two to four years.  </P> <P> But despite the company's fast start, it still has much to worry about.  Gurevitch's long-term sales goal is a huge jump from the approximately 600 to  700 computer units the company has sold thus far in the United States. To meet  that goal, New Image will have to increase its staff dramatically.  </P> <P> New Image also has to worry about a patent dispute with a rival company, a  Florida firm called Combputer Images. So far, Combputer Images doesn't look  like a fierce competitor, posting a loss of about $36,000 on sales of about  $30,000 for the six months ended June 30.  </P> <P> But Combputer Images "intends to file suit very shortly" against New Image,  said president Alex Grief. The Florida company has two patents that cover the  idea of using computers and video equipment to preview hairstyles, Grief said.  Combputer Images is in the midst of a $1.4-million public stock offering and  the money should give the company the funds it needs to launch a legal  campaign. "Right is right," said Grief. "We obtained the patents."  </P> <P> Gurevitch counters that Combputer Images doesn't have a case, arguing Combputer  Images' patents are so narrow that New Image's equipment doesn't infringe on  them. And Gurevitch asserted that his lawyers say Combputer Images' patents  aren't valid anyway.  </P> <P> Still, if Combputer Images sues and wins, New Image could be forced out of its  most lucrative market -- beauty parlor sales, which accounted for 73% of New  Image's revenues in its latest fiscal year, or it might be forced to pay the  Florida company under a licensing agreement.  </P> <P> Another problem is that the computer-imaging field is crowded with young  companies, said Richard Schwarz, an industry analyst with Shearson Lehman  Hutton in New York. Schwarz said he has not followed New Image closely, but  said he has files on nearly 1,000 companies making a variety of  computer-imaging systems -- including one to help police departments  reconstruct criminals' faces. A number of those firms have already failed,  Schwarz said.  </P> <P> There's also the question of just how many beauticians, builders and others  will pay the $10,000 to $22,000 it costs for a New Image system. Gurevitch said  it's not so tough to persuade builders and landscapers -- who can earn back the  price of a machines in just a few jobs -- to buy one. But with beauticians, who  use the equipment to push $50 perms, it's a more difficult sell, he admitted.  </P> <P> Telephone salespeople in Canoga Park now sell most of New Image's computer  systems, but the company recently opened sales offices in Chicago, Miami and  Westport, Conn. Virtually all of New Image's sales are made with leasing deals,  so buyers can get their payments down to a couple of hundred dollars a month.  </P> <P> Under its ambitious expansion plans, New Image plans to open as many as three  more sales offices, and to meet Gurevitch's lofty sales predictions, New Image  must also hire plenty of competent middle managers and stay ahead of burgeoning  cash and capital needs. Thanks to its stock offering, however, the company has  had about $4.4 million in cash as of Sept. 30.  </P> <P> But, said analyst Edeleman: "The risk is always that they will grow too fast  and lose control internally."  </P> <P> New Image was formed in 1986 when Kirk La Mar, a Woodland Hills beauty parlor  owner, teamed up with one of his customers, John Halloran, a computer-imaging  consultant for Lockheed. Halloran and La Mar borrowed about $10,000, and  invested $15,000 of their own money to build an experimental model of the Salon  System. Their first buyer was a salon owner who saw them on a local cable  television program. When the two incorporated New Image in 1987, they brought  in Gurevitch, a former executive with Gillette and Revlon who was then the  chief executive of a sportswear company.  </P> <P> New Image makes no computer hardware -- it simply repackages computer equipment  with its own software and a kind of pictorial glossary. A stylist aims a video  camera at a client and the computer records the client's face. Then the  computer can replace the image of the client's hair with one of the hairstyles  loaded into its memory.  </P> <P> It's a tool for marketing to the cautious -- or as Encino beauty parlor owner  Michael Berg calls them, "the glamour resistant." Said Berg: "They're afraid of  change. They want to say, 'show me.' "  </P> <P> New Image also makes systems for builders, landscape designers and weight-loss  clinics. And since buying McGhan InstruMed Corp. of Carpinteria last month for  about $200,000, New Image has been in the business of selling similar computer  systems to cosmetic surgeons too.  </P> <P> The company has been helped by a flood of publicity -- mostly centered around  the beauty shop systems. New Image has been featured in 750 newspaper and  magazine articles, and La Mar has put in 30 television appearances touting the  computer device. But when La Mar appeared on "Late Night with David Letterman"  in August, 1988, his usual TV game plan didn't work. Letterman's first comment,  according to La Mar, was " 'You look like you manage wrestlers.' "  </P> <P> Wrestling with the company's growth will be his next task.  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Today The Essential History Of Europe is about the French. Let's hope the programme obscures the fact that the Italians taught them to cook, and overlooks the Second World War. French TV is another sore point, as is the erosion of the French language by English. Oh, and the subject of wine is best avoided: French wines now lose so often against the Australians in blind tastings that the French are starting to sulk. Kinder to ignore pop music and modern drama, too, and although you can hardly disregard their racism remember that it is only a bit more virulent than that in Germany and Britain. Otherwise they are marvellous people (8.00 BBC2). BBC2's Video Diaries series has been very mixed. Some have been compelling, others scarcely worth watching. Today's was made by Elhanan Oppenheim who lives in the occupied West Bank. For That Was This Week That Was (9.00 ITV) the poacher/presenter has turned gamekeeper. After 36 years, the programme ends with a retrospective which attempts to discover what the programme did, why it got into trouble with the government, and what may replace it.</p>

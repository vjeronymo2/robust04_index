			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UKRINFORM-TASS correspondent Lev Ryabchikov] </F>   [Text] Simferopol, 11 March -- While Crimean MP's were  approving Crimea's budget, Yevgeniy Saburov, who was appointed  deputy premier of its government, held his first official press  conference.    He stated that the new government of the republic would  begin  to operate in its final form in a month's time -- in April.    Yevgeniy Saburov said that the break with Russia was rather  tragic for the economy of the Crimea since it was oriented  toward selling goods and services to the Russian north in the  first instance. Therefore, if one were to speak of restoring  these contacts, what was at issue was not political  rapprochement but the closest ties with the sales market. This  is what the people of Crimea wanted, too, and one should be  sympathetic toward the will of the people.    He confirmed that Crimea and Ukraine would enjoy the closest  ties. And it was likely that the best of what was accepted in  the Crimea would be used in Ukraine, too.    In reply to a question as to what would happen if  politicians  did not allow the reforms to be carried out, the deputy premier  said that in that event, his stay in the Crimea would be  pointless.    At the press conference itself, Yevgeniy Saburov signed a  statement to Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, asking  Ukrainian citizenship to be conferred upon him in connection  with his appointment to work in the Crimean government.</p>

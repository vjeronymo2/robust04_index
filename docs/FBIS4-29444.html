			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime  Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Friday the Al-Arqam Muslim  fundamentalist movement had reached a level that could threaten  national security, but the government would be cautious in  taking any action to reform it.    The prime minister said the people might wrongly conclude  that the government was trying to suppress an Islamic movement  if it acted because they did not realise that Al-Arqam's  teachings had become deviant.    Commenting on the Islamic centre's disclosure that Al-Arqam  was training its own militant force, Dr. Mahathir said action  needed to be taken to check the spread of its influence.    We have to act effectively and, to be effective, we need the  people's support, he told reporters after opening the World  Islamic Civilisation Festival '94 here.    Towards this end, the most important thing was to make the  people aware that Al-Arqam had deviated from ths true teachings  of Islam, he said.</p>

The two agreed that Seoul and Buenos Aires exchange a  memorandum of understanding on the matter and expand exchanges  of law-enforcement officials to strengthen bilateral judicial  cooperation.    "Judicial cooperation is very much in need considering more  than 35,000 Koreans are living in Argentina and bilateral  exchanges are growing," Ho pointed out.    On this understanding, the two countries decided to sign an  extradition treaty as soon as possible after consultation with  the Korean Justice Ministry, he said.    On Saturday, Ho finishes his agenda in Argentina and leads  the four-man National Assembly delegation to Chile, where he is  scheduled to meet President-designate Eduardo Frei and discuss  problems of mutual concern.</p>

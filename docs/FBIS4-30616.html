			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report by NHK Economic Department reporter </F> Eiichi Meguro on NHK's "emergency survey" on the yen's  appreciation]    [Text] In connection with the yen's current appreciation,  NHK conducted an emergency survey today with 30 major exporting  companies, including automakers and electrical appliance  companies. According to the survey, two-third of them initially  expected to make greater business profits this year, and they  hoped that their business would recover. However, only 7  percent of these respondents said that they will earn higher  profits even if the dollar remains at the level of 100 yen. On  the other hand, nearly 40 percent of them said their business  profits will decline.    As for the economic situation as a whole, 15 companies said  that the economic recovery will be delayed, while 14 companies  expressed concern that the economy will deteriorate again. It  can be said that they consider the situation to be very serious.    When asked about measures to counter the yen's appreciation,  17 companies plan to increase their overseas production, while  13 companies plan to expand their imports of parts from foreign  countries. They intend to deal with the yen's current  appreciation by reducing costs through increasing both overseas  production and the imports of parts.    If they increase production at their plants abroad, it is  feared that this will cause industrial stagnation in Japan. For  example, there are concerns that this will affect domestic  employment and technological development.    As for domestic employment, only 30 percent of these  respondents said that they are going to maintain their current  number of workers. On the other hand, nearly 60 percent of them  said that they are going to decrease the number of their  employees. On the question of by what percentage they intend to  reduce their work forces, we got answers from nine companies.  While nine companies plan to decrease their work force by less  than 10 percent, one company plans to decrease its work force by  30 percent.    If major companies promote rationalization, this will affect  subsidiary companies. It is feared that the domestic employment  situation will become more serious in the future.</p>

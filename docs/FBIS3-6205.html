			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- Democratic Party [DP]  Chairman Yi Ki-taek declared Tuesday his determination to pursue  unification of the opposition parties.    "The party and myself are willing to offer considerable  concessions on vested rights to unify the opposition camp within  the scope of protecting the legitimacy of the DP," Yi said at a  press conference marking the first anniversary of his leadership  of the main opposition party.    In order to build a powerful opposition, Yi said he would  join hands not only with the existing opposition parties -- the  United People's Party, New Korea Party and New Political Reform  Party -- but also with dissident and civil groups.    The DP would soon coordinate party opinions in a supreme  council meeting and, depending on the form of unification, could  make considerable concessions on its vested rights, he said.    "During the past year as party leader, I realized that  without inner discipline, any rewards from struggling against  the ruling party or progress as a policy-making party are  useless," he said, vowing to instill discipline in party members  or step aside.    He said he would prepare for next year's mayoral and  gubernatorial elections by strengthening the DP's nationwide  network, adopting a budget accounting system and conducting  training programs for election candidates and winners at home  and abroad.    An agreement reached recently by DP and ruling DLP floor  leaders to create a subcommittee on legislation and judiciary to  discuss revision or abolition of the national security law must  be honored, he said.    He pledged that formation of the legislation and judiciary  subcommittee would top the agenda when a special National  Assembly session opens in May.    Yi proposed that a special committee to reform legislation  affecting the public, including the national security law,  police neutrality law, Bank of Korea independence law, unified  medical insurance law and labor relations law, be set up on a  full-time basis.    He hinted at a stronger attack against the ruling camp,  saying he would no longer tolerate delay in the installation of  a National Assembly intelligence committee under the revised law  related to the Agency for National Security Planning.    "Though it is best that I visit North Korea after an  inter-Korean summit, I am firm on my wish to visit North Korea  despite the lack of realization of such a summit," the  opposition party leader said.    He said he would apply to visit the North at an appropriate  time depending on progress in inter-Korean dialogue and  Pyongyang-Washington talks.    Yi, however, said little about his recent summit with  President Kim Yong-sam except to note that the DP, as a  legitimate opposition party, has performed its duty in helping  the government when it is headed in the right direction and  offering criticism when it is not.    He went on to urge a thorough investigation into a bribery  scandal concerning the state-financed National Agricultural  Cooperative Federation and relocation of Sangmudae, an army  athletic unit.    He said his party would emphasize economic affairs as its  success in the local elections also depended on resolving the  public's financial problems.</p>

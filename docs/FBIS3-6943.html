			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Aris R. Ilagan] </F>   [Text] Top leaders of the National Democratic Front (NDF)  now living in exile in the Netherlands have expressed their  willingness to resume anew peace negotiations with government  representatives based on the joint declaration agreed upon by  the government and communist leaders in The Hague last year.    Tarlac Rep. Jose Yap who is a member of the government  panel,  said in a television talk show late Thursday night that NDF  leader Luis Jalandoni told him over the phone from the  Netherlands last Sunday that they are willing to proceed with  the peace talks.    Yap said that after their exploratory talks with Jalandoni  and Jose Ma. Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the  Philippines (CPP) who is also seeking political asylum in the  Netherlands, the peace initiative will now deal with the  establishment of committee level talks in preparation for the  holding of formal negotiations.    The peace negotiations with top leaders of the CPP, the New  People's Army (NPA), and the NDF have remained suspended  following a deadlock on the issue of venue.    While the government has adopted a "shifting venue" concept  as part of the confidence-building process, Hague-based NDF  leaders led by Sison have not made any decision on their choice  for the next meeting place with government representatives.    The initial choice of the NDF was in Hanoi, Vietnam, but  Sison later rejected the venue for still undetermined reasons.    On the other hand, former communist leader Saturnino Ocampo  said that the impending amnesty declaration of President Ramos  should not provoke the NDF into changing its position of  including the rebels who have not availed of the government's  amnesty package.    Ocampo also opposed the imposition of a deadline on the  peace  negotiations once the presidential amnesty for rebels, may it be  conditional or unconditional, has been declared by the Chief  Executive.    Col. Rufo de Veyra, spokesman of the Armed Forces of the  Philippines (AFP), declined to issue any comment on the possible  effects of President Ramos' amnesty package, adding that any  statement on the issue will only be speculative.    However, any decision made by the president with regard to  the amnesty issue will be fully supported by the military, he  said.  <H5>  Joint Meeting </H5>   President Ramos has called the chairmen and members of the  three government peace panels to a joint meeting in Malacanang  [presidential office] on Monday, 21 March, to review the  progress of the peace process with all the rebel groups in the  country.    In a handwritten memorandum, the president instructed  Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. to also invite  advisers from the Cabinet, Senate, and House of Representatives  to attend the conference.    During the meeting, the Office of the Presidential Adviser  on  the Peace Process (OPAPP) will brief those attending the meeting  on the status of the peace negotiations with the Moro National  Liberation Front (MNLF), the National Democratic Front-New  People's Army- Communist Party of the Philippines, and the  military rebels.  <H5>  Internal Reforms </H5>   Camp Capinpin, Tanay, Rizal -- Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile,  Philippine Army commander, said yesterday that with peace within  "arm's reach," his command has embarked on a program of  sustaining internal reforms and upgrading equipment and  resources as part of its general shift from counter-insurgency  to external defense of the nation.    Speaking at the 18th anniversary celebration of the Army's  Second Infantry (Jungle Fighters) Division, Enrile said that the  military has already dismantled the political-military structure  of the New People's Army (NPA) in most parts of the country,  particularly in the Southern Luzon and Bicol countrysides.    He said that the communist rebels have now been pushed  deeper  into mountain enclaves where they are isolated and deprived of  the popular support essential in the conduct of the insurgency  war.    Enrile praised the officers and men of the Army division  under Brig Gen. Regino Lacson for having done much toward the  achievement of peace in Southern Luzon and Bicol.    Enrile also cited the Army division's "Galloping Clouds"  campaign that maximize the opportunities to reach out to the  masses and "give an entirely new and larger meaning to the  traditional concept as a civil military operation."</p>

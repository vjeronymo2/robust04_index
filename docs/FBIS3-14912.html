			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan, 28 Feb -- Four hours of talks with the  Armenian leadership were held in Yerevan today by Vladimir  Kazimirov, the Russian president's special envoy, and Colonel  General Georgiy Kondratyev, deputy Russian minister of defense.  The conversation with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan  was held behind closed doors. However, it is known that they  concerned the new peace-making initiative of Russia, which once  again is trying to stop the bloodshed in Nagorno-Karabakh.    The representatives of the Russian leadership also met  Armenian Defense Minister Serzhik Sarkisyan and the Armenian  president's special envoy David Shakhnazaryan. As the Armenian  president's press service has reported, during the course of the  meetings the Armenian side reaffirmed that Yerevan is ready to  assume all its commitments arising from the Moscow protocol.  The conflict has reached a phase where a settlement is  impossible without the introduction of separating forces, the  participants in the conversation at the Armenian president's  office stated.    As reported earlier, at the recent meeting in Moscow of the  Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers with the  participation of a representative of Nagorno-Karabakh, and with  the mediation of the Russian defense minister, it was proposed  to the conflicting sides that there should be a cease-fire and  an end to hostilities from 0000 on 1 March, and also that troops  should be withdrawn from the confrontation line. These points  were sealed in the protocol that was signed.    Russia has done everything in its power, Georgiy Kondratyev  told journalists. "We intended to visit Stepanakert," said the  general, "but bad weather prevented us from going. The Armenian  side was quite constructive and had no questions." According to  the deputy minister, "if the Azerbaijan side does not respond to  this initiative, Russia will suspend its mediatory mission." A  cease-fire is awaited in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and  Azerbaijan and if all sides agree, a mechanism to implement a  cease-fire, worked out by heads of the military directorates at  a Moscow meeting, could be set in motion, Georgiy Kondratyev  said. The general expressed certainty that the agreements will  be respected by both Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. "It is  essential," he said, "that Azerbaijan adopts a similar decision."    This evening, after the meetings in Yerevan, the  representatives of the Russian president went to Baku.</p>

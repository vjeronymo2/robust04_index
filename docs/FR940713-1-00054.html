			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is proposing the value of 40 psi based on SAE J1505,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brake Force Distribution Test Code Commercial Vehicles.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has tentatively determined that the safety problem addressed by the requirement in S5.3.5, i.e., slow heat build up and brake fade caused by long gradual down hill runs at relatively low air pressure, is not a problem for severe brake applications over 40 psi. In formulating this proposal, NHTSA contacted all the major valve manufacturers. Other than Sealco, no other valve manufacturer stated that they had to drill holes in the valve or otherwise modify the valve in a way that might adversely affect their real-world dynamic braking performance in order to comply with the test in S5.3.5. Aside from Sealco, the valve manufacturers believed that the existing test was a realistic, reasonable assessment of low pressure differential performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has tentatively determined that this amendment would facilitate the use of spool valve technology, while not being detrimental to safety. The agency's primary concern in these rulemakings addressing control line pressure differentials is brake performance in the low end of the air pressure range since the vast majority of stopping occurs there. Specifically, in the August 1992 rule, the agency sought to improve low end brake performance with respect to slow heat build up and brake fading brought about by relatively low brake applications during long gradual downhill descents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After further review, the agency now believes that the current requirement may unnecessarily extend the 2 psi requirement into the higher pressure ranges where it is not necessary for safety. As noted above, the requirement is designed to prevent brake fade during relatively low brake applications below 20 psi and is not applicable to hard brake applications, i.e., those exceeding 40 psi. Accordingly, the agency has tentatively decided to modify the differential requirements at levels over 40 psi. Notwithstanding the agency's tentative conclusion, the agency request comments about whether this amendment poses any risk of adverse safety consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, NHTSA disagrees with Sealco's statements that the test procedure in S5.3.5 does not simulate actual braking conditions. The agency notes that this test procedure was based on the agency's own testing and extensive test data and recommendations by trailer manufacturers in response to previous agency proposals. Specifically, the agency disagrees with Sealco's statement that ``Slow and fast ascending and descending control line pressures should be used to check CLV performance.'' As discussed in earlier notices, NHTSA sought pressure rises and decays that were neither too fast nor too slow. As trailer manufacturers and other commenters to the earlier proposal stated, if the pressure rise were too slow, test personnel would waste time waiting for the event to occur, and if the pressure rise were too rapid, pressure differentials could not be read quickly enough. In addition, pressure surges from a fast rate would likely result in a loss of normal valve hysteresis and subsequent errors in crack pressure readings. Accordingly, the agency believes that the test accurately evaluates real-world dynamic braking without creating any significant negative safety effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is not ``significant'' within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. A full regulatory evaluation is not required because the rule, if adopted, would have no mandatory effects. Instead, the proposal would permit spool valve technology. Therefore, this rulemaking would not have any cost impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this action on small entities. Based upon this evaluation, I certify that the proposed amendment would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle and brake manufacturers typically would not qualify as small entities. This amendment would affect small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units to the extent that these entities purchase vehicles. However, this amendment would not have any cost impact on vehicles. For these reasons, vehicle manufacturers, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which purchase motor vehicles would not be significantly affected by the proposed requirements. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. No State laws would be affected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the agency has considered the environmental implications of this proposed rule in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and determined that the proposed rule would not significantly affect the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 U.S.C. 30111), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 105 of the Act (49 U.S.C. 30161) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

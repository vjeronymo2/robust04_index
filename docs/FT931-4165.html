			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / Crisis meeting at fishing federation THE NATIONAL Federation of Fishermen's Organisations is holding an emergency meeting today on the crisis over fish imports. Fishermen and dock workers at Grimsby last night mounted a 24-hour blockade to prevent cheap Russian and Norwegian fish arriving. The federation has written to Russian and Norwegian fishing organisations threatening a full-scale land and sea blockade of British ports if the imports do not stop. In the last few days, cargoes of Russian and French fish have been turned back or destroyed at ports around Britain.</p>

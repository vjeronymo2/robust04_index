			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Technology: Dial M for meters - A look at a trial scheme to measure water and energy consumption by telephone From the beginning of next year, telephones in the office and in the home could be leaking information about our lives as we sleep. The information they will relay is likely to concern our energy consumption and how much water we use, and the callers they will be 'talking to' will be the utilities that bill customers for these services. Up to 150 residents in Doncaster, in the north of England, are taking part in a trial in which their telephones are used to read their electricity and water meters. The trial, which runs until the end of the year, is a joint project between Yorkshire Water, Yorkshire Electricity, British Telecommunications and Schlumberger Industries. The latter supplies the meter interface unit (MIU) which converts the data from the meters to a central database via the telephone network. A subscriber line access controller (Slac) calls the MIU when instructed by the companies' computers to read the meters. Four ports on the MIU enable four different meters to be read. The Yorkshire trial is using just two. The trial uses technology developed by BT which enables the telephone lines to convey data without ringing. The aim is to leave customers blissfully unaware that their telephone lines are involved in any activity. If a customer uses the telephone while the meter is being read, the call from the utility will automatically end. No call from an electricity company will delay a call for an ambulance, for example. The introduction of the no-ring facility, which negates the usual ringing current of normal calls, has required a big investment by BT and involved large-scale infrastructure changes. The costs of installation have been kept down because the facility has been installed at the same time as other BT developments, such as being able to identify a caller. Changes both to the telephone exchanges and the software used in digital exchanges have been implemented. BT plans to install this 'no-ring' facility on most of its 25m lines before the start of next year when it will be available for commercial use. Future applications could include equipment monitoring and control for photocopying machines and a 'home automation' system whereby heating, lighting and security can be checked automatically. But, says Andrew Batchelor, services development manager at BT: 'We are focusing on the utility sector as our first market. This is because the utilities have a more pressing requirement to have some technology available to help them out of a commercial difficulty.' This 'pressing requirement' felt by the water and electricity industries is the need to cut costs before forthcoming large-scale reviews by industry regulators. Both reviews will consider pricing controls and will take into account the companies' ability to cut costs and improve efficiency. The onus after the reviews will be on both industries to prove to investors that they can still increase dividends based, among other things, on continuing to cut costs. The Yorkshire trial is one of a number involving utilities, particularly electricity companies, and automatic meter reading. Joint ventures such as the one in Yorkshire also point to a move towards multi-utilities with one company providing both electricity and water. A few smaller multi-utilities in the US are testing the use of telecommunications for meter reading. But Peter Harrie, marketing manager at Schlumberger Industries, says the scale of the potential market in the UK - which has some of the biggest utilities in the world - makes the Yorkshire trial particularly exciting. The City appears to be watching signs of such closer co-operation with great interest. Robert Miller-Bakewell, utilities analyst at NatWest Securities, predicts that there will be seven multi-function utilities in the UK by 1997. 'We will see a move towards more multi-function utilities in the UK, perhaps along the lines of those in the US but probably bigger. One of the things driving this forward is the need to cut costs and eliminate the overlap.' Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett, also foresees closer co-operation at both operating and management levels. 'In terms of billing, for example, telecoms must be in a pole position for utilities.' But there are still a number of questions concerning the cost-effectiveness of automatic metering. The meters used in this system are more expensive than traditional ones and costs will not come down until they are produced and used in bulk. Most industry analysts accept that the 'man in a van' system with an engineer making regular, if infrequent, readings will remain cost-effective until 'special' reads need to be carried out. These include returns to homes where nobody was in or an address changes. Having a qualified member of staff visiting premises has other advantages, although as Harrie says: 'Some people find it difficult arranging a convenient time for their meter to be read and others don't like strange people coming into their homes anyway.' Proponents of the scheme argue that 'added value services' should be added to any cost benefit analysis. For utilities' customers, improvements could include the elimination of estimated bills, immediate informed response on queries and complaints, and flexible tariffing and billing. The electricity industry already sells energy to big industrial users in 30-minute lots that could be accurately gauged with such advanced metering. The system will also enable water companies to detect leaks more easily and to prepare load profiles of customers. A shared billing system between the water and electricity companies could lead to shared information about bad-debt customers. In the Yorkshire trial, each utility has access only to its own meters but the possibility of utilities sharing information is likely to cause alarm. 'This is certainly a complex subject, which is why nobody is rushing into it and why we're having trials to see how customers react to having their phones used in this way,' says Batchelor. 'We're taking this fairly slowly, although we have been impressed by the reaction so far,' he adds. Yorkshire Water is also tentative. 'Our main aim is improving services. We are not doing this purely for the sake of new technology.'</p>

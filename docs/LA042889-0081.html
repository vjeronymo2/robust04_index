			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS HAVE THAT SAME PLAYOFF SPARK;  </P> <P> JOHNSON HAS 30 POINTS IN ROUT OF PORTLAND, 128-108  </P> <P> Little, it seems, has changed. First-round playoff games are still about as  dangerous for the Lakers as the morning shoot-arounds that precede them.  </P> <P> Then again, maybe they are even less hazardous now.  </P> <P> Thursday morning, a railing leading to the locker rooms in the Forum put up  more resistance to onrushing Laker guard Michael Cooper than the Portland Trail  Blazers did to the Lakers in Game 1 of the Western Conference quarterfinals  Thursday night. Cooper required 21 stitches to close a gash on his forehead,  but that was nothing compared to the way  </P> <P> the Lakers tattooed the Trail Blazers in a 128-108 victory before a Forum crowd  of 17,505 that has come to expect as much in playoffs past.  </P> <P> The Lakers have never lost a first-round playoff game since the five-game  series was implemented in 1984. Their 16th consecutive first-round victory may  not have been among their most dominant, but it certainly wasn't the struggle  even some of the Lakers had predicted.  </P> <P> Starting fast, finishing strong and using 30 points from Magic Johnson and 29  from Byron Scott, the Lakers easily dispatched the Trail Blazers, just as they  had done in all five regular-season games and 23 of these teams' last 24  meetings in the Forum.  </P> <P> But, cautious types that they are at this time of the season, the Lakers  weren't about to say that the 20-point victory was reminiscent of previous  first-round blowouts.  </P> <P> "Portland is a tough team, not like some of our other (first-round opponents),"  Coach Pat Riley said. "Give us credit. We came in prepared. When we get to the  playoffs, we really step up our play a notch, and you saw that tonight. This  blowout is nice, but we have to come out and do it again to maintain home-court  advantage. . . . And they'll be back."  </P> <P> The Trail Blazers have to come back for Game 2 Sunday at the Forum. And, the  way the Lakers systematically took Portland out of its strategy in Game 1  certainly gives the Trail Blazers much room for improvement.  </P> <P> Without question, the biggest reason for the Lakers' big victory was the lack  of production by Portland's big men.  </P> <P> Center Kevin Duckworth, harnessed by early foul trouble, fouled out late in the  game with only five points and five rebounds in 21 minutes.  </P> <P> Steve Johnson, Duckworth's main backup, had only five points and four rebounds.  More effective was oft-injured 7-footer Sam Bowie, who had 15 points. But Bowie  did most of his scoring from the perimeter, while the Lakers dominated the  inside game.  </P> <P> The Lakers had a 48-39 rebounding advantage, and their defensive limited drives  to the basket by Clyde Drexler and Jerome Kersey. Drexler still had 30 points  and Kersey 24, but they could not compensate for little production inside.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Lakers were proficient in all aspects. Johnson, hobbled a little  after bumping a knee, not only led the team in scoring but also had 16 assists  and seven rebounds. Scott punched up his total by making five of six  three-point attempts and 10 of 16 overall from the floor.  </P> <P> But production from the Laker backcourt is nothing unusual. It was the  dominating front-line play that made the difference.  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar responded to the playoffs with one of his most effective  games. Abdul-Jabbar scored 11 points and had eight rebounds but, more  important, he played sound defense against Duckworth and drew the Portland  center into foul trouble.  </P> <P> "We've got to play them tough inside," Abdul-Jabbar said. "That's one of the  keys. I think I had a hand in the game. I was more active on defense, clogging  the middle. Kersey and Clyde are tough going to the hoop."  </P> <P> When Abdul-Jabbar wasn't around to stop the Trail Blazers, Mychal Thompson  stymied his former team. Thompson, who was a member of the Trail Blazers when  the teams last met in the playoffs in 1985, made eight of 11 shots for 20  points and had six rebounds.  </P> <P> "Those big guys got in foul trouble early," Thompson said. "For them to win,  their big guys have to be on."  </P> <P> Drexler did the best he could. He made 14 of 27 shots and had nine assists. And  he received help from Kersey, who outscored Laker small forward James Worthy,  24-17.  </P> <P> But the Lakers' tough defense translated into easy baskets via the fast break.  When the Lakers went to their half-court offense, they still shot well, making  55% overall.  </P> <P> Just as they did in the first half, the Lakers had a double-figure lead midway  into the third quarter before a Trail Blazer run cut it to 75-70 after a basket  by Drexler with 5:39 left.  </P> <P> But then Duckworth was called for his fifth foul and left the game, and the  Lakers put away Portland with a 20-6 run in the final five minutes.  </P> <P> Included in the surge were two Johnson free throws coming after technical fouls  were called on Portland Coach Rick Adelman and Kersey in a span of less than a  minute. Both were upset over a perceived inequity in fouls between the teams.  </P> <P> So frustrated were the Trail Blazers after one technical foul that assistant  coach Maurice Lucas, a former Laker, grabbed Cooper's ankle as he was  inbounding the ball.  </P> <P> Cooper shook free, as did the Lakers. They led, 95-76, entering the fourth  quarter and extended it to as many as 22 points on Scott's three-point shot to  open the final quarter. Portland was not heard from again.  </P> <P> Portland did not begrudge the Lakers the victory, but was upset by the  officiating. The Trail Blazers had 26 fouls, the Lakers 22.  </P> <P> "Every time we'd get within striking distance," Drexler said, "there would be a  handful of calls that could have gone either way. The Lakers seem to have  gotten all those calls. They are a good enough team already. They don't need to  be getting all the close calls."  </P> <P> The Lakers, on the other hand, credited their third-quarter surge to tough  defense and their offensive execution.  </P> <P> "We were standing around, but when I came in, we picked up the pace," said  Thompson, who had seven points in the surge. "We have to win this series  because I spend my summers up (in Portland) . . . and I'd have to hear it from  those guys all summer."  </P> <P> Based solely on Thursday night's game, and on the Lakers' first-round history,  Thompson should have no worries.  </P> <P> But the Lakers still are cautious.  </P> <P> "Sunday will be a tougher game," Magic Johnson said. "They'll be more ready."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Robert Kerlan, the Lakers' physician, examined reserve center Mark McNamara's  sprained right ankle before Thursday's game. Laker trainer Gary Vitti said that  McNamara is on schedule to return in another two weeks. "I think we'll get him  back by (the second round of the playoffs)," Vitti said. McNamara has yet to  run on the ankle. He is undergoing electronic stimulation and ultrasound  therapy and rides and exercise bicycle to try to maintain fitness.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS HAVE GOOD TIME, ROUT SIDEKICKS  </P> <P> There was a buzz in the Sports Arena throughout the Sockers' 8-2 victory over  the Dallas Sidekicks Friday night.  </P> <P> Maybe it was because of Waad Hirmez, who returned to town and kissed the floor  when he was introduced before the game, then helped floor Dallas with a  third-quarter goal that made it 4-0.  </P> <P> Or maybe it was because of Victor Nogueira, who returned to the lineup after  his wife gave birth to a girl Thursday and made three of the better saves of  the year, robbing Richard Chinapoo late in the third quarter and stopping Mark  Karpun on two breakaways in the fourth.  </P> <P> Probably though, it was just the appearance of the Sidekicks that had everybody  feeling good. The Sockers always seem to play their best when Dallas is in  town, and on this night it was no different as the Sockers dominated every  phase in front of 8,845 fans.  </P> <P> Hirmez, who spent the first half of the season with the Los Angeles Lazers,  sparked an evening's worth of home-town entertainment when he knelt on his  knees and kissed the floor during the pregame introductions.  </P> <P> "That's how much I missed San Diego," Hirmez said. "I was so happy to be back."  </P> <P> The crowd, which seemed happy to have him back, went wild and then never really  had a chance to settle down after that.  </P> <P> Branko Segota scored just 5:45 into the first quarter when he surprised  Sidekicks' goalkeeper Krys Sobieski by directing a re-start kick on goal.  </P> <P> Sobieski was screened when Segota's shot arrived and had no chance to prevent  the Sockers from taking a 1-0 lead.  </P> <P> Segota scored again 6 minutes later when he collected Ralph Black's shot off  the boards and drilled home a rebound.  </P> <P> Segota, who now has 23 goals -- only one fewer than Zoran Karic, the team  leader -- didn't play in the second half because of a bruised right thigh. It's  unclear whether he will be able to play Sunday night against Los Angeles.  </P> <P> It was clear that the Sockers' didn't really need him in the second half  anyway.  </P> <P> Chris Chueden scored to make it 3-0, and then Hirmez struck a shot from the  right boards that banked in off the far post.  </P> <P> Hirmez, who scored three goals in first game back in a Socker uniform Thursday  night in Los Angeles, ran to the boards and slapped high-fives with some fans  after this one, his 15th of the season.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Alan Willey scored twice and even Paul Dougherty -- shut  out at home since Jan. 2 -- scored once as the Sockers continued to have a good  time.  </P> <P> With eight goals as a backup, Nogueira did not need to be at his best Friday,  but he was anyway.  </P> <P> Every chance Dallas had of catching up were snuffed out. The Sidekicks, who  failed to get a shot in the second quarter, put together some good second-half  efforts but rarely produced.  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Cacho suffered a pulled left hamstring in the Sockers' 10-9 loss to Los Angeles  Thursday night and is expected to be out two to four weeks. . . . Midfielder  Brian Quinn, who suffered a strained left arch more than a month ago, said  he'll be back this season, but he doesn't know exactly when. "It's just hard to  say," Quinn said. "It doesn't feel to bad, but I just can't play yet." . . .  Tatu, the Dallas' Sidekicks' leading scorer, missed Friday night's game with a  sprained right shoulder. . . . Gordon Jago, the only coach the Sidekicks have  had since the franchise was formed in 1984, also missed the game, but that's  because it has been reported he will soon become the team's new president,  replacing David Shutte. Sidekick assistant Billy Phillips, who is rumored to be  Jago's replacement, coached the Sidekicks' in Jago's absence Friday night. . .  . The Sockers will play the Los Angeles Lazers Sunday at 6:05 in the Sports  Arena, then won't return home until March 10 to meet league-leading Baltimore.  </P></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / People: Nader Sultan to run Kuwait Petroleum Nader Sultan, one of Kuwait's most experienced international oilmen, is to leave the chairmanship of the London-based Kuwait Petroleum International to become deputy chairman of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which manages the Gulf state's oil exploration, production, refining and transportation. KPI, which is an affiliate of KPC, runs Kuwait's network of Q8 petrol stations and the state's European refining operations. Sultan's appointment will make him the most senior oil executive in Kuwait. It follows last month's resignation of Abdulrazak Mulla Hussein, who left the deputy chairmanship of KPC over differences in oil policy with Ali al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister. KPC has used Hussein's departure to expand the board, appointing also Siham Rizouki, previously an assistant undersecretary at the oil ministry and a familiar member of Kuwait's Opec delegations, and one of the most senior women in the oil industry, as managing director of KPC administration, finance and foreign relations. Suleiman al-Omani will also join the KPC board from the oil ministry. Ali Al-Mousa, deputy governor of Kuwait's central bank, and Farouk al Nouri, from the foreign ministry, will add to the expanded board.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (1): Changes of emphasis - Bank lending last year fell because of the economic slowdown and the prospect of new rules on capital adequacy. The vacuum has been partly filled by the bond markets, which grew dramatically during the 1980s TWO FACTS stand out from the shifting patterns of international capital flows on the financial map: the crumbling of international bank credit, and the expansion of bond markets. The fall-off in bank lending reached a critical stage last year. For the first time since records began, international bank lending actually contracted. Cross-border lending fell by 1 per cent, or Dollars 102bn. This was all the more notable, given that it followed six years in which bank lending had grown by more than 10 per cent a year, The reasons for retrenchment in the banking industry have been well-rehearsed. Banks around the world need to bolster their resources ahead of new rules on capital adequacy, developed by the Basle Committee of banking supervision, which come into force from the end of this year. That has involved concentrating on profits and cutting back lending undertaken at unrealistically tight margins during the 1980s. At the same time, the worldwide economic slowdown and a near-collapse in property values in several major economies have hit bank balance sheets hard. The effect has been most marked in Japan, where falling share prices, a property collapse and a slowing economy have combined to deliver a nasty shock to a banking industry which had grown bloated on cheap deposits. By the end of 1991, Japanese banks accounted for 31 per cent of outstanding international bank loans, well down from the peak of 38 per cent in 1988. In spite of this retrenchment, there are few signs of a credit crunch. Economic slowdown has so far stunted the demand for new credit. In its latest annual report, the Bank for International Settlements, the international bankers' club, blames high debt levels in the private sector for the retrenchment. 'In most countries the credit slowdown appears to have reflected more a decline in demand for borrowing than an inordinate reluctance of markets to grant credit,' it concludes. Small and medium-sized companies, whose access to credit has been cut off most sharply, may not agree with this relatively sanguine view of credit conditions. Also, fears remain about the extent to which banks would be able and willing to finance any revival in the world economy. Part of the vacuum left by banks has been filled by the bond markets. The growth of the international bond market was one of the most notable financial phenomena of the 1980s, as private sector borrowers in particular moved outside the narrow contraints of their domestic capital markets in search of the cheapest possible borrowing. By the end of the decade, companies had tapped the international bond market for the equivalent of more than a fifth of their total bond market borrowings. The bond markets paused briefly after 1986, as banks seemingly strove to outdo each other in financing the dizzying rise in property markets and the leveraged buy-out craze in the US. Now, though, bond market lending has returned to its sharp upward course: in 1991, new international bond financing (net of redemptions) jumped to Dollars 171bn, up from Dollars 132bn the year before. That pace has been sustained so far this year, with the rate at which new bonds are being issued slightly above that in the first part of 1991. The debt overhang of the 1980s overshadows much of this activity. The bond markets have been pressed into service to help refinance expiring bond issues, reckoned to amount to some Dollars 190bn this year, with a further Dollars 270bn due next year. A quarter of this is accounted for by equity-linked issues, which provided a steady and cheap source of capital for Japanese companies while the good times lasted. High long-term interest rates have helped to attract investors to the bond markets. US dollar bond rates have stayed high, despite successive reductions in shorter term interest rates to give a boost to the flagging economy, while European rates have been held at a high level by the Bundesbank's attempts to halt the escalation of Germany's money supply. Those conditions look likely to remain constant for the foreseeable future. Stock markets, meanwhile, have staged their own side-show as international equity investment has picked up - though market conditions have deteriorated rapidly in recent weeks. Little more than six months ago, international investors still believed that Japanese share prices had reached rock bottom. Foreign money poured into the Tokyo stock market - around Dollars 47bn in all in 1991. Other major stockmarkets also experienced a new wave of foreign investment, reversing the trend of the previous year, when foreign participation had shrunk in all areas except the European Community. As share prices have lifted, US companies have taken the opportunity to become net sellers of shares for the first time since 1983. In the intervening years, stock repurchases and leveraged buy-outs had persistently eaten away at US companies' balance sheets, and they were quick to come back to the stock market to try to repair some of the damage when the time was ripe. Circumstances have now changed. In the first five months of this year international equity offerings reached Dollars 11bn, higher than the same period in 1991, as a growing number of US companies added international tranches to their stock issues. Latin American issuers also returned in greater numbers both to the international equity and debt markets. But, led by US fund managers, investors have since become increasingly wary of current stock market valuations, and issuing volume has fallen off as a result. The boom in international securities markets - and the continuing strong growth in allied derivatives markets - have made it a profitable period for many bankers and brokers. However, two factors suggest that the future is likely to get considerably tougher. One is the over-capacity in the financial sector, which has persisted well beyond the boom years of the 1980s. The other is the increasing attention of regulators, concerned to get better control of fast-moving international markets. The excess capacity in some parts of the securities industry has been apparent for half a decade, since the deregulation of national markets cut off many intermediaries' traditional sources of profit. Japanese securities firms are under the severest pressure to retrench, having seen commissions on domestic deals - the fuel that has kept their massive corporate machines running - dry up. US securities houses, which until recently were enjoying one of their best-ever periods, also face a difficult time as equity issues tail off and uncertainty takes hold of the markets. A consolidation in the securities industry could be hastened by new capital adequacy rules. Capital regulations have already helped to precipitate a retrenchment and mergers in the banking industry. Securities regulators are still in the process of hammering out their own international framework, but their work looks set to produce tougher rules for many brokers, forcing many to think again about whether they should stay in the business. London, an international centre which has made a virtue of its less arduous capital regime, could be one of the biggest losers. Regulators are also trying belatedly to get to grips with the lightly regulated (and little understood) derivatives markets. The proliferation of new financial instruments and the sharp escalation in derivatives trading (in many cases overtaking trading in the underlying securities) have left the authorities groping for new ways of regulating financial markets. They face at least three problems: Some financial instruments are understood only by a handful of people. That raises questions about the ability of financial institutions correctly to assess and manage their risks. It is difficult to assess sometimes where risks in financial markets ultimately lie. Many of the instruments created to shift risk from one institution to another have not been tested in a liquidation, and netting arrangements for some markets (such as swaps) are open to question. Much of this new activity is happening in private, as custom-made financial products increasingly replace exchange-traded instruments. These problems are well understood by regulators. What is not clear yet, though, is what they are going to do about it.</p>

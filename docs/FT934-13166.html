			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Sweden to raise Dollars 1bn through seven-year global FRN issue THE irreversible trend towards a global bond market gathered momentum yesterday when the Kingdom of Sweden announced its intention to raise at least Dollars 1bn through a three-year issue of global floating-rate notes (FRNs). Several sovereign borrowers have issued FRNs in the Eurobond market this year but Sweden's forthcoming deal, which will be jointly led by Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan, marks the first sovereign global FRN offering. The joint leads of Sweden's deal said that demand among international investors for FRNs was firmly established. In addition, there was growing interest among domestic US investors for this kind of paper in view of the perception that US interest rates were close to the bottom of their cycle. The joint leads declined to comment on the pricing of the notes, but the market expects Sweden to achieve an all-in cost of five or six basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Among yesterday's issues, two banks took advantage of continued investor demand for high-yielding paper to raise subordinated debt in the Eurobond market. HSBC Holdings raised lower tier-two capital through a Dollars 250m issue of collared FRNs due 2008 while Societe Generale raised upper tier-two capital through a Pounds 100m issue of undated Eurobonds. However, both issues are likely to be called in 2003, given the penal nature of the step-up which comes into effect in that year. The structure of HSBC's issue enabled the bank to make the most effective use of capital under international banking guidelines. Rather than starting to be amortised after five years, the structure allows the entire proceeds of the issue to count as capital for 10 years. In addition, HSBC achieved an all-in cost of funds of Libor plus 40 to 50 basis points, which represented a big improvement since March when it paid Libor plus 100 basis points for 10-year funds raised in the US domestic market. HSBC's bonds pay six-month Libor minus 25 basis points, but since Libor is currently at 3 1/4 per cent, investors will receive the minimum interest rate on the notes of 5 per cent. Elsewhere, the recent flow of Euroconvertible bond issues from emerging markets continued as Reliance Industries, India's largest private-sector company, raised Dollars 125m through an issue of six-year convertible bonds. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the issue was already several times oversubscribed and there was strong demand from foreign institutions who have permission from the Indian government to invest directly in Indian companies.</p>

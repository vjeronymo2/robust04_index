			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Civil rights group suffers fresh blow The reputation of one of the oldest and most illustrious US civil rights organisations was further damaged yesterday by details of an out-of-court settlement of sexual harassment charges brought against its director. According to reports in both the New York Times and the Baltimore Sun, the Rev Benjamin Chavis last year committed the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People to pay up to Dollars 332,400 in damages without informing the NAACP's board and its legal counsel. The plaintiff, Ms Mary Stansel, who briefly worked for the organisation last year, is now additionally suing Mr Chavis and the NAACP for breach of part of the out-of-court settlement under which she would be found a job elsewhere paying at least Dollars 80,000 a year. Several NAACP board members were quoted as saying that they knew nothing of the settlement and subsequent suit and that nothing was communicated about either at the organisation's annual convention in Chicago earlier this month. Lawyers for Mr Chavis said he denied the sexual harassment charges and he had reached the settlement under duress and in order to preserve his reputation. Good faith attempts were made to find Ms Stansel another job, but she either failed to turn up for interviews or overstated her qualifications, one said. Mr Chavis was elected executive director of the 85-year-old NAACP in April last year. He took over an organisation with a membership of only about 500,000, less than half that of 30 years earlier, and with current debts estimated at about Dollars 3m. It was also deeply split between traditional moderate integrationists and outspoken black nationalists. This came to a head early in June when Mr Chavis invited Rev Louis Farrakhan, militant head of the Nation of Islam, to participate in a 'black summit'.</p>

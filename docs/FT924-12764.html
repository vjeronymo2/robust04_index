			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Credit card APRs to include fees CONSUMERS will soon be able to make more accurate comparisons among credit card company charges following a deal between leading card suppliers. The Association for Payment Clearing Services said it had agreed a method to allow consumers to take into account the effect that up-front charges on credit cards have on annual percentage rates (APR), the interest rate paid on outstanding balances. The differences arose when annual fees were first introduced on credit cards almost three years ago. Before then the annual cost of a card was simply the monthly interest rate compounded over 12 months.</p>

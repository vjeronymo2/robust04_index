But it cannot afford this now  because it has no financial means," Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said.    Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his  visit to the United States in New York City on Monday, Kravchuk  said that the termination of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine may  worsen the economic crisis in the republic and cause a social  explosion.    "We did not stop holding talks with the Russian side on this  issue. They have been held on a permanent basis. We have  really no money to pay in hard currency. The paradox is that we  can supply Russia with various manufactured goods for roubles --  for example railway carriages or pipes -- but Russian  enterprises cannot buy them because they themselves have no  money. We cannot earn hard currency either, because Ukraine has  not so far received a quota for exports to the United States.  It's a vicious circle," Kravchuk said.</p>

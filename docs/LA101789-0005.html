			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD STUDENTS  </P> <P> Carol Watson's otherwise excellent story (Part I, Sept. 27) on Stanford  freshman Lupe Vasquez, who came from an Oxnard shelter for the homeless, gives  life to the fading myth that California private education is primarily for the  wealthy and privileged.  </P> <P> By treating Vasquez as an exception to Stanford's "country-club image," and  claiming that "freshmen are as likely to have $2,000 computers as they are to  have notebooks," Watson overlooks a reality of education in California, and at  Stanford in particular: that the best and the brightest of our college students  come from increasingly diverse backgrounds.  </P> <P> More than half of Stanford's entering freshmen need and receive financial aid,  and approximately 100 have parents who are unable to make any contribution  toward the cost of their education. Stanford remains committed to a "needs  blind" admission policy and guarantees that the demonstrated financial need of  all accepted applicants will be met.  </P> <P> MARY BARTLETT  </P> <P> Assistant Director of University  </P> <P> Relations, Stanford University  </P> <P> Southern California Office  </P></p>

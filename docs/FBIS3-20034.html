			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Elisabeth Grona: "Harsh Words About Policy </F> Towards the East: Schori and af Ugglas on a Collision Course in  Riksdag Debate"]    [Excerpt] Who is playing Russian roulette with Swedish  foreign policy?    The government is with its Baltic policy and its talk of the  need for shock therapy for Russia, replied Pierre Schori (Social  Democratic Party [SDP]).    Pierre Schori is, with his talk of missile attacks on  Belgrade and his quotes from confidential telegrams from Moscow,  said Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas (Moderate Party).    Wednesday's [23 February] foreign policy debate in the  Riksdag turned into a tense showdown between af Ugglas and her  challenger for the foreign minister's position after this fall's  elections. Schori called for an active Swedish policy in the  former Yugoslavia but more thought regarding the Baltic and  Russia. Margaretha af Ugglas emphasized consultation with other  countries on the war in the Balkans but advocated an active  policy in the Baltic.  <H5>  Political Burden </H5>   Schori quoted from a report from Orjan Berner, the Swedish  ambassador in Moscow, who warned the government about economic  and foreign policy advice to the Russians. Given the current  uncertain situation, each comment could become a political  burden for Sweden.    "Where is the gentleness and the care when Schori quotes  from  confidential documents?" the foreign minister wondered.    This year's foreign policy review was dominated by the  European Union [EU], the war in Bosnia, and developments in  Russia and the Baltic. The government made a clear distinction  between its policies and a former foreign policy line:    "What we want to achieve is an arrangement that has freedom  and democracy as its foundation. The many attempts during the  Cold War to create detente and cooperation across blocs were all  based on conceptions of coexistence between systems with freedom  and lack of freedom."    However, developments in Russia, especially talk of "the  country next door," are cause for uneasiness:    "We can now understand tendencies toward a return to a more  traditional model of tensions," the foreign minister said as she  spoke in some detail about the Baltic countries. The alleged  abuses of human rights there are baseless, she said:    "Protestations to the contrary serve no constructive purpose  but rather risk being seen as pieces in a power policy."  <H5>  Seeks Generosity </H5>   At the same time, she counseled those countries to be  generous towards their minorities. And, as Carl Bildt before  her, the foreign policy review pointed to an active policy  towards the East:    "We can never sit by indifferently when there are  developments that carry threats against either Russia's  democracy or the independence of the Baltic states."    Schori accused the government of "diplomatic conformity and  political passivity" in foreign policy. Gone are the creativity  and the determination, he said, taking the former Yugoslavia as  his first example:    "That must be the area closest to our hearts and the main  goal of our actions."    But, on the other hand, with respect to Russia and the  Baltic, Schori would like to see more thought and consultation:    "It is more urgent than ever before to put simplified  notions  about shock therapy behind us. The government cannot privatize  policy towards the East."    Schori went on to criticize the government for lacking the  determination to put effort into a Swedish seat on the Security  Council and for providing support to the East that was  squandered and uncoordinated. On the whole he saw foreign policy  as an extension of domestic policy, even on the issue of the  European Union:    "It is hard to expect that a government that is trying to  disarm Sweden socially will work on behalf of social rearmament  in Brussels."    "Schori's tone is pathetic," Margaretha af Ugglas replied.  "Where are the alternatives?"    Schori referred to Liberal Party criticism of "impotence" in  Bosnia and "distance from the slaughter in Bosnia."  <H5>  Broad Consensus </H5>   Instead Daniel Tarschys (Liberal Party), the chairman of the  standing committee on foreign policy, emphasized the large  measure of partisan political consensus on the issue of  Yugoslavia. And Par Granstedt (Center Party), who took part in  his last foreign policy debate, wondered why the Social  Democrats want to have a confrontation over foreign policy.    Schori replied saying that the center parties, unlike the  Moderates, stand for traditional Swedish foreign policy.    Invite Zhirinovskiy here and tell him that we will not stand  by passively and see Russia threaten the Baltic, Christer Winden  (New Democracy) suggested.    "Trying, through EU membership, to create a European  security  arrangement is the worst way to respond to a Russian threat,"  said Bertil Mabrink (Left Party). "That just makes Russia more  uncertain."  <H5>  Quotations of an Unusual Sort </H5>   Pierre Schori will probably go down in history as the first  person to have read from a letter to the foreign minister from a  Swedish ambassador in an important neighboring country in the  Riksdag's chambers.    What Schori quoted to the chamber and foreign ambassadors  from the speaker's lectern was a handwritten letter to Foreign  Minister Margaretha af Ugglas dated 5 January of this year from  the Swedish ambassador to Moscow, Orjan Berner.    In a longer report, Berner summarized his assessment of the  current situation in Russia and gave the foreign minister seven  pieces of advice, sources at the Cabinet Office and Ministries  told TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA.    Piece of advice number seven, the last one in the letter,  alluded to Prime Minister Carl Bildt's statement about the need  for more shock and less therapy in Russia. Schori quoted  Ambassador Berner's assessment.    "Exercise caution about talking about any economic policy  advice. No matter how right and legal the shock therapy warnings  may be, they are a political burden." [passage omitted]</p>

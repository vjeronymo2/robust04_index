Particular attention is given to checking foreign currency  and electronic and electrical goods at the Iraqi crossing point  into Jordan at Tirbil in the wake of a dramatic plunge in the  value of the Iraqi dinar since early this year, they said.    In many cases vehicles carrying diplomatic plates are also  searched thoroughly before being allowed out, they said.    Iraqi nationals carrying foreign currency with them into the  country also face similar problems, they said.    "There does not appear to be any hard and fast rule for the  amount of foreign currency one could carry while he or she goes  in," said an Iraqi source. "Sometimes even small amounts are  seized from travellers."    "On the other hand, many businessmen appear not to have any  serious problems," added the source.    Beyond that, however, are stricter measures aimed at  preventing imported products leaving Iraq territory, the sources  said.    "Every piece of baggage is checked very throughly and  anything that raises doubts that it could be used for commercial  purposes is confiscated at the border poknt before the traveller  leaves Iraq," said an Iraqi source.    A traveller reported that two of three Irqi-made leather  jackets he was carrying were seized at the border. "They said  they could permit only one for personal use," the traveller told  the JORDAN TIMES.    In another case, a foreign journalist who had carried with  him extra lenses and other camera accessories on an assignment  in Iraq reported that he was not allowed to take them out.    "I had registered my cameras when I went in, but did not  bother to do so with the lenses and some other accessories,"  said the photographer. "On my way out, they said I could carry  only the cameras and confiscated the lenses and accessories,  saying I could not prove I had taken them with me when I went  in. Intervention by Iraqi officials in Baghdad did not help  either."    According to experts on Iraqi economy and the government  approaches to imports and exports, Baghdad appeared to be  concerned that it would have to spend massive amounts in foreign  exchange for imports to meet local demands as and when the  sanctions are lifted. And, as such, It wants to retrain whatever  remains in the country, they said.    Border officials on the Jordanian side said they were  finding  fewer cases of smuggling and fewer items that are subject to  Jordanian customs regulations in travellers baggage.    "We used to find many travellers, both Iraqis and others,  carrying foreign-made cameras, watches, perfumes, electronic  equipment, etc., and most of the time levy customs on them,"  said an official. "These days the flow of such items seems to  have dried up."    According to Iraqi sources, the Baghdad government wants to  check people trying to take out electronic and electric goods  that the country imported prior to the imposition of the  sanctions in August 1990.    A massive quantity of such products also ended up in the  Iraqi market from Kuwait which remained under Iraqi occupation  between August 1990 and March 1991.    The Iraqi source noted that Iraqi rules in force for many  years prevent the outflow of goods imported into Iraq without  prior government permission, but that the regulations were  enforced with relative laxity until recently.    "Now, the rules are enforced to the letter," said the  source.  "Only those with wasta (connection with influential officials)  are an exception."</p>

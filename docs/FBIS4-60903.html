			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin commentary: "`Press Asked Not to Worry'"] </F>   [Text] The Media Disputes Tribunal set up four months ago  in accordance with the Russian Federation president's edict is  designed, according to Paragraph 4 of the statute on it, to  "help ensure the objectivity and accuracy of reporting in the  mass media that touches on public interests." The pretext for  the latest session of the tribunal, which was attended by  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent, was the article carried in  one of the March issues of EKSPRESS-GAZETA entitled "But  People...Live!" devoted to the material and organizational  provision for State Duma deputies. The lower house of  parliament considered this newspaper article to be libelous.  The State Duma's Legal Administration sent a statement to the  tribunal attesting to the inaccuracy of the EKSPRESS-GAZETA  article.    I. Zablotskiy, a staffer at the Legal Administration,  referred in his statement to the Interim Statute on Ensuring the  Activities of State Duma Deputies (it was published in  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 29 January), which stipulated the rights and  privileges that deputies may enjoy. There was no mention of  dachas, foreign trips, or personal physicians -- as  EKSPRESS-GAZETA had reported.    G. Dyakonov, leader of the Duma Press Center, who spoke  after  I. Zablotskiy, talked about breaches of professional standards  by the EKSPRESS-GAZETA journalists, who had failed to check  their facts.    For their part, the respondents, representing the  newspaper's  founders -- the "Komsomolskaya Pravda" Joint-Stock Company and  the "Segodnya" Limited Partnership -- tried to use different  arguments. They said that the article "But People...Live!" had  used facts borrowed from other newspapers.    But Tribunal Chairman A. Vengerov and the tribunal members  deemed these explanations unconvincing. First, EKSPRESS-GAZETA  had not indicated the sources of the information it had cited.  Moreover, the quoting was inaccurate and not verbatim, and the  facts -- lifted from various publications and collated --  created a distorted impression of deputies.    The article "But People...Live!" was deemed inaccurate and  unobjective, and a crude breach of legal and technical norms.  The newspaper's founders were instructed to relieve A.  Kupriyanov of his duties as chief editor.    We have no grounds to leap to A. Kupriyanov's defense.  Nonetheless, we are doing so, because, in our view, the Media  Disputes Tribunal is turning more and more into a kind of  censorship organ -- a prototype of the notorious "troika" --  where it is becoming the rule not to listen to the accused  party. That was the case at the hearings on the article "Buds  Swelling. For a Putsch?" in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. The tribunal  condemned the statement from the Russian Federation Press  Committee without even inviting a representative to attend.  Moreover, in a phone call to the chief editor of ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA, A. Vengerov said that they did not consider it necessary  to invite committee workers to attend, the statement was  sufficient....    The Statute on the Tribunal (Paragraph 12) states that it is  entitled to reprimand a journalist who violates generally  accepted ethical norms, and "in the event of their violating the  legislation on the mass media, to raise the question before the  relevant organ (leader) of established legislative proceedings  being instituted against them." As we can see, there is no  mention here of the tribunal's right to recommend the removal of  the chief editor. And the tribunal was conceived so as to  ensure that its activity would be based on moral and ethical  grounds, without being a substitute for judicial and legal  organs.    It is probably no accident that in its 4 February issue  IZVESTIYA allowed itself to voice some doubts about the  tribunal's good intentions: "....under certain circumstances  the tribunal is also able to pursue a line of actually  restricting press freedom."    At the hearing the EKSPRESS-GAZETA representatives suggested  that it had been decided to begin with them so as to "stifle"  the yellow press. A. Vengerov brushed this aside, claiming that  there was no intention to "stifle" anyone and, in general, he  did not want to listen to such arguments.    Nonetheless, has not the tribunal's ruling turned out to be  far too politicized? The hearing saw the use of what was, to my  mind, a very symptomatic phrase -- "our patience is exhausted."    It has to be admitted that even the tone of the tribunal's  ruling was surprising. It used the word "mockery" three times  and the journalists were rebuked for their "basic ignorance" and  their "unacceptable presentational style." I may not have to  read this kind of ruling very often, but I would like to see a  suitable tone of gravitas from such an important institution.    The tribunal is meant to settle media disputes. At the last  hearing there was no dispute as such -- it was clearly one-way  traffic. You could not help getting the feeling that you were  present at the birth of a media tribunal that had taken on all  the "best" punitive traditions of agitprop.</p>

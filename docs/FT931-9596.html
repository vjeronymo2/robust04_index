			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon bids for Drayton Asia EFM DRAGON Trust, an Asian investment trust managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, has made a bid for Drayton Asia Trust, a similar concern managed by Invesco MIM which is almost twice its size. Invesco MIM did not comment on the bid, which follows last year's payment of Pounds 9.5m in compensation to shareholders in another investment trust, Drayton Consolidated. The bid is for the whole of Drayton Asia's share capital and warrants. The terms are complex, and involve EFM Dragon offering to issue ordinary shares at fully diluted net asset value in exchange for Drayton Asia's ordinary shares at a rate equivalent to 96.4 per cent of the latter's formula asset value. EFM Dragon is also offering to issue three 2005 warrants for every Drayton Asia warrant. Mr Iain Watt, EFM's managing director, said the aim was to increase EFM Dragon's size, making it the largest UK investment trust for Asia, and benefit from economies of scale. He pointed out that EFM's share price performance has been better than Drayton Asia's, with growth over the three years to the beginning of this month of 35.43 per cent, compared with growth of only 0.79 per cent by Drayton Asia, according to Micropal. EFM is also offering to pay half of the compensation fees to Invesco MIM for loss of the management contract. The other half, equivalent to two year's notice, would come from Drayton Asia shareholders. EFM claims irrevocable undertakings from 13.6 per cent of Drayton Asia's issued share capital and 1.6 per cent of the warrants. It had received letters of intent from 21.4 per cent of the share capital and 16.5 per cent of the warrants.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: GM misses production target GENERAL Motors, which has been involved in a shake-up of its supplier network over the past 18 months, said yesterday that its third-quarter US production would be 70,000 vehicles below earlier estimates because of problems fitting new parts into its models, writes Martin Dickson. The company estimated in July that its production of cars and trucks would total 845,000 units in the quarter but it said yesterday that it expected to manufacture 775,000 units. It said the drop was not due to weaker demand for its vehicles. Analysts said the shortfall could hit its third-quarter financial results and make it harder to achieve its goal of breaking even in North America this year on an operating basis after several years of heavy losses. The problems seem due in part to the shake-up in GM's relations with parts suppliers which was set in motion last year by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the executive who quit GM earlier this year to join Volkswagen of Germany. The two companies are embroiled in a legal battle over GM's accusations that Mr Lopez and other defectors of Volkswagen took with them sensitive company documents. Mr Lopez, in an attempt to slash GM's parts purchasing costs, forced many suppliers to renegotiate contracts at short notice. Suppliers warned that this could have a knock-on effect on GM production in the model year just started. GM said yesterday that the problems could not be attributed to the cost-cutting process, 'which is sound and is working'. However, GM acknowledged that its vehicles would contain 20,000 new parts this year, significantly higher than previous years.</p>

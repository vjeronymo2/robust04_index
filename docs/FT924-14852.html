			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Abortion referendum bound to be divisive: Even the Irish cabinet is in deep disagreement over the issue THE IRISH government's decision to submit the country's constitutional ban on abortion to a referendum in December promises a stormy and divisive political debate over the next two months. Deep disagreement over the issue is reflected at cabinet level, within the main political parties, and down to the family dinner table. After six months of deliberation on the issue, the government announced on Tuesday that a referendum would be held on December 3. The electorate will be asked if they approve of the right of women to travel abroad for an abortion, if women should be entitled to obtain information on how to go about this, and whether abortion should be made available within Ireland under exceptional circumstances (this has been euphemistically termed the 'substantive issue'). Within the cabinet Mr Des O'Malley, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in the coalition, warned earlier this week that the 'substantive issue' should be dealt with by legislation and not a referendum, as it would be too politically divisive at a time when key decisions on Northern Ireland and the economy will also have to be taken. The Northern Ireland round-table talks face a deadline of November 16 to come up with a new legislative framework for the province, and if any workable accommodation is to be reached with the Ulster Unionists this will inevitably require a commitment by the Irish government to drop the Republic's territorial claim. The claim is enshrined in the constitution and any change to it will trigger stiff opposition from hardline nationalists. On the economic front, the government is facing an unprecedented jobs crisis, with unemployment at 21 per cent, exacerbated by sterling's recent devaluation, and is struggling to maintain the punt within the ERM. Devaluation would leave Ireland without an economic policy. However, under pressure from the pro-life campaigners within his Fianna Fail party who want to air the abortion issue after a controversial Supreme Court ruling last March, Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, decided to submit the idea of limited abortion in Ireland to a vote. The Supreme Court ruling, in approving an abortion for a 14-year-old rape victim, in effect established the right to abortion in Ireland for women who face a threat to their lives, including the threat of suicide. But the country's top judges also concluded that where such a threat to the life of the mother does not exist, then pregnant women seeking an abortion abroad can legally be prevented from doing so. The ruling deeply upset both the pro- and anti-abortion lobbies, forcing the government into a commitment last April that legislation and/or a referendum would be forthcoming by the end of the year. The Catholic Church Bishops said in March: 'Abortion has now been declared legal in Ireland. . .experience has shown that laws permitting abortion even in restricted circumstances rapidly lead to abortion on demand. A particularly urgent challenge now faces our legislators as they seek to exercise their responsibility to protect the lives of unborn children.'</p>

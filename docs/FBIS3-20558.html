			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by WEN HUI BAO reporters Wang Jienan (3769 2212 </F> 0589) and Lu Zhengming (7120 2973 2494) from Beijing: "1994: A  Battle Has Begun To Tackle the Most Difficult Problems in  Reform; The Key Solution Is To Establish New Systems--Prospects  of This Year's Economic Reform Viewed by Economists in the  Capital"]    [Text] The year 1994 will be a "foundation-laying" year for  the edifice of the socialist market economy in China. According  to economists, in the 1980's, which were marked by the single  traditional planned economy, any reforming effort, even if  superficial, could produce some results. In contrast, the reform  in the 1990's is conducted in a double-track environment, where  it is necessary to coordinate the reform measures and deepen the  reform drive under the friction of two coexisting systems.  Compared with the former, the reform in the 1990's is harder and  has greater resistance. As economists point out, it is  confronted with striking difficulties:    One of the difficulties is the placement of surplus  personnel  laid off by enterprises, especially old enterprises--a problem  caused by "unemployment during the transitional period" in the  reform of the enterprise system. Economists opine that the  transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned  enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system  both mean the acceleration of job rearrangement, which will  inevitably result in the layoff of some employees. It is,  therefore, necessary to make an unremitting effort to build a  job market. However, under the present circumstances where work  units distribute public housing, retirement pension, and price  subsidy to their employees and pay their medical and health-care  bills and where an unemployment relief fund system has yet to be  established by the government, the following questions have  arisen: How should we, on the one hand, solve the problem of  overstaffing of state-owned enterprises through the bankruptcy  procedure or by the mechanism of keeping the superior and  eliminating the inferior and, on the other hand, properly place  the surplus personnel and ensure their well-being? How should we  speed up the socialization and marketization of welfare  distribution while accelerating the transformation of  operational mechanisms in enterprises? These are difficult  questions that must be solved in the 1994 reform.    Economists hold that if we continued to take the  "double-track approach," that is, "a new method for new people  and the old method for old people," it would take several  generations' time to solve the above questions. That could not  meet the needs of building a market economy. On the other hand,  it would be a formidable political task to drastically adjust  the present interest pattern. Besides, our country has not  fostered sufficient economic strength for the institution of an  extensive, equitable, and socialized security system. In view of  this, all that we can do is to make some transformations in  mechanisms on the basis of the reality. As far as we know,  departments concerned are presently contemplating a package plan  to solve the problems. With regard to housing, efforts will be  made to privatize housing units as soon as possible. To solve  the unemployment problem, apart from the expansion and  improvement of unemployment insurance, new outlets and  diversified placement measures will be sought for those  employees laid off by enterprises. Principal proposals in this  regard are making all-out efforts to develop employment agencies  and improve and perfect the employment service system, beefing  up job training and job-transfer training to improve workers'  quality, energetically promoting service enterprises and various  tertiary industries to create more job opportunities, and  establishing a policy to encourage people to work in township  enterprises, the "three-kinds of foreign-funded" enterprises,  and private enterprises. Meanwhile, efforts will be made to  reduce the current administrative restrictions on capital  raising and to simplify the company registration procedure so  that laid-off employees can raise funds or borrow loans to open  stores or workshops and act as their own bosses. In so doing,  they can also hire some surplus personnel. This will provide an  outlet for the extra employees laid off by state-owned  enterprises.    Another difficulty concerns the relationship between central  and local authorities. Economists are of the opinion that reform  efforts over the past 15 years have done away with the  over-centralized system and made it possible to delegate power  to enterprises and local governments, thus arousing to a great  extent the initiative at the local level. However, they say,  these efforts have also resulted in the over-expansion of local  government power. In the past reforms, local governments often  showed a greater enthusiasm than central government departments.  While storming the old systems, local governments also  unwittingly impacted the statistical and reporting systems and  even the basic financial work discipline, especially in the  fields of banking, financial management, and taxation. This  situation, if allowed to continue, will affect the authenticity  of the information on which the state's macroeconomic management  is based. Yet the fact is that, as the local party and  government election systems develop, local leaders will continue  to take the development of their local economic and welfare  programs as their basic goal. At present, three problems on  local government activities deserve attention: one,  counter-regulatory action affecting the higher level; two,  direct interference in the work of the lower level; and three,  blockades imposed upon peers at the same level.    According to economists, a pure tax revenue sharing system  can only solve the question of tax revenue distribution between  the central and local governments. It can in no way serve the  purpose of redefining the government functions to meet the needs  of the market economy. We should combine the reform from the  bottom up with the reform from the top down and beef up the  central government's guidance for the reform as soon as  possible. It is imperative to clearly define the administrative  powers of the central and local governments and take this as an  important task in reforming the government functions. The  objective should be that authority for currency issuance and  macroeconomic regulation and control is held by the central  government, while administrative powers closely related to local  work targets are by and large delegated to local governments.  Examples of the latter are local finances, transportation, urban  construction, housing reform, social security, environmental  protection, education, and rectification and improvement of  loss-incurring enterprises. Meanwhile, efforts should be made to  adjust those functions inappropriate for local governments. The  only direct link that the two levels of government should  maintain with enterprises is taxation. All government regulatory  activities must be conducted through the intermediary of law or  market.    The third difficult problem lies in financial reform, a task  closely connected with the question of interests of the  government versus enterprises and of the central government  versus local governments. An urgent question in this regard, say  economists, is how to change, in accordance with the needs of  the market economy, the present practice that the government  deals directly with matters of finances, banking, and interest  rates. It is learned that the central authorities have decided  to reorganize the specialized state banks into state commercial  banks, beginning 1994. The reorganized banks will operate in  line with modern commercial banking practice and will be fully  responsible for their respective fund mobility and payment  ability. Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China will enforce the  nation's monetary policy independently under the leadership of  the State Council. It will assume centralized control over the  issuance and basic turnover of the currency and regulate the  scale of loans. The principal goal of the monetary policy is to  maintain currency stability.    With respect to the prospects and difficulties of the 1994  reform, economists say that China's reform has entered the most  difficult, challenging, and hopeful stage where efforts must be  made to tackle the hardest problems. Whether we can break with  the old traditions or not has a great bearing on the success or  failure of this reform. Now, as China's reform is developing in  depth, those engaged in the work of reform should, as well,  raise their awareness of the need to reform themselves. Also,  it is imperative to guard against the distortion of the reform  by vested interests either deliberately or unknowingly.  Recently, the central leadership has pointed out that only  through reform is it possible to grasp the "high technology"  required for the swift running of the economy, and the new  systems are exactly such "high technology." We must get a good  grasp of that "high technology" and do our best to drive the  "express train."</p>

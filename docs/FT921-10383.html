			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parties unite to play down Ashdown's affair LIBERAL Democrat MPs yesterday rallied round Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader, after he said he had a brief affair with his former secretary five years ago. He also won backing from Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, who both insisted that the affair should not become an election issue. Mr Ashdown was forced to make the admission after the theft last month of personal papers from his solicitors - Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite in the City of London. The effect of Mr Ashdown's statement on Liberal Democrats' election fortunes remains uncertain. At Westminster his greatest strength was seen as portraying Liberal Democrats as above what he regards as Britain's outdated and unfair political system. There have been a number of thefts and break-ins at political offices in recent months, intensifying fears at Westminster that this year's election campaign would be the dirtiest on record. All political parties have suffered burglaries, particularly of computer equipment. The Conservatives last night catalogued 37 break-ins which had occurred at 25 of their constituency offices over the last three years, including the telephone bugging of an office in Southampton. Most involved the theft of computer equipment. Labour last night said it was carrying out a similar survey of its constituency offices. There were signs from Downing Street yesterday that the government was sympathetic to calls for tougher security measures at the Commons. One senior Liberal Democrat official said the explanation for the spate of break-ins probably lay 'somewhere between overt conspiracy and coincidence'. However, Conservative Central Office said there was no reason to suppose the incidents were anything but common theft. Lord Holme, a colleague of Mr Ashdown, said on BBC radio he feared a new form of civil crime might be emerging 'where people see the opportunity for getting hold of confidential documents and selling them on to the press'. At a meeting of the parliamentary party last night Mr Ashdown apologised for any difficulties he might have caused. He received unanimous support from his colleagues. At the weekend he had taken out legal injunctions against all the main national media outlets after Mr Andrew Phillips, his solicitor, heard that the News of the World had been offered a copy of a note stolen from a safe. The note was an account of a meeting in May 1990 in which Mr Ashdown told Mr Phillips about the affair. Mr Ashdown decided to make his statement after the injunctions were referred to in a Scottish newspaper. Party officials said he recognised he would have to make a statement eventually - in spite of his belief that the affair should remain a private matter. Within minutes of his statement, Mr Major said: 'These matters are not relevant to Mr Ashdown's policies or his capabilities. They should not be a political issue.' Mr Kinnock said: 'His private life has nothing to do with the political issues that face the nation.'

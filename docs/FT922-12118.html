			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: Engineers' status not real problem Sir, Mr Ledger is, of course, correct - 'without engineers, no amount of help from Mr Heseltine will save our industry' (Letters, April 18). However, the low status of engineers is not, as Mr Ledger protests, a 'key factor behind UK industry's problems'. The UK might not treat its engineers with the same respect as other countries; even so, it still enjoys, according to the Central Statistical Office, a favourable ratio of highly qualified engineers to workers, when compared with Japan, US, west Germany and France. Indeed, after Japan, the UK has, says the CSO, 'the highest proportion of engineering qualifications in comparison with the employed workforce'. Given that such an advantage has, ominously, done little to halt the slide in the engineering industry - so well outlined by Andrew Baxter ('Machines in need of maintenance', April 14)) - the key problem facing British industry is not a shortage of happy engineers but a shortage of a manufacturing base that will create such a shortage.

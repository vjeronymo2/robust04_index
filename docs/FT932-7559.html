			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep cheer from BT3 THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging the use of Personal Equity Plans in the forthcoming offer of shares in British Telecom, known as BT3. Better terms for Pep investors will be available in that part of the offer known as the 'retail tender'. Those who apply via the retail tender will be able to submit bids on the same basis as institutional investors. Private investors will be able to participate in the tender through one of around 100 stockbrokers or financial intermediaries. The plus point of this process is that they have the chance of buying significant amounts of shares; the minus point is that any incentives and discounts under the public offer will not be available via the tender. The minimum investment for Peps under the retail tender will be Pounds 1,500, lower than the (yet-to-be-set) minimum for those who apply outside a Pep. Managers will also be required to make no initial charges on investments in new Peps used to acquire BT shares in the retail tender. Investors who go for shares in the public offer will also be able to transfer their shares into Peps. However, past privatisations have resulted in some small allocations for those who apply through the public offer. The marketing campaign for the sale of the third tranche of shares in BT starts next week with dealing expected to begin in July.</p>

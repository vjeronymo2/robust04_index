We have found that the accreditation process of this organization provides reasonable assurance that the laboratories accredited by it meet the conditions required by Federal law and regulations for the specialty of histocompatibility. Consequently, laboratories that voluntarily become accredited by ASHI in lieu of receiving direct Federal oversight and continue to meet ASHI requirements would meet the CLIA condition level requirements for the specialty of histocompatibility and therefore are not subject to routine inspection by State survey agencies to determine their compliance with Federal requirements for the specialty of histocompatibility. They are, however, subject to validation and complaint investigation surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice is effective for the period October 20, 1994; through October 20, 2000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Cecelia Hinkel, (410) 597&hyph;5906. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Background and Legislative Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On October 31, 1988, the Congress enacted the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), Public Law 100&hyph;578. CLIA replaced in its entirety section 353 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), as enacted by the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act of 1967, Public Law 90&hyph;174, and made every laboratory in the United States and its territories that tests human specimens for health reasons subject to the requirements established by HHS and Federal regulation whether or not it participates in the Medicare or Medicaid program and whether or not it tests specimens in interstate commerce. New section 353 requires HHS to establish certification requirements for any laboratory that performs tests on human specimens and to certify through issuance of a certificate that those laboratories meet the certificate requirements established by HHS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6141 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;239, amended the Social Security Act (the Act) to require that laboratories participating in the Medicare program meet the certificate requirements of section 353 of the PHSA. Subject to specified exceptions, laboratories must have a current unrevoked and unsuspended certificate to be eligible for payment under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or both. Laboratories that are accredited by an accreditation organization approved under section 353 of the PHSA automatically are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid participation as long as they meet applicable State requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 28, 1992, we published several final rules in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 7002&hyph;7243) that implemented the amendments to section 353 of the PHSA. The technical and scientific portions of these rules were drafted with input from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Public Health Service (PHS). Specifically, we established regulations at 42 CFR part 493 that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Require laboratories to pay fees for issuance of applicable certificates and to fund activities that we undertake to determine compliance with our performance requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specify the performance requirements that apply to laboratories subject to CLIA (some of which were amended by a subsequent January 19, 1993 rule, 58 FR 5215) and list requirements for laboratories performing certain limited testing to be eligible for a certificate of waiver; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Set forth the rules for the enforcement of CLIA requirements on laboratories that are found not to meet Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 31, 1992, we issued additional final rules (57 FR 33992), under authority found in section 353(e)(2) of the PHSA, that establish that we may approve a private, nonprofit organization as an accreditation organization for laboratories under the CLIA program if that organization's requirements for its accredited laboratories are equal to or more stringent than the applicable CLIA program requirements of part 493 of our regulations. Therefore, a laboratory accredited by an approved organization that meets and continues to meet all of the accreditation organization's requirements would meet CLIA condition level requirements if it were inspected against CLIA regulations. The regulations listed in subpart E of part 493 specify the requirements an accreditation organization must meet in order to be approved. We may approve an accreditation organization under &sect;493.501(d) of our regulations for a period not to exceed six years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the accreditation organization must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

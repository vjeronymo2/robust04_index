In his New Year address the great leader President Kim  Il-song set forth a task to decisively increase production by  making effective use of the existing production foundation and  creating production capacity still more in the coal industrial  sector which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the  national economy.    In several days of the New Year alone coal miners in  different parts increased results of capital tunnelling 1.2  times, preparatory tunnelling 1.3 times, test drilling 1.4 times  and coal production 1.2 times, compared with the corresponding  time of the previous month.    The Anju District coal mining complex is overfulfilling its  daily plan by more than 7 percent these days by operating mining  equipment at full capacity.    The Sunchon District coal mining complex which last year  tunnelled over 7,000 metres more than the previous year has  given definite precedence to tunnelling from the beginning of  the year.    The Sinchang coal mine of the complex has carried out its  daily tunnelling plan at 130 percent in the New Year up until  now.    The Tokchon and Pukchang District coal mining complexes have  secured new reserve cutting faces and augmented the utility rate  of mining equipment to boost coal production to a high level.    Especially, the Chenam coal mine of the Pukchang District  coal mining complex this year set itself a goal of increasing  coal production 50 percent up on last year and is conducting a  vigorous high-speed tunnelling drive.    The coal miners there last year produced 120,000 more tons  of  coal than the previous year through the introduction of a belt  conveyer line in transport and modernization of mining equipment.    The South Hamgyong Provincial, Saeppyol, Onsong, Myongchon  and Kangwon Provincial district coal mining complexes are  fulfilling their daily plans at 120 to 130 percent by highly  displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  fortitude.    New coal mines and pits are under construction vigorously in  Anju, Sunchon and Pukchang areas and North Hamgyong Province  which have rich deposits and good mining conditions.</p>

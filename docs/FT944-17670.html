			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Serbs enraged by killings United Nations peacekeepers yesterday found the corpses of 16 Serb soldiers and four female medics, many of them mutilated or burned, near Sarajevo, Our Foreign Staff reports. The Bosnian Serb army blamed Moslem-led Bosnian government forces and responded menacingly to the carnage near a demilitarised zone patrolled by the UN by warning it could trigger an explosion of fighting in the region. Government troops have been moving through the zone recently, prompting repeated complaints from UN officials to Bosnian government and military leaders. The Bosnian Serbs' leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said they might demand a UN withdrawal from the area. They were also reconsidering their promise to let a vital UN airlift to the Bosnian capital resume after a two-week break. The discovery of the bodies marred attempts to resolve disputes between the warring parties which included an exchange of 295 prisoners yesterday. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi, who had earlier announced the reopening of the city's airport, urged 'maximum self-restraint on both warring parties'.</p>

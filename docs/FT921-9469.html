			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: Shock to competitiveness Sir, The commentary on electricity prices for large industrial customers in the Lex column (February 5) missed the vital issue. The recession is only an aggravating factor; the main concern of large users is the impact of electricity price increases on their international competitiveness. By the middle of this year, large users will have seen their electricity prices increase by roughly 50 per cent since 1987. In most other west European countries prices have shown little change in that period. For most large industrial customers product prices are set in international markets. In the short term, they have the choice of losing business or losing profit margins as a result of electricity price increases. In the long term, an uncompetitive cost structure means factory closures and job losses at home and new investment abroad. A strong manufacturing sector, as the government knows, is vital for the future health of the UK. As large energy users, we must urge support for our international position.

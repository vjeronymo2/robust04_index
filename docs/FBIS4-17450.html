			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting between the parliamentary leadership  and law-enforcement officials in Tbilisi Friday, Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze announced the beginning of a crackdown on  terrorism and corruption. "Neither I nor the security service  will rest until we catch the murderer of Deputy Interior  Minister Giya Gulua," he was quoted as saying.    Shevardnadze called corruption "the biggest danger facing  the  country." He added that "it will devour all Georgia, and dreams  of democracy will remain a fairy tale."    Shevardnadze instructed the Interior Ministry, security  service, prosecutor's and judicial bodies and the whole  government to develop a draft decree on tighter corruption  controls, including specific tasks, within ten days.</p>

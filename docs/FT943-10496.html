			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel figures beat forecasts with 33% gain Economic recovery in Europe helped Akzo Nobel, the Dutch-based chemicals group, to lift net profit by nearly 33 per cent in the second quarter, exceeding most analysts' forecasts. The company, which said the results were better than it had expected, attributed part of the gains to synergy created by Akzo's acquisition last year of Nobel, the Swedish chemicals and coatings group. Group net profit surged to Fl 288m (Dollars 162.26m) from a pro forma Fl 217m in the same period of 1993. When Fl 75m in extraordinary charges for reorganisation in the fibres division are subtracted, the rate of growth in net profit was 48 per cent. Operating profit rose by 52 per cent to Fl 547m, on turnover up 5.5 per cent at Fl 5.56bn. 'Results were better almost across the board, both for the former Akzo businesses and for the former Nobel ones,' said Mr Syb Bergsma, finance director. The chemicals sector saw the biggest increase in operating profit, up 88 per cent at Fl 173m, but coatings and pharmaceuticals also posted large gains of 41 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. Fibres, traditionally the weakest of the group's four businesses, saw operating profit improve to Fl 30m from Fl 7m, but Mr Bergsma said this was still unsatisfactory. Demand for fibres was higher in the latest quarter, but this positive note was largely offset by strong downward pressure on prices, particularly for textile fibres such as polyester. The company said it was studying a range of options, including strategic alliances and business swaps with other companies, to bolster the fibres division, but declined to give details. Mr Bergsma said Akzo Nobel expected its second-half results to be higher than in the same period of 1993, reflecting economic recovery in Europe and continuing economic growth in the US. However, he noted that the group also faced uncertain factors, such as the direction of the dollar and raw material prices. A weaker dollar is, on balance, negative for Akzo Nobel. In the second quarter, currency movements had little effect on results, but since then the dollar has dropped against the guilder.</p>

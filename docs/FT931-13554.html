			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Accounts survey finds summaries preferred MOST SHAREHOLDERS prefer using summary financial statements rather than companies' full annual reports, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. But its financial reporting committee, which commisioned a survey into summaries and full reports, recommended that the Department of Trade and Industry should make the regulations on reports more flexible so they could be easier to read. The survey showed that for most companies offering summary statements, more than 90 per cent of shareholders opted for them in preference to the annual report. The findings will fuel arguments that the Accounting Standards Board must do more to prepare statements which meet the demands of the majority of users of accounts. Mr Roger Hussey, of the University of the West of England, who conducted the research, said: 'We should recognise that annual reports are not a general-purpose document for the general reader.' The survey showed that most companies offering summary reports did so to help communication with shareholders. They had also on average saved costs of 20 per cent to 33 per cent. Relatively few companies have yet produced summary statements - just 11 of the 350 largest quoted industrial companies in 1991, according to a separate study due to be published later this year.</p>

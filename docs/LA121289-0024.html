			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Receiving junk phone calls at home or at work is one thing, but. . . .  </P> <P> A few hours after Judy Graeme gave birth to 8-pound Sean Rose at Tarzana  Medical Center, the phone rang in her room. The cheery female voice on the  other end said, "Hi! Congratulations!" and went on to say that Graeme was now  eligible for a gift.  </P> <P> The caller asked for the new mom's home phone number. But when the solicitor,  instead, was asked for her phone number, her cheeriness evaporated and she hung  up.  </P> <P> At least it wasn't a door-to-door pitch.  </P> <P> What if they gave a protest and everyone came -- to the wrong address?  </P> <P> About 90 members of Pesticide Watch and other anti-malathion groups showed up  at a Wilshire-area building the other day to picket the local offices of Gov.  George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Only problem was, the Guv had moved downtown in August, the same month  (coincidentally) that authorities rained malathion on the Wilshire area.  </P> <P> (Downtown hasn't been sprayed yet, its many fruit trees having avoided  contamination.)  </P> <P> "He fled the spray zone," demonstration organizer David Bunn said of  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> And the protest? Well, since they'd gone to all the trouble, they held it at  the old address anyway. But the protesters faced downtown.  </P> <P> Should Long Beach's new logo get the heave-ho?  </P> <P> A survey taken by the Long Beach Weekly Seabreeze found Beachites favored, by a  2-1 margin, sacking the new skyscrapers/waves symbol in favor of the old  design, which featured such lost landmarks as the Rainbow Pier and the old  Municipal Auditorium.  </P> <P> "The new logo looks like Long Beach is sinking into the waves after the next  earthquake," wrote one reader, possibly recalling the city's 1933 shaker.  </P> <P> An anonymous city employee commented that the new logo "implies that all there  is to Long Beach is its business development. Why not a big dollar sign,  instead?" The new symbol, chosen over more than 100 other entries, was  announced a couple of months late, sparking rumors that the judges were not  overwhelmed with any of the candidates.  </P> <P> City officials felt that the old logo -- dating back to 1930 -- needed  replacing, because it puts Long Beach's incorporation date at 1897, which might  lead one to wonder why the city celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1988. Also,  the old logo contains the Latin motto, Urbs Amicitiae ("The Friendly City").  That title is claimed by nearby Bellflower. And, when it comes to a stolen  motto, there are limits to Bellflower's friendliness.  </P> <P> It might seem hard to believe, but there was a time in Southern California when  junk mail from real estate agents wasn't so plentiful.  </P> <P> In the 1860s, the bottom fell out of the market after a drought virtually wiped  out the cattle industry and left many land barons impoverished.  </P> <P> At a sheriff's sale of confiscated downtown property, held 125 years ago today,  there were no takers for lots on the corners of Main and 5th streets, Spring  and 5th streets, and Broadway and 4th street.  </P> <P> The price was the amount of unpaid real estate taxes owed on each lot,  according to author Oliver Carlson ("Mirror for Californians"). The lack of  interest was understandable. Back taxes amounted to 63 cents for each parcel.  </P></p>

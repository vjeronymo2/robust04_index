			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Goncharov] </F>   [Text] Orenburg April 11 TASS -- "No shots will be fired  during the Russo-U.S. military exercises on the Totsk military  test-range," said Major-General Anatoliy Sidyakin, commander of  the 27th Division of the Russian Army, at a news conference in  Totsk. Sidyakin said it was symbolic that the Totsk military  test-range, which saw the first cloud of a "mushroom" of a  nuclear explosion going up on September 14, 1954 as a sign of  the times of the Cold War, has been turning into an arena of  close peaceful cooperation between Russian and American troops.    Nevertheless, the general expressed concern over the fact  that joint military Russo-U.S. exercises scheduled in July have  encountered strong resistance from the mass media in the  Orenburg and the Volga region. The general pointed out that one  might get the impression that the very possibility of the  presence of American servicemen there arouses the indignation of  some representatives of parties and movements.    "The scope of the upcoming exercises stand no comparison  with  exercises regularly held on our test-range," the general said.  "Shots are permanently fired and explosions are made in the  neighborhood of Totsk, showing that full-scale military  exercises are underway there. The upcoming exercises are not so  big in comparison because the main goal of these exercises is to  teach organisation and planning the activities of peace-keeping  forces," the general said.    He pointed out that the main purpose of the exercises is to  work out with the U.S. side a common approach to conducting  peace-keeping operations. "These operations are of a non-combat  character, but rather exercises in the disengagement of warring  sides and the establishment of a regime of safety in the  disengagement corridor," the general said, adding that the  exercises would be held with the single aim of ensuring  political, non-military settlement of a conflict.    The general pointed out that no shots are planned and  expected on the test-range, since "this is not necessary and was  not specified by a U.N. Security Council mandate." The general  pointed out that taking part in the exercises will be 50  armoured carriers, adding and that no "phantom tanks" can  possibly damage the Orenburg soil.    Asked about the U.N. role in organising the exercises, the  general pointed out that "the exercises will be held under the  U.N. auspices which might send its representatives to the  exercises. In future, the exercises might be held with the  participation of "blue helmets" and other states. "Thus, the  exercises would be multilateral," the general said.    In conclusion, the general pointed out that the process of  the U.S. and Russia getting closer together and cooperation  between them have become irreversible.</p>

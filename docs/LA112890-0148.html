			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> D.A. WON'T CHARGE AXL ROSE  </P> <P> Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors today declined to file assault  charges against Axl Rose, lead singer for the heavy metal band Guns 'N Roses,  who was arrested for allegedly hitting a woman neighbor over the head with a  wine bottle.  </P> <P> In lieu of the criminal charges, prosecutors scheduled an informal hearing at  which both Rose and the neighbor will meet with a representative of the  district attorney in an attempt to reach an agreement to ensure that no future  confrontations occur.  </P> <P> Rose, 28, was arrested Oct. 30 at his West Hollywood condominium for allegedly  hitting his neighbor, Gabriela Kantor, 37, over the head with a wine bottle,  authorities said. He was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon  and was released on $5,000 bail.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said Kantor and Rose had been involved in an ongoing dispute  over the last few months about how loudly he played music in his unit.  </P> <P> Since the incident, Rose has decided to sell his condo and move into a  single-family home.  </P></p>

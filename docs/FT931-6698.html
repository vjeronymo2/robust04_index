			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: The Step Left, The Step, sweeping the US and going great guns in the UK, is just one of the new-age devices for pleasurable exercise. In the two and a half years since it was launched some 1 3/4 m have been sold. While most of those have gone to clubs and other institutions there are now two versions suitable for those who have neither the time, the means nor the taste for communal exercising. The domestic versions mean that even the shyest and most inhibited can deal with their flab and their bulges in the privacy of their own homes, while those of us who are chronically busy and short of time can tone up without having to travel anywhere. There are two versions, the Step XT, which is 30in long and has three height adjustments - 6, 8 and 10in - and costs Pounds 59.95. It is primarily used for cross-training - that is swimmers who also run or tennis players who want to get fitter but is an enjoyable way for the rest of us to improve our cardiovascular fitness. The Step 2 is the more usual domestic version; it is 27in long with 4, 6 and 8in height adjustments. It costs Pounds 44.95. Both are available from some 900 stores nationwide - in particular the sports departments of Harrods, Lillywhites and John Lewis Stores. They come with an accompanying video which it is absolutely essential to follow, at least to begin with. How you stand, the body-line, how you move; it all matters and the video nannies the novice along in a most encouraging way. It aims to leave you bursting with renewed energy, not exhausted from effort. As the handsome blond instructor puts it: 'You should be able to talk at all times and a good test is whether you can sing along with the music.' All nice, jolly, enjoyable stuff. Below is the new, laid-back, easy-does-it way to dress for exercising - not a shiny piece of Spandex in sight, colours are muted and low-key and the clothes could as easily be worn for jogging, walking, or any other sport that does not have too serious a dress code. Her outfit is from Champion Sport, the great new name in sportswear. She is wearing a grey marl leotard and street-cred, bulky shoes. He keeps her company with loose and easy, drop shoulder T-shirt, slouch socks, white towelling wrist bands and navy fleece tracksuit trousers, again by Champion Sports.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- Wage negotiations have  been settled at South Korean industries at a rapider pace so far  this year than last year.    According to the Labor Affairs Ministry, 812 firms or 14.8  percent of the total 5,483 companies employing more than 100  workers have concluded labor-management wage negotiations as of  Tuesday. The percentage represented an increase of 3.2  percentage points over the same period of last year.    A Ministry official said the faster settlement was  attributable to the fact that a central labor-management wage  agreement came earlier than last year, and many industries had  affirmatively accepted the wage agreement. The wage hikes  agreed on thus far averaged at 5.3 percent, which compares with  the average 5.2 percent of last year. By area, service firms  topped the list with 24.1 percent followed by electricity, gas  and water works (22.7 percent), transportation, warehouse and  communications (20.5 percent), manufacturing (12.1 percent),  construction (10.9 percent) and financing and insurance (5.1  percent).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Imposing Sanctions on DPRK Is Not a Good </F> Method"]    [Text] Regarding the DPRK nuclear issue, Pyongyang has  taken a tough attitude, rejecting the inspection of its key  facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].  However, the United States has reached a consensus with the ROK  and Japan: Even if a resolution on imposing economic sanctions  against the DPRK is not adopted by the UN Security Council, the  United States, the ROK, and Japan will impose sanctions  unilaterally. The United States has even asserted that it will  go it alone in imposing sanctions at any cost if other countries  are not willing to join in.    The ROK has held a supreme security conference, and has  ordered its air, naval, and ground forces to be put on alert.  According to Pyongyang, sanctions adopted by the UN Security  Council will be tantamount to a "declaration of war," which will  lead to inestimable consequences.    The United States, the ROK, and Japan all expect China to  play an important role in the tense situation on the Korean  peninsula, that is, to "persuade" Pyongyang to accept the IAEA  inspections. Russia, which also has influence on the DPRK, is  against economic sanctions and hopes that an international  conference attended by the countries concerned can be held to  resolve the problem through consultations.    Regarding China, its central leaders have told other  countries not to place too much hope on China's influence on  Pyongyang. China's basic position is that it supports the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and hopes that talks  will be held to settle the question of the DPRK accepting  international nuclear inspections arranged by the United Nations.    While meeting with a DPRK military delegation led by Chief  of  Staff Choe Kwang yesterday, President Jiang Zemin emphasized  Sino-DPRK friendship and said that "the parties and armies of  China and the DPRK share traditional friendly relations.  Whether in the past or at present, it has been of great  significance to further enhancing and developing such friendly  ties."    The purpose of the DPRK military delegation's visit to China  at a time when the situation on the peninsula is tense is to  show the United States, the ROK, and other countries that  Sino-DPRK relations, including military ties, are still good.  Naturally, China and DPRK have maintained good neighborly  relations for a long time. As neighbors, the continuity of  their friendly ties benefits both sides. Jiang Zemin did not  make any public statement on the DPRK nuclear question.  Apparently, the situation on the Korean peninsula is still  developing and changing. China is against compelling Pyongyang  to give in. Even the question of nuclear inspections should be  resolved through dialogue and consultations. Pressure will only  aggravate and complicate the situation on the Korean peninsula.  Russia is more or less inclined to China's position.    As a matter of fact, the international community should  calmly evaluate whether the DPRK is capable economically,  financially, or technologically to quickly produce an atomic  bomb. At a time when the United States, Russia, and Ukraine are  in deep trouble concerning the destruction and reduction of  their nuclear warheads and rockets following the end of the Cold  War, why should the DPRK, whose economic situation is very grim,  develop an A-bomb? Would the people support it?    It seems that the United States has been a little too  sensitive on the DPRK nuclear issue, which has also affected  Japan and the ROK. However, they have neglected the popular  will of the Korean peninsula, which tends toward reconciliation  and the reunification of North and South Korea.    The facts and achievements attained by China since reform  and  opening up was introduced 15 years ago have exerted an influence  on the DPRK, and Vietnam's open policy is also producing a good  effect on the DPRK. A plan proposed by the United Nations to  establish an international development zone in the Tumen Delta,  which borders China, the DPRK, and Russia, in order to promote  the economic development of all Northeast Asia was well received  and supported by China, Japan, the ROK, Mongolia, the United  States, and even Finland in northern Europe. The DPRK is also  willing to turn its Chongjin and Rajin ports into open ports for  the international development zone. This shows that the DPRK  intends to open itself to the outside world.    From a long-term perspective, the Korean peninsula will be  reunified. This is an irresistible historical trend. If, at  this moment, one only knows how to step up pressure and impose  sanctions at every turn, it will be difficult for a sovereign  state to accept this. It is better to settle problems through  dialogue and negotiations. As measures to isolate a country  usually have the opposite results, they are not recommended.  While meeting with the Maltese prime minister yesterday, Qian  Qichen said that China maintains its position on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. China hopes that the  DPRK nuclear issue can be settled through talks held between the  three sides and four parties. Sanctions are not good at  resolving problems as they only intensify problems.    It is necessary for China to reconcile and mediate in the  DPRK nuclear deadlock inside and outside the UN Security  Council. The best option is to calmly analyze the causes of the  problems on the Korean peninsula and to resolve these problems  through patient and peaceful talks.    There is an ancient Chinese saying: "He who cannot forbear  in  small matters spoils great undertakings." In the face of the  tense situation on the Korean peninsula today, the parties  concerned should think further about China's proposal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Talks between Malawi's two main opposition parties  seem to have come to fruition today. The former ruling Malawi  Congress Party, MCP, which was ousted in last month's elections,  used to be the bete noire of the Alliance for Democracy, Aford.  Aford's leader, Chakufwa Chihana, was jailed for several years  under Dr. Banda and was at the forefront of the campaign for a  multiparty system, but both lost out to the UDF [United  Democratic Front], who formed the new government. After weeks  of talks, the MCP and Aford have signed a memorandum of  understanding. It was announced at a press conference at a  Lilongwe hotel this afternoon. Willie Zingane was there. On  the line Chris Green asked him what the memorandum says.    [Begin recording] [Zingane] It appears that the two parties  in opposition would like to stick together in checking some of  the issues that maybe the ruling United Democratic Front would  be following, but the two leaders that signed the memorandum are  Chakufwa Chihana, president of Aford, and vice president of the  Malawi Congress Party, Gwanda Chakwamba, said that they saw the  danger of tribalism in Malawi, and this could spark into  violence.    [Green] What was the atmosphere like in today's  announcement?    [Zinane] Well, from the people who have been at the  conference, they belong to Malawi Congress Party and Aford, and  so they were cheering the thing, but from outside, the United  Democratic Front have also got their side of the story, and they  feel that the two parties are just coming together to try and  give them tough time in parliament.    [Green] There must be people inside Aford who regard talking  to the Malawi Congress Party as akin to talking to the devil.    [Zingane] Yes, there are. There has been a rumor that some  senior members of Aford didn't attend today's function because  they are not happy, because this is the same party that they  fought against.    [Green] Are there specific people that you would have  expected to be present today who are conspicuous by their  absence?    [Zingane] Well, the vice president of Aford, Reverend Peter  Kaleso, was not there. The publicity secretary of Aford, Simon  Pandule, who should have chaired the press conference is in  Lilongwe, but did not come, and rumors are saying that they  expressed reservation about this come together.    [Green] What do Malawians who don't belong to one of these  three parties think of the antics since the elections?    [Zingane] The Malawians in general are a bit disturbed,  because they are saying that they voted for change, and they  have got it in the referendum against the one-party system and  they won, and the next thing they voted in the general  elections, and at least an opposition party won, and they are  saying where is the change, if people are going to waste time  arguing and quarreling about things they should solve even  before parliament meets next week.

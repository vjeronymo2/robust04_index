			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Single premiums drive up L&amp;G Legal &amp; General, the life and general insurer, yesterday announced a 56 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 181m, from Pounds 116.1m. Profits from the core UK life and pensions business increased by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 119.6m. The results were helped by a recovery in general UK insurance. The share price gained 8p to close at 510p. The main factor in the rise in UK premium income from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 1.9bn was single premium business, in particular sales of unitised with-profits bonds. UK general insurance made a profit of Pounds 39.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 46.7m. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said that L&amp;G no longer had to make mortgage indemnity provisions, as it had done in 1992. The group's overseas general insurance operation was sharply cut as L&amp;G withdrew from 20 of its 21 agencies. Mr Prosser said the remaining agency might also be terminated. 'We are not a multi-national composite.' Mr Prosser emphasised the impact of a tougher regulatory regime on the outlook for the UK life and pensions business, saying that the direct additional cost of regulation in 1993 was more than Pounds 10m. He expressed qualified support for the personal investment authority, the new retail financial services watchdog to protect the private investor, and said that L&amp;G would apply for membership. New requirements for disclosure of commission and product details from the beginning of next year would, he added, affect product design, with moves towards greater flexibility in commission structure. Mr Prosser said that L&amp;G had made 'prudent' provisions in its reserves against potential compensation for people who had been given poor advice to transfer to a personal pension from an occupational scheme. As for general insurance, Mr Prosser said that L&amp;G would focus on its areas of greatest expertise - a combination of personal lines, single policy cover for small and medium sized businesses and commercial property. A final dividend of 13.6p makes a total of 20.1p - just over 5 per cent up. Earnings per share rose from 18.5p to 30.5p. Funds under management grew by Pounds 9bn to Pounds 33.7bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

(New York), Feb. 4, IRNA --  Iran's permanent envoy to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, in  a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Thursday  [3 February] protested the illegal activities of the U.S. Navy  in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.    Kharrazi complained that between June 25 to September 16,  1993, the U.S. naval forces disrupted the routine patrolling of  an Iranian air fighter and six helicopters over Iranian waters  and threatened them to change their course.    In his letter Kharrazi emphasised that the Iranian interest  section in Washington last month asked the Embassy of Pakistan  to inform American secretary of state over the incident and to  ask for an explanation.    The letter describing details of the incident was  distributed  as a United Nations Security Council document at the UN  headquarters here on Thursday.</p>

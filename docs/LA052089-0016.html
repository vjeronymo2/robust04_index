			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRESPI'S FATE IN 2-A TRACK FINALS HINGES ON WHITE'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Although Crespi High qualified only three individuals for the Southern Section  2-A Division track and field finals at Cerritos College in Norwalk today, the  Celts could ride the broad shoulders and fleet feet of Russell White to a  top-three finish in the boys' team standings.  </P> <P> White, who placed eighth in the 200 meters in the state championships as a  junior and second in the triple jump as a sophomore, is expected to contend for  2-A titles in the 100, 200, long jump and triple jump.  </P> <P> He was the leading qualifier in the 100, 200 and long jump last week and the  third qualifier in the triple jump.  </P> <P> "We're going to go as far as Russell takes us," Coach Jim Benkert said. "But I  don't think we can beat Arroyo Grande. They've just got too many people."  </P> <P> Arroyo Grande, led by sprinter David Stone, distance runner Luis Quintana and  hurdler William Henry, is expected to score the bulk of its points in the 200,  400 and 800 meters, and in the 110-meter high and 300-meter intermediate  hurdles.  </P> <P> In addition to Crespi, the Rio Mesa boys and girls, Agoura boys and girls, and  Oak Park boys also will battle for team titles.  </P> <P> Rio Mesa, which tied Bakersfield for the girls' state title last year, is  expected to be challenged by Upland and Duarte for the girls' 3-A title.  </P> <P> Angela Burnham, the defending state champion in the 100 and 200 meters, will  lead Rio Mesa's charge. Burnham will run in the 100 and 200 and anchor the 400  and 1,600 relays.  </P> <P> Scott Guerrero and Lester Smith will lead Rio Mesa as it pursues the boys' 3-A  title along with Esperanza and Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> In the boys' 1-A meet, Oak Park will attempt to make a successful defense of  its title.  </P> <P> The Eagles still have the bulk of last year's team -- including two-time  defending 400 champion Jason Stein -- but could be hard pressed to defeat  Agoura, which placed fifth in 1988. Bryan Dameworth and Jeff Ingalls will lead  Agoura.  </P> <P> Dameworth, the two-time defending 1-A champion in the 3,200, is entered in that  event and the 1,600. Ingalls is favored to win the 400, contend for the 200  crown and anchor the Chargers' 1,600 relay.  </P> <P> Agoura could romp to its second consecutive title in the girls' 1-A meet. The  Chargers are two-time defending 2-A champions in cross-country and should score  heavily in the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 meters, and also in the hurdles and relays.  </P></p>

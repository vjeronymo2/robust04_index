In an interview to ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYE VEDOMOSTI (this  Russian-language daily newspaper of the Russian Defense Ministry  is published in Tbilisi), Artem Azirov, a leader of the  Alliance, said that communists favor the preservation of  Georgia's territorial integrity and condemn separatism and  nationalism. "We maintain that disruption of links with Russia  and other fraternal republics is unnatural. It is unacceptable  to oppose, as some politicians do, the closest and the most  powerful neighbor, Azirov said. The course of the present  Georgian leadership toward the rebirth of economic links within  the CIS and the joint use of the potential built by the joint  effort is worthy of all-round support."</p>

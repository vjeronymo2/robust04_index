Their list includes the Gas-Prom joint-stock entity and  the Norilsk nickel concern that annually scoop up 1 billion in  hard-currency revenues. This was stated here today by Anatoliy  Chubays, chairman of the Russian State Committee for the  Management of State Property in the course of hearings on the  Russian privatization drive being held by the State Duma's  Committee on Property, Privatization and Economic Activity.    According to Chubays, the Russian privatization concept has  worked on the whole, with the state getting back 88 million  privatization checks (out of the 148 million checks issued to  the population that still has 12 million vouchers). The rest  are wielded by commercial organizations and by the nation's 650  voucher investment funds. In his words, the voucher's price is  bound to keep growing steadily. As a matter of fact, it has  soared 50 per cent over the last two weeks when it became  crystal clear that not a single political opponent could affect  the pace of national privatization.</p>

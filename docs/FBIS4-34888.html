			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 24 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  said today that relations between the United States and  Argentina "are going through the best of times." Menem also  spoke about the possibility of sending more ships to help in  Haiti's political and economic blockade.    Menem made these comments during a news conference at the  Argentine Embassy in Washington after his meeting with his U.S.  counterpart, Bill Clinton, at the White House.    During most of the news conference Menem answered questions  on international matters, which were at the center of his talks  with Clinton today.    Menem considers himself a guarantor of peace and democracy.  He also mentioned issues that will be discussed in the  hemispheric summit in Miami.    "We discussed the Haitian situation, the next American  continent summit meeting in Miami," the president said. Menem  added that Argentina is ready to contribute to any decisions  made by the UN Security Council.    Speaking about the hemispheric summit, Menem said: "It will  center on three main items: democracy and its most important  result -- freedom, trade, and continental security. Other topics  might be added later."    Menem said he is sure economic sanctions against Haiti will  yield good results, adding that he is "always speaking about  political and economic measures."    Menem said there are two ways Argentine troops can be sent  to  Haiti, where a dictatorial government prevents elected  authorities from taking over.    "The first case is presidential prerogative. The president  can send troops anywhere in the world to keep the peace. This is  the case in Croatia, Cyprus, and Haiti. In Haiti we are  contributing to the embargo. The president needs congressional  approval if troops will be involved in combat situations," Menem  added.    The president said that during his meeting with Clinton the  two leaders discussed "the most worrisome current issues, which  includes the case of Haiti. We agreed on the need to increase  pressure in the political and economic areas to force the  withdrawal of the military from the government."    The president said he was optimistic about a possible  resolution of the international problem created by the North  Korean refusal to deactivate its nuclear programs.    "I learned today that U.S., North Korean, and international  organizations' representatives will meet next month to try to  solve the problem," Menem said.    The president also was asked about Brazil's annoyance at  Argentina for its support of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari to head the World Trade Organization.    "I recall that Argentina supported Carlos Salinas de Gortari  based on a Colombian request made at the Ibero-American summit.  I was not aware then of the Brazilian position on the issue,"  the president explained.    Menem added: "Brazil proposed the candidacy of Mr. [Rubens]  Ricupero, a successful economist in Brazil. Therefore, at this  time there are two candidates, and the decision is in the hands  of World Trade Organization members. [no closing quotation mark  as received]    Regarding the issue of Haiti, Menem said pressure against  the  dictatorial government could include actions in the financial  field.    "These measures will affect the entry of capital and assets,  but the decision will be made by the United Nations. As  guarantors of democracy and freedom, we will support them  immediately," Menem said enthusiastically.    The president added: "The international community, through  the United Nations, must take steps as quickly as possible when  a country does not live in democracy, when people are killed  everywhere, and when there is hunger and misery because of it."</p>

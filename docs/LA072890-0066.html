			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE / UNFINISHED BUSINESS;  </P> <P> POLIO'S END IN AMERICAS SEEN BY 1991;  </P> <P> ONLY THREE CASES OF THE DISEASE HAVE BEEN DETECTED SO FAR THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> Buoyed by substantial progress in recent months, Pan American Health  Organization officials remain cautiously optimistic that they can achieve their  goal of eradicating polio from the Western Hemisphere by the end of this year.  </P> <P> So far this year, only three cases of the feared crippler of children have been  confirmed -- one in Mexico, one in Ecuador and one in Peru. Another 10 cases  are classified as "polio compatible," which means there is not enough evidence  to definitely exclude the diagnosis. About 500 cases of polio-like illnesses  remain under investigation; more than two-thirds are in Brazil, Chile, Colombia  or Mexico.  </P> <P> "Things look good. . . . People are confident that the goal will be achieved,"  said Dr. John Andrus, a medical epidemiologist with the Washington, D.C.-based  international health agency.  </P> <P> The Pan American Health Organization launched its polio eradication campaign  for the Americas in 1985. The group hoped that announcing a concrete goal would  spur fund-raising efforts and motivate health officials.  </P> <P> The campaign could still be derailed by a number of factors, Andrus said. These  include wars, ineffective batches of vaccine or persistent transmission of the  virus in the areas of greatest concern -- northwestern Mexico and the northern  Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.  </P> <P> Through immunization, many Western nations, including the United States, appear  to have eliminated the natural polio virus. But the virus is still responsible  for more than 250,000 cases of paralysis worldwide each year, primarily in  Africa and Asia, where the vaccine is not as widely used.  </P> <P> For an infectious disease to be eradicated, not simply controlled, the natural  transmission of the virus that causes it must be halted. Then, this result must  be confirmed over several years. So far, the only human germ eradicated  worldwide is smallpox.  </P> <P> The World Health Organization's goal is to eradicate polio from the world by  the year 2000.  </P> <P> Smallpox eradication was aided by the fact that people infected with the virus  almost always became sick and developed a rash. Polio cases, by comparison,  must be confirmed in the laboratory, and most infections are asymptomatic.  </P> <P> The polio virus can easily be transmitted through food and water contaminated  with human feces, as well as close person-to-person contact.  </P> <P> The first step toward global eradication of polio is success in the Western  Hemisphere. The nearly $50-million campaign by the Pan American Health  Organization has relied on several strategies:  </P> <P> National vaccination days, in which health workers try to immunize each child  up to age 5 against polio and other childhood illnesses.  </P> <P> Intensive surveillance of potential cases, including comprehensive reporting of  unexplained cases of paralysis, particularly in children.  </P> <P> "Mop-up" operations, in which public health workers go house-to-house in  high-risk areas and immunize all children under age 5.  </P> <P> In 1989, 130 polio cases were confirmed in the Americas. But much of the  decrease so far this year can be explained by a change to more stringent  criteria for diagnosing cases.  </P> <P> If the new classification system had been used last year, only 24 of the 130  cases -- those in which the virus was isolated from stool specimens -- would  have been classified as confirmed, Andrus said.  </P> <P> Even if success appears at hand by December, the Pan American Health  Organization will not certify polio eradication until three years after the  onset of the last case.  </P></p>

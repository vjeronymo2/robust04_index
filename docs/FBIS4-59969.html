			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Facts of the Peace Process  Anew," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: During his reception of the  U.S. secretary of state yesterday, leader al-Asad reemphasized  several facts concerning Syria's position on the peace process.  These facts are among the bases on which the Middle East peace  process was established when Syria accepted this process and  gave an opportunity for its launching through the Madrid  conference.    AL-BA'TH explains that among these facts is Syria's care for  continuing the peace process and its appreciation of the U.S.  efforts designed to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to  the Arab-Israeli conflict. The paper asserts that achieving  this objective is linked to the commitment to the bases and  principles on which the peace process was established. This  process emanates from the resolutions of both the United Nations  and international legitimacy, led by the commitment to the  land-for-peace principle.    The paper holds Israel responsible for the stumbling  bilateral negotiations. Israel has not ceased its attempts to  circumvent the peace process, the paper says. These Israeli  positions prove to everyone that Israel's acceptance of the  peace initiative was formal in the first place. This acceptance  also conceals intentions that reject a just solution.    The paper points out that Israel always seeks to depart from  the bases and substance of the peace process, and to shirk the  commitment to the initiative which was accepted on the Arab,  regional, and international levels. This was confirmed  yesterday through the [Israeli] replies Christopher carried to  Damascus.    AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel is the only party that is  undermining the peace initiative and threatening regional  stability through intransigent positions and dictates that are  not in harmony with the substance of the peace process.    Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH wonders: To what extent can  Israel continue its refusal to respond to both the international  community and the cosponsors of the peace conference? The near  future, however, may answer this question.    Under the headline "Israel Is Undermining the Peace  Efforts,"  the newspaper TISHRIN says: After he was briefed on the outcome  of Christopher's talks in Israel, President Hafiz al-Asad  explained that differences between the Syrian and Israeli  positions are wide and great because the Israeli side departed  from the bases and requirements of the peace process.    Discussing the Israeli positions based on intransigence and  procrastination, the paper adds: The rulers of Israel have  foiled all efforts designed to remove the peace talks from their  deadlock. The paper explains that Syria worked for a real and  substantial launching of the peace process, and also supported  the U.S. Administration's efforts designed to place the peace  process on the right path.    TISHRIN continues: In brief, the Rabin government wants to  annex the territories. Thus, this government's talk about peace  is no more than a cheap maneuver designed to mislead world  public opinion and create a false optimism that the peace  process is achieving progress. The paper notes that Syria  absolutely believes in peace and that it continues to make every  possible effort to promote the peace process. The paper  emphasizes that Syria adheres to regaining the entire Golan and  other occupied territories and to Israel's withdrawal to the 4  June 1967 borders. It is not a Syrian tradition to sell out an  iota of national soil or any Arab right. This is because peace  should be just and comprehensive.    TISHRIN points out that the proposed Israeli settlements are  actually a consecration of occupation and an open disregard of  both the Security Council resolutions and the international  community's principles and charters.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Peace can be achieved by resorting  to the international law and not by entrenching and spreading  the law of the jungle. The rulers of Israel should realize that  all their alleged peace plans would fail because Syria is the  Arabs' conscience and also because the Arabs will only accept  what Syria accepts.    Under the headline "Complete Withdrawal First," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: At a time when Syria showed full  cooperation with both the U.S. initiative and efforts designed  to promote the peace process in implementation of the  resolutions of international legitimacy, Israel showed much  disregard of international principles, UN charters, and the  legitimacy of the relevant UN resolutions rejecting the Israeli  occupation.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Despite the apparent future difficulties  and traps facing the Cairo agreement and obstructing its  implementation, it seems Israel has not yet learned the lesson  that lame peace settlements cannot make a durable peace, that  peace does not mean there is a winner or a loser, and that peace  does not imply concluding cheap deals based on bargains.    The paper says all observers have no difficulty in  discovering that the real Israeli position is pushing the peace  process toward numerous bargains, now that Israel has placed  obstacles and demonstrated intransigence about this process.  The paper explains that there is a great difference between  someone who wants a complete, just, and comprehensive peace, and  someone who wants to tamper with the components of such a peace,  ridicules the resolutions of international legitimacy, and  discounts the international will on the other.    The paper adds: Christopher's regional tour has shown that  differences [between Syria and Israel] are still wide because  the Israeli position departs from the bases and requirements of  the peace process launched in Madrid.    AL-THAWRAH points out that Syria cares for the continuation  of the peace process. As President Hafiz al-Asad asserted, the  objective is to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in  accordance with both the international resolutions and the  land-for-peace principle.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH notes: As President al-Asad said,  Syria adheres to the pillars of the peace process, which is  based on the Security Council resolutions. These resolutions  stipulate full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 borders in  order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region.  Thus, complete Israeli withdrawal is the first and foremost  priority under all circumstances.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR TAXES;  </P> <P> IT CAME FROM WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> LOOPHOLES, SPECIAL PROVISIONS AND A FEW SACRED COWS;  </P> <P> THE IRS MAY GIVE YOU A BREAK, ESPECIALLY IF YOU BUY A DOWN-ON-ITS-LUCK AIRLINE  OR A FOOTBALL TEAM.  </P> <P> If you're unhappy at the prospect of paying your federal taxes this year, it  probably won't give you much comfort to hear about the sweet deal the wealthy  Sullivans of Boston will be getting.  </P> <P> Congress gave William H. Sullivan Jr., eldest son Charles W., and other family  members a special tax break on their sale of the New England Patriots football  team, which they completed last October. The Sullivans were the first owners of  the franchise but in recent years had piled up more than $50 million in debts  on the team and other enterprises.  </P> <P> Since 1985, they had been talking to some 20 potential buyers about the team  but had failed to nail down a deal, causing some anxiety that their financial  problems might disrupt the Patriots' activities.  </P> <P> To the rescue came Congress, by writing into the tax code a special provision  allowing the Sullivans' company to write off those accumulated losses if they  reached a deal. Exactly which congressmen pushed for the break is veiled in  obscurity -- as is often the case -- but the intent was evidently to give the  family an extra incentive to turn the Patriots over to a more financially  stable owner.  </P> <P> The loophole is expected to mean millions of dollars for the family, which sold  the team to Victor Kiam, chairman of the Remington shaver company, for $85  million.  </P> <P> The Sullivans' special deal is one of the loopholes that continues to make some  taxpayers more equal than others under the "reformed" federal tax code, though  hundreds of other breaks were eliminated.  </P> <P> Some were written in to see that corporations and individuals didn't suffer  unfairly when Congress changed the rules of the game in 1986. Others provide  special benefits for broader groups of taxpayers -- and often, despite their  patent unfairness, enjoy wide popular support.  </P> <P> Two other individuals who got special deals under the so-called transitional  tax rules were Kansas oil billionaires Charles and David Koch, owners of the  private Koch Industries conglomerate.  </P> <P> The tax code writers allowed the brothers' company to use accelerated  depreciation and an investment tax credit for their planned expansion of a big  Minneapolis oil refinery, though such benefits were curtailed for most other  businesses in 1986.  </P> <P> Congress took the view that the break was fair, because the company had begun  the expansion believing that the old tax rules would not change.  </P> <P> Also a beneficiary was Texas Air Corp., owner of Continental, Eastern and  People Express air carriers. Congress said Texas Air could continue to reduce  its taxes by applying losses Eastern racked up before it was purchased by Texas  Air.  </P> <P> The tax code writers decided that this was fair because the company had bought  the struggling line expecting to be able to use the so-called tax loss  carryforward. They estimated the value of the writeoff at $47 million.  </P> <P> As Congress wrote these special deals into the new code, it preserved other  quirks from the old code that benefit those clever enough to know how to use  them.  </P> <P> The code's rules on inheritance continue to allow many well-off people to pass  on much of their riches free of taxation from one generation to the next.  </P> <P> The break comes in rules that have to do with the way inherited property is  valued. The rules say that, for tax purposes, the value of the property to the  new owner is fixed at the time it is inherited, rather than at the time the  former owner acquired it.  </P> <P> Consider an example. A father wants to pass on a block of stock that he bought  for $10,000 20 years ago and is now worth $100,000.  </P> <P> If the son inherited it at the $10,000 value, he would be required to pay taxes  on a $90,000 profit if he sold it. But since it is valued at $100,000, he can  sell it and pay no tax on it, said Sidney Kess, a tax accountant with Peat  Marwick Main &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> "To me, this looks like a loophole, plain and simple," Kess said.  </P> <P> The father's estate will pay tax on the stock, but only if the value of the  estate exceeds $600,000. Only a small percentage of estates are worth more than  that amount, said Kess, who also noted that any asset passed on to a spouse  escapes all taxation.  </P> <P> Congress repealed and quickly reinstated this law in the late 1970s, after  howls of protest. Now legislators are considering dumping it again.  </P> <P> In a recent report, the Congressional Budget Office wrote that plugging this  hole could "reduce opportunities for wealthy families to avoid tax permanently  on an important source of income."  </P> <P> Another dodge, the so-called tax-free exchange, has helped make many wealthy  real estate people lots richer.  </P> <P> This rule allows the individual or corporate owner of a piece of real estate to  swap it for any equivalently valued property without paying tax on the  transaction.  </P> <P> An investor might buy a run-down building for $50,000, fix it up and swap it  for a building valued at $100,000. The investor might continue to add value to  his portfolio of properties with similar tax-free transactions.  </P> <P> By "trading up" in such a way, the investor avoids taxes he'd pay if he sold  one property to raise money to buy another.  </P> <P> Part of the beauty of these deals is that the tax rules are "very liberal in  what you can swap," Kess said. "You can swap not only buildings for buildings,  but for business or farm equipment."  </P> <P> But if such less known rules of the code can be unfair, so can the provisions  that are well known and have great popular support.  </P> <P> The home equity loan, one of the code's most sacred cows, "raises a whole host  of equity questions," says Joseph Minarik, a tax expert at the Joint Economic  Committee of Congress.  </P> <P> For instance: The taxpayer who finances his car through an auto company now can  now deduct only 20% of the interest, a figure that falls to zero in 1991. But  if he takes a home equity loan to finance his auto purchase, he can deduct the  full amount.  </P> <P> Tax purists also still frown over the airlines' "frequent flyer" programs,  which they say allow companies to pass benefits to employees -- mostly  high-ranking employees -- free of tax. These days, the airlines might be just  as happy to see the authorities start taxing the programs, because it might  discourage use of the program and cut the airlines' expensive obligations.  </P> <P> But it appears that the programs' status will remain unchanged, since the  Internal Revenue Service feels enforcement would be simply too big a job, said  Eliot Rosen, editor of the nonprofit tax publication Tax Notes in Washington.  "Here's an example of a benefit people are getting without a special  congressional action," he said.  </P></p>

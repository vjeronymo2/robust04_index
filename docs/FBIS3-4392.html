The provincial leaders sincerely talked with well-  known specialists, scholars, and artists of the province's  theoretical, press and publication, and artistic circles. They  jointly bid farewell to the outgoing year and welcomed the  arrival of the new year. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, first extended earlier new year  greetings to the participants. They also pointed out in his  speech: The propaganda, ideological, and cultural fronts across  the province should firmly grasp the fundamental guiding  principle of the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, submit themselves to and serve the overall  situation of building an economically powerful province, go deep  to the reality and the grass roots, strive to cultivate a large  number of specialists of various categories, and enliven the  province's undertakings theory, press, publications, culture,  and artistic undertakings.    The specialists, scholars, and artists talked freely at the  forum. In line with their actual conditions, all departments  reviewed the fruitful achievements in carrying out the  propaganda and ideological work and building the spiritual  civilization made over the past year. Simultaneously, they set  forth many good opinions and suggestions on further achieving  the work of the propaganda and cultural departments in the new  year.    After hearing their opinions, Cheng Weigao set several  demands and expectations on the specialists, scholars, and  artists participating in the forum.    First, they should further strengthen the study of the  theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  ceaselessly upgrade their ideological and political level.  Comrades on the propaganda, ideological, and cultural fronts  should pay particular attention to and conscientiously study the  third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  and comprehensively and deeply understand the basic guidelines  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important statements.  Simultaneously, they should study the speeches made by the  central leading comrades at the national propaganda and  ideological work conference, persistently arm their brains with  the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  and upgrade their political and ideological level. Only then  will their research and creative findings accurately embody the  line, principles, and policies of the party, be more  instructive, and be permeated with the significance of the  times; and really ensure that the people are armed with  scientific theories, guided with accurate media, portrayed with  lofty spirits, and mobilized with outstanding works.    Second, they should carry out a good style of study  characterized by linking theory with practice and further  enhance the awareness of serving the economic construction,  reform, opening up, and the socialist market economy. Relying  on deepening reform is the key to achieving the propaganda,  ideological, and cultural work. Comrades should attach  importance to going deep to reality and positively dedicate  themselves to the great practice in which the masses engage  themselves in the development of socialist modernization in an  effort to find a new situation, study new problems, sum up new  experiences, and answer new questions. We should create  excellent, healthy, solemn, elegant works which the broad masses  of the people are fond of, that conform to the spirits of the  times, and that are conducive to mobilizing the masses to engage  in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization so as to  enrich the people's cultural life, inspire their fighting will,  mobilize their enthusiasm, and provide powerful spiritual  motivation for building an economically powerful province.    Third, they should enthusiastically cultivate skilled  persons  and have increasingly more people become worthy and capable  persons. In a sense, promoting and cultivating a large number  of young skilled persons in a rapid manner and having them make  achievements and contributions soon has more far-reaching  significance than direct achievements of veteran comrades. We  can believe that if we show more concern for and make more  efforts to cultivate the younger generation, the propaganda and  cultural workers contingents will have a well-balanced lineup,  become more powerful, and have grand momentum.    Fourth, they should provide more constructive opinions and  suggest ways and means to build an economically powerful  province. The specialists, scholars, and artists present at the  forum are our comrades as well as our friends. I hope that you  will provide more opinions, criticisms, and suggestions on the  work of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, the propaganda and ideological work, and the  spiritual civilization. So long as you provide more good  opinions and think out more good methods we will be able to pool  the wisdom of the masses, choose and follow what is good, make  more democratic and scientific policy decisions, and ensure that  predetermined progress is made.    Cheng Weigao also stressed: Party committees and governments  at various levels should strengthen leadership over the  propaganda, ideological, and cultural work. According to the  guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work  conference, we should conscientiously persist in the principle  of "taking a two-handed approach and being sure that both hands  are tough;" focus our efforts on achieving work in the  theoretical, media, ideological and educational, and main melody  spheres; provide more assistance; come up with more topics; set  forth more demands; and comprehensively achieve the propaganda  and ideological work. As for the specialists, scholars, and  artists on the propaganda and cultural fronts, we should  politically show more concern for them, provide them with more  assistance in their work, and take more care of their livelihood  so as to have them bring their functions into play in the course  of building an economically powerful province.    Han Licheng, standing committee member of the provincial  party committee and director of the propaganda department,  chaired the forum. He urged that the all departments and  bureaus under the provincial-level propaganda front to  conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of the  speeches made by Comrade Jiang Zemin and Comrade Li Peng at the  national propaganda and ideological work conference as well as  the guidelines of Comrade Cheng Weigao's speech made today,  grasp strong items, create first-grade achievements, and elevate  the province's propaganda and ideological work to a new height.  Simultaneously, party committees at various levels and leaders  of all departments should pay attention to caring for,  respecting, cherishing, and treasuring the specialists on the  propaganda front; make friends with experts; establish close  contacts with them; show concern for their thinking, work, and  livelihood; conscientiously listen to their opinions and  suggestions; sincerely help them solve their working and living  problems; and create a good, relaxed, and favorable environment  for bringing their wisdom and intelligence into full play.    Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee; and Liu Zuotian, vice governor of the provincial  government, attended the forum.

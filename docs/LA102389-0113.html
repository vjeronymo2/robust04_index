			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PRIME COMPUTER TO LAY OFF 2,500  </P> <P> Prime Computer Inc. today said it will lay off 2,500 employees, or about 20% of  its work force, due to a restructuring of the company into four units.  </P> <P> Prime was acquired in August for about $1.13 billion by New York investment  firm J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. after a protracted, nine-month battle for control  of the Natick-based computer maker.  </P> <P> In a statement, Prime said the layoffs will occur mostly in the United States.  Half of the U.S. layoffs, whose number was not specified, will be in  Massachusetts, the company said.  </P> <P> Prime said it will be reorganized into four profit centers: the computervision  business unit, the minicomputer business unit, the customer support business  unit and the international business unit.  </P> <P> Prime posted a net loss of $18.9 million in the second quarter, compared with a  $76.2 million profit in the same period last year.  </P> <P> Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic Four Inc. launched a hostile bid for Prime last  November and the long battle cut into Prime's earnings, sapped customer  confidence and drove off some valued employees.  </P></p>

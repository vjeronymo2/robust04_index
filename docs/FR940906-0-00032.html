			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thirty-four oral and forty written comments were received on the proposed rule. These included comments from three Federal agencies, four Montana and Idaho State agencies, four Canadian agencies, the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, Idaho's two U.S. Senators, Montana's U.S. Representative, Idaho's Governor, fifteen County or City officials, and thirty-three individuals or groups. The Service considered all comments, including oral testimony at the three public hearings. A majority of comments opposed the proposed rule. Opposition was based on several factors, including the possible economic impacts of listing the white sturgeon population, and that all causes of decline are not currently known or fully understood. Seven written comments supported the proposed rule and five letters requested additional public hearings. Idaho Senators Larry Craig and Dirk Kempthorne requested that the Service ``*&blank;*&blank;* not proceed hastily towards a decision to list the Kootenai sturgeon *&blank;*&blank;*'' and suggested that the Service consider ``*&blank;*&blank;* the recovery strategy prepared by the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho.'' Many commenters provided information pertaining to further research needs, critical habitat, and recovery planning. These comments, in addition to recovery strategies submitted by the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks, will be useful in the development of a recovery plan for the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon. Several commenters provided new and substantive biological information applicable to the listing decision. The British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks of Canada submitted information on a fertilization program for Kootenay Lake. The Kootenai Tribe provided additional information on white sturgeon captured in the Kootenai River in 1993, and the BPA provided annual reports describing results from a 1993 white sturgeon monitoring program ongoing in the Kootenai River. Comments of a similar nature or point of concern are grouped for consideration and response. A summary of these issues and the Service's response to each, are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters requested that the Service delay or preclude listing the Kootenai River white sturgeon because too little is known regarding all causes of decline. They also believed there were ``obvious uncertainties'' regarding the Kootenai sturgeons' current status throughout its range. Some commenters questioned whether population estimates for Kootenai River white sturgeon cited in the proposed rule are a reliable indicator of its current status since the fish moves between the river and Kootenay Lake and additional fish may reside in the lake. Other respondents claim that the Service ignored all potential causes of decline in the proposed rule. Specifically, assertions in the proposed rule that ascribe the primary cause of decline to Kootenai River flow modification such as ``*&blank;*&blank;* the free-flowing river habitat has been modified and impacted from development of the Kootenai River basin *&blank;*&blank;*''. The Lincoln County Board of Commissioners (Montana) believe ``*&blank;*&blank;* other potential causes of decline must be analyzed before a decision is made on the listing of the white sturgeon, while another respondent stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* information strongly suggest other mechanisms are limiting sturgeon recruitment into the population.'' Because it appears that the Kootenai River white sturgeon population has been declining since the mid-1960's, prior to the construction and operation of Libby Dam, additional causes of decline contributing to a lack of recruitment and survival should be investigated. These respondents also suggested that the Service initiate a comprehensive research study to develop additional data on the biological and environmental factors limiting sturgeon recruitment prior to any listing decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The listing process includes an opportunity for the public to comment and provide new information that is evaluated and considered by the Service before making a final decision. Aside from previously cited studies and reports in the proposed rule (58 FR 36379), the Service has reviewed and considered new information regarding distribution and general life history for the Kootenai River population of white sturgeon from BPA (1993), the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (1993), and Marcuson (1993); information about Kootenay Lake fertilization studies (Ashley and Thompson 1993); and information contained in an independent status review prepared for the Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference Committee (Giorgi 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

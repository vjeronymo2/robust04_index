			<p>Weapons   <F P=102>   NC1404071294 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0602 GMT 14 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> NC1404071294 </F> <F P=104>  Cairo MENA </F> <F P=105>  Arabic </F> BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has  voiced astonishment at the U.S. Administration overlooking  Israel's nuclear capability. It asserts that this oversight is  not the result of ignorance, because the Israeli nuclear  enterprise is known to all intelligence services.    In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR refers to remarks made by  U.S. sources that Israel will acquire 45 F-15E combat aircraft.  It points out that this is the first time the United States has  agreed to sell this sophisticated type of aircraft and says that  these planes will enable the Israeli air force to carry out  strikes against Libya, Iraq, and Iran.    AL-AKHBAR remarks that this raises questions about the U.S.  position on Israel and causes much astonishment.    The paper asserts that the U.S. attitude to nuclear weapon  proliferation is contradictory; while it pressures North Korea  to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection,  going as far as to threaten air strikes against it, it  disregards any discussion of Israel's nuclear weapons, long  deployed in the Negev.    AL-AKHBAR denounces the Israeli Government's refusal to sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in clear defiance of the  international community. The paper says the Israeli  intelligence services occasionally leak reports about the  country's nuclear weapons so as to frighten Arab countries near  and far.</p>

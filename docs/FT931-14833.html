			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Growth stock focus gives Dow support Wall Street BLUE CHIPS once again lagged behind the broader market as demand for technology and small-capitalisation growth stocks helped to offset earnings disappointments elsewhere, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.32 at 3,267.88. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 2.91 at 435.94 and the Nasdaq composite jumped 8.92 to set another record close of 695.70. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 304.5m shares. News of a 52,000 rise in weekly jobless claims surprised the market, because the drop reversed the recent trend for improving job market conditions. This was offset by better news on retail sales, which rose 1.2 per cent in December. There was also good news on inflation, with the Labor Department announcing that producer prices were up just 0.2 per cent last month. With many investors still apprehensive about the immediate outlook for stock prices and willing to wait until the quarterly reporting season is over, leading issues remained locked in a narrow range. Leading indices were pulled in different directions by a big loss in JP Morgan on disappointing figures and a solid rise in some big technology issues which reported stronger than expected earnings. JP Morgan dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 in volume of 2.3m shares after reporting that profits rose 11 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 298m, or Dollars 1.48 a share. Although the net income figure was slightly higher than forecasts, analysts were disappointed with JP Morgan's operating earnings. Motorola jumped Dollars 10 7/8 to Dollars 123 1/4 as investors reacted positively to the news that fourth quarter profits reached Dollars 181m, up from Dollars 126m a year earlier. Digital Equipment was also in favour, soaring Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 in volume of 5.5m shares on news that the computer group's fiscal second quarter losses narrowed to Dollars 73.8m, down from a figure of Dollars 155.2m a year ago. The good news from the sector lifted other technology stocks, with IBM rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 3/4 , Compaq putting on Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 53 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard adding Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 74 1/8 . Coca-Cola rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 on reports that international unit case volume in December was 11 per cent higher than the year before, a big improvement on previous estimates of overseas sales growth. Canada TORONTO stocks ended generally higher after an active session filled with corporate news. A trader said that we seem to have turned around at the end of the day, following New York higher, but golds and financials are still pretty soft. The TSE 300 index improved 5.5 to 3,303.8 and rises exceeded falls by 321 to 288. Volume amounted to 44.7m shares. Molson A shares rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 29 1/4 on news that Philip Morris's unit, Miller Brewing Co, will buy 20 per cent of Molson Breweries for USDollars 273m.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 2.5% on lower bond prices THE weakening yen and lower bond prices prompted index-linked selling and profit-taking ahead of the weekend, and share prices lost 2.5 per cent amid low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 470.29 to 18,221.00, opening at the day's high of 18,621.54, and falling to a low of 18,191.39 in the afternoon as index selling accelerated. Volume fell from 270m shares to 242m. However, with many investors staying away from the market as some 300 companies announced their results for last fiscal year yesterday, the lack of volume exaggerated price movements. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.62 to 1,371.70 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.36 to 1,088.47. Declines outnumbered advances by 831 to 168 with 131 issues unchanged. Reports that the finance ministry was going to take action against a bankrupt foods company, for window-dressing its accounts, also depressed sentiment. Theme stocks were active, but most fell on profit-taking. Mitsubishi Kakoki, the most active issue of the day, was unchanged at Y1,130 and Ebara, the industrial water pump maker, lost Y30 to Y1,530. Bio-technology and Aids related issues also fell, with Okamoto Industries down Y30 to Y1,340 and Meiji Milk Products losing Y15 to Y833. Issues with poor results for the last fiscal year and weak forecasts for the current year to March 1993 declined. Fanuc, the industrial robot maker, fell Y210 to Y4,390. Reports that the company's pre-tax profits for the current year to March 1993 will plunge by 29 per cent discouraged investors. Kajima, the construction company, led the decline in that sector, falling Y10 to Y1,080. The company expects a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y103bn. Sony, which announced a operating loss for the first time since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958, fell Y50 to Y4,260. Daiei, the supermarket chain, rose Y28 to Y941 after surging to Y1,000. It announced that it would acquire over 30 per cent of Recruit, the publishing and information company which was at the centre of a stock bribery scandal in the late 1980s. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 360.44 to 20,891.41 in volume of 12.5m shares. Roundup FINANCIALS lifted Seoul and Taiwan yesterday, while Bangkok dropped on profit-taking. TAIWAN moved on Thursday's approval for the listed China Trust to transform to a commercial bank on July 2. The weighted index registered its sixth consecutive gain to close 60.27 better at 4623.94, 7.7 per cent higher on the week. HONG KONG's unexpected decision to cut prime rates by one percentage point from Monday came too late to affect trading and the Hang Seng index closed down 5.93 to 5,859.68 for a five-day gain of 2.7 per cent. In London, however, Hong Kong equities advanced some 2 per cent. SEOUL's composite index rose by 9.05 to 582.88, but trading remained slow and the index ended 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Two heavyweights, Pohang Iron and Korea Electric, rose Won400 to Won19,400 and Won 500 to Won12,400 on news that the government will allow foreign investors to buy their shares. BANGKOK, still worried in the aftermath of civil strife, fell 2.7 per cent on the day, and 2.0 per cent on the week, the SET index ending 20.16 lower at 718.51. MANILA consolidated, the composite index rising 2.89 to 1,379.69, 3.1 per cent higher on the week. AUSTRALIA continued to digest the ADollars 1.7bn loss at Westpac Banking as the All Ordinaries index rose 1.9 to 1,684.5, up 1.4 per cent on the week. BOMBAY finished broadly lower. The BSE index lost 124.21 to 3,435.07.</p>

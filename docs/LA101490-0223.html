			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR MORE INFORMATION  </P> <P> If you want a sprinkler system installed, experts advise getting a contractor  with a "C16" license for installing fire sprinklers. They are listed in the  phone book under fire sprinklers or fire protection.  </P> <P> You may want to call the Contractors' State License Board at (916) 366-5153 to  verify licenses and whether contractors are in good standing. Or check with  your local fire department for information and recommendations.  </P> <P> Some manufacturers offer do-it-yourself kits, although fire officials say it's  a good idea to have an expert check the plans and installation, especially if  you aren't familiar with plumbing techniques.  </P> <P> You should also ask your building department for local requirements. Fire  departments will usually check systems to see if they are working properly.  Systems are checked with a test valve so the sprinkler heads don't activate.  </P> <P> Sprinkler manufacturers include:  </P> <P> ASCOA Fire Systems  </P> <P> P.O.

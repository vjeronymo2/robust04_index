			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 31 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  announced this morning that Radical Civic Union leader Raul  Alfonsin "last night denied" establishing a "pact" with Grand  Front leader Carlos Chacho Alvarez to prevent the Justicialist  Party from including a clause [in the constitutional reform] to  allow the reelection of governors.    Menem told Radio 9.90: "We have only one pact here -- the  Olivos Pact," which Menem signed with Alfonsin.    The chief of state did not hide his disquiet about some  headlines in Buenos Aires newspapers which report an alleged  "pact" between Alfonsin and Alvarez, or on the comparison he  made between Argentina and Colombia [regarding the World Soccer  Cup].</p>

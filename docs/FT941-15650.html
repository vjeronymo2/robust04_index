			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Zhirinovsky berates rivals A key Yeltsin aide was elected speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament yesterday as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader, announced that he was withdrawing his candidacy as head of the lower house. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, was elected as speaker of the Federation Council. In the lower house, however, Mr Zhirinovsky recommended that his rivals be sent to psychiatric hospitals and said he was saving his health in order to become president. 'I temporarily withdraw my candidature until presidential elections (due in 1996) and then we will talk,' he said. 'In two years, through our special (security) services, we'll know who was ill and with what.' When Mr Anatoly Chubais, the radical privatisation minister reconfirmed in his post yesterday, pointed to his watch to get Mr Zhirinovsky to cut short his hectoring, Mr Zhirinovsky yelled: 'You'll be doing that to call for your supper in Lefortovo jail.' Lefortovo is where Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former parliamentary speaker, is being kept for his role in last year's coup attempt. As the Liberal Democratic party leader continued to make a mockery of parliament, Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg, claimed he had evidence that the KGB picked Mr Zhirinovsky to head an alternative, controllable party requested by the communist politburo as it formally gave up its monopoly on power in 1990. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, former Soviet president and head of the party, yesterday denied his politburo had decided to set up such a party, although he could not vouch for other forces such as the KGB. Mr Zhirinovsky's withdrawal from the race for speaker means the likely victory of Mr Ivan Rybkin, a 47-year-old former Communist party secretary who belongs to the conservative Agrarian party. Mr Vladimir Lukin, the Russian ambassador to Washington, was eliminated from the race in early voting yesterday. He had the support of the democratic parties, including Russia's Choice, the largest single group in parliament. Two anti-Yeltsin candidates, including Mr Rybkin, remain for a run-off vote to be held today.</p>

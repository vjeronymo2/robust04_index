			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> HELICOPTER CRASHES BUT ALL ARE RESCUED  </P> <P> Two Navy pilots were plucked safely from the ocean and two of their crewmen  awaiting help in a life raft were rescued after a Sea King helicopter plunged  into the ocean southwest of San Diego during military exercises, authorities  said. Navy officials said the Sikorsky SH-3 helicopter with four men aboard  crashed about 11:30 p.m. Friday, 86 miles offshore and about 10 miles from the  aircraft carrier it had been assisting.  </P> <P> "From the time we learned the aircraft was in the water until the time we got  them back to the ship was about 45 minutes," said Cmdr. Bob Pritchard. The  pilots, Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Mills and Lt. Walter Beck, were fished out of the calm  but chilly waters, and Petty Officer Charles Marcus and Airman Dale Brandt were  found in a raft at the crash site by two rescue helicopters dispatched from the  carrier Ranger. No one was injured, although the men were treated for mild  hypothermia. The cause of the crash is under investigation.  </P></p>

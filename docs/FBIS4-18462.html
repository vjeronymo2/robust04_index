			<p>BFN     [Text] Osnabrueck (DPA) -- The Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] does not think that halting  arms deliveries to Turkey, which is no longer ruled out by  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party), either,  is a sufficient response to the basic problem of the  relationship between Turkey and the West. In an interview with  NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Wednesday edition), Karl Lamers,  foreign policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group,  stressed that membership in the European Union, which Turkey is  striving for, is becoming increasingly impossible in view of  Turkey's way of dealing with the Kurdish problem.    Of course, it would place a serious strain on German-Turkish  relations if it could be proved that German weapons are used  against the Kurds. From the moral point of view and because of  the Turkish Government's promise to the contrary, it would then  certainly be justified to stop arms deliveries. On the other  hand, Germany would thus give up any possibility to influence  Turkey and its behavior toward the Kurds. Therefore, the  Kurdish problem can be solved only by political means, by having  us and others convince Turkey that there cannot be any solution  without, at least, far-reaching cultural autonomy. "The  excessive use of weapons against parts of the Turkish people is  a bad thing -- no matter where the weapons come from," Lamers  stressed.</p>

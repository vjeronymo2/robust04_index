			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Britain may develop ballistic missile defence Britain took the first step towards developing a ballistic missile defence system by launching a two-year study for the defence industry yesterday. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the post-cold war world might emerge as a 'significant threat to deployed forces'. While only missiles based in the former Soviet Union are currently capable of reaching the UK, Mr Rifkind pointed out that the technology to produce them was not confined to Britain's traditional enemies. In response, the government had set aside money from the annual Pounds 22bn defence budget for a national programme of studies to assess technical options, costs, and the performance of systems likely to be available. It will decide whether the UK needs a ballistic missile defence capability on the basis of the study, which will be worth about Pounds 3m to the successful bidder. Any contract for developing and manufacturing such a weapons systems, however, is likely to run into billions of pounds. Competitors for the early study, which include British Aerospace and GEC-Marconi, welcomed one of the first signs that the government might add to its defence capabilities since the 1990 Options For Change reforms. But BAe, which said it would be competing for the study with a team of other companies - not necessarily all British - immediately raised doubts over the affordability of the ballistic missile defence programme at a time when the Ministry of Defence was making cuts. The manufacturers are well aware that an off-the-shelf ballistic missile defence system already exists in the form of the US Patriot - and that the government might decide to buy that if the early studies persuade it to acquire such a defence capability. Mr Brian Lowe, of the Defence Manufacturers' Association, welcomed the fact that the government was trying to keep pace with technological advances. The Labour party said the launch of the review was long overdue, as the government had scrapped the surface-to-air Bloodhound missile four years ago and not replaced it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [V. Voropayev video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>   [Text] Although agreement on the demarcation of the  eastern sector of the Russian-Chinese border was reached three  years ago, the fate of the border islands near Khabarovsk still  remains unclear. The Chinese side is claiming the Bolshoy  Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovskiy Islands, and if their reasoning on  defining the line of the border is accepted the international  boundary will be practically in the center of Khabarovsk. The  issue of demarcation of this sector has been temporarily set  aside and this uncertainty must worry those who live here.  [Video shows unidentified correspondent interviewing Colonel  General A.I. Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian Border  Troops]    [Begin Nikolayev recording] Today's visit to Khabarovsk, to  the Far East Border District, is a fundamental part of the  measures Russia is taking to protect its interests in the Far  East. There are quite a number of issues directly connected  with Khabarovsk Kray, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, and the Amur  Oblast arising from problems which the border troops must solve.  The border with China is changing and conditions on the state  border must be such as to conform with the relations between our  two states. All this is being done in the context of the  discussion process currently in progress between the Russian  Federation and the PRC. It is very important for me to find out  how the approach developed by the Foreign Ministry and the  Federal Border Service will be perceived in connection with the  forthcoming signing of the Russian-Chinese border agreement.  [end recording]    However, the inhabitants of the border territories are  ignorant of this approach at present. According to newspaper  reports, diplomatic representatives of both countries meeting in  Beijing have not made any progress in resolving the problem of  the islands. The only reassuring thing is that Russia is  rejecting the PRC's territorial claims. Meanwhile, the Japanese  magazine Sentaku, issue No. 12 of last year, reported that the  question has been resolved and mutual agreement reached on  handing over the disputed islands near Khabarovsk to the PRC.  True, the Japanese magazine does not quote the source of the  information. At the same time, Chinese maps of Heilongjiang  Province for some time now have shown the islands near  Khabarovsk, which the neighboring country is claiming, in the  same colors as the Chinese territory. Understandably, all this  is simply political fantasy. However, the inhabitants of  Khabarovsk must be worried by the mass of reservations and vague  wording of the sparse and contradictory information about the  islands.</p>

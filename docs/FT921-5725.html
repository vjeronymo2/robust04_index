			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Calling in the brain surgeon These days when one personal computer is almost identical to any other built around the same processor chip, differential marketing is what the PC retailing business is about. There are many ways to distinguish Joe desktop from other clones. One is by price. Others include design, after-sales service and back-up. But an increasingly popular option is to attach an 'upgradeable' sticker to the machine - or more precisely to its central processor unit (CPU). Upgradeability is not a new concept. Most ageing desktops can accommodate more memory, a bigger hard disc and a better screen. But making provision for a PC to have the equivalent of a brain transplant - by swapping its CPU - is a relatively new bandwagon, and one on to which many of the PC manufacturers are now jumping. Indeed, until relatively recently it was arguable that processor upgradeability was simply a fortunate by-product of efficient manufacturing. Modular assembly, using a standard board into which different processor chips can be plugged to produce machines with different specifications, is often the cheapest way of manufacturing. Using this single 'motherboard' design for a whole PC range generates volume savings and improves quality. However, recent developments have made the arguments for built-in upgradeability even more compelling for the customer. First, chip prices continue to tumble as Intel manoeuvres to maintain its dominant market position and to encourage users to climb the chip generation ladder. This means that the price of upgrades is also dropping steadily. Second, the chip development cycle is accelerating. There is now only a two- to three-year gap between new generations of Intel processors - and the gap is getting shorter. Third, Intel will today unveil its new DX2 chips based on its 'clock doubler technology' which enables the processor to run internally at twice its usual speed and is designed to provide a 'mid-life' kicker initially to its 486 range, ahead of the launch of its next generation of processors, dubbed P5, later this year. Intel will also announce its 'OverDrive' companion chip for 486SX machines which speeds up all mathematical calculations. Although the new DX2 chips are designed principally for new machines, some manufacturers have already said they will offer them as upgrades. Similarly, the OverDrive chip which plugs into the vacant co-processor socket initially in 486SX machines, will also be made available as an upgrade for DX2 machines next year. The most obvious way a manufacturer can build in upgradeability is to provide for the removal of the existing processor from its socket on the motherboard. The upgrade can then be plugged in. Companies such as Viglen and Dell, among many others, have taken this route. Usually the upgrade package includes a special chip removing tool. The only other thing required is a steady hand. Another route is to mount the processor on to a smaller board, known as the daughter board, which plugs into the motherboard. Upgrading is just a matter of pulling one daughter board out and replacing it. This is the route chosen by Elonex, the UK's largest direct seller of PCs. The company does not charge a premium for its upgrades, so upgrading from a 33MHz 386DX to a 33MHz 486, for example, costs just Pounds 250. With Intel vowing to make 1992 the year of its 80486 chip the case for choosing a 486 machine with a guaranteed upgrade path has never been stronger - provided there is little or no price premium.</p>

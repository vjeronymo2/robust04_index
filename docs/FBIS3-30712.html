The Supreme Court established that the Council of Ministers  has once more acted illegally by committing a breach of the  Constitution and of legal acts. The Council of Ministers has  abused its power, which is an inadmissible offense in a  rule-of-law state, especially if committed by an organ that is  responsible for the comprehensive administration of the country,  the Supreme Court's announcement reads.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson to raise Dollars 232m from sale and Beazer US flotation Hanson is to receive Dollars 232m (Pounds 157m) from the flotation of Beazer Homes USA, which was priced yesterday, and the sale of property in Hawaii. The Anglo-American conglomerate will today issue the pathfinder prospectus for the flotation of Beazer Homes in the UK which will be completed by the group's half year end in March. The net book value of the assets being sold was Dollars 201m at January 31. Mr David Clarke, chief executive officer of Hanson Industries, Hanson's US business, said the share sale 'demonstrates the premium value of Hanson's individual business units'. Hanson shares rose 4p to 279p. The sale of the two housebuilding activities, acquired with the purchase of Beazer in December 1991, will help in Hanson's efforts to cut its gearing - which stood at 86 per cent in the September 30 balance sheet. The news followed Tuesday's Dollars 1bn convertible bond issue. At the year end Hanson's net debt stood at Pounds 3.4bn compared to shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.95bn. Prior to the Beazer US deal, Hanson had raised Pounds 256m from disposals in this financial year. The price for the US share issue was set at Dollars 17.50, in the middle of the revised price range of Dollars 16.50 - Dollars 18.50 a share. Hanson is selling 6m shares, cutting its stake to 33.3 per cent, but could sell a further 900,000 if underwriters find strong demand which would cut the holding to 25.8 per cent. Beazer Homes USA is also issuing Dollars 115m of 10 year senior notes, carrying a 9 per cent coupon. With the repayment of debt to Hanson and the proceeds from the share sale, Hanson is receiving Dollars 184m. The balance of Dollars 48m is coming from the sale of 220 acres on Ma'ili Kai, Oahu, the stock of Lokelani Construction and houses under construction to Schuler Homes. Hanson acquired these with its purchase of Kaiser Cement Corp.</p>

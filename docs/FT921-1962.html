			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trading in Gas TURNOVER in British Gas was the heaviest of any stock in the London stock market yesterday and the shares fell 5 to 242p. The volume of nearly 20m shares was largely accounted for by a sizeable placing carried out by SG Warburg Securities, which was said to have sold around 6m shares on behalf of a large institution. Dealers said the investment bank took the shares on to their book at 239p and sold them at 241p. Warburg would only say that it had been active in the shares. The deal could be part of a much bigger placing. Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said it had also been selling on behalf of a large institution this week. However, the sale does not appear to reflect the prevailing view that shareholders of privatised companies might be in for a tough time if a Labour government is elected. Strauss Turnbull's oils team argues: 'There are no political risks attached to the shares - if anything a Labour government might introduce regulation by committee which is much prefereable to the perceived arbitrary rule currently in force.' Reuters return Volatility in Reuters Holdings continued as the shares bounced back by 24 to 1144p on optimism over one of the company's new trading systems. Traders said the market was encouraged about Globex, a futures and options after-hours trading system, following developments at a US conference. The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said four New York commodities exchanges agreed to become affiliated to the Globex system. It was also announced that a new test for Globex had been set for late March. Investors also feel that the stock is unlikely to be affected by the outcome of the general election as 80 per cent of the group's business is conducted overseas. Rosehaugh steady Troubled property group Rosehaugh finally won approval yesterday for its long-awaited Pounds 315m re-financing package from a syndicate of 28 banks, led by Barclays and NatWest. The market responded positively, the shares gaining 2 1/4 to 9p in busy volume of 3.1m, not least because there had been serious concerns whether the developer would survive. The shares have declined from a high point of Pounds 7.42 in October 1987 as the company has mirrored the dramatic fall in property and office rental prices. Last year, Rosehaugh, which is joint-developer of London's prestigious Broadgate and Ludgate sites, lost Pounds 227m, and last month also lost its vice-chairman Mr Godfrey Bradman. Analyst Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest commented: 'The banks will have demanded an awful price for this arrangement which will inevitably come at the expense of shareholders.' Mr Michael Padley at Strauss Turnbull is more optimistic, but believes the deal, combined with cuts in interest rates to single figures in the next two years, will bring Rosehaugh into play - with MEPC and Hammerson tipped as possible predators. Once again, utilities suffered in sympathy with the declining fortunes of the government. Almost all the water companies were weak with Anglian (off 3 at 326p) and Severn Trent (off 5 1/2 at 319 1/2 p) being among the bigger losers. The Electricity Package fell Pounds 45 to Pounds 2,493. Profit-taking in Midland Bank saw the shares off 17 at 343p. Buyers in the US lent support to Glaxo which picked up 8 to 764p. The shares have been sold heavily on the worries of a French investigation into the pharmaceuticals company's marketing policy. They have also suffered from sinking below a perceived support level of 770p. Consumer products and healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman slipped 10 to 674p. The group which reports its 1991 profits on Tuesday is expected to come up with very little growth at the earnings per share level and profits of between Pounds 250m to Pounds 265m, up from Pounds 235m last year. Amusement machine and nursing home group Kunick issued a statement over its the performance of its shares - which have declined by almost a half in over a week - denying any knowledge of the reason why. Talk in the market was concern over trading conditions in the gaming machine business. The shares rallied before steadying to 6 1/2 p in turnover of 2.3m. Nervous selling ahead of the results due this week took 9 off Kingfisher which closed at 466p. Elsewhere among retail stores, GUS was weak, finally 23 off at 1,460p although the shares are a thin market. Marks &amp; Spencer slipped 8 to 302p on continued nervousness over the outlook for consumer spending. Booker, the food and agricultural products group, turned easier with the market as traders took a cautious line ahead of the trading results due at mid-week. The shares lost 16 to 427p. However, many other leading stocks in the food manufacturing sector held up well as some brokerage houses argued that they are strong enough to resist recessionary pressures and good buys for the economic recovery phase - when it sets in. United Biscuit a penny better at 407p were sustained by bid speculation, while Cadbury Schweppes, 3 up at 437p improved as investors absorbed the details of the Pounds 188m Mexican purchase, for which a Pounds 145m share placing is intended. Rank Hovis McDougall held steady at 217p but Tate &amp; Lyle at 418p lost 5 in late trading. But the food supermarket groups, regarded as closer to the front line in the consumer spending contest, lacked confidence. Kwik Save, finally 12 of at 544p saw some selling pressure and Tesco, 2 off at 245p shaded lower. Among the regional brewers, Morland had another active session but, in the absence of developments after the bid speculation of the previous session, the shares ended 12 down at 458p. Devenish, suggested by some as a potential suitor, showed no change at 233p. Guinness up 2 at 558p edged higher at the close, reflecting a move to quality, according to some analysts. However, both Allied-Lyons down 8 at 608p and Whitbread 12 lower at 403p shared in the general downturn in equities. Speculation that Luxembourg-based group Minorco may launch a takeover bid boosted Tarmac for the second day running. The shares rose 8 to 146p, with a strong turnover of 9.8m shares giving some credence to the talk. Bid talk also spilled over into Pilkington which gained 6 to 126p. TI Group added 10 to 653p, rounding off a positive week, as investors again saw it as a safe stock in an uncertain trading period. Industrial conglomerate Lonrho, talked up all week on bid speculation, lost 6 to 102p on profit-taking. Speciality chemicals group Laporte continued its slide, losing 14 to 550p ahead of the placing of its stake by Solvay of Belgium. However volume was low and the fall was prompted more by marketmakers reducing their prices than by genuine selling. Courtaulds remained firm on the back of a series of presentations. Yesterday, it was the turn of institutions in Scotland. The shares rose 5 to 539p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (26).

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Grigoryan: "End of a Legend?: A Captive </F> Mujahidin Debunks the Myths"]    [Text] Various rumors, frequently bordering on  fantasy, concerning mujahidin have been going around for several  months now. The news media of Azerbaijan, skillfully stirring up  interest in them, have been creating, not unsuccessfully, in the  person of the mujahidin the heroic image of fighters for the  faith and professional warriors. However, for a long time we  were unable to find out what the mujahidin actually represent.  Various gossip and rumors from Karabakh were highly  contradictory, and it was difficult ascertaining anything  specific. Altogether recently the Karabakhers succeeded in  capturing near Fizuli a mujahidin whose evidence has thrown a  good deal of light on the situation. Bakhtior Verbollakh  Baberzai, commander of a "twenty" (20 men), was born in 1974, is  from the Rashiddustan tribe, lived in the city of Mazar-e Sharif  in the north of Afghanistan, and had left behind at home a  mother and sister. During a bout of artillery shelling he was  wounded in the eye and arm. Our doctors had to work very hard to  get him back on his feet. What, for all that, has brought the  mujahidin to Azerbaijan: Muslim solidarity or a chance to make  some money?    The prisoner confessed that all the talk about fighting for  the faith and against the infidel is merely an attempt to  conceal the real reason for the appearance of the mujahidin in  the zone of the Karabakh conflict. They were all promised  generous compensation. Each warrior was promised approximately  $5,000 a month. Even before arriving in Azerbaijan, each Afghan  was paid an advance of 50,000 toman. They were then taken to  Beylagan, where the first disappointment awaited them. They were  arrested in the city by a military patrol and were sent to  prison, where they were treated none too kindly and, in  addition, had all their money taken from them.    Baberzai received his baptism of fire near Goradiz, which is  where they are positioned still. The talk about several thousand  mujahidin is correct as far as it goes since there are at the  front one [line missing] 200 or 300 men. They fight according to  this schedule: One day a week they are at the front, the  remaining days are time off. The mujahidin are allowed to go in  their time off to Baku and Mingechaur. A special flight takes  those wishing to spend their time off at home in Afghanistan.    All problems arising with the mujahidin are resolved by  their  compatriot, one Vaidallakh, who is to be found in Baku and who  is their official representative.    The prisoner was the commander of a "twenty." Of the 20 men,  15 were Afghans, five, Azerbaijanis, whom, Baberzai maintains,  they killed themselves. Relations with the Azerbaijanis did not  amount to much right from the start, and all contacts with them  were reduced to a minimum. "Money and drugs--that's what [line  missing] the prisoner, maintaining that the Azerbaijanis  remember them only when they want to obtain narcotics. The drugs  trade is highly profitable, he says, and the income from it is  frequently higher than the compensation promised by the  Government of Azerbaijan for military services.    Concerning habitation and sustenance, the prisoner confirmed  that they eat and live separately, since their coreligionists  "live like the impious." Medical services are organized in  Beylagan, where the wounded and sick mujahidin are treated.  Despite the promises of the authorities, not all return home, it  is true. Lest they attract the discontent and anger of the  relatives of the deceased and also to conceal the true picture  of losses among the Afghans the Government of Azerbaijan does  not send all the deceased home. Many of them have found eternal  refuge on Azerbaijani soil.    As far as the rumors concerning clashes with Russians are  concerned, the prisoner admitted that his group had not  encountered them personally. But clashes between the mujahidin  themselves, the supporters of various groupings and parties,  occur very often, which is causing the authorities of Azerbaijan  a great deal of trouble.    The prisoner is, despite it all, optimistic. He acknowledged  that he misses his mother and sister very much and hopes, with  Allah's help, for a safe return home.</p>

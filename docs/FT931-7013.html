			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Shell The patrician sang froid of the Shell board in London yesterday was in marked and unwelcome contrast to the ritual slaughter at Showa Shell in Tokyo. While there are some decent excuses for the failure to pick up the unauthorised forex dealings, a little public abasement goes a long way towards drawing the sting of tabloid criticism. It is also a bit thick for Shell to hide behind Showa Shell's associate status as an explanation for lack of control. Associate or not, such companies can bite back. Still, at least Shell could find plenty of plusses to fill in the hole in its preliminary figures. The artificial assistance of tax credits and, ironically enough, foreign exchange movements, rather flatter the total. At the operational level, things remain tough. European chemicals losses are accelerating and the situation will not improve without substantial retrenchment. Refining margins remain low and production cannot offer much further help without a significant rise in the oil price. Earnings in dollar terms are likely to fall this year, which explains the cautious 5 per cent final dividend increase at Transport and Trading. Indeed, the final dividend at Royal Dutch rose by a mere 2 per cent - presumably because continental investors take a longer view than those in the UK. Only the continued weakness of the pound will make things look better, come the 1993 sterling accounts.</p>

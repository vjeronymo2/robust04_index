			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent </F> Smallholders Party, by Ildiko Horvath: "Will You Extend Your  Hand to the Hungarian Democratic Forum?"]    [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] wants to step  to the front of a national cooperation that is rather necessary  now to change somewhat the situation that emerged after the  elections, MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi declared recently. He  thinks it is possible that the MDF will get in contact with the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP] in places where candidates of these  parties are still running. We asked FKGP Chairman Jozsef  Torgyan, whose party is also interested in driving back the  left, whether they are ready to help out the MDF.    [Torgyan] The FKGP thinks that the MDF is definitely  responsible for the current situation. We must start from this  premise in developing our strategy. Our party continues to  preserve its firm principles which it also preserved in the past  years, and this is the condition for any cooperation.  Therefore, we see primarily contacts with the KDNP as  realistic. Besides, before the second round of elections, we do  not have any points of confrontation that cannot be bridged.  Certain concrete agreements in some given areas on supporting  candidates are naturally not excluded. However, we will not  renounce the possibilities of any of our candidates.    [Horvath] The MDF also hopes for such support.    [Torgyan] The policy of the MDF contributed to the tragedy  of the national wing. They wanted to destroy the FKGP. By  this, they revived the Communists. For any cooperation with the  MDF, we need top-level principled coordination regarding the  future policy of the two parties. Time will tell whether any  cooperation can emerge regarding individual places.</p>

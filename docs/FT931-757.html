			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Probe continues as BP fraud case ends THE jailing of two oil industry 'information brokers' yesterday marks the end of the first phase of a continuing Serious Fraud Office corruption investigation involving some of the best-known companies in European engineering. Mr Paolo Sorelli and Mr Josef Szrajber were both found guilty of conspiring to defraud British Petroleum. Sentencing was adjourned until April 23, and both will remain in custody until then. BP fell victim to fraud because staff members sold confidential details of its contract tenders to middlemen supposedly denied access to such information. This was then passed, for a price, to companies competing for the highly lucrative engineering contracts associated with oil production in the North Sea. These companies included Thyssen, the German steel giant, Sulzer Pumps GB, Borsig GmbH and a number of large Japanese concerns. The corruption centred around the sealed-bid tender system operated by BP - a system regarded throughout many industries as the best practice means of achieving maximum value when putting work to tender. But by cultivating key BP personnel within the oil company's procurement department at Harlow in Essex, the two middlemen, Mr Sorelli and Mr Szrajber, subverted the system and earned substantial commissions by selling information to tendering companies. Mr Sorelli made the contacts with BP staff, while Mr Szrajber sold the information to bidding companies. A former BP employee named in court as one source of the information sold by the men was Mr Alan Owen, a former chief buyer with the company's procurement department. The complex sealed-bid system was manipulated in a variety of ways. The information could be used to either undercut a rival bidder or push up the price BP was eventually charged. On other occasions it enabled an advantage to be gained during negotiations, supposed to clarify technical and other details, which took place between BP's procurement staff and a bidding company after the bids were in. The sums involved were considerable. The sample charges put before the jury concerned 11 contracts awarded between 1988 and 1990 for pipes and pumping equipment worth up to Pounds 50m each. The commissions were usually worth 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the contract values. Those paid to Mr Sorelli for the 11 contracts totalled more than Pounds 890,000. Those paid to Mr Szrajber amounted to about Pounds 524,000. Further sums totalling almost Pounds 300,000 were paid to others, including BP and Thyssen staff. One Thyssen employee, Mr Manfred Reuss, took regular commissions when his company won a contract, the court was told. The corruption first came to BP's attention early in 1990 when it was alerted to irregularities within its procurement department and an inter-nal investigation was launch-ed. During the searches of Mr Szrajber's home police found records which outlined his system of receiving and paying his commissions. This discovery led the police to Mr Sorelli.</p>

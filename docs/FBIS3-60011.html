Gaston Martinique [no title given] informed us about  existing  and future agreements.    Martinique: There is an agreement that will remain  in force until March. The Bolivian Government has committed  itself to eradicating 4,500 hectares. I am deeply satisfied to  report that so far we have fulfilled the second target of the  agreement. We have eradicated approximately 2,350 hectares.    Reporter Amalia Pando: Gaston, what amount will  the United States give as credit in return for this, although  this is not actually a credit but a donation, sort of  compensation, right?    Martinique: It is a fund of approximately $40  million, which supports the balance of trade. They disbursed $10  million after we fulfilled the first target. Now that we have  fulfilled the second target, we expect disbursement of another  $10 million installment, and the remaining $20 million before  March.    Pando: To start from scratch after March?    Martinique: Right. At that time we will design the  new targets under the new policy that I described to you, a  policy of agreement and coordination with coca growers.    Summing up, to date the government has fulfilled only 50  percent of its eradication commitment, and it has only three  months to eradicate the other 50 percent, that is, 2,200  hectares. The government is confident this will be done through  a policy of agreements with coca growers.    This will decide the fate of $20 million the United States  will deliver to the Bolivian Central Bank.    According to Martinique, the alternative development policy  will be maintained. In 1994, this policy will demand investments  of $25 million, which the government will obtain from foreign  countries and international organizations interested in the  replacement of coca farms.</p>

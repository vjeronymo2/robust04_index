			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard shares dip in spite of strong growth HEWLETT-Packard, the US electronics and computer systems company, reported strong growth in sales and earnings for its fourth quarter. But concerns about increased costs and inventories drove down the shares Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 73 3/4 . Net earnings for the quarter rose to Dollars 298m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, from Dollars 68m or 28 cents in the same period last year when the company took a restructuring charge of 36 cents a share. Net revenue rose 32 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 4.3bn. 'This quarter was a big improvement over last year's fourth quarter,' said Mr Lewis Platt, HP chairman, president and chief executive. 'But upward pressure on cost of sales continued, and inventory levels were higher than we'd like.' HP's cost of sales for the fourth quarter was 61.4 per cent of net revenue, against 58.1 per cent in the same period last year. Price cuts and a continuing shift toward products carrying higher sales costs were factors, the company said. Inventories increased 41 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn from Dollars 2.6bn at the end of the last fiscal year. Part of the increase was attributable to new product introductions, the company said. Operating expenses rose 11 per cent to 30.2 per cent of net revenue from 35.9 per cent in the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 1993, revenue rose 24 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, from Dollars 16.4bn. With revenues of Dollars 15.6bn from computer products, service and support, HP has become the second-largest US computer company, after IBM, overtaking Digital Equipment. Net earnings for the year were Dollars 1.2bn, or Dollars 4.65 a share, compared with Dollars 549m, or Dollars 2.18, last time after special charges. Before these charges, HP earned Dollars 972m, or Dollars 3.85 a share last year. Mr Platt said the company would launch important new products in several sectors in fiscal 1994 and efforts to reduce expense structures would remain a high priority.</p>

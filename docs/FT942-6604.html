			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Schneider chief held on fraud charges Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the French electrical and engineering group, was yesterday detained in a Brussels prison on charges which include embezzlement and the falsification of annual accounts, the company said yesterday. Schneider said it rejected the charges, which were brought by a Belgian prosecuting magistrate and relate to complaints filed by minority shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel, two Belgian financial subsidiaries of the French group. Schneider launched an offer to take full control of the companies in November 1992 as part of the restructuring of its Belgian activities. The terms of the offer were strongly contested by minority shareholders in the two companies, who took legal action to secure a higher price and claimed irregularities in documents relating to the offer. Schneider agreed an out-of-court settlement on the price with the minority shareholders at the beginning of this year. The complaints of the minority shareholders, however, had prompted the Brussels judicial authorities to open an investigation last autumn. Schneider said its chairman had been charged with 'forgery and use of fraudulent documents, embezzlement, falsifying annual accounts, breach of trust and breach of accounting laws'. According to Schneider, the Belgian state investigator is accusing the French group of having managed its Belgian subsidiaries in a way that was detrimental to minority shareholders. Schneider said its management and employees were 'deeply angered and shocked by the action taken against their chairman'. The company rejected the charges against Mr Pineau-Valencienne and said it had always acted in the interest of all of its shareholders. Shares in Schneider fell sharply following the announcement of charges, losing almost 6 per cent of their value to close at FFr390. The company, which is one of the CAC-40 leading industrial shares on the Paris bourse, has annual sales of about FFr56.4bn. According to Schneider, Mr Pineau-Valencienne had travelled voluntarily to Brussels on Thursday to make a statement before the legal authorities and had requested a hearing on the issue. Schneider said it was unclear how long Mr Pineau-Valencienne would be detained. But he said it was possible the detention could last until Wednesday, when he is due to appear in court for a hearing. The company said it was staggered by yesterday's events, particularly because it had resolved the dispute concerning the terms of the acquisition of Cofibel and Cofimines. To reach the agreement, Schneider increased its offer for the acquisition of Cofibel and its subsidiary, Cofimines, by FFr60m to take the total cost of the deal to FFr1.4bn (Pounds 163m).</p>

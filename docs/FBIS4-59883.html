			<p>BFN     [Text] In their meeting last night in Oslo, Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman 'Arafat agreed on  principles and an agenda to begin negotiations on widening the  authority of Palestinian self-rule to other areas of Judaea and  Samaria, aside from Jericho. The negotiations are to take place  in Cairo, but no date was set. Peres told reporters the  withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza Strip has been completed  properly.</p>

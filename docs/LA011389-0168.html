			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> KIMBALL MAY ALTER PLEA TO PROTECT INSURANCE MONEY  </P> <P> Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball may be allowed to change his guilty plea in  a drunk-driving manslaughter case to safeguard insurance money for victims and  their families, his attorney said.  </P> <P> The guilty plea Kimball entered Wednesday could amount to a breach of contract  and allow his insurance company to cancel a $1.3-million liability insurance  policy, said Frank Quesada, a lawyer for the 1984 silver medalist.  </P> <P> So Kimball may seek to change his plea to "no contest" before sentencing on  Jan. 30, Quesada said.  </P> <P> "The company could cut Kimball loose," he said. "It has nothing to do with the  way Bruce feels. . . . A change (in pleas) would be all for the victims."  </P> <P> Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe III said he would accept a no-contest  plea if it's proven his policy would be canceled.  </P> <P> Kimball pleaded guilty after listening to only a few minutes of testimony about  the Aug. 1 crash, which killed two teen-agers and injured four others. He said  he wanted to spare the families the grief of hearing descriptions about how his  car plowed into the youths on a dead-end road in suburban Brandon.  </P> <P> Kimball, 25, is being held in Hillsborough County Jail awaiting sentencing.  </P></p>

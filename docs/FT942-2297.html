			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Timber group in Dollars 1bn alliance Indonesian and Malaysian corporate interests are to form one of the world's biggest timber concerns in a complex deal valued at around Dollars 1bn. Barito Pacific Timber, one of Indonesia's largest companies and the world's leading plywood exporter, will purchase about 70 per cent of Construction and Supplies House group (Cash), a relatively small, loss-making building supplies company listed on the Kuala Lumpur exchange. At the same time Cash is to buy a 30 per cent interest in Barito Pacific. The deal is the biggest cross-border transaction so far between listed companies in south-east Asia. Malaysia and Indonesia account for more than 90 per cent of global tropical plywood production and analysts suggest the two countries could be seeking greater control of plywood prices through the alliance. Barito Pacific has timber concessions in Indonesia of more than 5m hectares  -an area larger than Switzerland. The company is controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, an Indonesian Chinese who has become one of Indonesia's leading corporate figures. Apart from Barito, Mr Prajogo has a 10 per cent holding in Astra International, one of Indonesia's biggest conglomerates, and has business partnerships with two of the children of President Suharto. Last year about 12 per cent of Barito was listed on the Jakarta stock exchange and the company now accounts for more than 10 per cent of the stock market's total capitalisation. Private family interests of Mr Prajogo control the rest of Barito. At a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Prajogo said the alliance with the Cash group was the first step in plans for Barito to go international. Analysts feel Mr Prajogo has other reasons for the move. Recent industrial disputes and riots in Indonesia have made the small but economically powerful Chinese community nervous. The Cash deal effectively moves a large part of Mr Prajogo's private assets offshore. By injecting a substantial part of his private interests into a listed Malaysian concern, Mr Prajogo will take advantage of the high price/earnings ratios commanded by timber companies on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. Foreign fund managers are also seen to favour Kuala Lumpur-listed companies over those listed in Jakarta. On completion of the deal, Mr Prajogo will still retain control of Barito and own more than 60 per cent of Cash. The newly enlarged Cash will become one of the biggest timber companies on the Kuala Lumpur exchange. The terms of the transaction, valued at MDollars 2.59m (Dollars 1bn), include Mr Prajogo injecting privately held interests in Papua New Guinea and China into Cash in exchange for newly issued Cash shares. Cash will use a combination of rights issues, cash and irredeemable, convertible unsecured loan stocks to purchase 30 per cent of Barito shares.</p>

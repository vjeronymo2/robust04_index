			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (6): Confidence crisis - The Financial System EVER since it became clear that there was something desperately wrong with the Japanese stock market, the world financial community has been anxiously awaiting the fall-out. The immediate fear was that the mighty Japanese financial institutions would pull out of the international arena: in particular, that banks would withdraw from overseas lending. The problem was seen as a mechanical one: that as the Nikkei index fell, the banks' capital bases would be eroded, causing them to cut back lending to keep within internationally-agreed rules on the ratio of loans to bank capital. That specific problem may have been exaggerated. However, the broader question of the health of the Japanese financial system remains open to anxious debate. Mr Takasha Kiuchi, chief economist of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, points out that the banks' ability to lend depends not only on the level of the equity market, which affects their asset base, but on the yen-dollar rate, which affects the value of their dollar-based loans. On both counts, he is fairly optimistic. 'We presently think the Nikkei index is below its normal range, which on various measures should be between 18,000 and 20,000. If it gets back within that range and the yen stays above Y130 to the dollar, the long-term credit banks and city banks can probably expand their lending at a similar rate to last year's 4 per cent. That didn't cause any strain, and this year we don't expect a recovery strong enough to need more than that'. Not everyone in Tokyo is so sanguine. Mr Peter Tasker, of the merchant bank and stockbroker Kleinwort Benson, says: 'The problems of the banking system are very serious'. Suppose, to take an extreme case, the Nikkei index were to fall further to 10,000. 'The cost of that would be paid by the real economy for years to come. The banks' hidden reserves would disappear, so they couldn't use them to offset bad loans as they did in the past. So it would take many years to absorb bad debts. That means raising banking spreads, which means slower economic growth. 'The Japanese blue-chip industrials may have access to alternative funding sources such as the Euromarkets. But the small- to medium-sized companies - the heart of industrial Japan - rely wholly on the banks. In a worst case, that could hold the economy back for six or eight years'. As for the contraction in Japanese bank lending abroad, it has already happened. Ms Alicia Ogawa, of S G Warburg in Tokyo, says: 'In the year to March 1990, loan growth overseas by the Japanese banks was three times as high as in the domestic market. By 1991 it was actually negative. In 1992 it will be the same, and again in 1993. The banks got badly burnt in the UK and have no interest in Europe. In the US, they're doing a lot of strategic re-thinking. The only overseas markets they're still interested in are in Asia, especially mainland China'. In any case, Ms Ogawa says, generalisations about the health of the Japanese banking system at present are largely meaningless. This is because nobody knows the true scale of their bad debts. 'In most Japanese townships', Ms Ogawa says, 'depositors have only the regional banks or the government savings bank to choose from. There has been a lot of switching into the savings bank already. If the regional banks had to announce bad debts equivalent to six or seven times their capital, the exodus would reach tidal wave proportions'. Bad debts, Ms Ogawa estimates, must amount to between 5 and 10 per cent of the average bank's loan portfolio. In addition, she points out, some Japanese companies do not have to disclose off-balance sheet loan guarantees which they have made to their own subsidiaries. 'In some cases, that could exceed the company's assets. So the banks don't always have a real idea of their customers' collateral either'. Even those who dispute the seriousness of the banks' position would concede that the other pillars of the Japanese financial system, the insurance companies, are changing their behaviour as a result of the bursting of the bubble. Mr Yasuo Kanzaki, deputy president of the Tokyo stockbrokers Nikko Securities, says: 'In the past, the insurance companies weren't so concerned about currency risks. They claimed to have plenty of hidden reserves, so they could offset currency losses by realising unrealised capital gains. 'Now the stock market has collapsed, their currency risk is uncovered. A lot of my friends in overseas portfolio management now say that if the yen goes up any more, they're exposed. In the past, they could ask the domestic portfolio managers in the same organisation to cover for them from their profits. Now their domestic colleagues aren't so generous. And if the rising trend in the Japanese trade surplus is a guide, the yen could still be undervalued. So they're very nervous'. Given the traditional role of the Japanese insurers in funding the US budget deficit, this trend could eventually prove fairly serious. At the margin, it could push up US long-term interest rates, further jeopardising US economic recovery. But in the end, the plight of the financial institutions in Japan belongs in a wider context. As time goes by, it is becoming apparent that the true effect of the bursting of Japan's asset bubble is to cause a crisis of confidence in the wider economy. 'The body is sound', says Professor Makoto Utsumi of the Ministry of Finance, 'but the brain is suffering from neurosis. The result is a 'Don't take risks' syndrome which is very serious'. The problem thus goes beyond the availability of Japanese finance to service a world economic recovery. Important though that issue is, the real question is how far the Japanese economy will be able to act as an engine of growth to pull its trading partners out of recession. If the neurosis proves as serious as Professor Utsumi fears, the world may be disappointed.</p>

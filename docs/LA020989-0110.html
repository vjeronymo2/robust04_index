			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Despite objections of some longtime residents, the Carmel City Council voted  unanimously Tuesday to allow director Henry Winkler to film a Disney movie  starring Tom Hanks in their picturesque costal village in April. A vocal group  of citizens had made it known that they were fed up with fame, overdosed on  tourists after the days of Mayor Clint Eastwood and longed for a more low-key  community atmosphere. The film, "Turner and Hooch," an action comedy, teams  Hanks with Mare Winningham and a big dog named Beasley. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

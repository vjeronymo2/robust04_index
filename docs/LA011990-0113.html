			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTIST HELD IN SHOOTING OF BLUNT NAGASAKI MAYOR  </P> <P> Police arrested a reputed leader of a right-wing extremist group Thursday in  the shooting of Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki, who had provoked  nationalist ire and received numerous death threats after remarking 13 months  ago that Emperor Hirohito was partly responsible for World War II.  </P> <P> The man under arrest, Kazumi Tajiri, 40, confessed to firing a single pistol  shot into Motoshima's back as he left the city hall a few hours earlier, a  police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Tajiri was arrested in a local hotel and charged with attempted murder after  fleeing the scene in a rental car, which the police found abandoned less than  half a mile away. Tajiri had rented the car in his own name, which allowed the  police to track him down, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Motoshima, 67, was reported in stable condition Thursday night at Nagasaki  Public Hospital after undergoing two hours of surgery. The bullet bounced off a  rib, pierced the left lung and narrowly missed the mayor's heart before  emerging from his chest, surgeons were quoted as saying.  </P> <P> The shooting was decried by political leaders and social commentators as an act  of terrorism. Some of them warned that free speech in Japan is under attack by  the right wing.  </P> <P> "Speech must be refuted only with speech," said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary  general of the Japan Socialist Party, who was himself attacked, but not  injured, by right-wing extremists while delivering a lecture last May. "The use  of violence cannot be permitted."  </P> <P> Tajiri was identified by police as a leader of Seiki Juku, a rightist  organization of 31 members established in Nagasaki in 1981. A man answering the  telephone at Seiki Juku's office Thursday night said the group had no comment  on Tajiri's arrest or the attempt on Motoshima's life.  </P> <P> Controversy erupted in December, 1988, after Motoshima addressed the question  of the late Emperor Hirohito's wartime responsibility in remarks before the  Nagasaki City Assembly on the 47th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl  Harbor. Nagasaki was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb on Aug. 9, 1945, three  days after Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15.  </P> <P> Motoshima's comments broke a clear-cut taboo on criticizing Hirohito, who was  then on his deathbed suffering from cancer.  </P> <P> Right-wing groups denounced Motoshima. Japan's hard-core nationalists, many of  whom allegedly have ties to organized crime, typically glorify the emperor and  wear military-style uniforms. The groups, which number in the hundreds, are  generally considered harmless, but violence occasionally erupts.  </P></p>

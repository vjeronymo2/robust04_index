			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRADE A ON THE B&amp;B  </P> <P> My wife and I just returned from a week's stay at the House of Blue Ginger, a  B&amp;B at 47-504A Lulani St., Kaneohe, Hawaii 96744 on Oahu. We confirm Jerry  Hulse's tip in an earlier column. It is a marvelous alternative to staying in  Waikiki.  </P> <P> HELEN AND GERALD LERMAN  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

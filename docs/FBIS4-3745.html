			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Trade delegations  from China's five autonomous regions are making active trades at  the ongoing '94 Spring Chinese Export Commodities Fair held in  Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province.    The Guangzhou fair, which opened on the morning of April 15,  is held biannually, in spring and autumn. This is the 75th  session. Some 2,800 enterprises on the Chinese Mainland have  brought products to the fair.    Trade delegation from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region  made successful deals worth 39 million U.S. dollars in the first  five days of the fair, accounting for 80 percent of the  delegation's early-set target.    The trade mission from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is  making full use of the autonomous region's advantages to  actively open up markets in Muslim countries, while maintaining  its existing markets in Hong Kong and the United States.    Xinjiang chalked up a business volume of 16.48 million U.S.  dollars in the first five days alone, with its local products  such as Hami melons showing sharp increases compared with  corresponding figures of previous spring sessions.    Chinese caterpillar fungus, which is a local product found  only in Tibet, has won favor from businessmen from Singapore,  Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Besides these, Tibetan carpets and  highland barley juice from Tibet are also in great demand at the  fair.    Trading officials from Tibet told reporters that they could  not only do businesses at the fair, but also make new friends  through the fair.    Also, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region would not like to  be left behind. Trading officials from the autonomous region  have made active efforts to sell local products, such as rosin  and talcum. In the first five days, the trading delegation  clinched a business volume of 74 million U.S. dollars.</p>

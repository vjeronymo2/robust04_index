			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Aleksey Portanskiy and Sergey Krayukhin under </F> the general heading: "In St. Petersburg Eurobank and `Dixon'  Group Take Different Views of Our Country"]    [Text] St. Petersburg -- The third annual meeting of the  board of governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development (EBRD) was held in St. Petersburg's Tavricheskiy  Palace on 18 and 19 April. According to its president, Jacques  de Larosiere, the meeting was successful and its outcome  positive.    One person I spoke with in the Tavricheskiy Palace was Boris  Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, where an EBRD pilot  project to assist in the creation of small and medium-size  businesses has been up and running for a long time.    "What the European Bank is aiming at above all," B. Nemtsov  said, "is small production outfits and the services sphere, not  trade in its present mass resale form. EBRD repesentatives  carry out a most meticulous study of the partner, right down to  his moral character and habits, before providing credit."    You could say that the EBRD's policy is not only tough (in  terms of partner selection), but also one of high principles and  integrity. The bank's own reputation is extremely important to  it and, as we know, it is based on the results of what it does.  When the EBRD okays participation in a project it means that it  adds its own 35 percent to the one-fourth of the funds put up by  the particular enterprise. The very fact that it is involved in  the particular business then changes things radically: The  quest for a third partner to make up the difference is no longer  a problem when the EBRD is operating in tandem.    That, briefly, is the way the bank operates in Russia, and  this mechanism really is working, although the volume of  financing is not so great at the moment compared with the scale  of activity in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast. The experimental  projects that are under way in Nizhniy Novgorod and Tula will  soon spread to Tomsk, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin confirmed in  his speech in the Tavricheskiy Palace.    The Russian emphasis in the EBRD's activities markedly  strengthened when Jacques de Larosiere became president, many  financial experts acknowledge. The new bank chief has already  managed to do a great deal to restore the EBRD's reputation and  confidence in it, following the scandal resulting from  overexpenditure on its own needs under his predecessor.  [Portanskiy ends]    At the very same time (16-19 April) as the bank forum  organized by the EBRD was taking plce with great pomp and  ceremony in the Tavricheskiy Palace, on the other side of the  road, in the famous Kikin Apartments, another international  conference was in progress. The conference, organized by the  European Investment Journal and the "Dixon" company, also  attracted the attention of banking and business circles.    The idea of the "Dixon" firm's conference was simultaneously  to present a number of St. Petersburg projects that had been  selected for Western businessmen to look at and possibly invest  in. The conpany's experts had carefully studied and analyzed  more than 300 promising projects and finally selected around 20  for this review. They inluded projects by the "Impuls,"  "Pozitron," and "Balt Elektro" science and production  associations and a number of others.    The techniques and methods of assessment used by the "Dixon"  firm differ from the EBRD's expert evaluations. The EBRD goes  for large-scale projects, whereas the "Dixon" company's experts  believe that, given the political and economic instability in  Russia, Western businessmen are unlikely to put their capital at  risk, therefore it is more realistic to expect them to  participate in small but well planned and well costed projects.    Although Company President Mark Dixon criticized the EBRD  and  believes that its current leadership needs to overcome  bureaucratic tendencies in its work and make more flexible use  of the bank's potential for active involvement in the Russian  market, he is prepared to participate in some EBRD projects.    Having studied the current situation, the "Dixon" company's  experts arrived at the conclusion that around 10,000 Russian  enterprises can lay claim to real investment support on the part  of the West. At the same time, every year only around 500 out  of approximately 50,000 promising projects find investors, so  Western companies and firms need to step up their activities in  this sphere, Mark Dixon stressed.    At the final press conference on the results of the meeting  the "Dixon" company president announced that St. Petersburg City  Hall officials had done their level best to prevent the  conference from being held in the Kikin Apartments and even  tried to wreck it. This is intolerable, Mark Dixon believes, in  a civilized democratic society in which people should be free to  express different views and opinions.</p>

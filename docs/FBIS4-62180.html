			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Moscow Has Still Not Decided </F> Whether To Cancel Syrian Debts. Reports of Russian Generosity  Were Exaggerated"]    [Text] It has not been ruled out that a small portion of  Syria's debts to the Soviet Union, which have now been inherited  by Russia, will be written off. A Russian Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations staffer refused to be drawn on how far  Moscow's generosity would extend while negotiations are still in  progress.    Some Arab newspapers have been quick to report that an  agreement was signed during the visit to Damascus by Russian  First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets and that Russia canceled 90  percent of Syria's debts.    Yuriy Mikhaylov, advisor to the vice premier, who was in the  delegation along with representatives from the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations, has stated that no agreement on debt  was reached, although there are high hopes of resolving the  problem this year.    The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations staffer reported  that the exact total of Syria's debts is in the order of $11  billion. Of this total, almost $4 billion are overdue payments.  Moreover, the USSR gave Syria a total of $205 million in freely  convertible currency. The rest is composed of ruble loans,  mainly to acquire arms and military equipment in the USSR, and  also interest.    Damascus has in fact been pressing for the bulk of the debt  -- which has emerged as the result of unproductive spending on  military purposes -- to be written off, for repayment conditions  to be relaxed, and first and foremost for the right to pay in  installments over 20 years. Moscow favors the fulfillment of  the contractual obligations relating to every loan and the  repayment of the debt by 2005, at least with regard to the  foreign currency loans. It is envisaged that the remaining  amount will be paid off by deliveries of commodities (Syria has  approximately 70 commodity categories which are in demand on  world markets), by financing Russian institutions in Syria, and  also via reinvestment in the local economy.    The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations is convinced of  Syria's creditworthiness. Before the collapse of the  transaction clearing system, when Russia stopped meeting its  commitments, Damascus was punctually paying off 400-500 million  clearing rubles a year in order to cancel its debts. By 1994  Syria had paid back a total of $5.2 billion. Its present  financial and economic well-being is not causing any concern to  specialists, and it is undoubtedly a major trading partner of  ours.    Following the cooling of relations between the USSR and  Egypt, Syria remained Moscow's only strategic partner in the  Near East. Russia intends to preserve this special relationship.    Political factors, and also the bid price (going rate) of  Syrian debt on the world debt market will be taken into account  in determining the percentage of the debt to be written off, if  indeed things reach that stage, the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations staffer said. In any case we are only talking about  fairly insignificant sums and certainly not 90 percent of the  debt. This concession, the ministry claims, does not create a  dangerous precedent for debt negotiations with other countries.</p>

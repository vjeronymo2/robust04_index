			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dieter Kirchner, main manager of the </F> Gesamtmetall metal industry employers' association, by Alexander  Jung; place and date not given: "No New Costs"]    [Text] [Jung] Two days before the strike scheduled for  the metal industry you came to an agreement with the IG-Metall  trade union. Was the whole thing just a show, a ritual, or did  Chancellor Kohl put pressure on you?    [Kirchner] Not at all. We worked out the agreement  ourselves, and we are rather proud of that. I make it clear:  We were not staging a show.    [Jung] Were there long faces among your people?    [Kirchner] The Gesamtmetall Executive Committee unanimously  approved the result. Of course, some entrepreneur or other may  not be enthusiastic. But we have found a fair compromise that  pays off.    [Jung] Medium-sized companies in particular are teetering on  the brink.    [Kirchner] Medium-sized industry, too, will recognize the  advantages of this contract. We have developed a number of  flexible models, which had not previously existed. And it is  particularly important is that we have managed to prevent a cost  increase for wages. This year's productivity increase may be  fully invested in improving competitiveness.    [Jung] But the goal was to reduce costs considerably?    [Kirchner] In the final analysis, we have a reduction of  costs. We can compensate for the wage increases of 2 percent:  Until June there are five "zero months." The vacation and  Christmas bonuses are being frozen for three years; in addition,  the 1994 Christmas bonus is being reduced by 10 percent. All  that adds up to a very clear, calculable zero for this year.    [Jung] Does that stop the development of entrepreneurs  nowadays arranging agreements with shop councils on income and  working time on their own?    [Kirchner] I hope so. The area wage contract has been  opened up a little with the new models so that the companies can  adjust their work time in line with their requirements. As a  result, the area wage contract will probably regain acceptance.  The autonomy of collective bargaining has proved its worth in  the crisis.    [Jung] Is the metal industry contract a model for the  negotiations in the public sector that are still continuing?    [Kirchner] We have integrated the agreements at Volkswagen  and in the chemical industry. The public sector and the Public  Services, Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV) will  certainly take the appropriate steps derived from our result.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Walker to put plan to creditors MR GEORGE Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, won leave yesterday to put a plan to his creditors to avoid bankruptcy. He was appearing at the High Court responding to a petition for personal bankruptcy by TSB Bank claiming more than Pounds 9m, writes Maggie Urry. Mr Michael Coleman, of Harkavys, Mr Walker's solicitor, said 'the court today ordered that a creditors' meeting be held on September 10 in order that certain proposals that Mr Walker has been putting forward can be carefully considered by those creditors and can be voted on as to whether they are or are not accepted.' The vote will require a 75 per cent majority by value of the creditors to be agreed. The proposals, which have been reviewed by accountants Stoy Hayward over the past fortnight, are believed to include Mr Walker devoting his next three years' earnings to his creditors. Mr Coleman said 'Mr Walker sincerely hopes that upon careful consideration his creditors will vote in favour of acceptance of those proposals and that he can effectively get back to work.'</p>

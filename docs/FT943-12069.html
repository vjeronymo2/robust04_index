			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Observer: Rwandan welcome Kigali's Hotel Meridien is offering special discounts for the adventurous. If you don't mind bomb-shattered windows, no bar, running water or electricity, you can stay for free. Its manageress, Therese, kept the hotel running during the recent fierce battles between the former Hutu government army and Tutsi guerrillas. Current distinguished guests include about half of the cabinet ministers of Rwanda's new government, who arrived from European exile once the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front declared itself victorious last week. The menu is looking rather sad, dating as it does from March 31, but Fina, a feisty Zairean, will whip up a gourmet meal in short order. For Dollars 20, it can be washed down with a bottle of vintage claret, formerly c/o the French ambassador's residence.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses offer limited reaction to peak oil price Oil prices peaked again in London yesterday, but there was limited reaction in individual oil company share prices on the Continent, writes Our Markets Staff. Zurich was closed for a public holiday. FRANKFURT reported US interest in Volkswagen, and a rise in BASF ahead of the chemical industry's results season, as the Dax index rose 7.15 to 2,153.79, picking up in the post-bourse to end at an Ibis-indicated 2,161.50. Turnover fell from DM5.3bn to DM4.7bn. 'This is a stock picker's market, lacking the liquidity of 1993,' said Mr Craig Abbott of the Banque Nationale de Paris team in Frankfurt. In the automotive sector, VW rose DM5.90 to DM507.90 as BMW fell DM5.50 to DM861.50. Among special, or specialised, industrial situations, Lufthansa put on DM7.50 at DM211.50, PWA DM4.70 at DM235, and SAP 115 at DM3,770. But Mr Abbott said that, in each case, share price moves were probably exaggerated by the lack of liquidity. There was a more studied look about the gains of DM4.10 to DM320.50 in BASF, and DM2.70 to DM363.50 in Bayer. BASF was regarded as the purest bulk chemicals play in the German market, while Bayer fans were subdued a little by worrying developments in US pharmaceuticals. PARIS saw low volume, little obvious reaction to the oil price and, in chemicals, mild trepidation instead of excitement about the Rhone Poulenc first-half results expected on Thursday. The CAC-40 index fell 5.41 to 2,069.58 in light turnover of FFr2.2bn. Alacatel Alsthom, up FFr10 at FFr658, continued to benefit from a Goldman Sachs recommendation, but expectations of lower profits at Rhone Poulenc left the shares FFr2.40 down at FFr130. AMSTERDAM put in a solid performance, concentrating on a sharp rise in futures. The AEX index gained 3.93 at 412.14, the mood enhanced further by steady bonds and the rise in the London market. Among cyclicals reporting tomorrow, Akzo rose Fl 2.30 to Fl 216.70 and DSM Fl 1.40 to Fl 144.40 on hopes of sharply higher second-quarter figures. Nedlloyd added to Friday's Fl 2.90 advance with a Fl 1.60 rise to Fl 72.50. Small investors were said to be taking a lead from brokers' positive recommendations. Among recently underperforming financials, ABN-Amro closed 80 cents higher at Fl 60.10 in volume that jumped to a heavy 1.5m shares as demand picked up after the share price surpassed the Fl 60 resistance level. A 90-cent advance to Fl 55.60 in Philips was attributed to favourable reports in the Dutch press and expectations of strong earnings next week. MILAN was indecisive ahead of today's address to parliament by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, when the prime minister is expected to detail his plans to put distance between his business activities and his governing role. The Comit index edged 1.06 lower to 708.70. Industrials were broadly weaker, with Olivetti losing L30 to L2,399 as foreigners shied away. Among the banks, BCI slid L75 to L4,800 but Credito Italiano added L45 at L2,230 in response to last Friday's annual shareholders meeting. Credito did not announce a capital increase and said that any future capital increases would be used to fund specific investments. The telecommunications sector was mixed. Sip dipped L16 to L4,502 while Stet put on L6 to L5,244. Its former managing director, Mr Michele Tedeschi, who took over yesterday as chairman of the state holding IRI hoped that the programme to start Stet's privatisation would go ahead this autumn. MADRID began August, a traditionally quiet month, with its share prices elevated in thin trading, the general index recovering another 5.68, or 1.8 per cent, to 319.38 in turnover down from Pta29.7bn to Pta26.1bn. Traders said that the market was lifted by strength in the secondary debt market. Interest rate-sensitive stocks led the way up, with BCH and Santander up Pta120 to Pta2,770 and Pta190 to Pta5,200 in a strong banking sector, and Endesa and Iberdrola in utilities closing Pta130 and Pta24 higher at Pta6,260 and Pta970 respectively. Repsol reflected the strength in world oil prices, closing Pta95 better at Pta4,245, and Telefonica led the volume charts in 1.98m shares as it closed Pta10 ahead at Pta1,870. HELSINKI closed higher in relatively active trade as domestic investors returned after the traditional July holiday period. The Hex index gained 15.0, or 0.8 per cent, at 1,860.8, taking the rise for the year so far to 17.6 per cent. Finnair closed FM2.10 stronger at FM39.10 after reaching a new high for the year of FM39.50, with buy recommendations from brokerage houses contributing to the gain. Nokia preferred firmed FM9 to FM511 following strong demand for the shares in New York. VIENNA woke up again as OMV, the oil, gas and chemicals group, rose Sch37, or 4.1 per cent, to Sch946, and the ATX index by 19.87, or 1.8 per cent, to 1,097.57. OMV is due to produce results in three weeks' time, but analysts favoured neither that, nor the global oil price, as influences on yesterday's share price, going instead for talk of an unbundling, detaching the loss-making chemicals division and leaving oil and gas to perform. ATHENS rose 1.6 per cent, the general index finishing 13.56 better at 859.39 as it broke out of a 800-850 trading range.

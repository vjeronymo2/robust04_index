			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid has  stressed that Yemenis will put an end to military and tribal  hegemony. To do this, they have two options: Either to accept  the authority of the military establishment backed by the gangs,  or resist in order to impose democracy, political pluralism, and  human rights. We have chosen the latter path and have paid a  heavy price out of the conviction that our Yemeni masses  understand the situation and realize that our struggle is for  the sake of Yemen -- not just for the sake of the six southern  governorates. We are paying dearly, with our lives and blood,  on behalf of those who have not joined us in the battle for the  national cause.    Replying to a question on the military situation, 'Ali Salim  al-Bid said: We are currently arranging our affairs within the  framework of our state and its institutions. We are currently  working with the institutions of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen as opposed to those of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 'Ali  Salim al-Bid noted that the political Army and the military Army  are coordinating on a large scale. He referred to the confusion  that existed in the initial days of the war, saying it was only  natural because we had not conditioned our masses to be warlike  and destructive, but that when our units started being attacked  in the northern governorates, the logic of reality and struggle  took over and gave rise to a different orientation. The people  began adapting themselves to the new circumstances.    Presidential Council Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We  have begun in practical terms what we have been talking about  and what we have been demanding in part of Yemen for the sake of  the whole of Yemen. It is up to us to compete on a basis of  peace and democracy in order to provide an example acceptable to  the Yemeni people, a model for the future of the modern civil  state based on pluralism, democracy, and human rights. He noted  that if there exists a state in the northern governorates  proceeding along these same lines, there will be no difficulty  in reuniting in the future on the same basis as that on which we  agreed in the pledge and accord document.    Referring to the issue of the recognition of the new  Republic, 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that the coincidence of the  declaration of the new Republic with the 'Id al-Adha festival  has positive implications that will soon become apparent, God  willing. He said contacts made before and during the war with  the presidents and kings of the Arab states arose from our  eagerness to prevent the disaster of war. The presidents and  kings were sympathetic toward our complicated situation which  [words indistinct] force.    On the military situation in al-Anad, 'Ali Salim al-Bid  stressed that the enemy forces there will be unable to  accomplish anything, that good progress is being made there, and  that the enemy forces will never be permitted to take al-Anad.  He invited reporters to go to the base and the area as a whole  to see that for themselves.    On the military situation in Shabwah Governorate, the  Presidential Council chairman confirmed that there is indeed a  current breakthrough in the direction of the Ma'rib because we  did not think they were bent on occupation. He added that the  Sanaa forces have been unable to achieve their desire, which is  to gain control of the oil wells, because the sons of the  Shabwah Governorate have rejected anything like occupation.    The Presidential Council Chairman stressed that our [word  indistinct] alliance with the various parties toward building  the Yemeni state is an ongoing target and all obstacles in the  way of achieving it in the future will be overcome. Everyone is  bound to consider the views of others so that we can build an  institutional state. We are eager to offer our hands to others  and to promote joint action.    Replying to a question on the provision of guarantees for  the  security of oil companies working in our country, the  Presidential Council chairman stressed that the new state will  guarantee the interests of all oil companies in our country and  will provide them with security and stability regardless of cost  inasmuch as there exist joint interests between the new state  and these companies. He said there are good contacts with the  international oil companies which have responded positively.</p>

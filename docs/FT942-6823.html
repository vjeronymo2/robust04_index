			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Greek telecoms returns to market  -The new government has scaled down the flotation The much-delayed flotation of OTE, the Greek telecoms monopoly, is back on track after an eight-month gap caused by a change of government. However, the socialist administration's plan to sell 25 per cent of the company through the Athens stock exchange is less ambitious than the one launched by its conservative predecessor in 1993. The conservatives wanted to sell 49 per cent of OTE, disposing of a 35 per cent strategic stake to an international telecoms operator, together with management rights, before floating another 14 per cent. The socialists insist the company should remain under state management. Nevertheless, government advisers, aware that the question of efficient management will loom large in investors' minds, propose appointing a telecoms operator from abroad as a technical consultant. The selection of a consultant could be timed to coincide with the flotation, provisionally set for October, they suggest. Analysts say that given investors' current enthusiasm for international telecoms issues, neither the delay nor the decision to restructure the disposal are likely to reduce the appeal of OTE. OTE, valued by analysts at around Dr1,000bn (Dollars 4bn), is one of only a few profitable public utilities in Greece. Company officials say that operating profits in 1993 amounted to some Dr120bn on turnover of Dr300bn, a 25 per cent increase on the previous year. Although Greece is a mature market in terms of its fixed network - with 40 lines for every 100 residents - there is considerable room for growth. Digital lines amount to only 15 per cent, while data transmission systems, paging and tele-conferencing are all in their infancy. OTE is also benefiting from substantial European Union funding for a 'crash programme' to improve telecommunications in Athens. Last month, Siemens Hellas and Intracom, a local telecoms equipment supplier, were awarded a Dr40bn contract to provide 1m digital lines for the capital. New transit exchanges will be linked by fibre optic cable, and 12 outmoded exchanges are being replaced with remote concentrators. A crucial question will be tariff policies, still controlled by the government. Some effort was made last year to iron out distortions in pricing - which favoured domestic customers making local calls while long-distance and international rates were charged at high rates - but further restructuring will be needed. 'Revenue per line for OTE is only half the European average, so there is plenty of potential. But if the company stays under the state umbrella, will the government allow realistic price hikes?' asked a local analyst. The government this week re-appointed Credit Suisse First Boston and J. Henry Schroder Wagg, originally the conservatives' choice, as co-ordinators and lead managers for the issue flotation. CSFB was already advising the government on the strategic sale. Schroders will structure the issue, while CSFB will place an international tranche, expected to amount to 10 per cent of OTE's equity, with investors in Europe and the US. National Bank of Greece, the biggest state-controlled bank, will be lead manager for the domestic tranche, replacing Credit Bank, the private Greek bank selected last year. The experience acquired last year should help the international investment banks to meet the new timetable for the flotation. It will still be tight: revised legislation on the regulatory framework must be passed, a full audit must be completed, and decisions are needed on OTE's heavy pension fund liabilities. There are still gaps in OTE's balance sheet, as its first audit to international standards, launched last year by Arthur Andersen, was halted when the change of government took place. However, it is clear that current pension fund liabilities amount to over Dr300bn, analysts say. OTE contributes Dr14bn annually to the fund, which also receives a subsidy from the budget. However, if the company's pension obligations are not reduced, the fund will become a serious drain on future earnings. With the socialists now committed to increasing Greece's base of small shareholders through privatisation, the domestic tranche, expected to amount to some 10 per cent of the offering, may include some incentives. The remaining 5 per cent is to be stripped out and sold at a discount to OTE employees and pensioners. Government advisers discount fears that the issue, five times bigger than the largest offering to date, could overwhelm the Athens stock exchange. They see no shortage of liquidity, as more than than Dr50bn in listings and rights issues was raised without difficulty during the first quarter of this year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several municipal governments were concerned about the need to change the button size or lower the height of existing crossing controls and the potential costs of such changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New, added, and altered installations must comply with ADAAG 14 requirements. Existing facilities are addressed by the Department of Justice regulations implementing title II of the ADA (28 CFR 35.150). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.5(2)&blank;Marked Crossings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (2) requires that markings at pedestrian crossings provide visual contrast. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM included an appendix note recommending locations for marked crossings such as at State and local government facilities, transportation facilities, places of public accommodation, irregular intersections and mid-block crossings. Commenters suggested deference to recommendations in the MUTCD for the location of marked crossings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim final rule does not contain recommendations on where marked crossings should be located. The appendix has been amended to include information on marked crossings derived from MUTCD and AASHTO recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule required marked crossings to be delineated with contrasting markings or materials. Comments from organizations representing persons with vision impairments supported contrast requirements for marked crossings and recommended that the final rule contain more specific requirements. Many commenters suggested additional features for crosswalk design, including raised guidestrips, textured and resilient surfaces, and flashing lights to increase their identifiability. Other commenters noted that the examples provided did not include any of the standard methods of marking crosswalks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methods of measuring color contrast in and between exterior paved surfaces are not sufficiently well-developed to establish a requirement at this time. No substantive changes have been made to this provision. However, the examples have been removed. A new appendix note on contrast has been added to clarify recommendations in the absence of a technical specification. Other crossing features recommended by commenters have been included in the appendix note.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.2.5(3)&blank;Islands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with ADAAG 4.7.11 (Curb Ramps), paragraph (3) requires that islands in pedestrian crossings be cut through to allow an at-grade passage or be provided with public sidewalk curb ramps and a landing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Few comments were received on this provision. Several commenters expressed concern that islands with cut-through passages at street grade did not provide cues to persons with vision impairments. One commenter noted that islands that are marked or cut through often do not provide enough space for a person using a wheelchair to wait safely through a traffic light cycle if his crossing is interrupted by a light change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Increasing the Minimum Wage"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The federal law on increasing  the minimum wage, adopted by the State Duma, was yesterday  approved by the Federation Council and should come into force 1  July. As is well known, the minimum wage is increased by 40  percent on that day -- that is, from 14,620 rubles [R] to  R20,500 a month.    At the same time, deputies instructed the Committee for  Social Policy to work out with each region within two weeks the  question of the source of funding for the increased wage, so as  to ensure that this decision, which the people need so much,  does not remain an empty intention.    The upper house also approved the federal law on amendments  and additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code and Code of Criminal  Procedure, which had been sent to it by the State Duma. The law  "On the Russian Federation's State Foreign Borrowings and State  Loans Granted by the Russian Federation to Foreign States" was  also approved.    The Federation Council yesterday adopted an appeal to the  CSCE parliaments in connection with the Latvian Saeima's  adoption of a citizenship law.    The document notes that this law was adopted "despite  numerous protests from the international community and  regardless of the recommendations made by the CSCE, the Council  of Europe, and a number of international experts." Thus, the  Latvian authorities have "ignored generally accepted standards  in the human rights sphere," the appeal notes.    The Federation Council called on them to "uphold the  principles of humanism that are being asserted in Europe, to  prevent Latvia from sliding into aggressive nationalism, and to  avert the emergence of a seat of tension in the Baltic region."</p>

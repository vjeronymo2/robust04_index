The review period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States, Saha Thai Steel Pipe Company, Ltd. (Saha Thai). As a result of the review, we have preliminarily determined that dumping margins exist with respect to this manufacturer/exporter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  November 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Sandra Yacura or Zev Primor, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5253.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 11, 1986, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (51 FR 8341). On March 12, 1993, the Department published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notifying interested parties of the opportunity to request an administrative review of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (57 FR 13583). On March 30, 1993, the domestic producers (Allied Tube &amp; Conduit Corporation, Sawhill Tubular Division of Armco, Inc., American Tube Company, Inc., Laclede Steel Company, Sharon Tube Company, Wheatland Tube Company, and Eagle Pipe Company) requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a) of the Department's regulations, that we conduct an administrative review for the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is now conducting a review for this period in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this administrative review are shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. The subject merchandise has an outside diameter of 0.375 inch or more, but not exceeding 16 inches. These products, which are commonly referred to in the industry as ``standard pipe'' or ``structural tubing,'' are hereinafter designated as ``pipe and tube.'' The merchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 7306.30.1000, 7306.30.5025, 7306.30.5032, 7306.30.5040, 7306.30.5055, 7306.30.5085, and 7306.30.5090. The item numbers are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The review covers shipments made by Saha Thai from Thailand to the United States during the period of review March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993 (POR).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. Purchase price was based on the packed FOB or C&amp;F price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. The review included all of Saha Thai's U.S. sales that entered the United States during the POR. We made deductions from the unit price, where applicable, for ocean freight, bank charges, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, and customs clearing expenses (brokerage). We made an addition to USP for duty drawback. Additionally, we adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Siliconmanganese from Venezuela, Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other adjustments to USP were claimed or allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of pipe and tube in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales to the volume of third-country sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Saha Thai had sufficient home market sales of the subject merchandise during the POR. Thus, we based FMV on Saha Thai's sales in the home market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not include home market sales of pipe and tube made to the specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM pipe) in our FMV calculation because we determined that such sales were outside the ordinary course of trade.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  19 U.S.C. 1677(15) and 1677b(a)(1). Rather, we included only sales of pipe and tube made to British Standard specifications (BS pipe). In determining that Saha Thai's sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of trade, we did not rely on one factor taken in isolation, but rather considered all the circumstances particular to the sales in question. In reviewing the evidence for this review, we based our decision upon (1) the different standards and product uses of ASTM pipes and BS pipes; and (2) the comparative volume of sales and number of buyers of ASTM pipes and BS pipes in the home market during the POR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Saha Thai indicated that the ASTM pipes sold in the home market during the POR were produced on the basis of special orders or special projects in which the entire project was supplied with ASTM standard pipes. In addition, ASTM pipes and BS pipes cannot be coupled together. Therefore, ASTM pipe cannot be used in most pipe systems in Thailand and cannot be used to replace most existing pipe systems in Thailand. Finally, sales of ASTM pipe constituted a small volume of total Saha Thai's sales of pipe and tube in the home market, and the customers purchasing ASTM pipe in the home market were limited primarily to new, stand-alone government projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, we determined that sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of trade, and therefore did not use these sales in our calculation of FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

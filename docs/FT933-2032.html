			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Two Aitken Hume directors under threat TWO DIRECTORS of Aitken Hume International, the banking group, may face removal from the board following criticism over the weekend by Hong Kong regulators of Allied Group, one of its largest shareholders. Mr Lee Ming Tee, Allied's chairman and a major shareholder, and Mr Brian O'Connor, a director, will face scrutiny following a critical report into the operations of Allied. Mr Bill Brown, a director of Aitken Hume and non-executive chairman of Aitken Hume Bank, a subsidiary, said yesterday: 'As a member of the board I am interested to see the affairs of the company are conducted in a fit and proper manner. If they are censured it is a matter of great concern to us.' Mr Lee and Mr O'Connor are mentioned in a report from an inspector appointed to examine Allied's affairs by the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong published on Saturday. Allied was also raided by 300 police last week. Both men sit on the board of Aitken Hume, reflecting Allied's substantial stake, which is reported in the Aitken accounts for the 12 months to March 31 last year as 30.3 per cent. The shares are held through Menston Investments, a subsidiary. The Bank of England refused to comment yesterday. But it has regulatory powers to debar directors of banks on grounds including competence, integrity and skills as well as criminality. Mr Brown said that there were no financial links between Aitken Hume and Allied, and that Aitken Hume had not had any contact with the investigations in Hong Kong. Mr Lee is a Malaysian-born Chinese entrepreneur who owns a string of companies through the Allied Group. Mr O'Connor is mentioned in the Hong Kong report as chairman of Crestacare, which had a share placing in 1992 underwritten by Asia Securities, owned by Allied.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "WEU Admits </F> Nine East European Countries as `Associate Partners'"]    [Excerpt] The principal decision of the WEU [Western  European Union] Council (Foreign and Defence Ministers) meeting  on 9 May in Luxembourg with Jacques Poos [deputy prime minister  and foreign minister] chairing the proceedings was to grant  "associate partner" status to nine East European countries which  have or will have association agreements with the European  Union. The Western European Union will therefore soon comprise  four "circles":    (a) full members, namely, at this point, all the European  Union countries with the exception of Ireland and Denmark.  Greece is the 10th member, but has participated up to now  solely as an active observer as its Act of Accession has not  been ratified yet by all the other Member States (Germany has  meanwhile ratified the Act);    (b) observers, namely Ireland (a neutral member of the  European Union) and Denmark (a European Union member which up to  now has not wanted to join the WEU because of its reluctance  about a European security and defence policy, although some  political forces in this country are said to support entry).  This status could be chosen by Austria, Finland, and Sweden  once they become members of the European Union;    (c) associate members, i.e. NATO members: Norway (which  will become a full member of the WEU once it has become a member  of the European Union), Turkey (which tried unsuccessfully to  become a full WEU member several years ago) and Iceland;    (d) associate partners, i.e. Hungary, Poland, Czech  Republic,  Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (the  three Baltic states are given different treatment than that  given the other ex-USSR countries, as the Russian occupation of  these countries has never been recognized). In the afternoon,  the Ministers met with their counterparts from the nine  associate partner countries. In their final press release, the  Ministers also underscored their determination to develop  dialogue with the Mediterranean countries and contacts with  Russia and Ukraine. Asked about Russia's attitude to the  associate partner status given to East European countries,  [German Foreign Minister] Mr. Kinkel told the press that, after  first being "rather critical" for fear that this could be a  "substitute for closer ties with NATO," Moscow is now showing  "comprehension" regarding the initiative.    During lunch (separate from the Defence Ministers), the  Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Bosnia and,  welcoming the prospect of the start-up of the European Union's  administration of Mostar, discussed the contribution the WEU  could make by providing a police force for this city (Mr. Kinkel  told the press such a force could be operational very quickly).    The decisive criterion for attributing this new status is  the  type of relationship the countries concerned maintain with the  European Union, with which they must have an association  agreement. This explains why the WEU cannot agree for now to  grant this status to the states of the former USSR, even if the  Western European Union wishes to step up its bilateral contacts  with them. In contrast, the WEU will have a multilateral  relationship with its new "partners," another difference from  the Partnership for Peace offered by NATO. Moreover, while the  Partnership places greater emphasis on military cooperation, the  WEU associate status is essentially political in nature. This  associate partner status will be formally attributed to the nine  countries only once the ratification of Greek entry as the 10th  full member of the WEU has been completed (there is some delay  in Germany and France, which is why Greece temporarily has  observer status), which will also make it possible to formalize  the associate member status of Norway, Turkey and Iceland.  Formally, given the criteria which have been fixed for the East  European countries, it will also be necessary to await  ratification of the association agreements between the European  Union and the Baltic states. However, the associate partners  could begin exercising their new status in the coming weeks by  participating in every other meeting of the WEU Permanent  Council: The Council could thus meet with 15 members one week  (the 10 full members plus the three associate members and the  two observers, Ireland and Denmark) and the following week with  24 members. Associate members participate in all the Council  meetings but do not benefit from the automatic assistance clause  of Article V of the Treaty and cannot block consensus between  full members: These two conditions will also be applied to the  associate partners. The associate partners will also establish  a simple "liaison" with the WEU Planning Unit, while officers of  the two associate members (Turkey and Norway, but not Iceland,  which has no army) will now be allowed to participate in the  work of the Unit. Neutral countries such as Austria, Finland  and Sweden could in time be given observer status if they are  interested, but the WEU obviously does not wish to intervene in  their domestic debate on this subject. In Luxembourg, the  Ministers also decided to develop contacts with Egypt, which has  called for closer ties with the WEU. The WEU already has  theoretically multilateral relations with the Maghreb countries  (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Mauritania, but not with Libya), but  in practice they are bilateral.

They have done this without, in any instance, giving  specific details regarding the persons, place, and time the  actions have taken place. In addition, they have done it  indirectly, without denoting the attitude of a serious  government such as that of the United States, a country seeking  to end that illegal business. The U.S. accusations indicate a  rather obvious intention to tarnish the country so as to free  itself partly of the social stigma of currently being the  largest drug consumer worldwide.    If instead of trying to raise "doubts" regarding the  reputation not only of our country, but also of other nations on  the continent, Washington tried to outline joint strategies to  solve this serious problem, then the sincere will of the U.S.  Administration to stop the illegal business of those who come to  our countries to "clean up" would become evident. [sentence as  published] Then those countries, and their governments,  including Panama, would have a greater chance to succeed in this  fight against the negative forces of the U.S.-fed thriving and  powerful drug enterprise. These countries south of the Rio  Grande could never generate so much money because they do not  have it; and if they had it, they would use it to satiate the  overwhelming hunger of their peoples and not to use and abuse  cocaine, marijuana, and their many byproducts. In this serious  war, Washington should be the one to set an example for the  other participants.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Assets and profits advance at BCP BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), one of Portugal's top three commercial banks and its largest stock market listed company, yesterday announced strong increases in assets and profits for 1991. Total assets grew by 51 per cent from Es801bn at the end of 1990 to Es1,206bn (Dollars 8.9bn) at December 1991. Net profits were Es18.2bn - up 33 per cent on the previous year. Return on equity rose from 14.4 per cent to 16.8 per cent last year, with earnings per share, adjusted for dilution resulting from the incor-poration of reserves in March 1990, rising over 24 per cent from Es222.4 in 1990 to Es276.1 last year. During 1991, the bank continued to expand its activities opening another 111 branches, bringing its branch network to 242. The physical expansion of the bank was reflected in a strong increase in credit extended to clients, up 75 per cent to Es516bn, and in customer deposits up 59 per cent to Es932bn at the end of 1991. Having become one of the leading banks on the Portuguese market, BCP is gradually developing its presence on the international markets, and earlier this month, it joined forces with Banco Popular Espanol of Spain to set up a new bank in France.</p>

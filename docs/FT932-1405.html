			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UN reports new wave of 'ethinic cleansing' United Nations officials reported a new wave of 'ethnic cleansing' yesterday in an apparent rush by Croats and Moslems to consolidate their holds on disputed areas of central Bosnia as peace talks got under way in Geneva, Reuter reports from Sarajevo and Zenica. Although the front lines were mainly quiet, Bosnian Croat forces were pushing Moslems out of villages they held around Vares, 30 miles north of Sarajevo, and from the town of Kiseljak, just west of the besieged Bosnia capital. Moslem forces were simultaneously clearing Croats from recently captured territory further west at Novi Travnik. The town of Zenica suffered renewed shelling which killed nine people. This was the second worst incident the town has suffered since the beginning of the war over a year ago. Residents of the housing estate where the shells fell said three shells were fired from the Croat-held town of Vitez, seven miles to the south.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Andrew Knight's trusts sell half News Corp stake TWO FAMILY trusts of Mr Andrew Knight, executive chairman of News International, have sold more than half their stake in Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the newspaper publishing group's parent company. News Corp said yesterday that the trusts, Blomfield Trustees (Jersey) and Ernst &amp; Young Trustees of which Mr Knight is a beneficiary, had sold a total of 3.93m shares in two tranches on July 1 and July 2 at an undisclosed price. Following the sales the trusts held 3.8m shares. News Corp emphasised that the trusts had acted on their own initiative and that the disposal was designed to diversify their holdings which until now had been entirely in News Corp stock. Since Mr Knight's appointment at News International in January 1990 News Corp's shares have risen from about 175p to more than 300p. They closed down 3p at 338p last night. Mr Knight was on holiday yesterday and unavailable for comment.</p>

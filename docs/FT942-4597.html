			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Tougher sanctions for Haiti this week President Bill Clinton is expected to announce tougher economic sanctions against Haiti this week as the US moves to implement recommendations from the Organisation of American States to tighten the noose on the country's economic elite. Mr William Gray, the former congressman who has been named Mr Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said yesterday he expected the US to ban commercial flights and freeze financial transactions with Haiti in the next few days. 'I have confidence that sanctions can create an environment where people come to their senses,' Mr Gray told the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee yesterday. Other nations in Latin America and the Caribbean have also promised to contribute troops for an eventual United Nations mission to provide civil law enforcement in Haiti if and when the military coup leaders step down and allow the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Mr Gray said the broad embargo imposed by the UN on May 21 was the first real attempt to apply serious economic pressure to Haiti, since an earlier ban on supplying fuel and arms had been very narrowly targeted. The new measures were agreed last week by the four countries - Canada, France, the US and Venezuela - which have taken the lead in efforts to restore democracy to Haiti since the military coup in 1991, and approved as recommendations by the OAS this week. Critics of the Clinton administration's policy on Haiti have complained that sanctions so far have hurt only the country's poor, while the wealthy businessmen who have provided much support for the military coup leaders have been able to fly freely to Miami to stock up on groceries and other supplies. Mr Gray said that efforts to stop the flow of goods across Haiti's land border with the Dominican Republic had been 75 to 80 per cent effective, and that the sanctions were taking a toll on the wealthy, as well as the poor. 'Our intelligence tells us that there are many who are beginning to feel already, after only three weeks, the bite of the sanctions. This business elite which has supported the coup leaders will not be able to sit back and wait six, eight months before they feel the pain,' he said.</p>

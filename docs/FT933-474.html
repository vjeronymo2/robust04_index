			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Creditors of collapsed bank agree arrangement CREDITORS OF Equatorial Bank, the small Asian-owned institution which was placed into administration in March, have agreed a voluntary arrangement, it emerged last night. The agreement was reached at a creditors' meeting yesterday and then ratified by an extraordinary general meeting of the bank. The creditors' voluntary arrangement paves the way for payment of a first dividend of 20p in the pound by the end of the first week in November, the administrators said. They warned that creditors were unlikely ultimately to be paid in full. Mr Gareth Hughes and Ms Maggie Mills, the administrators from accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said liquid assets of the bank were Pounds 12.3m at the end of last month. That had increased from Pounds 5.1m in March as a result of Pounds 6.1m in amounts recovered from loans and advances made to customers, and Pounds 1.1m in tax repayments. They said Equatorial's trade finance obligations had been reduced to Pounds 2.8m. The bank's loan book net of provisions was Pounds 31m at the end of August. The administrators said they were beginning legal proceedings to recover outstanding amounts due. They said they were continuing to negotiate with interested parties on 'the possibility of a rescue', but stressed that this was unlikely.</p>

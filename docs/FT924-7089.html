			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad Irrespective of whether Mr Alan Sugar is offering a fair price for Amstrad, shareholders have a right to expect better treatment. His offer document contains only a gloomy paragraph on the trading outlook, no profits forecast, no comment on the last four months' performance and no detail of Mr Sugar's plans for the company once it is in private hands. Mr Sugar maintains that no detailed plans exist. But one can hardly imagine Lloyds Bank is stumping up Pounds 43m on the basis of sketchy assurances. In the absence of either non-executive directors or an independent financial adviser to comment on the terms, the level of disclosure is inadequate. Mr Sugar cannot expect shareholders to be happy with his offer while he gives so little away.</p>

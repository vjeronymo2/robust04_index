			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The most important event in the US credit markets this week will be tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, at which Fed officials will decide to what extent another round of monetary tightening is required. Analysts think the starting point for the Fed's deliberations will be an increase of half a percentage point in its target for the Fed funds rate, pushing it up to 5 1/4 per cent. Anything less - or indeed, nothing - would ring alarm bells, provoking fears that the Fed was not being tough enough on inflation. Since a half-point increase is already discounted by bond prices, such an outcome could provoke little action. But the more tantalising question is whether the Fed will demonstrate its resolve - and, incidentally, provide some welcome relief for the dollar - by lifting the target rate by up to a full percentage point. Any such move is likely to be greeted positively by the bond market, on the basis that it would signal a tough inflationary stance. The Fed apart, it is a busy week for economic data; but the figures that will be most closely watched are those for consumer prices, due out on Wednesday. Salomon Brothers forecasts that, excluding food and energy, the October year-on-year figure will remain at 3.0 per cent.</p>

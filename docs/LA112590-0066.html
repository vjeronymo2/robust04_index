			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> My family and I were totally enamored of the Disney Channel movie "Back to  Hannibal." At first I was a bit apprehensive at the idea of seeing Tom Sawyer,  Huckleberry Finn and Mark Twain's other characters as adults, but the movie won  us over with it wonderful story and performances.  </P> <P> Michele Edison, Los Angeles  </P></p>

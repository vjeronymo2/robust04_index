			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: EC takeovers The typical UK view of the European Commission's stalled efforts to harmonise national takeover rules is that not much would change if laws are eventually passed. An article in the Stock Exchange Quarterly suggests plenty will change. In particular, UK companies could be even more vulnerable to takeover within the EC. Two main reasons are advanced. The first is the UK's relative absence of structural barriers to hostile takeover, including, for example, such historical variables as the level of state ownership. EC legislation would do little to alter these factors, but would concentrate on more obvious technical barriers. These are restrictions typically built into company statutes on matters such as voting rights and dual classes of equity. The second reason is that EC law would effectively overturn a proven UK system of takeover regulation, without exposing many European companies to the threat of hostile acquisition. UK companies would thus be exposed to further risk, without any concomitant benefits. They might respond by erecting technical barriers of their own, possibly via cross-shareholding arrangements such as that between Guinness and LVMH. But such measures would require shareholders' approval. In the end, the argument hinges on different philosophical notions of whom corporations are supposed to serve. It is debatable whether parts of Europe are gradually becoming more comfortable with the Anglo-Saxon model of corporate control. The example of Continental/Pirelli in Germany suggests change is occurring, albeit painfully slowly. The Perrier affair in France was something of a milestone. But by the same token, the Dutch and Italians still have a long way to travel.</p>

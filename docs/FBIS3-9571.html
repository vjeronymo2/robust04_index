			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today is not a rest day for the new  Slovak Government. Members of the Cabinet have been meeting in  expert groups to prepare their programmatic statement. Our  correspondent Michal Tvarozek asked Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik which were the most important areas, especially in the  economy, that the government wants to accelerate.    [Begin recording] [Moravcik] The most fundamental problem is  putting together the economic program. The largest group of  experts is working precisely on this program. We will probably  have to revise some measures proposed by the previous government  in preparing the budget. We will have to revise these measures  to make them more realistic. We will have to do everything  possible to reach agreement with the international institutions,  particularly the IMF and the World Bank.    In other areas, the most complicated situation has arisen in  health and education. [passage omitted]    [Tvarozek] Presumably the first version of the government's  program will serve also as a consultative document for, let us  say, employers, trade unions, all those who have a say as far as  the government's statement is concerned.    [Moravcik] Certainly we have to do this. We have to respect  the general agreement. The general agreement is for us a very  important document, and we would like to have observations of  all involved parties when working on the first version of the  statement.    [Tvarozek] In one hour, you are going to attend the  extraordinary session of the government. It is possible that  the agenda will center precisely on the conclusions reached by  these expert groups.    [Moravcik] This session should not deal with specific  problems. We will discuss where we stand, what we ought to do  next in terms of next week's work, and we will clarify which are  the main problems that have arisen when working on these  materials.    [Tvarozek] Let us assume that the National Council will not  agree with your policy statement. What will happen if it is not  approved?    [Moravcik] I hope it will be approved. [end recording]</p>

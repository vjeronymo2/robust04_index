			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Northern base benefits Town Centre Securities TOWN CENTRE Securities, the Leeds-based property development group, lifted pre-tax profits by almost 11 per cent from Pounds 7.25m to Pounds 8.04m over the year to June 30. Mr Edward Ziff, who was appointed managing director earlier this month, said the group was lucky to hold most of its property in the north of England and Scotland - 'outside the trauma of most of the property market.' Rental growth had been 'only mediocre, but by today's standards any growth is terrific news.' Gross revenues rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 18.2m, and operating profits were ahead from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 14.1m. Interest payable increased from Pounds 5.58m to Pounds 6m. Gearing was 50.8 per cent at the group's year-end, compared with 44.2 per cent. About 65 per cent of the portfolio lies in the retail sector. Mr Ziff said that for the first time in recent years the group had been able to buy good quality retail properties and show an immediate return in relation to the cost of borrowing. Most of the remaining property is in the office market, which he described as 'very difficult'. An internal property valuation put values ahead by 1.4 per cent, giving fully diluted net assets per share of 123.07p (118.32p). Earnings per share were up from 5.12p to 5.59p. A final dividend of 2.3p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 3.4p (3.1p). The shares rose 4p to 137p.</p>

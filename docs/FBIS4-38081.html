			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] With the help of Almighty God, the strategic  hill of Maranjan and the surrounding areas have been captured by  the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The army's advance continues.  Maranjan Hill was captured by the mojahedin 17 hours after the  conquest of Bala Hesar base.    With regard to today's conquest, an official of the Ministry  of Defense said:    [Begin unidentified Defense Ministry official recording, in  Dari] [Words indistinct] operation started at about 0500 by the  forces of the Islamic Army from several directions: from the  direction of Bala Hesar and Maiwand Wat, and [word indistinct]  and Pol-e Pacha Khan. [words indistinct]    The Islamic State of Afghanistan, so far as possible,  exercised forbearance in order to find a peaceful solution to  Afghanistan's problems. The enemy abused this forbearance by  the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and they did not avoid any  crime against the people throughout this period. Only recently  they planned to organize an all-out offensive against Kabul.  The offensive was to be mounted by forces of Hekmatyar's and  Dostam's militia. It should have taken place at this time.  Luckily, the Defense Ministry forces of the Islamic State of  Afghanistan foiled this offensive.    At the moment, the enemy's major bases--which were their  heavy weapons bases from where they attacked the city with  rockets--have been captured. A large section of Kabul City,  which was abandoned by the residents, has now been liberated.  We hope that the residents of the city of Kabul, who have been  rendered refugees and even went to Pakistan, will be able to  return to their homeland and to reside in their original homes.    The operation continued, as you know, until 1700. [words  indistinct] As a result of the operation a large number of the  enemy's tanks and heavy weapons have been captured. The number  of prisoners, as of this moment, is more than 700. A large area  was liberated, which includes the Ghazi Stadium, Kabul theater,  Maranjan Hill, and the (?villages) of Qala-e Zaman Khan and  Deh-e Khodaidad. [words indistinct] [end recording]    Tab-e Maranjan was captured [word indistinct] following the  seizure of Bala Hesar.    During the course of an intensive air and land attack that  was carried out by the forces of the Islamic State, the militia  has lost the ability for confrontation. The militia's fire  power was reduced notably in comparison to yesterday.    A high-ranking military official of the Islamic State of  Afghanistan estimated the number of prisoners taken during the  last two days at between 600 to 700; among them are 11 foreign  nationals.    [Words indistinct] received reports saying that the complete  clearing up of Karta-e Naw and a serious advance toward  Charasiab [Hekmatyar's headquarters] continues, and the  Golboddin-Dostam militia forces are fleeing. Another report  says that a large area behind Tajbeg Hill has been completely  conquered. [passage omitted]    The Golboddin-Dostam militia suffered a heavy defeat in the  west of Kabul and has escaped. [passage omitted]    Mama Habib Modathir [word indistinct] at his command base at  Darolaman Palace said: The Golboddin-Dostam militia mounted an  extensive offensive on our positions last night. The militia  encountered the strong resistance of the Harakat-e Eslami  mojahedin and were forced to retreat. As a result of the  gallant resistance of the mojahedin, a large area was retrieved  from the control of the militia. In this area are: Darolaman  Palace, Mahmud Tarzi High School, the former building of the  administration of the Ministry of Defense, the services section  of Housing Department, Nur Hospital, the office of the deputy  head of the Construction Department, [word indistinct],  Sarasiab, Doghabad, Qala-e Muslim, Qala-e Qaderi, Qala-e Abas  Qoli, and Asiab-e Khoshk. The advance of the jihadi forces and  mojahedin toward Chilsoton and Rishkhor continues.    Modathir added: During the course of the operation, one set  of BM-1 [not further identified], two tanks, hundreds of light  weapons, three 83-mm artillery pieces, four medium-sized  mortars, two rocket launchers, two PK machine guns, two ZK-1  machine guns, five motor vehicles, and a large quantity of arms  and ammunition have been captured from the enemy as booty.  During the course of this successful operation, 40 members of  the Golboddin-Dostam militia were taken prisoner by the forces  of the mojahedin, nine of whom were foreign mercenaries.    Sardar Mohammad, Abofazl, Mr. Alawi, Sayd Husain Husaini,  Commander Sofi Safar, Commander Mohammad Anwar (?Sakhra),  Commander Aziz Ahmad, Commander Sayed Ali Shah, and other  commanders and mojahedin participated in the operations.  [passage omitted]    It should be said with [word indistinct] that the number of  losses was very small on the state's side, and observations show  that the occurrence of minor incidents have been due to the  carelessness of individuals. [passage omitted]    The destruction caused by the battles in Maiwand Wat [main  street in Kabul] is more terrifying than any other part of  Kabul. Among the ruins, only a few armed mojahedin could be seen  loitering. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin (DPA) -- Norbert Geis (Christian Social  Union), legal policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, harshly criticized  the amnesty of Red Army Faction terrorist Bernhard Roessner by  President Richard von Weizsaecker. In an interview with the  Berlin daily BERLINER ZEITUNG the Christian Social Union  politician said that this could be misunderstood as a signal for  another wave of politically motivated releases of terrorists  from prison. Decisions about the early release of prisoners are  the business of the judiciary, according to Geis. [passage  omitted]</p>

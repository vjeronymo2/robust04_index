			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Bayandin report over video; from the "As of This </F> Hour" newscast of the "Morning Cruise" program]    [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, has begun his tour of the country  with a visit to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. The government aircraft  landed this morning at the oblast center's airport. The  esteemed guest was met at the aircraft steps by Valiula  Maksutov, chairman of the oblast duma; Nikolay Dolgikh, first  vice governor of the oblast; Vladlen Sychev, commander of the  Army; and other officials. We managed to get an interview for  our program.    [Begin recording] [Bayandin] What is the aim of your visit  to Sakhalin?    [Stepashin] Well, first of all to take a look at how people  here live and work, including our department here. Now I do not  know whether or not the president's new edict on the fight  against crime has been received here....    [Maksutov, interrupts] Of course it has.    [Stepashin] Well, that is one of the main tasks. I am a bit  hoarse from the plane trip, so pardon my voice, but generally  the president instructed me to go out and see all the regions  and this is where Russia begins.    [Bayandin] Tell us please, how do you assess the work of  Sakhalin counterintelligence agents in the past?    [Stepashin] How do you assess it?    [Reporter] Personally I assess it very highly because there  were some operations involving the apprehension of smugglers  which were carried out very well.    [Stepashin] Well, our assessment is also fairly positive.  It was formed not only during the Putina operation. What used  to be known as an open zone, I have Sakhalin in mind, has not  worked out yet but the manifestations that we have seen from the  neighboring state and others are being successfully realized by  our administration, so our assessment coincides with yours.  [end recording]    During the visit the director of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service will acquaint himself in greater  detail with the activities of Sakhalin counterintelligence  agents and will outline ways for raising the efficiency of their  work in the future.    And so the leaders of two key ministries engaged in the  struggle with crime have visited our oblast during a short  period of time. Does this signify that a serious challenge has  been made to organized crime on Sakhalin? Will the crime  situation in the region improve significantly?. Well, we must  wait and see.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN KENNEDY JR. FAILS BAR EXAM FOR 2ND TIME  </P> <P> John F. Kennedy Jr. flunked the New York state bar exam for a second time and  has one last chance to pass or lose his job as an assistant prosecutor, a  spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office confirmed Monday.  </P> <P> "All assistants get three chances.  </P> <P> It's a long-standing office policy," said Colleen Roche, spokeswoman for  Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old only son of assassinated President John F. Kennedy will get his  last shot at passing the grueling exam in July. If he passes, he gets a $1,000  raise. If he fails, he loses his $30,000-a-year job.  </P> <P> Roche said 58 members of the most recent class of 65 recruits passed the bar  the first time around. Of the seven who flunked and took it a second time, at  least two have passed.  </P></p>

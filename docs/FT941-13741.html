			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Eurotunnel in issue to Bombardier Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, is to seek the approval of shareholders in its British and French companies for a further share issue to Bombardier International, the Canadian manufacturer of its rolling stock, writes Charles Batchelor. Up to 25m Eurotunnel shares were allotted to Bombardier in December under the settlement of its claim against Transmanche Link, the main contractor for the tunnel, for costs arising from changes in the rolling stock design. The French arm of Eurotunnel, Eurotunnel SA, will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the latest share issue on January 31, while the UK arm, Eurotunnel, will hold its meeting on February 17. In the 'very likely event' that the 50 per cent quorum for the French company is not met, its meeting will be adjourned until February 17 to coincide with the UK meeting. The share issue is intended to tie Bombardier's fortunes to those of the tunnel. ESC Wagons, the company created by Bombardier to build the trains, is also to receive FFr700m (Pounds 80.4m) in phased cash payments. On Friday Eurotunnel's shares closed at 568p.</p>

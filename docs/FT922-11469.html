			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Letter: Proper use of engineers Sir, Dr Murphy's letter (April 22) does not deal with all the problems of employment of professional engineers in Britain. Having had experience in both Britain and Germany I would add some points that should be considered with the arguments Dr Murphy presented. Having interviewed several early and mid-career engineers, with quite reasonable university education behind them, I have been very disappointed that many have been willing to accept jobs at the technician/technologist level rather than struggle for positions as a fully responsible professional engineer. This may mean that some employers use graduate engineers when they need only employ technicians. It therefore must be recognised that, without appropriate qualifications, official statistics of the employment of engineers can give a misleading impression. German employers try and use all employees, including engineers, as efficiently as possible. This may partly account for German GNP/head of population being considerably higher than Britain's. The test for all employees should be: 'What is your contribution to the commercial success of your employer?'

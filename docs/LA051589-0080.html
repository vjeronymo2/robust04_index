			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> An exchange exhibit of works by emerging Los Angeles and Czech artists has been  organized as a way to bridge cultural barriers. Works by 16 Los Angeles artists  will be shown this August in Prague, Czechoslovakia, while works by 10 Czech  artists will be displayed at the Otis Parsons Art Institute here next year. The  idea of the exhibit is "to promote art and the exchange of ideas and culture  between our two countries and around the world," explains participating artist  and exhibit organizer Barbara Benish.

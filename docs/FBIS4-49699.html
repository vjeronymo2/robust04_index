The meeting put forward a general plan for the  building of a market system in China, calling for introducing a  unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system and  establishing a close link between urban and rural markets and  between domestic and international markets so as to improve the  allocation of resources.    The symposium was held jointly by the State Economic  Restructuring Commission, the State Planning Commission, the  State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Internal  Trade, and the State Statistical Bureau. The meeting put  forward specific ideas for the direction of promoting the reform  of China's circulation system until the end of this century.    The meeting pointed out that the special characteristics of  the basic framework of a socialist market system should have a  new relations of exchange in market and a sound market  regulation mechanism; have circulation markets which can suit  the needs of a market economy; have sound commodity market  organizations; form, in the main, a market system for factors of  production; have a sound market supervision and control system;  have sound rules and regulations for market operation; have a  sound system for adjusting and storing important commodities,  and establish links between the domestic market and the  international market.    Concerning the steps and phases for realizing the  improvement  of the market system, the meeting pointed out: In carrying out  reform in the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan  period, it is necessary to vigorously develop regional wholesale  markets, further expand the scope of market adjustment, improve  large-scale wholesale markets and exchanges which are geared to  the needs of the whole country, establish a better commodity  market system, vigorously develop production factor markets,  promote the circulation of production factors, realize the  single price system for production factors, develop long-term  government orders and contracts, stabilize relations of demand  and supply, cultivate a new market relationship, and establish  and improve risk funds at central and provincial levels and a  reserve system for grain, cotton, and other important  commodities. During the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, we  should, in the main, establish a market system, a sound legal  system with necessary laws and regulations, a supervision and  control system, a government macro-control system, and a modern  circulation system which can meet the requirements of a  socialist market economy so as to give full play to the market's  basic role in the allocation of resources.</p>

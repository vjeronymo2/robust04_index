			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEACON OF HOPE;  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS HELP COMMUNITY DIG ITSELF OUT OF A QUAKE  </P> <P> Since early May, a motley construction crew of Bay Area residents -- from  plumbers to musicians to computer specialists -- has trekked to this farming  town south of Santa Cruz to build a $1-million beacon of hope for a community  hard-hit by last October's earthquake.  </P> <P> Just a couple of blocks from a flattened stretch of the predominantly Latino  town's main drag, the San Francisco-area volunteers are helping local residents  build a 6,400-square-foot community center.  </P> <P> When it opens Saturday, the structure will provide more than just a cultural  hub for the city, which sustained damages of $60 million in the quake and also  will lose 410 jobs when one of the area's largest employers relocates some  operations next year.  </P> <P> Organizers of the effort hope the new center also will spark a bit of a  renaissance in this city of 30,000.  </P> <P> "We were interested in helping shift the attitude of the community from  building from ground zero to looking forward," said Nancy Handelman, director  of the Oakland-based Sterling Community Service Foundation, which organized the  nine-week project. "We wanted to show Watsonville that it wasn't alone."  </P> <P> Community leaders and residents who have contributed time to the project said  the effort has paid off.  </P> <P> "This is incredible, the outpouring of support in terms of time, energy, blood,  sweat and tears," said Delilah Valadez, a Watsonville Volunteer Center activist  who helps out weekends at the city-donated site. "We haven't seen anything like  this since the earthquake, or before it. This shows what can be done with hard  work, vision and teamwork."  </P> <P> The center, to be dedicated Saturday, will give Watsonville residents an  inexpensive place to hold receptions, ethnic dances, English classes and  retraining sessions for some of the workers who are losing their jobs.  </P> <P> Pillsbury/Green Giant Co., one of the area's largest employers, announced in  April it would lay off 410 of its 550 peak-season workers by 1991 when it moves  its cauliflower- and broccoli-freezing operations to Mexico and Ohio.  </P> <P> Coming in the aftermath of the quake, the prospect of unemployment has been  dispiriting for many.  </P> <P> "All this has really wracked people who were already disadvantaged," said one  volunteer, Cecile Mills, a computer technician for a bilingual community  newspaper, El Andar.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I just want to pull my hair out and move to Portland."  </P> <P> A company spokesman said Pillsbury/Green Giant is making the move for economic  reasons. He said the company is negotiating a severance package with the union,  and also will take steps to retrain workers.  </P> <P> "It certainly won't eliminate the fact that some people are losing their jobs,  but hopefully we can make the transition a little easier," said Duane Larson,  plant manager.  </P> <P> The Sterling Community Service Foundation's leaders and volunteers said their  main goal is to build a spirit of cooperation and hope, something that will go  beyond the immediate benefits provided by the community center, located in  Marinovich Park on 2nd Street.  </P> <P> The foundation originally drew up plans to build the structure as a schoolhouse  in earthquake-ravaged Soviet Armenia. But when the 1989 temblor hit the Bay  Area, Sterling officials decided to use their resources closer to home. The  group has spent $75,000 on building materials. Labor and other building  materials were donated. The city will own the center.  </P> <P> Watsonville qualifies for about $4 million in federal and state disaster aid,  and could receive more once officials complete formal reports on the earthquake  damage. So far, the city has received about $2 million in government relief,  said Terry Stigall, Watsonville finance director.  </P> <P> So, efforts to mop up quake-related destruction in the city -- estimated by  Stigall to be about $60 million -- have fallen mostly to local groups with  limited resources.  </P> <P> The city has received $1 million in outside relief donations, which local  government officials have channeled largely to low-income homeowners through  house reconstruction grants. In a separate project, a local interdenominational  relief group has been rebuilding some of the 250 houses knocked off their  foundations, with homeowners paying only for the cost of materials.  </P> <P> The Sterling project has also funneled help from more affluent areas to the  north, bringing together members of the farming community and residents of San  Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz and elsewhere. An average of 130 or  more volunteers have shown up at the site every Saturday and Sunday to help  out.  </P> <P> "What I do for a living is not that fulfilling in a spiritual sense," said Matt  Lyons, 29, a computer systems analyst from Fremont. "This gives me a chance to  give something back. It's a chance to stand for something."  </P> <P> On weekend work days, the one-story community center structure has been abuzz  with activity. A roving safety crew barks commands, encouragement and jokes to  small teams of volunteers -- including some construction industry professionals  -- as they go about tasks as varied as hanging doors, installing insulation and  painting walls.  </P> <P> For the construction workers who leave their weekday jobs only to drive 90  miles and ply their trade for free on the weekend, the project offers a reward  not found on every project, said Harvey Rosen, 48, a Berkeley electrical  contractor who acted as the community center project manager on a recent work  day.  </P> <P> "When you're out on a regular construction site, that building doesn't  represent anything," Rosen said. "This building represents the community. This  building represents people.  </P> <P> "To me," he said, "this is a miracle."  </P> <P> It also has a practical payoff. "It's going to fill a need that's been here for  as long as I've lived in Watsonville," said Valadez, a 25-year resident.  </P> <P> Already, the street looks nicer, residents said. The basketball court that used  to sprawl across the community center site is gone. So are the graffiti and the  crowd of street gang members who used to hang out there. The house next door  has a fresh coat of ocean-blue paint. The people who live there said they  painted it so their home would look as nice as the new center.  </P> <P> Still, when the dedication ceremony is over, a lot of work will remain to be  done in Watsonville.  </P> <P> Few are more aware of that than project volunteer Herman Goon.  </P> <P> Until last year, Goon, 65, owned a small dry goods store and a little house,  each about two blocks from the nearly completed community center. He lost  everything in the quake -- store, inventory, house. His insurance covered  nothing.  </P> <P> Now, pushed into early retirement by the catastrophe, Goon shows up bright and  early on weekend mornings to help build the center in his old neighborhood.  </P> <P> When his fellow volunteers pack up and leave, the town's problems --  unemployment, a downtown partly in ruins -- will remain, he said. It will be a  battle to keep alive the community spirit inspired by the community center  project.  </P> <P> "Watsonville will be a little while before it can build up," Goon said. "We've  got to solve the problems ourselves now."  </P></p>

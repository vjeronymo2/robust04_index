			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / United Biscuits seeks to sell Terry's UNITED Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuit and snacks manufacturer, is seeking to sell Terry's, its chocolate division, in a move intended to cut debt and pave the way for further acquisitions. Talks have been underway for several weeks with a number of prospective buyers. They are understood to be most advanced with Philip Morris, the US tobacco and food group, which owns Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolate and coffee company. Neither UB nor Philip Morris would comment. Analysts estimate that Terry's, which earned operating profits of Pounds 3.2m on sales of Pounds 69m in the first half of last year, could fetch more than Pounds 200m. The company has about 3 per cent of the UK chocolate market as well as subsidiaries in France and Italy. UB has made acquisitions in continental Europe, Australia and the US in the past two years in an effort to strengthen its international presence in biscuits and savoury snacks, which it views as its core businesses. The company is considering bidding for the biscuits interests of Royal Brands, a leading Spanish food company, which has been put up for sale by Tabacalera, its state-owned parent. UB is also believed to have been in talks with Derwent Valley Foods, a privately-owned UK snacks maker best known for its Phileas Fogg brand. However, UB's scope for further acquisitions is limited by its high gearing, which rose to 88 per cent after last month's Pounds 47m purchase of Bake-Line, a US biscuit maker. The company's total debt is currently about Pounds 540m. The sale of Terry's would take the recent consolidation of Europe's chocolate industry a step further. Suchard, which was purchased by Philip Morris for Dollars 3.8bn (Pounds 2.7bn) in 1990, successfully bid Dollars 1.5bn last autumn to acquire Freia Marabou, a Norwegian confectionery manufacturer. Though Suchard is one of Europe's leading chocolate producers, it has only a small share of the UK market, which is dominated by Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle and Mars. Another possible bidder for Terry's is Hershey, the largest US chocolate company, which has been seeking to expand in Europe. It had also sought to take over Freia Marabou.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE ARREST 'PASSBOOK BANDIT' SUSPECT  </P> <P> A man suspected of being the "passbook bandit" who robbed 23 area banks this  summer was arrested Monday by the FBI and San Diego police after he allegedly  robbed another bank earlier in the day.  </P> <P> Benjamin Christopher Mejia, 39, was being held in the federal Metropolitan  Correctional Center in connection with the robbery spree that began Aug. 7,  officials said.  </P> <P> Mejia has been charged with the Sept. 4 robbery of a Union Bank branch in  National City and is a "very prime suspect" in the other robberies, said Joseph  C. Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI office in San Diego.  </P> <P> After Mejia's photograph appeared in a local paper, the FBI and police received  tips from the public that led them to target Mejia as a suspect in early  September, said FBI Agent Jack Kelly, coordinator of the bureau's bank robbery  squad.  </P> <P> A federal warrant was issued Sept. 18 for Mejia's arrest, but authorities did  not track him down until 11:30 a.m. Monday, about an hour after the Great  American Bank at 5565 Lake Murray Blvd. in San Diego was robbed of an  undetermined amount of cash, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Mejia, a Phoenix, Ariz., native who was living as a transient in San Diego, was  not armed when he was arrested as he drove near 28th and Market streets,  Johnson said. He has no convictions for bank robbery, Kelly said. He was to be  arraigned Tuesday.  </P> <P> The passbook bandit, so called because his demand notes for money were always  handed to tellers inside a bank passbook, stole nearly $30,000 from banks and  savings and loan institutions, making him the third most prolific bank robber  in San Diego in the past two decades, Kelly said. Greg Pearson, who was  convicted of robbing 27 banks in 1987, and David Kelley, sent to federal prison  for robbing 24 banks in 1988, hold the local record for most banks robbed,  Kelly said.  </P> <P> The passbook bandit used notes to tell the tellers he was armed, and a handgun  was seen three times during the robberies, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Johnson said the investigation is continuing.  </P></p>

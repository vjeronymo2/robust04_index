			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- State Council  Decision Concerning the Annulment of Some Administrative  Regulations Promulgated Before the End of 1993.    The objective conditions in China have undergone tremendous  changes since 1985, when the country undertook to  comprehensively sort out the administrative regulations  promulgated by or with the approval of the State Council  (including its predecessor the Government Administration  Council) before the end of 1984. To meet the needs of the new  situation -- that is, reform, opening up to the outside world,  and establishing a socialist market economy -- and in accordance  with State Council requirements for sorting out the rules and  regulations, the State Council ministries undertook again to  comprehensively sort out the 286 administrative regulations  (excluding the regulations governing foreign-related matters  that were declared annulled by a 1988 State Council circular or  had become invalid automatically but including administrative  regulations promulgated in 1985), the 33 administration  regulations that were left out the first time, and the 365  administrative regulations by the State Council between 1986 and  1993 -- 684 pieces in all. After the State Council Bureau of  Legislative Affairs item-by-item examination of the sorted out  regulations, the State Council has decided to announce the  annulment of 21 items (including those that have become invalid  automatically). Of them, 13 were annulled by corresponding new  laws or replaced by new administrative regulations while the  eight others have become invalid automatically because the  intended objects of the regulations disappeared, the period of  applicability has expired, or because the specific, legally  binding provisions formulated in reference to a specific issue  have become obsolete. Rulings that were made on the basis of  these administrative regulations remain valid.    Moreover, 86 administrative regulations have been  specifically declared annulled by laws and administrative  regulations promulgated between 1986 and 1993. A catalog of the  invalid regulations is also included here to help various  regions and departments obtain an overall understanding of the  condition of those invalid administrative regulations, thereby  facilitating their work.    Annex I: A catalog of invalid administrative regulations  promulgated before the end of 1993 that were annulled or have  become invalid automatically (21 items).    Annex II: A catalog of administrative regulations that were  specifically annulled by laws and administrative regulations  promulgated between 1986 and 1993 (86 items).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sophie Roquelle and Christine Lagoutte: </F> "Economic Situation -- Balladur: `A Plan for the Next Six  Months'"]    [Text] The day after the disappointing performance by the  RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Democratic Union]  majority's list in the European elections, Edouard Balladur  intends to seize back the initiative. On a visit to Lille, the  prime minister announced that, within two weeks, he would be  presenting a "plan of action for the next six months" with a  view to "stepping up the effort to boost economic recovery in  the country."    Unlike the January plan aimed at boosting consumption, which  was preceded by several interministerial meetings, it would  appear that the prime minister's office has not prepared a new  catalog of measures in consultation with the various ministers.  This time, the message is essentially a political one. Edouard  Balladur will set a date "on the major topics to be decided on  this autumn," explained someone from his entourage. For him  there can be no question of allowing the result of the European  elections to disrupt his own political agenda and lead anyone to  think that his government is rejecting any reforms.    These major topics, he said, concern "youth, health  insurance, the fight against the budget deficit, the choice to  be made between lowering taxes and social security charges,"  just to cite economic and social issues.  <H5>  Better Targeting </H5>   Will the government adopt new measures aimed at recovery?  Nothing could be less certain given the strong budgetary  constraints in force. Furthermore, people at the Economics  Ministry say that recent surveys on the state of the economy  conducted among company bosses and households demonstrate a very  clear-cut boost in confidence. Moreover, it was emphasized that  the result of the last study, carried out last week by the INSEE  [National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies] and  focusing on households, was "excellent."    The fact remains that the success of the "scrap premium"  adopted in January in an attempt to relaunch the automotive  industry is leaving some people rather envious. There are many  sectors serving a large consumer market, such as clothing,  toys, or furniture, that would like to benefit in turn from a  nudge in the right direction. Consequently, the CLIMO (Liaison  Committee for Manpower Industries), which represents more than 1  million jobs, is asking for "better targeting of back-to-school  grants" for September. Moreover, it wants employee ownership  of companies to be encouraged in order to stimulate consumer  spending, as was done in the automobile and housing sectors last  January. Yesterday, Edouard Balladur contented himself with  making a gesture in the direction of the textile and clothing  industries. He confirmed a program aimed at helping companies  in this sector to develop foreign markets and promote their  products. However, the textile and clothing sector is seeing  two further demands remain unfulfilled, namely the demand that  work hours be calculated on an annual basis and, more  importantly, that social security taxes be reduced.    While hailing France's foreign trade performance last year,  which "enabled us to preserve 100,000 jobs," Edouard Balladur  has found a new "carrot" aimed at encouraging companies to hire  more workers. Accordingly, he announced a new measure according  to which small- and medium-sized companies which recruit an  employee in an "export" department will receive a cash advance  from the COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade].  This advance will amount to 260,000 French francs [Fr] for  companies with a turnover under Fr300 million, and Fr300,000 for  those with sales totaling between Fr300 million and Fr3 billion.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Adams dashes hopes of ceasefire extension Hopes that the IRA might react to widespread pressure by extending its three-day ceasefire, which ends at midnight tonight, appear to have been dashed by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. With Downing Street yesterday rejecting Mr Adams' latest request for direct talks, and the IRA facing renewed calls from Dublin, nationalist politicians and church leaders to prolong the ceasefire, the Sinn Fein president said he believed it was 'unlikely, even logistically, for the IRA to extend its suspension'. With the ceasefire drawing to an end and fears rising of a return to violence in the province, both sides were trying to hold each other responsible for the deadlock in the peace process. Downing Street last night formally rebuffed Sinn Fein's demand for direct dialogue, denying that London had brought about a stalemate. But its carefully crafted two-page letter was markedly less blunt than the curt four-paragraph response it made to a previous letter from Mr Adams in January. Yesterday's response, signed by a senior official, said any pause in the movement towards peace was 'because of the continuing violence, and Sinn Fein's failure unequivocally to renounce violence as a means of achieving political ends'. Downing Street also reiterated Mr John Major's pledge that the government would be ready to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein 'within three months' in the event of a permanent end to violence and a commitment by Sinn Fein to the democratic process. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday broke off his holiday in Cyprus to say that an extension to the ceasefire was 'essential' if the strong momentum for peace was to be maintained. His message was repeated in a hard-hitting speech by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, who called the IRA ceasefire 'pathetically brief' and called for it to be permanently extended. Mr Spring used a conference in County Kerry to challenge republican leaders to display 'vision and courage to build', rather than to destroy. He insisted that the Downing Street declaration remained the only way forward for political progress in Northern Ireland and that a renewal of violence would 'not appreciably change the basic realities in the declaration'. He said Sinn Fein's failure to specify its concerns over the declaration had given rise to 'understandable worries' that the party's aim was to draw both governments 'into a world of verbal mirrors and shifting goalposts' and to enter political negotiations 'on a basis of armed conflict'. Mr Spring also criticised unionist leaders for their 'dogmatic refusal' to join talks, which he said they should do out of 'enlightened self-interest'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by President M. Shaymiyev at special 20th session of </F> the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan; date not given]    [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies!    Probably no one needs to be persuaded that there will be  economic reforms in the Republic of Tatarstan only if there are  the corresponding social and political prerequisites. If the  social processes occurring in the republic are considered from  this viewpoint, an unequivocal conclusion may be drawn: All the  necessary prerequisites for a resolution of the economic  problems in Tatarstan are today to hand. We are talking  primarily about the increasing trend toward a strengthening of  civil peace and interethnic harmony. We had also noted the  positive nature of this factor in constitutional development  earlier. Reality is confirming its value by the day. Everything  that contributes to a stable atmosphere and the formation of the  civil society and a multiparty system will receive the maximum  support from us. It is a question of respect for the sovereignty  of the multinational people of Tatarstan and the priority of  human rights, regardless of nationality, sex, or religious  belief, and the assurance of the rule of law and constitutional  legality. Today, more than ever, especially as we move toward  the 50th anniversary of Victory Day, we all need the organic  connection of the generations and their mutual responsibility to  one another and the creation of a kind of association of  patriotic forces and the incorporation in them of all those who  love their native land and work on it and all those for whom the  words "I am a citizen of Tatarstan" have profound moral meaning.    Proceeding from this, I deem necessary an acceleration of  the  elaboration and adoption of a republic program of patriotic  upbringing based on the best traditions of our people. The  creation of new mechanisms and procedures for notifying the  public of the most important events of domestic and foreign  policy occurring in the republic also is pertinent. And mention  has to be made of an increase within the framework of the law in  the responsibility of the news media and an improvement in the  work of radio and television. In a word, reforms need to be  given the go-ahead in the ideological sphere.    A most important condition of economic transformations in  the  Republic of Tatarstan is the development of relations with  Russia. The strategic goals in this direction are clear, they  have been set forth both in the republic constitution and in the  Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan treaty of 15  February 1994. I believe that it is possible to speak with a  full sense of responsibility about the consensus of the public,  which has recognized this treaty, that has taken shape. The past  three months have shown in various aspects--constitutional,  personal, national--the soundness of our policy and the absence  of any alternative to it. No, the treaty has not automatically  removed all current problems. But its role lies elsewhere--being  the instrument of their solution. There was a most active debate  on this and other matters in the course of the working visit of  B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, to Tatarstan.  The visit was essential for both the Russian and the Tatar  sides. And the fact that this trip took place following the  signing of the Social Accord Treaty lends the visit particular  political significance. The range of problems discussed, raised  largely on our initiative, and of the decisions on them was  quite broad. The economic and financial theme was represented by  plans pertaining to the Kama Truck Plant and the Yelabuga  Automobile Works--in respect to which decisions have already  been adopted--and the defense and oil-refining complexes.  Agreement was reached on the Russian side's participation in the  restoration of the Kazan Kremlin historical and architectural  monument. Assistance to representatives of the Tatar diaspora in  Russia and an expansion of the international relations of the  Republic of Tatarstan were discussed specifically and  fruitfully. We thereby succeeded, aside from the solution of  political questions, in involving the Russian Federation  Government in the current implementation of federal and joint  programs on the territory of our republic. And the central place  in the negotiations was occupied by the question of the  effective realization of the Russo-Tatar accords, of course.    Attaching importance to the realization of the treaty and  the  intergovernmental agreements, Boris Yeltsin and I formed a  bilateral commission composed of representatives of the supreme  executive of both parties for supervision of the progress of  fulfillment of these agreements. Members of the commission,  which is headed on our side by M. Sabirov, prime minister of the  Republic of Tatarstan, include V. Likhachev, vice president of  the Republic of Tatarstan, R. Muratov and F. Khamidullin, deputy  prime ministers, and Sh. Arslanov, minister of foreign economic  relations of the Republic of Tatarstan. On the Russian side the  president entrusted leadership of the commission to O.  Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Russian Federation  Government. This commission has been instructed to draw up  proposals for the decentralization of the economy of the Russian  Federation on the basis of the example of the Republic of  Tatarstan. This is a continuation of the agreements that we  achieved at our suggestion immediately following the signing of  the treaty.    This attention to the treaty is perfectly explicable. The  innovative role of the Republic of Tatarstan in the reform of  Russia and its contribution to the building of a renewed  federation today is a generally recognized fact. The recent  meetings between the leaders of the Republic of Tatarstan and  the leadership of Turkey, Poland, and Austria and business  circles of the United States, France, Germany, Bulgaria,  Hungary, Lithuania, and the CIS countries and numerous  publications in the national and foreign press point to this.    The treaty has evoked interest also as a possible approach  and procedure for the settlement of regional conflicts in  Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia and in Russia itself.    Esteemed people's deputies!    Throughout the second session, the economic situation has  been discussed keenly and with concern by the people's deputies  and by the entire population of the republic, I would say. The  spectrum of positions and opinions is most wide--from acceptance  of the measures presented by the government through their  complete rejection. This is understandable since even venerable  scientists and experienced practical experts have proven  incapable of making a precise analysis of what is happening in  the Russian economy and in the CIS as a whole at this time and  of presenting a prescription for recovery. Each speech heard  here today, therefore, whether it be liked or not, should be  perceived as a set of proposals geared to the recovery of the  republic's economy. They will undoubtedly be studied and  adopted, as far as possible, for the formulation of the  appropriate anticrisis documents. There is on the part of  certain deputies an aspiration to politicize the situation and  to attempt to discern in the explorations of the president, the  government, and its individual members insurmountable  contradictions in an evaluation of the course of the reforms  that should, in their opinion, bring about the immediate fall of  the government or something else besides. To expect such an  outcome and to connive at this in every possible way is to  utterly oversimplify the ways of extrication of the economy from  the pre-crisis state. Yes, indeed, the situation is very  complex, and it requires of all of us an objective appraisal and  a balanced, skilled approach in trying to overcome it. Whereas  the government has thus far succeeded by half-measures in  mitigating or eliminating the emergent problems of the  transitional period, it is now necessary in a number of areas to  fundamentally alter our approach, advancing the reforms, and to  adapt to the market.    Having opted, as distinct from other regions, for the path  of  a gentle entry into the market, we have in these years created a  sparing regime for the entire populace of our republic, and the  state authorities have undertaken here reforms with a human face  in a more stable economic situation.    And what we have all encountered today, the absolute  majority  of regions of the Russian Federation, if not all, encountered  two years ago. And the population of these regions is  experiencing the costs of the mistakes made in the course of the  reforms. We told the people honestly that the difficulties of  the transitional period would confront us also. We have thus far  tried to push them away as far as possible. But how, since we  are all in a single economic space, can it be otherwise. And  this day has now come.    In their politicized speeches some deputies are interpreting  the ongoing processes in their own way, unfortunately. They  proposed that the economic reforms be conducted otherwise, they  say. But they were not heeded, and this is the result. But they  are for one reason or another silent about the results where  reforms have been undertaken in accordance with analogous  proposals. And it is, after all, roughly according to their  format that the reforms have been undertaken in almost all  regions of the Russian Federation. And? We are today expressing  discontent at the mistakes that have been made and because of  which, being in a single economic space, our economy also is  suffering. If you have something to say, therefore, you should  say it objectively, not one-sidedly.    In a word, this means urging us on toward a worse situation,  that to which, according to their logic, we should have aspired  and that which we should have reached more rapidly. No, we did  not do this. And the people understood us and understood us  right.    What, then, is happening at this time? The peak of the  arrears crisis, which has exposed all commodity producers,  having shown the extent to which they are prepared for survival  under the conditions of a reduction in the timeframe of the  transitional period, has now arrived. The entire economy faced  the dilemma:    to consent to a wholesale mutual offsetting of accounts and  via hyperinflation alleviate the position of the commodity  producers and, through them, facilitate the accomplishment of  many current social tasks, preserving here, and also for the  future, many inefficient works, on which practically everyone  relied and still relies;    the second path is a strict policy of curbing the rate of  inflation within the framework of that promised the IMF and, via  radical measures, putting the commodity producers under survival  conditions. It is now clear to all that it is this version that  has been chosen. There is no doubt that the uncertainty in terms  of time in the actions of authorities of all levels and the  inevitability of the attempts to combine these two versions made  the position of the basic commodity producers even worse.  Today's situation in the economy is not an individual Tatar  phenomenon, it is a phenomenon that has encompassed without  exception all of Russia and the CIS. In a word, the entire basis  of the USSR.    When an arrears crisis hits, it affects first and foremost,  naturally, territories with a powerful industrial-energy  potential and specific works.    The slump at major works means not only a shortfall in tax  revenues, it signifies primarily the reduced incomes of the huge  number of people employed there. There is no doubt that this is  causing a deterioration in the social position of a large part  of the population, of the industrial regions particularly.    The decline in production is substantial everywhere. The  decline here in Tatarstan in the period January through May  amounted to 30 percent; production constituted 70 percent of  last year's level. In Nizhniy Novgorod--66.9 percent, Penza--64  percent, Mordvinia--55 percent. Production in the period January  through April in Tatarstan was at the level of 70.2 percent, in  Saratov--61.1 percent, Udmurtia--70 percent, and  Chelyabinsk--64.7 percent. In Bashkortostan, it was 78  percent--somewhat lower [as published] because it managed to  maintain oil production thanks to the existing large  oil-refining capacity. This is what is happening in the national  economy and economics as a whole.    There is no doubt that unless inflation is subsequently  permitted to a moderate extent and there is selective support  for the agro-industrial complex and individual sectors of the  economy, the situation as a whole could prove not only critical  but profoundly critical. And a real crisis in the economy could  erupt in our republic also.    The edicts of the Russian president that we discussed during  the meetings of heads of the republics proceed, therefore, from  a recognition of the situation that the Russian economic space  as a whole has now encountered. I believe that as a result we  succeeded in speeding up somewhat B. Yeltsin's adoption of a  number of edicts on the economy. But this does not indicate that  there will be wholesale payments and that inefficient works will  be preserved. There will be nothing of the sort because these  edicts are being accompanied by the implementation of measures  pertaining to the bankruptcy and the sale of inefficient  enterprises. No one state and no one person is in a position  today of continuing to support unprofitable production. There is  no other solution.    We speak a great deal about the problems of the  military-industrial complex, yes, there truly are such, and they  need to be studied, but the decline in production in four months  of the current year is connected primarily with the reduction in  production in the oil and petrochemical sectors. They account  for 39.4 percent of the decline and the military-industrial  complex, on the order of 7 percent of the total decline,  although the military-industrial complex also experienced a  reduction in volume in the four months of 47 percent. Arrears in  the petrochemical complex constitute approximately R1.5  trillion, and if we consider that in the first quarter this  complex accounted for almost [figure illegible] percent of the  republic treasury receipts, thus also the problem of the tardy  payment of the wages of persons in the publicly funded sectors,  the shortfall in the receipt of monies for support of the  agro-industrial complex, and much else. This is to what  attention needs to be paid first and foremost.    This is an example that shows how important it is for the  government to know, on the basis of a more in-depth analysis,  how to find the key aspects on which the fate of the budget and  the resolution of social problems depends. I believe that this  is understood and that purposive work will be done.    Speaking of the priority measures for economic recovery, I  agree entirely with Deputy T. Abdullin, who proposed an  investigation into the movement of finances and their resources  in the republic. There was virtually no mention of this in the  report, unfortunately, yet this question is at this time fateful  for the economy of Tatarstan. If we wish to abandon the high  lending rate and concentrate within the republic our own credit  resources and make efficient use of the finances that are formed  on the territory of the republic, the study and resolution of  the movement of finances is a key, urgent measure of economic  recovery.    There are questions of a strategic nature here also, and I  will speak of these later. Deputy A. Yefremov spoke in his  speech about the drain of money to other regions. These  questions are all interlinked and require very serious, skilled,  and competent intervention.    Or take the circulation of bills: First, it is largely  thanks  to its introduction that we have in recent years succeeded in  having the least decline in production--in the period 1991-1993  it constituted 36.8 percent for the Russian Federation, 28  percent for the Republic of Tatarstan. We managed to provide for  the turnover of mutual payments in the amount of R500 billion  via bills of exchange in 1993 alone.    Much can and needs to be done via bills of exchange in the  current year also. We are already into the sixth month, but a  fundamental approach to a further expansion of the sphere of the  circulation of bills has yet to be formulated, unfortunately.  The prime minister and government members are not managing to  overcome the psychological barrier connected with the work with  securities. Is there really any explanation for the scandalous  fact of the nonpayment for a medical diet in medical  institutions adduced by Deputy I. Mustafin, whereas there is  this entire turnover within the republic, and bill circulation  is being ignored. For according to information from the minister  of health, it is a question of debts of the Ministry of Health  to the Public Catering Administration of R32 billion, no more,  no less.    It is about such specific measures, of decisive  significance,  that we should be speaking when we deal with the priority steps  of stabilization of the economy. The bill of exchange system is  a very useful financial instrument performing an important role  in an economy in which the banking and financial systems are  insufficiently developed as yet. It should undoubtedly be under  the control of the National Bank of the republic, and care to  ensure that it not contribute to a sharp rise in inflation  should be taken here.    I believe that the adoption of a program in support of  enterprises has been dragged out unjustifiably. It is the third  time that I have spoken officially on this problem, which is one  of the most urgent. There is some rejection of that to which we  must aspire since we have embarked on the path of a market  economy. This being what we should arrive at via all-around  support for medium- and small-sized business and enterprise, and  we should, via this, secure the well-being of the rest of  society.    Note the percentage increase from year to year in the  proportion of income tax from individuals. Two years ago it  constituted 6 percent, last year, approximately 11 percent, and  now it constitutes 17.5 percent of our tax base on the revenue  side. This is the part of the tax base that the treasury is  confident it will receive. It is growing and will continue to  grow.    In four months we received on average as income tax from  individuals in the republic an average [as published] R11,000  from wages. From the persons that are employed in the  entrepreneurial structure this figure constitutes R53,500.  Economics requires calculation, profound analysis, and an  ability to determine priorities. We are talking today about  measures for the recovery of the republic's economy. And the  administration chiefs should be clear in their own minds that  the main source of the formation of local budgets should be for  many of them income from enterprise, medium- and small-size  business, not subsidies. Enough of soliciting subsidies. When it  comes to allocating subsidies, the government must act  differently. We need to make provision for the direct dependence  between the amount of subsidies, which we give many cities and  districts each year, and the extent of the development of market  structures and how they are developing enterprise and medium-and  small-size business.    Look, the Kama Truck Plant has suffered a big disaster, but  Naberezhnyye Chelny continues to live, and lives pretty well.  Count up what the income from entrepreneurial activity is there.  Everyone needs to bolster and increase the revenue side of his  budget. Yes, whether some people like it or not, the real estate  market has, as M. Sabirov's report said, to begin to operate at  full strength. There is no market economy without a real estate  market. A change in the nature of the work of the banks and  financial services is needed.    I have dwelt merely on certain aspects concerning urgent  measures--there are many of them, unquestionably. The main thing  now, having adopted them, is to concentrate on their immediate  solution [as published]. The government needs to be afforded an  opportunity to realize what it is proposing. We cannot permit  ourselves a lengthy warm-up period. I believe, therefore, that  the deputies will support the government and permit it to  realize all that it has devised with regard to the observations  made during the discussion of this matter. I believe that this  is at this time the front of activity and, simultaneously, the  fate of the government.    A program of Tatarstan's socioeconomic progress, which will  require in-depth study and time, if only until the fall, is  undoubtedly needed for determination of the prospects of our  development. After all, it is not the question of a program as  we have become accustomed to understanding it but of a clear,  precise, and practical program, specific for all executants,  which we should follow every day. All our actions should be  undertaken in accordance with this long-term program of republic  economic and social progress.    We have thus far succeeded, thanks to the Program of Social  Protection of the Populace, in holding back the process of a  decline in the living standard of our population. The main  indicator of determination of the living standard of society as  of this time is the ratio of per capita income to the magnitude  of the subsistence level.    In April of this year it was as follows: 1.99 for the  Republic of Tatarstan, 1.55 for the Russian Federation. These  indicators vary by the month, but the difference has never yet  been less than 0.5 in favor of the Republic of Tatarstan. This  indicates that the living standard in Tatarstan is 20-25 percent  higher than in the Russian Federation on average.    A social consequence of the transitional period of the  economy en route to the market is the stratification of the  population in terms of income level. The main mechanism of  realization of this policy also [as published] is the program of  targeted social assistance, which has been in effect in our  republic for more than a year.    Today the deputies have been asking: What have we gotten  from  "an increase in the minimum wage in the republic to R30,000  compared with the R14,600 for Russia." It is said here that the  average monthly wages of a person working in the national  economy in Russia are approximately 20 percent higher than in  Tatarstan.    I also have to make things clear in regard to what comes  next. These are not comparable figures. It needs to be  considered that the level of the average wage for Russia is  greatly influenced by the regions of the Far East and the Far  North, the high amount of the earnings in which is determined by  weightings and extra payments. If, however, we take the  Volgo-Vyatskiy and Volga regions, the level of the average wage  among the 13 territories in Tatarstan is in second place,  whereas the prices of bakery and meat and dairy products with us  are lower, except for Ulyanovsk. And you know that our cities  come second and third among 110 cities of the Russian Federation  in terms of cheapness of the consumer basket. The public should  know this.    How are we to act today, when the economic situation is  becoming increasingly complicated and the government is  proposing that minimum pay be established in the amount of  R50,000. We need to get a clear picture first and foremost of  whether we will adhere to the policy of prevention of the  wholesale impoverishment of our society or not. Our methods have  been justified thus far. Here are the figures of the Center for  Information Science, Administration, and Forecasting for 28 May:  The subsistence level according to the procedure for our  republic is R46,500, according to the procedure for the Russian  Federation, R49,000--this on our territory. Whatever, the  minimum wage must be in the range of this amount. Otherwise the  living standard of society will decline even more.    The terms "poor" and "destitute" have appeared in the press  frequently as of late. There have been attempts to exacerbate  the social situation in this way. Nonetheless, it is a warning  signal, and the government must remember this. It has submitted  its proposal concerning a rise in the minimum wage. This matter  has been framed correctly, I believe. Who are the main opponents  of an increase to raise minimum wage to R50,000? The leaders of  enterprises that are operating inadequately, I believe.    We are putting this condition to the commodity producers:  The  Supreme Soviet and the government do not agree that some of them  cannot pay those whom they have hired the subsistence minimum.  It is our people that are working there! In this case we must  tell them; you do not have the right to deprive them of the  subsistence minimum. And if you are not in a position to provide  people via their wages with the minimum without which it is  impossible to manage, thought needs to be given to the  competency of such commodity producers.    I agree that there are many issues here, particularly in  respect to the publicly funded organizations. The budget deficit  is considerable, as it is. I believe that the difference in  respect to the payment of pensions that has come about should be  assumed by the Retirement Fund, and in respect to the  unemployed, by the Employment Fund, which should begin to  operate properly. The enterprises, on the other hand, should  look after those whom they have hired.    Unemployment is a particularly important problem. But the  market society in which there is no unemployment does not exist.  There is a greater or lesser number of unemployed, but this is a  somewhat different issue.    Unfortunately, some people are exaggerating this matter, as  though the phenomenon were typical only of Tatarstan. Here are  recent figures: Unemployment in Tatarstan constitutes 0.36  percent, in Bashkortostan--0.82 percent, in Mariy El--3 percent,  in the Chuvash Republic--4.3 percent, in Udmurtia--3.9 percent,  in Nizhniy Novgorod--1 percent, in Samara--0.67 percent, and in  the Russian Federation--1.6 percent, of the total size of the  able-bodied population. Yes, there is, in addition, concealed  unemployment. But account has to be taken of one fact: If the  enterprises cannot give their employees the minimum, this should  be done via the employment authorities in the procedure  established by law. Such are the laws of the market, and such  are the functions of the state under the conditions of the  market. Catering for the subsistence level is our duty. We are  organs of state power. We could, I believe, support the proposal  of Deputy G. Kobelev and, having modified it, put the question  of the minimum wage on the agenda of the next session. But a law  on the minimum consumer budget must be adopted today or  tomorrow. Otherwise we would be binding the government hand and  foot because the subsistence level includes expenditure on  public utilities, transport, food, and much else.    In conclusion I would like to say this. The government has  proposed urgent measures for economic recovery and has  simultaneously submitted for your consideration a list of all  the enforceable enactments that it needs to realize these  measures. I have calculated that we will have to draw up and  adopt 15 bills, 12 decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers, and two  presidential edicts. But time is pressing. I believe that, in  accordance with the government's request, you will entrust to  the president the adoption of the edicts legislatively  enshrining the realization of the urgent measures pertaining to  economic recovery in order for the government to have something  to take as a basis prior to the Supreme Soviet's adoption of the  corresponding laws. Commissions of the Supreme Soviet should  join in the elaboration of these legislative instruments also.    I would like to make particular mention of the Program of  Socioeconomic Progress. This program is essential. The republic  needs a medium-term comprehensive and balanced program of  embarkation on the path of socioeconomic progress.    The long-term goal of the program is a rise in the living  standard of the average inhabitant of Tatarstan, and for this,  the creation of a healthy market economy with growing potential.    To this end it is essential:    --to preserve the state's capability for maintaining law and  order, ensuring the safety of the citizens, and defending  property; providing for the transfer of state property to as  great an extent possible to the private sector; and, what is  particularly important, providing for the necessary minimum  living standard for the transitional period.    This program should ensure the creation in Tatarstan of a  mixed economy with a large and stable private sector and a  solvent public sector.    May this proposition be the answer to the question: What  kind  of republic economy do we ultimately envisage?    A great deal of work is being performed on the creation of  the program. Foreign specialists and well-known scientists and  practical experts of Tatarstan are working on it. I believe that  we will be able to offer it for your consideration by the fall.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

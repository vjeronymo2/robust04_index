			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEVIN COPELAND WAS A MODEL HUMAN BEING  </P> <P> My friend Kevin Copeland was the epitome of the perfect young man. Not only was  he an outstanding and personable athlete in football and track, but he was a  true gentleman off the field as well.  </P> <P> His untimely death not only stunned his family, school and myself, but also  many fellow prep football players who heard of him and played against him. He  had a bright future, since he virtually had his choice of any college he wanted  to attend (i.e. Notre Dame, Michigan). Academically and physically he was a  prize pick for any university.  </P> <P> Thank you for showing the proper respect for him on the front page, and not  using the story as some tiny footnote in the back. He would have made the top  story anyway by scoring five touchdowns in a 4-A championship game, but  unfortunately it ended up like this.  </P> <P> We'll all miss you, Kev.  </P> <P> MARK FEATHERSTONE, Windsor Hills  </P></p>

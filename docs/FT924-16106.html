			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Argentine pensioners protest POLICE sealed off Argentina's Congress in central Buenos Aires yesterday as pensioners held a demonstration as part of a year-long campaign for a rise in pensions. They protest outside Congress every Wednesday. Last week, they had stormed a police barrier. This led to scuffles which the government claims were started by seven 'extremist' provocateurs. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, has refused all increases not funded by increased taxes or contributions. The government's hard line has only increased the pensioners' desperation. Argentina has about 4m pensioners whose benefits consume 7 per cent of gross domestic product. The government has refused to increase the minimum pension of the equivalent of Dollars 150 a month because it says the public pension fund is bankrupt. It is working on a pensions reform, replacing state benefits with private ones.</p>

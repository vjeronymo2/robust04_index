			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Milika Sundic from the "Sunday at Ten" </F> program]    [Text] The current situation on the territory of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is actually neither that of war nor peace.  The Muslim-Croat coalition is obviously not adhering to the  one-month cease-fire agreement that had been reached with many  difficulties. There is also a serious danger of what will happen  in the days ahead. It is also uncertain as to whether the  one-month cease-fire will ensure further negotiations on the  settlement of the crisis on the territory of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Therefore, the most important thing is to preserve peace at  any cost. The second most important thing is to invest  additional efforts so that the negotiations on the final  solution to the crisis can continue.    The most important thing is what the contact group is going  to do with the maps, because it is obvious that the latest  meeting in London has not resulted in an accord among the  countries that are participating in the meeting. There is even  a mention of major differences in the views of West Europe and  the United States, while not much is known as to what Vitaliy  Churkin was promoting at these talks in the contact group.    If one is to judge this according the results of Radovan  Karadzic's visit to Moscow, and what [Russian Foreign] Minister  Kozyrev said after that visit, one could expect the Russians  this time to insist that some vital interests of the Srpska  republic be satisfied. This vital interest does not only amount  to percentages, that is, to the 49 percent, but to the integrity  of the Serbian territory in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Without that territorial integrity, the Srpska republic could  obviously not accept any agreement, even if this were to the  detriment of an agreement for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At this moment all the factors that protect and defend the  interests of the Srpska republic and the interests of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must be extremely careful not to  find themselves in the situation that could be abused against  the Srpska republic -- here I, of course, also refer to the  republic of Serbian Krajina -- as well as the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia.    At this moment it would not be prudent to discuss anything  else but focus on the soonest possible establishment of a  lasting and just peace. The Srpska republic has obviously been,  is, and will be prepared to accept any just peace. On its part,  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is ready to accept any  agreement that would satisfy the interests of all three sides in  the conflict.    However, one should be wary of those forces in the world who  obviously do not care for a lasting and stable peace on the  territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I primarily refer to  some West European quarters and the United States, and  especially to the Republic of Croatia. A just settlement of the  crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is obviously not in its  interest as it expects that further complications in the crisis  there would help Croatia to achieve some of its aims vis-a-vis  the republic of Serbian Krajina.    I do not know whether the international community is  sufficiently ready and able to realize the essence of the  current crisis, but one thing is clear: If the United States  and the European Union cared for a lasting and stable peace,  that peace could be established as early as tomorrow. They must  exert additional pressure on the Muslim-Croat coalition to  accept peace. Contentious issues can be discussed and negotiated  until a lasting and stable solution has been found.    Therefore, the situation is extremely uncertain. The  greatest danger comes from the uncertainly of what the maps will  look like. This time I believe Russia will finally realize all  the behind-the-scenes activities of the United States, Germany,  and some other member countries of the European Union aimed at  granting the Muslim-Croat coalition something that does not  belong to them, to the detriment of the Srpska republic and thus  to the detriment of the Serbian people and the Serbian lands as  a whole.</p>

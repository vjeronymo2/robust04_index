			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, French President Francois Mitterrand will  arrive in our country on a state visit until 27 April. This  visit will further deepen equal and mutually advantageous  cooperation between the two countries. Our program recorded an  interview by our correspondent with Jean-Paul Vezian,  extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of France to  Uzbekistan.    [Vezian, in French fading to Russian report] The official  visit of French President Francois Mitterrand to your country,  says Jean-Paul Vezian, is considered in France to be very  important because this is the first visit by a head of state of  one of the EU countries. Today, we know Uzbekistan as a country  with an ancient culture and at the same time a young and quickly  developing country that values the preservation of peace and  provisions for collective and calm work of all the peoples  residing in Uzbekistan. We are expecting a lot of development  in the social and political spheres, the creation of a  democratic and open society, and the implementation of reforms  allowing for the overcoming of the crisis situation in the  economy inherited from the former USSR.    Answering a question on specific examples of French-Uzbek  cooperation, Vezian pointed to cooperation in reviving the field  of aviation in the country. Uzbekistan is one of the first  countries in the region that has introduced airbuses constructed  by Europeans for its aviation routes. These are being prepared  in France and in Germany. There is a very interesting project  for the joint reconstruction of Tashkent airport, which in its  current condition cannot meet the increasing demands of Tashkent  as a major center in Central Asia. The firm Thompson for  example, is carrying out the introduction of radar equipment at  Tashkent airport.    We are hoping to participate in the development of all  spheres of industry, noted Vezian, which will allow Uzbekistan  to achieve real economic independence. This is foremost in the  fields of oil and cotton processing, and also the food industry.  We already have interesting projects for irrigation,  construction of textile and oil processing enterprises, the use  of cotton for the production of paper, and also public services  in various cities of the country. We hope for the successful use  here of French firms' experience in the production of food  products. In short, we are prepared to support all efforts for  the speedy industrialization of the most important areas in the  economy.    I think that initial successes will be strengthened by the  introduction of the national currency, which will strengthen the  mechanism for guaranteeing foreign investments. In the final  instance it will be these factors that will create favorable  conditions for the successful economic development of the  country.</p>

He had to pay a  high price for his hesitant attitude toward Bosnia, Somalia, and  Haiti. The credibility and predictability of U.S. foreign  policy have been damaged.    All the conflicts mentioned, however, pale before the  exacerbating crisis surrounding North Korea. North Korea is an  isolated and desperate country whose regime is capable of  incomprehensible actions. It is trying to blackmail the whole  world with its nuclear facilities. The big question is: Are  patience and diplomacy suitable weapons to respond to this  provocation or is it time to reply with the same toughness to  this blackmail, as shown by George Bush in the Gulf war against  Saddam Husayn?    It is certain that the policy of cautious patience that has  been adopted so far is no longer sufficient. Slow-motion  reactions are not appropriate for a regime that is trying to  gain time because time gives birth to tough nuclear realities in  this conflict. CIA leader Woolsey proved this recently by  pointing out that, in all likelihood, North Korea possesses the  first nuclear weapon.    Everything suggests that Clinton will continue to seek a  diplomatic solution, enriched with gestures of a military threat  and economic sanctions. For the time being, he rules out a  military confrontation. It may well be that the time for  toughness -- as adopted toward Saddam Husayn at the time -- has  not yet come. However, if Washington wants to exert diplomatic  pressure, this can only take place with the willing cooperation  of the most important partner in this conflict -- that is China.  Thus, it is all the more incomprehensible that Clinton risked  direct confrontation with Beijing in his policy toward China.  Diplomacy may still be the most important weapon in relations  with North Korea but only so long as one does not use it to  shoot oneself in the foot.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Bosnian army in offensive BOSNIAN government forces, in the absence of a political settlement, yesterday sought to enlarge their territory, launching an offensive on the Croat-held town of Vares, central Bosnia. UN officials said the mainly Moslem army was trying to link up with soldiers trapped in the Croat enclave, mostly spared in the 19-month war. 'The Bosnian army opened up a route to relieve its people within the pocket. Having done that, the Bosnian army is pressing ahead with an assault along the northwest-to-south-west flank of the Croat forces,' said Colonel Bill Aikman, UN spokesman. Sarajevo radio said the offensive followed the destruction by Bosnian Croatian forces of Stupni Do, a Moslem village on the outskirts of Vares. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) 'burned houses and killed civilians,' said the radio. 'The village of Stupni Do is still burning. There will soon be an offensive to liberate this part of Bosnia.' Vares, under the control of the HVO, lies on a key road from Sarajevo to Tuzla, one of the biggest government strongholds, in the northeast. Bosnian government forces, under President Alija Izetbegovic, are trying to re-open the route to Tuzla, blocked since the collapse last May of their alliance with the HVO against the Serbs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Twelve more foreigners were banned from entering the  country to take part in human rights conference on East Timor.  This brings to 20 the number of foreigners banned from the East  Timor meeting. East Timor resistance leader Jose Ramos Horta  was among those who were earlier banned from entering the  Philippines.    Meanwhile, Senate President Edgardo Angara is supporting the  move to ban the participation of foreigners in the conference.  For his part, Senator Arturo Tolentino expressed concern over  the ban. He says the move reflects a weakness in the country's  foreign policy.</p>

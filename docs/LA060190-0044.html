			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NAVEL ACADEMY' GRADS BELLY UP FOR DIPLOMAS  </P> <P> Bellybutton down the hatches. The 990 new graduates of the "Navel Academy" have  a serious spelling error on their diplomas.  </P> <P> A printer mistakenly spelled the word "naval" as "navel" on the diplomas passed  out at Wednesday's commissioning ceremony.  </P> <P> Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke said officials detected the mistake on the parchments  before graduation but decided it was too late to correct the misspelling before  the commissioning exercises.  </P> <P> "The commercial contractor has agreed to reprint the diplomas and distribute  them to our graduates at no cost to the government," Van Dyke said.  </P></p>

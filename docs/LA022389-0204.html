			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE TRAFFIC WORRIES, EXECUTIVES UPBEAT OVER FUTURE, UCI POLL FINDS  </P> <P> Most Orange County executives hold an optimistic view of the year to come and  expect their companies to grow in 1989, but they worry that traffic and other  problems threaten to undermine the county's attractiveness as a place to do  business in the future, a UC Irvine poll revealed Wednesday.  </P> <P> Fifty-six percent of the respondents cited the transportation system as the  major problem facing the county. The lack of lower-cost, or affordable, housing  ranked a distant second, with 12% of the executives citing it as the biggest  problem to deal with.  </P> <P> Other concerns included increasing commercial rents and land prices, the  overall cost of living in the county and difficulties in hiring qualified  workers for many skilled, technical and managerial positions.  </P> <P> For those reasons, 41% of the respondents said they expect the county's  attractiveness as a place to do business will decline over the next 10 years --  compared to 34% who said they expect the county's attractiveness to increase.  </P> <P> The 1989 Executive Survey and Employment Forecast is based on the responses of  chief executives and chief financial officers of 194 county-based firms. The  findings showed little change from the university's 1987-88 survey. The  findings were also quite similar to the results of a survey of Orange County  business executives conducted by The Times early last year.  </P> <P> And as in the previous polls, the problems identified in this year's survey  failed to dim county executives' outlook, said Jone L. Pearce, a UCI associate  professor of management and co-director of the UCI Center for Orange County  Research survey.  </P> <P> Although two out of five executives said the county's business climate will  decline in the next decade, only one in 10 said it is "very likely" that their  company will move out of the county in the next 10 years. And 48% said it is  very likely that their companies will expand in the county.  </P> <P> The fact that 10% of the respondents said their companies will probably move  out of the county by 1999 is not disturbing, Pearce said.  </P> <P> The responses, she said, tended to come from older manufacturing firms and  businesses unable to afford the county's commercial rents. Their absences will  be more than made up for, she said, by the expansion of existing firms and by  new firms that either move in from outside the county or are started in the  county.  </P> <P> Asked to identify solutions to the county's pressing transportation problems,  the executives suggested comfortable standbys: 35% said more freeways are  needed, 24% said existing freeways should be widened and 20% said the county  should invest in a fixed rail system. People movers, monorails and other more  futuristic solutions weren't mentioned with enough frequency to be cited in the  survey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tolls, User Fees Suggested  </P> <P> Half of the executives suggested tolls or other user fees to pay for  improvements in the transportation system, 25% said they would support a sales  tax increase and 20% suggested a tax on new construction.  </P> <P> Because job creation is a prime indicator of the direction the economy is  taking, the executives were asked for their hiring projections for 1989. Half  said they intend to increase employment.  </P> <P> Overall, the executives forecast a healthy 3% increase in the number of jobs  available in the county by year's end, Pearce said.  </P> <P> A mathematical forecast prepared by Ralph Catalano, professor of social ecology  at UCI, projects that 30,000 jobs will be created in the county this year. That  will represent a 2.6% increase from the 1.14 million jobs that existed in  December, 1988.  </P> <P> The executives said the most sought-after employees will be clerical, sales and  crafts workers and unskilled laborers. A year ago, managers and professional  and technical workers were the prime hiring targets.  </P> <P> Although 41% of the respondents said they expect the county's attractiveness to  business to decline over the next decade, only 36% said they believe the  business climate has worsened in the past year; 33% said it has improved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manufacturers Downbeat  </P> <P> Manufacturers -- who tend to look for large, unskilled or semiskilled worker  pools and low-cost sites for their plants -- predominated among those who  anticipate or have seen a decline in business climate. Retailers and financial  executives predominated among respondents anticipating increased attractiveness  to business.  </P> <P> In a measurement of their confidence in the future, leaders of businesses with  more than 100 employees awarded the economy a score of 80 -- the equivalent of  a B+. That stands well above the 53, or "so-so" score, recorded in a nationwide  confidence sampling by The Conference Board.  </P> <P> And executives of small business and professional services firms -- included in  the 3-year-old UCI survey for the first time -- were even more optimistic. The  20 small-business leaders were asked whether they believe that their own  companies' economic performances will increase or decrease in 1989. Ninety  percent said they expect increases and 10% said they believe things will stay  the same. None anticipate decreases.  </P> <P> In a similar nationwide poll by D&amp;B Reports, 71% of the small-business  executives anticipated increased financial performance this year, 16% said  things will stay the same and 13% said they expect to see declining  performance.  </P> <P> Lyman W. Porter, a professor of management and co-director of the UCI survey,  said that county business executives tend to be highly optimistic because the  diversity of the businesses shields the county from the damaging economic  crunches that can hit areas where one or two industries dominate.  </P> <P> "And the kinds of businesses that are here -- medical and high technology and  retail and service -- are the kinds of businesses that have done well in the  general economy over the last 3 years," Porter said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW EXECUTIVES RESPONDED TO SOME SURVEY QUESTIONS  </P> <P> What is the most important public policy issue in Orange County?  </P> <P> Transportation:56%  </P> <P> Affordable Housing:12%  </P> <P> What is the chief impact of the transportation situation on your firm?  </P> <P> Hours lost through employee tardiness:36%  </P> <P> Difficulty in servicing customers:15%  </P> <P> Cost of time spent on transportation:15%  </P> <P> What do you believe is the best solution to the traffic situation?  </P> <P> Build new freeways:35%  </P> <P> Widen existing freeways:24%  </P> <P> Build fixed rail transportation:20%  </P> <P> How should we pay for traffic system improvements?  </P> <P> Toll roads and user fees:50%  </P> <P> Sales tax increase:25%  </P> <P> Taxing new construction:20%  </P> <P> Source: UC Irvine's Center for Orange County Research  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW EXECUTIES OF COUNTY BUSINESSES VIEW THE NEXT 10 YEARS  </P> <P> Although 41% of executives surveyed said Orange County will be a less  attractive place to do business in 10 years, with 34% saying the county will be  more attractive, a strong majority said their businesses are very likely or  somewhat likely to expand during that period.  </P> <P> COUNTY'S ATTRACTIVENESS IN 10 YEARS  </P> <P> More:34%  </P> <P> Same:25%  </P> <P> Less:41%EXPECT TO EXPAND IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Very Likely:48%  </P> <P> Somewhat Likely:22%  </P> <P> Not Likely:30%  </P> <P> </P> <P> REASON FOR DECREASED ATTRACTIVENESS OF ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Of those executives who said the county will be a less attractive place to do  business in 10 years, 33% gave traffic congestion as the primary reason.

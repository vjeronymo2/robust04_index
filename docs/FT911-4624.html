			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / European Diary (Ireland): Narrowing road for Ireland's travelling people IRELAND'S travelling people do not appear in the tourist brochures. But their caravans are parked on the roadside approaches to most of the country's cities and towns. Clothes are hung on hedges. Children play among bits of scrap metal and rubbish. The travellers - also referred to as 'itinerants' or more commonly 'tinkers'  -are Ireland's nomads. They are on the bottom rung of Irish society. An investigation by a government sponsored body in 1986 described their living conditions as intolerable. Half had no access to piped water, a toilet or electricity; 40 per cent lived by the side of the road on unofficial sites under constant fear of eviction. 'No humane and decent society, once made aware of such circumstances, could permit them to persist,' it concluded. Circumstances have changed little. The infant mortality rate of travellers is nearly three times the national average. Life expectancy is far lower. To most of the population, the travellers are a troublesome group who turn garden suburbs into scrapyards, and steal milk from doorsteps and washing off the line. They drink and fight and are not to be trusted. The traditional view, reflected in much official policy, is that travellers should be settled and blend in with the rest of the population. But travellers are now pressing for better treatment. They want recognition as a separate ethnic group, challenging the view of Ireland as a mono-cultural country, where racism does not exist - simply because, apart from the Irish themselves, there are no races. There are about 21,000 travellers in Ireland - half of one per cent of the population. While much of their history is either lost or is as yet unresearched, there are written references to them in the 12th century. The travellers' language, called cant or gammon, is an Irish yiddish, utilising old Gaelic words, English and words which seem to have roots in various other European languages. Travellers have tended to marry other travellers. There is a deep sense of clanship and even today marriages with 'settled people' are rare. Until recently travellers would roam the roads of Ireland, practising various trades along the way. They would also cross to England and Scotland. The men would make tin pots and pans (hence 'tinker') and the women would sell. In autumn there would be potato-picking. Travellers were also renowned as traders, in particular of horses and donkeys. Like nomads in many parts of the world, they have seen their old way of life all but disappear. Plastic and aluminium ruined the tin-making trade. Increased mechanisation meant fewer farm jobs. Door-to-door selling has become a thing of the past. Most of all, travellers have found it increasingly difficult to find places to park their caravans. Often there have been clashes with local residents. Mary and Kathleen McDonagh are travellers who run, with government and private help, a laundry service in a traveller's settlement on the outskirts of Dublin. Cousins in one of the more famous traveller families, they have been living in the same area for 17 years. 'We were here before any of the houses round here were built,' says Mary McDonagh. 'Travellers have nowhere to go any more.' Though both women live with their families in government-built houses, they still regard themselves as travellers. 'In summer especially, I'd want to be on the move,' says Kathleen McDonagh. 'I'd love to take off again. My children feel the same.' She admits times were hard. She had 12 children: only six are still living. Travellers have begun to protest about the way they are discriminated against. They are not allowed into most public houses and they say that recently insurance companies have begun refusing them cover for their cars and vans. In Dublin they have to go to a special office to collect welfare payments, unlike others who can make such collections in their neighbourhoods. Some schools insist that travellers attend separate classes. Mr Niall Crowley, a social worker who has been involved with travellers for many years, says that there must be an anti-discrimination law in Ireland, as in other EC countries. 'Settled society is destroying the travellers way of life and making it illegal,' says Mr Crowley. 'They were once self-sufficient. Now they have no alternative but to exist on government handouts.' There is some evidence that official attitudes are changing. Mr Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister, recently spoke of the 'depth and value' of the travellers culture. The government realises that the travellers won't just go away. The birth rate in the travelling community is well above average: 80 per cent of travellers are under 25 years of age. The young, like the old, insist on keeping their travelling way of life, despite all the difficulties. 'It's hard to burn the wildness out of a wild bird's nose' is an old travellers saying.</p>

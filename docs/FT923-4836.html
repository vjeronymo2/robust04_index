			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Japanese deals dominate primary market JAPANESE borrowers dominated primary market activity today, with deals in the dollar and yen sectors. Japan Development Bank launched a Y100bn seven-year deal, via Nomura, which met broad demand in the wake of extensive pre-marketing. The rally in the Japanese bond market, oversold earlier in the week, provided a more positive tone for the offering. Other potential borrowers in the sector include the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. The JDB issue was bid at 99 1/2 at the end of trading, unchanged from its fixed-price reoffer level. Meanwhile, Hokuriku Electric Power launched the first of an expected spate of offerings in the dollar sector by Japanese utilities. The Dollars 200m five-year deal was considered quite attractively priced to yield 54 basis points over the five-year Treasury yield at launch. Demand for five-year Eurodollar bonds is growing, due to the steep increase in yields between three and five-year bonds, which is tempting some investors further along the yield curve. In the Swiss bond market, the Republic of Ireland launched a SFr100m private placement of 7 1/4 per cent notes due 2002, arranged by Swiss Bank Corporation. Two more banks launched subordinated floating-rate note issues, with minimum and maximum coupon levels. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Dresdner Bank added a total of Dollars 200m to the recent supply of paper.</p>

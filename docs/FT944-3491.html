			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No dramatic change in UK labour market Sir, Simon Burgess and Hedley Rees are to be congratulated for nailing another myth about the UK labour market: that lifetime jobs have become a thing of the past (Personal View: 'Jobs for life still available to many', December 9). Their research findings showing only modest changes for men in the average duration of jobs and no change for women need to be taken on board by all those interested in welfare, employment and training policy. Evidence from the US matches that for the UK. In 1979, 30 per cent of Americans reported that they had been in their current jobs for more than eight years. In 1991, 31 per cent said they had been in their jobs for more than eight years. So in the two most flexible western labour markets, the length of job tenure has either changed very little or not at all. These findings go alongside other research, for example relating to the absence of significant growth in temporary employment, which suggests that changes in the structure of employment in the UK in recent years have been far less dramatic than is commonly supposed.

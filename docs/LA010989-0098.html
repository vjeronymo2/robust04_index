			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET SUICIDE RATE ON DECLINE, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's suicide rate has fallen since 1985, partly as a result of  the Kremlin's anti-alcohol campaign, a Soviet medical journal said Sunday.  </P> <P> In 1987, 54,000 people killed themselves in the Soviet Union, Meditsinskaya  Gazeta said, citing the States Statistics Committee as its source.  </P> <P> It did not give any overall statistics for any other year but did say that the  rate had declined, especially among men, since 1985. For example, among men  aged 50 to 59, the suicide rate fell from 98.5 per 100,000 people in 1985 to  56.1 in 1987, it said.  </P></p>

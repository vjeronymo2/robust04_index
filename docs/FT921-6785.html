			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Appointments: Piloting LWT London Weekend Television yesterday appointed its youngest ever executive director - 29-year-old Neil Canetty-Clarke. Canetty-Clarke, who came to the London television company from Morgan Grenfell Securities, has been appointed deputy director of finance of LWT (Holdings) and director of finance designate. He will succeed Peter McNally, group finance director, when he retires at 60 in March 1992. Canetty-Clarke, an Edinburgh University commerce graduate, joined LWT to work on the company's capital reorganisation. This process could well make millionaires out of some of the top people at LWT if the share price clears a certain threshold. The first hurdle towards that has already been cleared  -retaining the franchise. Neil Canetty-Clarke is well qualified for the high life at LWT; he has a private pilot's licence. ***** Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based subsidiary of National Australia Bank, is appointing Charles Love, chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland and head of branch banking for TSB Bank, to succeed its chief executive Richard Cole-Hamilton when he retires at the end of this year. Love, who is 46, has spent his entire career with TSB and has been based in Edinburgh since early 1990. His job there was recently widened to include all TSB's retail banking operations, which are run from Birmingham. Cole-Hamilton, 58, said last July that he would retire by the end of this year and headhunters were appointed to find a successor both externally and from inside the bank. He has been chief executive since 1982 and presided over the bank as it was sold by Midland to NAB in 1987. Love, a Scot who was born near Edinburgh, will join Clydesdale Bank in a few weeks' time.</p>

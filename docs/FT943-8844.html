			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / World Cup proves a winner with wide range of companies While this year's World Cup may be only a fading memory for football fans, the tournament continues to provide a warm glow for many companies which were involved behind the scenes. A string of international businesses from airlines and hoteliers to television manufacturers and brewers has begun to disclose the profits they made from the competition, held in the US. The main British winner appears to be Guinness. The drinks group, which was the official brewer to the Irish World Cup team, believes there was a fivefold increase in its beer sales during last month's competition. Brewers were also among the main beneficiaries in the US. According to retailers in Orlando, where Ireland played two of their four games, local sales of imported beer jumped 365 per cent in June, with the Dutch brand Heineken leading the pack. Airlines operating out of principal European centres also fared well. British Airways, which last week reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 1994, said the good performance continued through the weeks preceding and during the World Cup. American Airlines, the official carrier for the competition, said that compared with the year before it carried an extra 70,000 people across the Atlantic in June, followed by an additional 59,000 in July. Virgin Atlantic, the airline owned by Mr Richard Branson, reported excellent business in June and July, already one of its busiest periods. It said its aircraft into Florida had been 'absolutely packed'. Despite these increased passenger loads, the US business bonanza predicted by the World Cup's organisers did not materialise. However the tournament did produce its share of US winners off the field. Nike said retailers were reporting strong interest in its soccer boots during and after the tournament. Another clear winner was W H Smith, the UK newsagency group which operates airport and hotel gift stores across the US. Buoyed by demand for World Cup merchandise from visiting fans, sales at the stores were Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) during the World Cup, three times the average for the Super Bowl championship of American football, said W H Smith. For the television broadcasters, the 52 World Cup games were a success by the standards of previous viewing figures for soccer in the US, but the two networks which showed the tournament - ABC and ESPN - were unable to profit from the better-than-expected ratings because all the advertising time was sold before the World Cup began. The US Spanish-language television network Univision, however, did say it earned about Dollars 24m in advertising revenues during the US World Cup compared with just Dollars 10m from the Italy World Cup in 1990.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Still, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  protection of uninsured liabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fueled the argument that such protected liabilities should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be assessed. Since the assessment base already consisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as it still does) generally of total domestic deposits, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universe of non-assessed liabilities was limited to foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits and non-deposit liabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 141(a) of FDICIA amended section 13(c) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDI Act to impose a revised test for failure resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead of requiring that the resolution be no more costly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than liquidation, the new test requires use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution method that is least costly to the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit insurance fund. Provisions for present-value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses and documentation are specified in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the least-costly resolution method. The FDIC may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not protect uninsured deposits unless it is less costly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide such protection than not to do so. Further, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC is prohibited from pursuing any action, directly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly, that would have the effect of increasing losses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the insurance fund by protecting foreign deposits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (generally meaning deposits payable only outside the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States). Hence, all-deposit P&amp;A transactions are still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitted, provided the insurance fund does not incur any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss with respect to such deposit liabilities in an amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than the loss which would have been incurred with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to such liabilities if they had not been assumed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the acquirer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The perceived ``too big to fail'' doctrine has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced by a new statutory exception for situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving ``systemic risk''. In such cases_as determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by consensus among the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Reserve System, and the Secretary of the Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (in consultation with the President)_the FDIC may take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action or provide assistance as necessary to avoid or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigate the systemic effects of failure. However, the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required to recover the losses incurred under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systemic risk exception through one or more special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments on the members of the affected insurance fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As yet, this exception has not been used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net result going forward is that for any individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution, protection will be provided only for insured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits unless it is less costly to protect uninsured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits as well. In any instance (expected to be quite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rare) in which the ``systemic risk'' exception might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triggered, the FDIC is required to recover the loss to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable deposit insurance fund by means of a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment on the members of that fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been argued in the past that the assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be expanded beyond total domestic deposits in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conform the base to the actual protections provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FDIC under the failure-resolution policies. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many now believe that, given the new failure-resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies, this rationale for expanding the base has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weakened. (Of course, a shrinking of the assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be viewed as warranted under the failure-resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, or an expansion might be warranted for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Depositor Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In August 1993, Congress enacted legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing the priority order for payment on claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against an institution in receivership. As amended by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation, section 11(d)(11) of the FDI Act now provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the priority of deposit liabilities of the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over other general or senior liabilities. (Subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-guarantee provisions of section 5(e) of the FDI Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims with priority over deposit liabilities are secured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims to the extent of the security, and administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses of the receiver.) This situation raises the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question of whether, or to what extent, the assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should reflect the protection granted by this provision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uninsured deposits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Analytical Framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the FDIC's intention to apply an assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition that addresses the requirements of the deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance program over the long run, rather than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed only to respond to the current conditions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banking industry. To this end, the FDIC has identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain characteristics that it believes can be used as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for analyzing and comparing alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions. These criteria, which address the issues and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns discussed in the preceding section, are outlined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. They are applied in the final section of this Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a framework for analyzing various alternative assessment-base definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

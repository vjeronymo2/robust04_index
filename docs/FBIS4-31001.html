			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 1 (BTA) -- Today parliament passed at  second reading the National Security Service Act. The National  Security Service [NSS] (which stands for Bulgarian  counterintelligence) was set under a 1991 act regulating the  activity of the Interior Ministry and rescinding all previous  legislation concerning the ministry's structures.    The newly passed act defines the National Security Service  as  a specialized counterintelligence unit of the Interior Ministry  which is responsible for the protection of security and the  lawful state administration against encroachment. The National  Security Service has different sections: operations, analysis  and planning, coordination, training and administration,  centralized data processing, and operational documentation.    The National Security Service will be engaged in activities  aimed at safeguarding this country's security and will manage,  control and coordinate the activity of local national security  departments with regional police directorates nationwide.    Under this act, the National Security Service will be  authorized to collect data by examining facts, individuals and  sites related to national security, to guard strategic  activities and establishments, to clear would-be employees in  such establishments and officials for access to material  constituting a state secret, and to exercise border control over  documents and vehicles. NSS officials are allowed to use  special surveillance means in performing their duties.</p>

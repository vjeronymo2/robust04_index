			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER ORDERED TO YIELD CONTROL OF YANKEES  </P> <P> Baseball Commissioner Fay T. Vincent stripped George Steinbrenner of his  control of the New York Yankees on Monday for associating with gambler Howard  Spira.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner will remain as part-owner of the Yankees, but was forced to resign  as principal partner.  </P> <P> "Mr. Steinbrenner will have no further involvement in the management of the New  York Yankees or in the day-to-day operations of that club," Vincent said.  </P> <P> Fans at Yankee Stadium for a game against the Detroit Tigers greeted the  announcement with a 90-second standing ovation.  </P> <P> The agreement followed a daylong meeting in Vincent's office and was the result  of a four-month investigation by the commissioner's office into Steinbrenner's  dealing with self-described gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> "This sad episode is now over," Vincent said, adding that he had made his  decision in order to "preserve and protect this noble game."  </P> <P> "I'm greatly disappointed in Steinbrenner's actions," Vincent said. "He ignored  the responsibilities of the commissioner of baseball . . . he paid the famous  $40,000 to a gambler without coming to me under circumstances which he said  amounted to extortion."  </P> <P> Spira claimed he was given the money for information that Steinbrenner could  use against former Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield (now with the Angels), with  whom Steinbrenner had a long-running feud.  </P> <P> Vincent said Steinbrenner's relationship with Spira "was not in the best  interest of baseball" and that Steinbrenner will no longer be able to exercise  day-to-day control of a team he has run since 1973 but would remain as a  limited partner with shares in the Yankees organization.  </P> <P> He said Steinbrenner would have to reduce his interest in the team to below 50%  and added that Steinbrenner agreed to the penalties.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner must resign as general partner by Aug. 20, when someone will be  appointed to take his place, subject to the approval of Vincent and the other  major league teams.  </P> <P> Vincent said the new general partner could be Steinbrenner's son, Hank, but the  commissioner cautioned that anyone in that position found to be consulting with  Steinbrenner on baseball matters would be subject to expulsion from baseball.  </P> <P> "For all purposes, Mr. Steinbrenner agrees that he is to be treated as if he  had been placed on the permanent ineligible list," Vincent said.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner will, however, be allowed to consult on major business decisions  involving the Yankees, but he must ask Vincent's permission to attend games.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner agreed not to contest in court the decision or the commissioner's  power to make it.  </P> <P> "I will not comment on the decision," Steinbrenner said. "I'm very happy it was  resolved. I'm very satisfied with the resolution, and that's all I'm going to  say."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner is the only owner to be severely penalized twice for major  offenses. He was suspended in 1974 by then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for making  illegal campaign contributions to former President Richard M. Nixon.  </P> <P> He has been fined several times, most recently on July 5, when Vincent docked  him $25,000 for tampering with Winfield in the days after his May 11 trade to  the Angels. The Yankees also were ordered to pay the Angels $200,000.  </P> <P> This time, Vincent disciplined Steinbrenner for violating Rule 21, otherwise  knows as the "best interests of baseball" clause.  </P> <P> The investigation centered on Steinbrenner's $40,000 payment to Spira, a  31-year-old New Yorker who describes himself as a former gambler and a former  employee of the David M. Winfield Foundation. The commissioner wanted to know  why Steinbrenner gave the money to Spira.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner testified before Vincent on July 5 and 6 and gave various reasons  for the payment. Among them were that he was afraid Spira would attack his  family, that he gave Spira the money "out of the goodness of my heart" and that  he wanted to protect two former Yankee employees from embarrassing revelations.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner's testimony implicated Manager Lou Piniella of the Cincinnati  Reds, a former manager of the Yankees, but the commissioner's office cleared  Piniella of any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: C1,8,9  </P></p>

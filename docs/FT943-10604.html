			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Railtrack plans for the unthinkable: What the result of the supervisors' ballot could mean for the signalling dispute The outcome of the railway supervisors' ballot due to be announced this afternoon could have a crucial impact on the signalling dispute. Officials of the RMT transport union are publicly confident that supervisors will support action so that they can join strikes on Friday August 12 and on the following Monday and Tuesday. This would follow the seven days' notice of strike action required by law. But in private officials seem less sure of the ballot result and are playing down its significance. The 1,200 supervisors oversee the work of the 4,600 signalling workers, as well as instructing them and testing their work. The work of the supervisors, who earn an average of about Pounds 20,000, is critical in ensuring safety. Railtrack estimates that just 385 of the supervisors belong to the RMT and have been ballotted - about a third of the total number. If they reject the strike call the pressure on the union to make a swift settlement will be substantial. Such a vote would undermine the solidarity of the signalling workers and make it easier for Railtrack to persuade an increasing number to ignore strike calls. But both sides are planning contingencies in the expectation of a Yes vote from the supervisors. A fortnight ago Railtrack officials seemed unprepared to contemplate such an outcome. They still hoped that a settlement could be reached before there was any question of supervisors joining the strike action. Since then management has had to start preparing for the unthinkable. It is clear that Railtrack and British Rail would not be able to run as many trains as they have been in the past few weeks if the supervisors joined the strikes. But Railtrack said that it was impossible to estimate how serious an impact that would have on services. Observers believe that some supervisors will not heed a strike call, partly for fear of managerial reprisals. Whatever sympathy supervisors may have for signalling workers it is by no means certain it will translate into joining a dispute that is only indirectly relevant to them.</p>

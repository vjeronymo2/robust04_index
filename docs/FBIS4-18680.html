			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Christian Democratic Center </F> Considers Joining Forza Italia"]    [Text] Rome -- Smiling and optimistic, their ties bearing  the symbol of the Sail, they have decided to become "the cement  of the cement," or the guarantors of the pole of freedoms and  its true political function. The Christian Democrats of the CCD  [Christian Democratic Center] elected to parliament, yesterday  met in a Rome hotel for their first group meeting. Naturally,  however, talk concentrated on the storm raging inside the pole  of freedoms. Key concepts set out in instructions issued by  Pierferdinando Casini, Clemente Mastella, and Ombretta Fumagalli  Carulli read: "The only candidate to head the government is  [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi." The second point was:  "We will not allow the League to enforce a presumed relative  majority within the pole." In other words, the CCD could join  up with Forza Italia in parliament but its votes are available  to Silvio Berlusconi, enabling him to do without the seats held  by the League. The third point requires the immediate drafting  of laws on two fundamental issues, information and justice (for  the former, this means the launch of a law affecting not just  TV, but also newspapers, advertising, and cinema. In the words  of Fumagalli Carulli: "a law that confirms general and  fundamental points and which releases the sector from its  chains." Where justice is concerned, it must be quickly decided  whether or not it is necessary to alter the rules for the  election of the CSM [Higher Council of the Magistracy], the  legislating body for informers, and the obligatory nature of  penal action.    On the future government, all things considered, the CCD is  confident (otherwise we will have to immediately return to the  polls). What about the anguish in the PPI [Italian Popular  Party]? We are ready to welcome into our ranks only those who,  in good faith, have changed their mind about our political  plan." What about Formigoni's [PPI] approach? "If they are  roses, they will flourish."</p>

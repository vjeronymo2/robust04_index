An article published by the newspaper TRABAJADORES explains  local authorities allow all temporary trips abroad with a  minimum of procedures and this has resulted in the issuance of  100,000 of these authorizations in 1993.    Only 30,000 people, however, were able to fulfill their  wishes because the others were denied the corresponding visa,  mainly by the U.S. interests office in Havana.    Regarding citizens who definitely wish to settle abroad, all  the Cuban Immigration Directorate demands is a visa from the  country to which the applicant is going, enough funds to pay for  the ticket, and, in the case of males between 16 and 27 years of  age, completion of their military service.    The paper explains that thousands of Cubans who live abroad  also received, in recent months, permission to visit the island  following a simple procedure taken care of at the Cuban  consulate in the country of their residency.    The newspaper adds: Contrary to Cuba's attitude, Washington  does everything it can to make the immigration issue another  thorn in the extremely difficult bilateral relations, opening  its doors to all kinds of enemies of the revolutionary process  and encouraging the desertion of professionals as part of a  preconceived policy.    The newspaper states that no boundary whatsoever has been  respected in this undertaking, and adds the fact that the  normalization of immigration relations has always been a goal of  the Cuban Government is rejected.    For example, it mentions the failure to comply with an  agreement signed in 1984 in which the United States accepted the  figure of 20,000 visas per year for Cuban applicants who wished  to travel to U.S. territory and an additional 3,000 visas for  people who were punished for counterrevolutionary crimes.    Also, it condemns the fact that the White House facilitates,  without exception or numerical limit, risky illegal departures  from Cuba, which extract a high price in lives of victims who  are instruments of a destabilizing action which violates  international laws.</p>

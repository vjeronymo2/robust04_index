			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: ICI in talks to sell powder coatings arm IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, yesterday announced that it was in discussions with Ferro of Cleveland, Ohio, about the sale of its powder coatings business. ICI said the business, with annual sales of about Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m), did not fit in with its core operations. It employs about 350 people, half in the US and half in Europe. Although the sector, which provides coatings, mostly for domestic appliances, office furniture and automotive components, was growing faster than gross domestic product. ICI said it did not believe it had the critical mass to succeed in the busi-ness. Ferro said it thought the market was growing at 10 to 15 per cent a year. The group was in discussions with ICI about a possible joint venture last year. Ferro, which generates annual sales of about Dollars 100m in powder coatings, said ICI's operations would fit well with its business. The company said it was in the top three in the world market and already had some operations in the UK and continental Europe. ICI insisted yesterday that discussions were at an early stage. It would be premature to forecast the outcome of the talks, although both parties were confident that an agreement would be reached. The value of the transaction is expected to be less than 1 per cent of ICI group assets.</p>

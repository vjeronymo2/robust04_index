			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Xiaoqing (0491 1420 7230)] </F>   [Text] Chongqing 4 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chongqing,  the largest city in southwest China, is adopting various  measures to curb consumer prices, including temporarily holding  back several price increases and comprehensively checking all  prices.    Sun Tongchuan, CPC Chongqing City Committee secretary,  speaking at a session of the city committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference today, said that  Chongqing did great work in stabilizing prices last year,  revising the catalogue of price control, restructuring prices,  and insuring the basic market stability of grains, edible oil,  and vegetables. Presently, because of a comparatively  conspicuous contradiction between price-curbing, price  readjustment, and the expansion in investment scope, Chongqing's  retail price index rose by 20.8 and 28 percent in the first two  months of the year respectively, and the situation was stern.    Sun Tongchuan said to pursue the socialist market economy  does not mean that the government rejects price control. The  government should exercise control in such areas as studying and  formulating policies, organizing and insuring the supply of  important consumer goods, setting up a price regulating fund,  and augmenting supervision and control over market prices.  Chongqing has already decided to temporarily hold back the  price adjustments scheduled for April, and at the same time, a  great price check will be undertaken in order to resolutely halt  arbitrary price rises and charges. The government will strictly  encourage the practice of attaching explicit price tags to  various consumer goods and making public service charges. In  addition, Chongqing is to accelerate the completion and  perfection of the market price mechanism, set up, complete, and  perfect necessary regulating and monitoring systems to keep  Chongqing's price rises to a minimum, and work hard to maintain  Chongqing's economic and social stability.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> DARING U.S. AIRBORNE ASSAULT MAY REWRITE MILITARY TEXTBOOKS  </P> <P> When the first of 4,500 U.S. paratroopers dropped out of the early-morning sky  at Panama's Torrijos International Airport on Wednesday, it marked the opening  of a daring and unprecedented assault that military analysts believe will be  studied as a textbook case for years to come.  </P> <P> From a strategic standpoint, the attack was executed with planning and  precision that analysts called particularly remarkable because of the vast  distance covered by the troops, who were flown in from the United States, and  the complexity of their mission.  </P> <P> Experts stressed that their appraisals dealt only with the technical military  aspects of the operation, not the policy issues behind President Bush's  decision to order the assault -- much less the potential political controversy  that may erupt at home if order is not quickly restored in Panama and sporadic  fighting continues, even if at a militarily insignificant level.  </P> <P> That being said, considered purely in terms of military operations, the  Pentagon's handling of the massive assault appears to have been a considerable  achievement.  </P> <P> Waves of paratroopers, helicopter-borne Green Berets and Navy commandos mounted  a multipronged assault aimed at neutralizing the headquarters and the most  loyal battalions of the Panamanian armed forces. The paratroops were among  nearly 10,000 troops airlifted as far as 3,500 miles from Ft. Ord in  California.  </P> <P> Until this week, the major surprise attacks in modern military history have  been launched from much shorter distances and relied for transportation  primarily on ships. The Allied invasion of Normandy, perhaps history's greatest  military surprise since the Trojan Horse, involved crossing about a 75-mile  stretch of the English Channel.  </P> <P> "To go on the offensive, to project troops that far, it's a classic," one Army  general said. "You'll be reading about it in military histories for a long  time."  </P> <P> The scale of Operation Just Cause is also dwarfed by the 1950 Inchon landing at  Inchon, in which 261 vessels put 40,000 U.S. Marine and Army troops ashore on a  spit of land south of Seoul during the Korean war -- a daring end-run that cut  off thousands of enemy troops. Gen. Douglas MacArthur's famous landing, staged  from ships offshore, is considered a brilliant example of surprise and the use  of amphibious tactics.  </P> <P> But it was a slow-motion, short-range event compared to Wednesday morning's  timed-to-the-minute, long-distance projection of force by air.  </P> <P> Analysts outside the government tended to agree with the Defense Department's  claims that the assault achieved its primary goal of cutting off the Panamanian  military from its leader, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, even if it failed to capture  Noriega himself.  </P> <P> "I have a hard time believing that the strategy was to capture Noriega, because  that was iffy to begin with," said a retired Army general. "They expected that  he would not be caught, and that is one of the reasons they used so much force.  When you put 15,000 or 20,000 troops into a battle, you practically eliminate  the possibility of failure in the overall goal."  </P> <P> Several analysts said there is no precise precedent for this type of military  strike in U.S. history. The 1965 invasion of the Dominican Republic was the  closest parallel, but it occurred over a longer time period, and the first  contingent was only 405 Marines.  </P> <P> "There is nothing even resembling this in major U.S. wars, from World War II to  Korea and Vietnam," said the retired general, who asked that his name not be  used.  </P> <P> The most dramatic strategic element of the Panama assault recalled elements of  another, far more massive surprise action -- the invasion of Normandy by more  than 100,000 Allied troops on June 6, 1944.  </P> <P> As in Panama, paratroopers were a key component of the Normandy plan, and  members of the 82nd Airborne division participated in both. And as in Panama,  they landed at night after jumping out of airplanes -- already a high-risk  enterprise -- becomes far more dangerous.  </P> <P> To some military experts, the successful parachute drop by the 82nd Airborne  Division's Ready Brigade in Panama symbolized the precision of the entire  operation.  </P> <P> "Night drops of parachutists are enormously difficult and complicated, so this  was a rather hairy operation," said retired Army Col. Harry Summers, a  specialist in military strategy. "Because this difficult operation went well,  it is a good sign that the planning for the entire operation was pretty sound."  </P> <P> Summers also praised the isolation of the central elements of the Panamanian  Defense Forces as another sign of good planning and execution.  </P> <P> Despite the overall effectiveness, Summers said that he saw two substantial  mistakes -- the failure to secure the Marriott Hotel in Panama City, where  Noriega forces seized a number of Americans as hostages, and the failure to  immediately knock out the city's radio transmitter.  </P> <P> "Taking out the radio transmitter would have been easy with smart munitions,"  Summers said. "They could set the frequency of the radio transmitter on the  bomb and blow it away. But it was in a heavily populated area, and they felt  the number of civilian casualties would be too great."  </P> <P> However, he suggested that a ground force should have been assigned to destroy  the transmitter as a top priority to prevent Noriega from trying to rally the  nation, as he attempted to a few hours after the invasion.  </P> <P> "The failure to secure the Marriott Hotel was a significant failure," he added.  "The American people were getting their news from journalists there who were  very scared, with good cause, and all the successes were being lost."  </P> <P> The attack has been described in some quarters as overkill, with critics  contending that the U.S. force -- about 22,500 troops in all, including roughly  13,000 already stationed in Panama -- was far larger than necessary. Many of  them argued that a "surgical strike" involving a smaller number of troops would  have been more effective as well as more politically palatable.  </P> <P> However, Summers and others said that the size of the force was necessary to  ensure success when trying to control the far-flung forces of the PDF. Summers  insisted that the notion surgical strikes are effective is more illusion than  reality.  </P></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Middle East: Kuwait clear-up deal for US ONE of the first long-term contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait seems set to be awarded to Waste Management, the largest waste services company in the US. Chicago-based Waste Management looks likely to be given one of the world's biggest clean-up jobs - clearing the debris left by the Iraqis from the streets of Kuwait City. So far, the Kuwaiti authorities have awarded mainly short-term emergency contracts, but Mr George Villasana, Waste Management's vice-president for the Middle East, said he was in the final stages of negotiating a one-year contract. Immediately after the defeat of Iraq, Waste Management crossed into Kuwait with 30 vehicles and 60 labourers and began to clean up a suburb of Kuwait City, even though it then had no contract from the Kuwaiti authorities. The company has since been awarded a month-long contract worth about Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.2m) to clean part of Kuwait. It has brought about 450 workers, mainly from the Indian sub-continent, into Kuwait to do this. Mr Villasana said he was now negotiating a year-long contract worth well over Dollars 10m to clean the majority of Kuwait City, including almost all the central districts. The rest of the work will be divided between five Saudi companies. The company will have to demolish pill boxes and clear away burnt-out cars. Mr Villasana said he aimed to return the streets to a semblance of normality within two months.</p>

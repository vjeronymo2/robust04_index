Well, very  positive signs are now emerging from the talks that have been  going on in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, since November. It  seems, the representatives of the MPLA [Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola] government and the rebel movement, UNITA  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], have  reached agreement on many of the crucial points. The first sign  of this emerged on Monday when it was announced that they had  agreed on the future composition of the police force. Well,  mediating at those talks has been the UN's envoy to Angola,  Alioune Blondin Beye. Up to now, he has been reluctant to  discuss the progress of the talks with the media, but last night  he was only too happy to tell us what has been happening. Ndai  Auhami has called him up in Lusaka and asked him first if the  progress was so substantial that the war in Angola was now over.    [Begin recording] [Beye, in French fading into English  translation] No, one cannot say that because, although we have,  well, sorted out the reinstatement of the cease-fire, we have  not yet proclaimed it. It will not come into place yet because  we have chosen a global accord, and it is only when the global  accord is finished that we will be able to say that the war in  Angola is finished.    [Auhami] Mr. Blondin Beye, what about the withdrawal from  areas occupied since the elections, and the acceptance of the  election results?    [Beye] This question has been definitely solved. A letter  signed by UNITA addressed to the UN secretary general formally  accepts to withdraw from occupied zones after the elections, and  this withdrawal has been programmed, and is already solved  militarily, and will be under UN supervision when the time  comes. Its principles and modalities have already been  negotiated.    [Auhami] Does UNITA accept the results of the election?    [Beye] UNITA has formally declared at the beginning of the  Lusaka talks, and already during the exploratory talks of  Lusaka-I that it formally accepted the September's 92 election  results and their consequences.    [Auhami] It is a very big breakthrough in Lusaka, so what is  going to happen now?    [Beye] Yes, since Monday [31 January] when the police  question was resolved, we can say that we are at a turning  point, as a sportsman climbing a mountain, who has made a great  effort to reach the top. With the police question we have  reached the top of the mountain, and we are now starting the  downward slope. Indeed, very substantial and significant  progress has been made, and with the solution to the police  question, it is a significant move forward. What is left now is  to be patient still to negotiate in the same conditions, and to  count on the same political will of the government and UNITA,  and count on the press' understanding that they should let us  work in private which has worked so well for us.    [Auhami] So, in your mind, is the killing in Angola over,  the  bloodshed over?    [Beye] Yes, I am one of those who sincerely regrets that  UNITA and the government are still having fatal combats. It is  high time now that the political will is paramount, and now that  the choice has been made to solve the Angola crisis not by  military means, but by negotiations, the time has come to put an  end to the Angola tragedy, that Angolans stop killing each other  unnecessarily as peace is near at hand. So, if the negotiations  are solved, as I hope they will be, I hope the Angola tragedy  will end. We took time, but we didn't waste our time. We  preferred to negotiate seriously and in depth to leave nothing  out, to leave no problem aside, and attack each question  resolutely and in detail in order that this time the peace be a  durable and real one, and that Angola finally know peace.    [Auhami] How long do you think you are going to stay in  Lusaka? Are you going to stay for more than two weeks, three  weeks, a month?    [Beye] I must be very modest. It would be very pretentious  of me to be able to predict on such a difficult question as  Angola. Five centuries of colonization, 15 years of freedom  fighting, 17 years of fratricide fighting do not get resolved in  a few months or weeks. We must have time to solve this  question. What the international community does not accept is  the [words indistinct] to stay put. Other than that we are  ready to invest the time necessary as long as each day marks  progress, that each day means a step toward peace. We will not  accept staying put, but if everyday we can make progress, we are  ready to go slowly. [end recording]</p>

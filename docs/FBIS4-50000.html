			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] While meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State  Kissinger at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this afternoon,  President Jiang Zemin said confrontation between China and the  United States will do no one any good, adding that the  development of cooperation between the two countries will  benefit the peoples of the two countries and the people of the  world.    Jiang Zemin said: China and the United States bear an  important responsibility for the future of the world and the  destiny of mankind. We should do something for the people of  the world. Although there are some disputes, some problems, and  differences between the two countries, in the final analysis,  efforts should be made to improve relations between them. This  is required for world peace and stability.    Jiang Zemin said: Practice demonstrates fully that Sino-U.S.  relations are not merely limited to bilateral ties but are  closely related to the international situation. In the past,  Sino-U.S. relations developed more smoothly whenever both sides  were able to overcome their differences in social systems and  value concepts, proceeded from their common interests, developed  mutually beneficial cooperation, and continually expanded common  points on the basis of mutual respect, noninterference in each  other's internal affairs, and treated each other on an equal  footing. However, Sino-U.S. relations met with difficulties or  setbacks, or even regressed whenever these principles were  violated, differences over ideology were stressed, the other  side's interests were ignored, views were imposed on others, and  sanctions and pressure were applied. These historical lessons  are very profound.    Jiang Zemin stressed: A good opportunity has presented  itself for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is hoped  that both sides will grasp the opportunity, respect each other,  seek common ground while reserving differences, and work  together on the basis of the principles set forth by the three  Sino-U.S. communiques, so as to enable their relations to  develop on a healthy and normal track.    During the meeting, Jiang Zemin praised Dr. Kissinger for  working vigorously to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the  foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman, saying  that this is commendable.    Kissinger said: I have always been against the use of the  most- favored-nation trading status [MFN] as a means to exert  pressure on China; I am also against putting pressure on China.  I hope to see greater improvements in U.S.-Sino relations.    Present at the meeting were Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu,  and others.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Five more members of  the House of Representatives bolted the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) today, bringing to 11 the number of LDP  legislators who have quit the party in four days.    Meanwhile, three lower chamber members of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), one of the seven  ruling coalition partners, said they have left the party.    The five LDP defectors said they quit the single largest  party to launch a new parliamentary group in an effort to  reorganize the political structure in Japan. They are Koji  Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo  Sato.    "We decided to quit to accelerate the current development by  our action," Kakizawa told a press conference in Tokyo.    Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, also left the  party today, saying he will join Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), the coalition's core party led by Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata.    Five other LDP Dietmen who defected the party Friday [15  April] formed a new party today called the New Party Mirai  (Future).    The three JNP members, Fumihiko Igarashi, Sakihito Ozawa and  Akio Nakajima, handed their letters of resignation to Hosokawa,  who is the JNP leader.    The three, who gained parliamentary seats for the first time  in the 1993 general election, have expressed dissatisfaction  with Hosokawa's approach to Shinseito. They told reporters that  they feel an affinity with the New Party Sakigake (Harbinger),  the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party,  the three coalition partners that abhor Shinseito co-leader  Ichiro Ozawa.</p>

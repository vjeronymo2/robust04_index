			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Global equities take turn for the better Global equities took a turn for the better last week, with the FT-Actuaries World Index gaining 2.1 per cent, but there were reservations about the prime component in the equation. Japan's rise of 4.6 per cent fell marginally short of the week's top performer, South Africa, comparatively unimportant to the World Index structure with an equity market capitalisation only 5 per cent of the Japanese level. Morgan Stanley, which was not enthusiastic about Japanese equities a month ago, has not changed its opinion. 'We are in a holding pattern now,' says Mr David Roche, its London strategist, 'but we think there will be another leg down.' In spite of domestic arguments based on the fall in price/earnings ratios, Mr Roche thinks Tokyo is still very expensive in p/e terms. He says that what is happening in the domestic economy will have recessionary, if not deflationary, consequences. In Europe, Switzerland came out fractionally better than Sweden at the top of the table, reporting strong foreign buying of its chemical/pharmaceutical blue chips. However, the Scandinavian countries were impressive en bloc, with a 3.6 per cent gain, or double that of Europe as a whole. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel says that although Finland made a good start to last week with the removal of its stamp duty, the action was in Norway and Sweden. Norway was strong across the board, having seen good domestic buying over the past two or three weeks. Support of Norsk Hydro based on aluminium and oil prices was followed by other industrials, and then the shipping sector. Sweden enjoyed a strong mix of foreign and domestic buying, led by engineering companies seen as cyclical recovery situations. While Norway may be at risk of profit-taking, says Mr Longmuir, demand for Swedish stocks seems far from satisfied.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**     sterling** US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                           1992     1992         1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        -0.01    -0.21   -20.71    +7.51    +3.77       -0.89 Belgium        +1.08    +3.23    -1.12    +5.93    +2.40       -2.20 Denmark        +3.52    +4.92    -2.85    -3.46    -6.23      -10.44 Finland        +2.69    +8.51   -20.41   +12.21    +9.29       +4.37 France         +1.72    +4.43   +13.21   +16.70   +14.29       +9.17 Germany        +0.79    -0.15    +3.24    +9.98    +6.02       +1.26 Ireland        -0.96    +1.22    -1.84    +3.98    +1.17       -3.37 Italy          -1.64    -0.57   -11.20    +0.14    -2.80       -7.16 Netherlands    -0.78    +2.82    +5.25   +10.47    +6.65       +1.86 Norway         +3.58   +11.88   -10.94   +12.28    +9.05       +4.15 Spain          +2.44    +1.73    -5.97    +3.88    +2.20       -2.38 Sweden         +3.66    +3.75    +5.12   +13.26   +10.84       +5.86 Switzerland    +3.67    +6.23   +17.61   +16.36    +7.96       +3.11 UK             +2.52    +6.68    +8.26   +10.62   +10.62       +5.66 EUROPE         +1.78    +4.29    +5.76   +10.42    +8.29       +3.43 Australia      -0.52    +4.99    +6.11    +0.21    +3.78       -0.88 Hong Kong      +2.04   +13.74   +50.46   +31.19   +38.05      +31.85 Japan          +4.59    +7.31   -29.92   -20.12   -21.63      -25.14 Malaysia       +1.71    +3.59    -3.01    +5.17   +18.67      +13.34 New Zealand    +0.94    +5.89    -9.06    -4.55    -0.56       -5.02 Singapore      +0.34    +8.29    -0.20    -0.15    +2.73       -1.88 Canada         +0.36    -0.16    -4.19    -3.57    -2.69       -7.07 USA            +0.90    +3.05   +10.75    -0.11    +4.59       -0.11 Mexico         -0.11    +1.96   +86.48   +20.16   +23.43      +17.89 South Africa   +4.95    +7.09   +23.47    +5.16    +3.10       -1.53 WORLD INDEX    +2.06    +4.60    -4.03    -3.18    -2.21       -6.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on May 8th 1992.

Construction of Japan's first engine wind tunnel  capable of testing the ramjets required for spaceplanes has been  completed at the Kakuda Research Center. The opening ceremony  was held on 7 October 1993. The ceremony was attended by 137  guests including former Science and Technology Agency Director  General Soichiro Ito and the Space Activities Commission's  Acting Chairman Tamiya Nomura. The test facility was shown to  the visitors at 2:30 p.m. and the ceremony was held at the  Kakuda City Center at 4 p.m.    The construction plan was authorized in FY88 and  construction  began in 1989.    The facility can simulate on the ground engine inlet  conditions equivalent to Mach 4, 6, and 8 during flights at  altitudes of between 20 and 35 km. In order to heat high  pressure gas to a maximum of 2300C at up to 100 atmospheres  of pressure, heat reservoir and combustion heaters are used  together. The heat reservoir heater, 2 meters in diameter and  about 10 meters in height, contains aluminum oxide bricks which  operate as a heat exchanger. The combustion heater burns a  hydrogen and oxygen mixture. The ramjet is placed in an air  current which is accelerated through a supersonic nozzle with a  51 cm square outlet to measure the engine performance and the  pressure and the temperature of every part of the engine. In  order to approximate altitude conditions, the ramjet engine test  facility is connected to the exhaust system of the existing  rocket engine high-altitude sky performance testing facility and  the pressure in the low chamber where the engine and propulsion  measuring equipment is located is lowered to 1/10 - 1/100  atmospheres.    This testing facility is the first of its kind in Japan.  Other features of the ramjet and scramjet performance test  facility, one of the best facilities in the world, include:    1) Ability to simulate a wide range of flight conditions  from  Mach 4 to 8.    2) The world's largest facility able to test up to Mach 6  using pure gas heated by a heat reservoir heater.    3) Comparison of engine performance within heated pure gas  and combustion simulated gas.    4) Simulation of engine regenerative cooling through control  of the temperature of hydrogen and engine fuel, from -253C  to 500C.    5) Ability to measure the main thrust, and vertical moment  generated by the engine.    The engine wind tunnel will be used not only for testing  high-speed flight range in Japan, but also as a significant  resource for joint use by the rest of the world.    At present the National Aerospace Laboratory [NAL] is making  a water cooling type subscale engine prototype as Japan's first  scramjet for testing. Comprehensive engine performance tests are  scheduled in this new test facility. Through the tests, the  results of the research conducted so far on elements such as air  inlet, combustor, and nozzle, parts of the engine and cooling  structures will be reconfirmed. NAL will clarify the mutual  interference effect when different elements are combined. NAL  intends to further promote ram-/scram-jet engine research by  completing a test engine that best combines those elemental  features.    The program has had its ups and downs since initiation in  1986. The most crucial task was to expand the cross-section of  the wind tunnel to twice the size of that originally planned  space specifications for the engine tunnel called for a precise  combustion simulation and cooling structure. Also the pressure  required by the facility had to be increased because the  simulated flight altitude at Mach 8 was decreased from 40 km to  35 km. The above two tasks strained both budget and technology.  However, with much support from concerned parties, including  Kobe Steel and the Science and Technology Agency, the facility  has finally been completed. The exterior building was  constructed in cooperation with Tohoku Region Construction  Bureau and Ishihara Construction Co., Ltd. and the facilities  were prepared in cooperation with Yuatech and Nissin Setsubi.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> FIGHT THE POWER: Is Public Enemy, the rap world's most provocative band,  blacklisted from "The Arsenio Hall Show"? That's what Public Enemy leader Chuck  D says in the new issue of Spin magazine. It's a charge supported by the fact  that Hall's adventuresome show has championed nearly every major rap act over  the past year -- except Public Enemy, who were in town last week for a pair of  shows at the Palace.  </P> <P> "Spike Lee told me it was because Public Enemy and him are a posse and Arsenio  doesn't like Spike," Chuck D told Spin. "But I think that the deep down fact is  that Arsenio is just plain scared."  </P> <P> Asked if Arsenio fears a "black planet," Chuck D responded: "I don't know if  that's true because I think his planet to him is his whole ego. He's just  playing it safe. He doesn't want to put us on his show because he's scared to  lose sponsors. Now the media have tagged us as racists, it's the only excuse he  needs."  </P> <P> Hall's publicist said the talk-show host had "no comment" on the charges.  </P></p>

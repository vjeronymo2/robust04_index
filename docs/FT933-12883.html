			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Struggle to find mining investors: Operating profits are up but, coal's future looks even more uncertain IT WAS hardly the perfect prelude to privatisation. Yesterday's results from British Coal were not the worst in the corporation's 45 years in the public sector - but they are potentially more harmful. The reported losses for 1992-93 of Pounds 588m compare to the biggest loss of Pounds 5bn in 1990 after the corporation initiated a capital restructuring. But coming just months before the government is due to present its coal privatisation bill to parliament they increase the difficulties ministers have in persuading financiers and industrialists that British Coal has a healthy future in the private sector. The government will argue, as British Coal executives did yesterday, that last year's losses were exceptional, brought about by an unusual combination of heavy asset write-offs and pit closure costs. The figure they will stress is the operating profit of Pounds 545m, some Pounds 123m higher than the previous year and bettered only in 1986 when there were unusual circumstances following the national pits strike. This is indeed a success story and reflects a growing ability to bring costs under control. There has been an impressive increase in productivity to 7.49 tonnes per manshift - after a doubling to 6.34 tonnes per manshift between 1985-86 and the end of last year. Meanwhile overhead, or 'above pit', costs have been halved in the past four years. Both trends will continue in the current year as the corporation proceeds with plans to reduce by half the number of white-collar staff and takes advantage of government proposals to allow changes in working patterns among miners by, for example, allowing them to work longer shifts. Next year's operating profits will be affected by a fall in the price of coal to electricity generators and a potential further decline in the contribution from opencast operations which was, until last year, a significant element in profits growth. In 1992-93, opencast contributed Pounds 160m to operating profits, down from Pounds 171m in 1991-92. The main factor affecting opencast was the increasing difficulty of winning planning permission. Increased concern about the environment is likely to reduce tonnages - down from 16.7m to 15m last year - still further. Next year's exceptional losses are likely to be less onerous than in 1992-93. Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said yesterday that the Pounds 636m write-down of assets and stock, taken as an exceptional loss, was intended to reflect the fall in prices in the current five-year contracts with generators. This means they are unlikely to be repeated when the corporation outlines its annual report for this year, probably the last before privatisation. Exceptional costs associated with pit closures will, however, recur in 1993-94. Last year's Pounds 235m is associated with 18 pits kept open for more than six months after British Coal announced their closure. Most of them are still being maintained, but not mined for more than three months into this financial year. More pit closures are on the way among the 12 mines reprieved in March and possibly among the 19 core pits. These closures will cost money to implement and will dent this year's profitability and British Coal's image further. They may, however, help to assure potential purchasers that the corporation is down to a size that the market can sustain and that exceptional costs will end before the industry is privatised. The government's ability to sell British Coal will depend on a variety of factors, including whether it splits the corporation up and whether it underwrites potential subsidence. The crucial factor for any prospective purchaser will be whether the coal can be sold. The difficulty in predicting that was underlined yesterday when Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said the outlook had worsened considerably since the white paper in March as nuclear power and gas had performed better than expected. British Coal now believes that on top of contracts it already has with electricity generators there will be space in the market for 11m tonnes of black fuels - coal or oil or orimulsion - which it could compete for.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Inflation lowest for 29 years: Chancellor hails 1.3% annual RPI rate as 'astonishing' achievement THE GOVERNMENT'S battered reputation for economic management received a boost yesterday with news that inflation had come down to its lowest level for 29 years. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hailed the drop in retail price inflation in April to a year-on-year rate of 1.3 per cent as an 'astonishing' achievement that would underpin an upturn by helping investment and jobs. UK inflation is now well below half the 3.5 per cent average in European Community countries. Only Denmark among Britain's EC partners has a lower figure. The response in financial markets was more muted, with gilts, London share prices and sterling all registering falls. Many investors believe UK inflation has bottomed, and may rise strongly in coming months assuming the recovery picks up. The retail prices index last month was 1.3 per cent higher than in April last year, after a year-on-year rise of 1.9 per cent in March. Excluding mortgage interest payments, the RPI rose 2.9 per cent between April 1992 and last month, after increasing 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to March. The lowest rate by this measure since the government started records in 1975 was exceptionally good news for the Treasury, which aims to keep this figure below 4 per cent. Although generally weak demand pressures caused by the recession played their part, the overriding reason for the shift in the headline RPI rate was the switch from poll tax to council tax last month. The average householder now pays a far smaller bill for local taxes. Another measure of inflation - the RPI excluding both mortgage payments and local tax payments - showed a small rise between March and April from 3.2 per cent to 3.3 per cent. The year-on-year rise in this measure stood at 3.3 per cent in December last year and reached a low of 2.9 per cent in January. Mr Lamont, in bullish comments to reporters outside 11 Downing Street, concentrated on the headline RPI figure, heralding this as 'excellent news'. He added: 'Britain is very firmly in the low inflation camp among the major economies and I am determined that we are going to stay that way.' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, was less enthusiastic. He warned that inflation would go up in coming months. A similarly downbeat mood was evident on financial markets, where the inflation news failed to excite investors, even though the headline RPI figure was slightly lower than the City had expected. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'We are not seeing any fundamental improvement (on inflation), more a statistical blip.' Such sentiments unsettled investors on the gilt market, where 10-year securities lost a quarter of a point. London shares slid fractionally, with the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks shedding 4.6 to close at 2,812.2. On the foreign exchange markets, the pound lost a quarter of a pfennig against a weak D-Mark to finish at DM2.5075, though up more than 4 pfennigs on the week. In New York, sterling closed at DM2.50945. Against the dollar, the pound closed in London at Dollars 1.5415 and in New York at Dollars 1.543.

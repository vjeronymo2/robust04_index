			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Arts: A code of elegance in Florida / A new village founded on principles of quality It all happens in a quiet street in Little Havana to the west of downtown Miami where a firm of architects and town planners is gradually changing the way Americans look at their sprawling suburbs and decaying urban areas. This April, Andres Duany and his wife and partner Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, who run this Miami practice, will receive the much-prized Thomas Jefferson Medal for Architecture for their remarkable contribution to radical planning. The two architects are great proselytisers for ideas that reverse the spread of urban chaos and create densely planned communities of high architectural and environmental quality. It must be at least six years since I wrote about the new town of Seaside, which Duany and Plater-Zyberk, inspired by the vision of Leon Krier and the developer Robert Davis, designed on the Gulf of Mexico. The influence of that small holiday community of some 2000 residents has now gone far beyond the remote regions of the Florida panhandle. Their second, more modest, (416 acres), planned community is the village of Windsor at Vero Beach in south Florida. This will be an exclusive haven where there will be an emphasis on golf, tennis, polo and the pursuit of happiness in beautiful surroundings. The joint developers are Geoffrey and Jorie Kent and Galen and Hilary Weston. Both Seaside and Windsor are very American in the form they take as private community developments. Their privacy, exclusivity and literal remoteness from the troubled inner cities of the world gives then an air of unreal perfection. But this is, in some ways, a mistaken view. In America, the private sector takes the lead and creates models of redevelopment that will have a wider application. The planners of these two communities are applying the same principles to deprived areas of cities and communities throughout the US. What are the principles that have made Windsor and Seaside so influential? It is the simple, intelligible planning guidelines and the architectural codes that are applied to the new buildings. The planning rules that govern the developments are extremely sensible -  similar to those of older European towns and pre-sprawl America. The town plan is dense and houses -  or their high garden walls -  are built to the edge of the site boundary. This removes at a stroke the useless acres of suburban front lawn, encourages an economical use of space and allows for the creative design of courtyard or 'side yard' gardens. This close planning will give the completed development a sense of defined, narrow streets and elegant squares. The other principle is one that prescribes a maximum walking distance of five minutes between the town centre and the houses. Existing planning regulations have to be waived to allow for narrow alleys between houses and small mews houses or blocks of garages at the end of rear gardens. This follows the old carriage house idea of towns like New Orleans and Charleston: you can also hide the cars away and house granny. Cars are accommodated but not encouraged. At Windsor it is possible to leave your car and use the small electric golf carts that are available on a 'park and ride' basis. These simple rules immediately allow for a town that feels like a town with the right level of intimacy and neighbourliness. The planning rules are accompanied by a code for the architecture which ensures the sympathetic use of appropriate materials and helps develop the town's sense of propriety and character. At Windsor the code's insistence on deep set windows, consistent roof pitches, wood balconies, high garden walls and cool colours has resulted in a town with the feel of Florida and the Caribbean. Scale and proportion, and a closely defined relationship of windows to walls are written into the code; and there is a town architect and a five man review committee to ensure civilised compliance. It might be thought that the imposition of codes restricted architectural design. This is definitely not the case at Windsor, where I saw some of the best new houses I have seen for a long time. Certainly there is a sense of tradition about some of them, but they are interpretations of tradition in a way that allows for new thinking. The house by the Washington-based architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen is a spectacularly beautiful, modern version of the Palladian villa. The house has a glorious double height salon and a large swimming pool between the main house and a handsome garden pavilion. You can slip into the pool from the windows of the salon and swim across the pool, which is lined by symmetrical rows of lemon trees, to the pavilion. It is within the codes and yet original, refreshing and splendid. Other architects working at Windsor, within both the architectural codes and the community code, are Scott Merrill, Craig Roberts and Clemens Bruns Schaub. Scott Merril has designed a terrace of rowhouses which seems to be inspired by English Arts and Crafts architecture of the turn of the century. The houses' tall chimneys and lofty rooms are complemented by elegant gardens, designed by Deborah Nevins. All architects felt that it was worth some sacrifices to stringent design codes because the end result produces a coherent context. Certainly Windsor, in its early stages, shows every sign of being one of the most beautiful and carefully designed new villages in America. It should be a serious exemplar to follow.</p>

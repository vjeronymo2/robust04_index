			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Nedashkovskaya: "Russian-Chechen Talks </F> on the Way to Harmony"]    [Text] The "Chechen revolution" three years ago was the  result of the struggle of the Russian and USSR centers for  mastery in the Russian home. Considering the present desire of  Russian politicians to achieve harmony on the territory of the  entire Federation, it makes sense recalling the events of those  revolutionary days.    In 1991, the official elite of the Russian autonomies (and  Doku Zavgayev, leader of Checheno-Ingushetia, was no exception)  supported the USSR center in exchange for the right to sign the  USSR Treaty. The national movements of the autonomies, on the  other hand, supported the Russian democrats headed by the chief  fighter against party privileges--Boris Yeltsin. The chairman of  the Russian parliament reciprocated the support of the national  leaders: it was the Russian parliament that in June 1991 sent a  telegram of greetings to the National Congress of the Chechen  People (NCCP), which had by that time proclaimed the sovereignty  of the Chechen Republic of Nokhchi-cho and announced the  republic Supreme Soviet's loss of its legitimacy.    The official leadership of Checheno-Ingushetia reacted to  the  August putsch in the same way as the leaders of the majority of  administrative and national-state units of the ex-USSR, that is,  remained in session for three days. The National Congress of the  Chechen People, like the informal movements in other regions,  organized a demonstration in Groznyy's main square and then  demanded that the "continuous-session" Supreme Soviet be  dispersed. By that time, the NCCP was supported by thousands of  unemployed persons (merely according to official figures, there  were approximately 100,000 of these in the republic) and  representatives of the "shadow economy" hoping with the help of  Dudayev's group to squeeze out the clan of Supreme Soviet  Chairman Doku Zavgayev from the main sources of revenue (oil)  and take control of these sources themselves.  <H5>  Some Things From Recent History </H5>   Representatives of the Russian leadership--General Aslanbek  Aslakhanov, member of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Presidium, and  Inga Grebesheva, deputy chairman of the RSFSR Council of  Ministers--warned Zavgayev at the emergency session of the  Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet Presidium of the  impermissibility of the use of force for breaking up the  demonstration and the national guard of the NCCP demanding  parliament's resignation. Especially since at that moment  General Dudayev was declaring that "only the laws of the Russian  Federation are valid on the territory of the Chechen Republic of  Nokhchi-cho."    The Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet resigned, and  guardsmen of the NCCP broke up the parliamentary presidium  following an assault on the House of Political Education on 3  September 1991. Power in Groznyy passed to the NCCP Executive  Committee. Russian politicians made an attempt to take control  of the situation in Groznyy. State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis,  Information Minister Mikhail Poltoranin, RSFSR Supreme Soviet  Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, and Vice President Aleksandr  Rutskoy flew to Groznyy for this purpose. But, the Russian  authorities' attempt to form a provisional supreme council made  up of deputies of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet and  Checheno-Ingushetia and political organizations ended in  failure: Hurt by the role of extra, the Congress of the Chechen  Peoples Executive Committee broke up also in the early hours of  8 October the Supreme Council that had been consecrated by the  supreme Russian authorities.    The Russian leadership's subsequent attempts to intervene in  the "Chechen revolution" led to Groznyy's isolation from Moscow,  the general mobilization of the male population, and the  declaration of a "holy war" against Russia. The elections of  President Dzhokhar Dudayev and the parliament of the Chechen  Republic were held on 27 October, and independence was  proclaimed on 2 November.    A decisive role in Dudayev's victory was performed by the  Russian presidential edict on the imposition of a state of  emergency in Checheno-Ingushetia of 8 November 1991: The  opposition, which had opposed Dudayev's usurpation of power and  had divided the republic, was forced to remove its demands and  go underground. The cancellation of Boris Yeltsin's edict two  days later could not by this time have changed anything: The  arms stores had been ransacked, and the population was armed.  The Chechen and Russian leaderships said scurrilous things about  one another, but in January 1992 still embarked on long and  absolutely fruitless negotiations on the status of Chechnya.  <H5>  Dzhokhar Dudayev and His Opposition </H5>   The opposition to Dudayev is diverse: The political and  economic interests of various opposition groups and parties are  interwoven with clan inequality and territorial demarcations.    The first opposition to Dudayev arose back in the  "pre-revolution" times, when some of the new politicians headed  by Lechi Umkhayev, unhappy with the radicalism of Chairman  Dzhokhar Dudayev, who had originally been assigned the role of  "wedding general" in the NCCP, walked out of the National  Congress of the Chechen People.    The next opposition--the Democratic Reform Movement, the  Movement for a United Checheno-Ingushetia--was formed at the  time of the "Chechen revolution" and consisted of parties and  movements unhappy with the usurpation of power on the part of  the NCCP. But the "political" opposition was small and did not  constitute a threat to Dudayev's power even at that time.    The territorial opposition, which has as of this time  embraced the valley areas, arose primarily in Nadterechnyy  Rayon, the birthplace of Doku Zavgayev, the ousted chairman of  the Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet. The mayor of this rayon,  Umar Avturkhanov, heads an opposition that calls itself  "constructive" and lays claim to a particular role in the  Russian-Chechen negotiations.    The next opposition group--that of Yaraga Mamodayev, "vice  premier of the first Dudayev intake"--arose in the spring of  1993. As local observers believe, the main motive for  Mamodayev's move into the opposition was the loss of control of  the trade in petroleum products. The rift between the prime  minister (Dudayev) and vice prime minister (Mamodayev) signified  the formation of a territorial opposition in Urus-Martanovskiy  Rayon also, in which the leading parts are being played by  representatives of the Chankhaya Clan (to which Mamodayev  belongs).    The political crisis in Chechnya and the growth of  corruption  led to the "political" opposition's demand for a limitation of  Dudayev's power being supported by both parliament and the  Constitutional Court. But, the lesson of neutralization of the  opposition with the aid of an external threat had been well  assimilated by Dudayev back in 1991: The struggle against the  opposition has invariably been conducted to the accompaniment of  the imposition of a state of emergency in order to defend the  fatherland against Russian encroachments. Parliament, the  Groznyy Municipal Assembly, and the Constitutional Court were  broken up in May-June 1993, and criminal proceedings were  instituted against parliament in January 1994 "for having  undermined the sovereignty of the republic."    But, despite everything, General Dzhokhar Dudayev's  positions  are quite stable in Groznyy. This is connected not only with the  fragmented nature of the various opposition groups but also with  the lack of a common policy in respect to the "former Russian  colony" on the part of the Russian political establishment.  <H5>  Elections Optional? </H5>   The general's enemies in Chechnya, and in the Caucasus also,  explain the president's stable positions by the fact that the  republic long since became a joint venture of the president of  Chechnya and certain Russian generals in the sale of weapons to  "flash points." And, cited as proof of this version is the  geography of the general-president's unimpeded trips--Bosnia,  Libya, Somalia.... And the absence of the signing of any  documents enshrining the republic's new status.    Negotiations between the Russian leadership and Chechnya  have  been under way since 1992, for that matter. Both sides have in  fact deemed these negotiations to be illegal. First, Chechnya  broke up parliament, accusing it of collaboration with Russia,  and then Russia's deputies this March adopted decrees of the  State Duma and the Federation Council "A Political Settlement of  Relations of the Federal Authorities and the Authorities of the  Chechen Republic," which, according to Shakhray, were essential  for overcoming the legal vacuum after General Dudayev's regime  had at the Fifth Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR been  deemed illegal.    The documents adopted by the Russian leadership were based  on  the "Shakhray concept." They provide for consultations with all  political forces of Chechnya and the signing of a treaty on the  mutual delegation of authority following "free elections to the  organs of power of Chechnya and to the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly." This wording suits that part of the Chechen  opposition that calls itself "constructive" (Avturkhanov's  group). But such a concept is not to the liking of another part  of the opposition or Groznyy officialdom.    First, because the Chechen authorities do not consider the  republic a component of Russia and Sergey Filatov, leader of the  Executive Office of the Russian Federation President, had  already let slip in an interview with Radio Ekho Moskvy that he  regarded Chechnya as a republic within the Russian Federation.  Second, because the Chechen leadership is unwilling to conduct  multilateral negotiations with the participation not only of the  "constructive" but also other oppositions to Dudayev.  <H5>  Switching Off the Electricity--Telling Argument </H5>   On the other hand, Groznyy officialdom has as of this time  no  other way but Russian-Chechen negotiations. The republic is on  the verge of a social explosion: Wages at the oil fields have  not been paid since last October; and, on 12 April, according to  an Interfax report, power in the republic was switched off for  the nonpayment of arrears--approximately R20 billion. Even the  traditional deployment along the republic's borders "on the  threshold of an emergency situation" was no help under these  conditions.    With the switching off of electricity on 12 April, the  vocabulary and tone of the highest echelon of the Chechen  Republic changed. In an interview with INTERFAX, Dzhokhar  Dudayev agreed with the position of the current Russian  establishment: "The sole way out of the current imbalance of  forces in the world is a revival of the defense might of the CIS  and the sovereign status of Russia." The ideologist of the  "Chechen revolution" and Movladi Udugov, Chechen minister of  information, cited as the most acceptable position of Russia for  them that of Valeriy Fateyev, Russian deputy minister of  economics, who called for recognition of the legitimacy of  President Dudayev and termed the attempts to make the question  of the signing of a treaty dependent on elections in Chechnya  the "imperial policy syndrome."    But, Valeriy Fateyev's words can hardly be considered  decisive, and there is also opposition to this approach not only  in Chechnya but in Russia also. But, in any event, Russia and  Chechnya are condemned to seek an accord. Especially since this  course has today been proclaimed official doctrine in Russia.</p>

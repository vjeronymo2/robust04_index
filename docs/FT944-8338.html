			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Labour to woo Tory postal rebels Labour hopes to inflict fresh embarrassment on the government over Post Office privatisation by inviting Tories who opposed a sell-off to back a Commons motion giving it greater commercial freedom. Following the government's decision not to proceed with a flotation of Royal Mail, the letters division, Labour plans to introduce an amendment to this year's finance bill which would demand new commercial opportunities for the Post Office within the public sector. In previous years the Commons has held a single vote on the entire finance bill, which contains the main provisions of the Budget. However, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, believes there are strong grounds for Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, to allow an amendment relating to the commercialisation of the Post Office in this year's bill. He also intends to introduce an amendment calling on the government to abandon an increase in value added tax on fuel. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected to give the go-ahead to the increase in his Budget next week. Labour whips in the Commons believe both amendments could cause difficulties for the government because they might be supported by a number of Tory rebels. Earlier this month about 12 Tory MPs wrecked the government's plan for a majority sell-off of Royal Mail by stating that they could only support the commercialisation option. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, who was one of the principal rebels, said last night that he might be prepared to back the Labour amendment on the Post Office. 'I might be driven, much against my will, to support a motion that would facilitate greater commercialisation,' he said. 'The government seem to me to be showing a level of dogma on this issue that causes concern and surprise.' The call for greater commercialisation for the Post Office has been strongly advocated by Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader. He has called for the organisation to be allowed to enter joint ventures and to enjoy greater powers to take investment decisions. However, the government's opposition to this was made clear at the weekend after the leak of a memorandum from Mr David Hunt, the public service minister, to the prime minister. In the document Mr Hunt reflected the fears of members of the cabinet's industry committee that 'the 'Prescott option' would seriously undermine our whole approach to privatisation'.</p>

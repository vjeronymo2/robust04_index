			<p>BFN     [Text] The results of a Vox Populi Institute poll were  published on 29 April. It shows that former President and  Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  is the second most popular presidential candidate with 19  percent of the votes. He comes behind Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  (PT) [Workers Party], who has 30 percent. Sarney is ahead of  Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party], who has 15 percent. Between 23 and 25 April, the  institute interviewed 3,100 voters countrywide. Just 10 days  earlier, the IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics  Institute] released the results of its poll which showed Sarney  in third place with 13 percent of the votes, Lula in first place  with 31 percent, and Fernando Henrique Cardoso in second place  with 16 percent.    Of the three PMDB pre-presidential candidates, Vox Populi  only inquired about the support for Sarney and Orestes Quercia,  leaving Roberto Requiao aside. Requiao received the least  support in a poll about PMDB pre-presidential candidates only.  When Quercia is included in the list of candidates, he occupies  the fourth place with 5 percent of the votes, Lula receives 35  percent of the votes, Fernando Henrique Cardoso 16 percent, and  former Governor Leonel Brizola 9 percent.    With the votes that were given to Sarney, the number of  votes  given to Lula decreased by five points, those given to Cardoso  by one point, and those to Brizola by two points. Progressive  Renewal Party candidate Espiridiao Amin and Liberal Party  candidate Flavio Rocha remained stable in their positions with 3  percent and 1 percent, respectively.    Brizola was chosen by 20 percent of those interviewed as the  worst candidate on the list. The next worst candidate is Lula,  who is rejected by 13 percent of the people. He is followed by  Quercia (8 percent), and Sarney (7 percent). Fernando Henrique  Cardoso is rejected by just 4 percent of those interviewed.    In three different projections about the second round --  with  Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Quercia, and Sarney as his rivals --  the Workers Party candidate, Lula, wins. His tightest victory  is over Sarney: 40 percent to 32 percent.</p>

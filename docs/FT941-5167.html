			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pollution costs catch up Sir, Your section on Europe and the environment focused heavily on the costs of environmental legislation to industry (Can Europe Compete?, March 3). This is only half the story, because doing nothing about the environment is not a low-cost option. Pollution created by one company lands extra costs on to others, or society, often at a level far higher than the cost of prevention. The damage being done to buildings, monuments and forests by acid deposition from sulphur pollution, for example, probably runs into billions of Ecus. This is a bill that will have to be picked up sooner or later. It will be a great deal cheaper if the bill is paid by preventing emissions at source, and fairer if this is charged to the polluter. It is only because such costs have been missing from the balance sheets of companies and governments that skimping on the environment has ever created the illusion of economic commonsense. In many sectors, improvements in environmental practice are about increasing efficiency in a way that assists economic performance. Worries about competitiveness in sectors where this is not so should be pursued through a new Gatt round designed to build a global framework for pollution control. The need for such a step was widely identified during the tortuous and flawed progress of the Uruguay Round. It will be disastrous for us all if the global nature of many environmental problems puts a brake on progress because of narrow national interests.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Union tries to agree line on enlargement The European Union was struggling yesterday to paper over its differences regarding enlargement to embrace eastern Europe, and to assemble a package which EU leaders can endorse at their Essen summit on December 9-10. Still to be agreed are the amount of EU funding needed to assist integration of the former communist states, the extent of EU reform in areas like agriculture before they join around the turn of the century, and the degree of trade access to the Union's single market they will be given in the interim. The hub of the strategy, designed for Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania, remains intact, however. This is to draw up a white paper detailing the changes the newcomers need to make to their legislative, regulatory and standards regimes to bring them into line with the EU. 'If this is not the actual Rubicon, then it's very close to it,' one senior European Commission official said. 'If the east Europeans sign up to the single market, then the only arguments you've got against integrating them are essentially internal, not very respectable ones.' But such arguments, over money, agriculture, and trade access, were on display yesterday when EU foreign ministers met to prepare the summit. Brussels wants to commit Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in aid under its Phare programme for eastern Europe in 1995-99. Southern and Mediterranean member states, however, want parallel commitments on the Commission's recently unveiled Ecu5.5bn aid plan for the Middle East and North Africa, before they sign up to the eastern strategy. Work is far less advanced on the Mediterranean strategy, however, and the German presidency of the EU yesterday secured a compromise which will get it past the summit. Aid already pledged aid for next year (Ecu1.16bn for east and central Europe and Ecu492m for the Mediterranean) will be minimum benchmarks for succeeding years, with the amounts by which they are to increase to be decided later. Under the Commission plan, the 1996 figures, for example, would be Ecu1.23bn for the east, and a sharper increase to Ecu710m for the Mediterranean. However, up to a quarter of this will be available for big infrastructure schemes in the east, including up to eight road, rail and gas pipeline projects to be examined at Essen. On agriculture, the UK - strongly opposed by France - demanded a full debate on reform of the common agricultural policy, the cost of which would rocket if it were extended without changes to the east. 'That is a discussion we cannot avoid,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary. But Essen now looks certain merely to call for a Commission study on the impact of eastern enlargement on the CAP and other expensive EU policies such as aid to backward regions. Tomorrow, Brussels will try to resolve the trade access question, but only through what one official called 'fairly modest' improvements in rules of origin for incoming eastern goods. These would probably allow an 'accumulation' of rules of origin, with a product containing added value of at least 40 per cent from any three of the six states counting as an EU good and entering tariff-free.</p>

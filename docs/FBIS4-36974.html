			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers held a meeting at 1100  today under Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi and reviewed the work  of the services and economic committees.    During the session, the Council of Ministers was briefed by  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' on current developments in both  the Arab and international arenas. The foreign minister  clarified the nature and aims of the pressures being put on  Syria in order to harm its pan-Arab and national decision,  stressing that Syria firmly adheres to its positions and trends  to achieve a just and comprehensive peace and that it will not  relinquish any national or pan-Arab rights.    In this context, the foreign minister also explained that  the  aim of the Israelis is to force the peace process from its  course and its true goals and to push it onto a thorny and  deadlocked road. He also asserted that the continued Israeli  intransigence is aimed at weakening current international  efforts to push the peace process forward, ignoring the  resolutions of international legitimacy, and blocking the peace  process.    The foreign minister then reviewed the results of the  meetings that were held in Damascus to promote Syria's  cooperation with the Russian Federation, the PRC, and India. He  also touched on the positive results of the meeting of the  nonaligned foreign ministers in Cairo, stressing the importance  of the movement's role in protecting the interests of the  nonaligned countries in the absence of democratic relations in  the international arena.    The Council of Ministers also discussed the draft law on  implementing a trade agreement with the Vietnamese Government,  as well as the draft law on amending some articles of the mail  and parcels law No. 470 of 1957. It also studied issues on its  agenda, as well as subjects under discussion, and made  appropriate decisions.</p>

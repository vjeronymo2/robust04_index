			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / People: Maitland steers private course Angus Maitland, vice chairman of Burson-Marsteller, one of the world's largest public relations consultancies, is leaving at the end of the year to set up his own business. Maitland has managed to strike an agreement with his erstwhile employer, allowing him to take along a number of B-M clients. Maitland, 47, who will have been at B-M three years and was the first non-American on its main board, says he has had enough of the meetings and other restrictions a big organisation imposes. Instead, Maitland wants to devote himself full-time to what he calls 'high-level strategic consultancy'. A graduate of Glasgow University, who kicked off his career as an economic analyst in industry, Maitland joined Charles Barker in the early 1970s where he met Reg Valin. When Valin and Richard Pollen formed Valin Pollen, Maitland joined shortly afterwards. But the group ran into difficulties in the late 1980s following an American acquisition. It fell to Maitland, made chairman of communications group VPI when Valin quit, to try and pick up some of the pieces. Maitland says he will not be in direct competition with former Valin Pollen colleagues now working at other agencies across London, such as those at Gavin Anderson and Fishburn Hedges. However, he has in recent months been doing some work for Invesco, the fund management group which Richard Pollen, also in business on his own, had previously advised.</p>

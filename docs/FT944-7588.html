			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Naval dockyards attract only one bidder each The Labour party yesterday accused the government of botching another proposed privatisation after the Ministry of Defence announced it had received only two initial bids for the Royal dockyards at Rosyth in Fife and Devonport in Plymouth. Five months after the government announced it was putting the yards up for sale, the ministry said that Devonport Management had been the only bidder for the Devonport yard and Babcock International Group the only bidder for Rosyth. The companies have been managing the respective yards on behalf of the government since 1987, but their contracts are set to expire shortly. It is understood that a dozen other companies, including GEC and BAe, had registered an interest in buying the Devonport yard earlier this year. However, the MoD has asked companies bidding for the yards to carry the heavy risks involved in fixed-price contracts and to give guarantees over the cost of refits for at least the first five years after sale. In a Commons written answer yesterday, Mr Roger Freeman, defence procurement minister, said the government was evaluating the bids. He added: 'Outcomes other than sale cannot be ruled out.' His announcement came two weeks after the government abandoned plans to privatise the Post Office, and drew a rebuke from Labour. Dr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'This is yet another failed government privatisation plan. It is now time the government stopped putting ideology before practicality. You can't privatise Britain's security requirements.' Labour accused the government of spending more than Pounds 2m hiring City consultants and bankers to advise on the privatisation, only to find an absence of competition when the initial deadline for tenders had passed. A range of management consultants and banks have advised the government on the sale, including Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Kleinwort Benson. Under Treasury guidelines, ministers are obliged to hire specialist consultants when considering privatisation of state assets. The MoD said last night that bids could still be received even though the initial deadline had passed. It added: 'We will be going into negotiations for the final bids shortly, but the government will only accept bids that provide value for money for the taxpayer.'</p>

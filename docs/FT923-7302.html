			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Germany a step closer to car recycling GERMAN Environment Minister Klaus Topfer yesterday presented a draft regulation which would make it compulsory for car makers to take back their old cars when they are ready for the scrap heap, Reuter reports from Bonn. Under the draft, German motorists would be entitled to return their old cars and lorries free of charge to their dealer for disposal or recycling. 'In the past, the emphasis was on developing, making and marketing cars,' said. 'In future, anyone who produces and markets vehicles should also be made responsible for their disposal.' The ministry said the regulation, which must still be approved by the cabinet, would apply to German as well as foreign manufacturers selling vehicles in Germany, which is Europe's biggest car market with 36m registered cars. 'The importer represents the manufacturer,' Mr Topfer said. The order is aimed primarily at cars registered after it comes into effect some time next year. Older cars would be exempt if the manufacturer's costs for their disposal exceeded the value of their reused parts. Cars crushed in an accident would also be exempt because it would not be economical to recycle them. In anticipation of the new rules, leading German car makers have announced take-back guarantees for their latest models once they are ready to be scrapped. Car makers around the world are already touting the environmental features of their cars for consumers increasingly concerned about green issues. About 2.6m cars are scrapped annually in Germany, most ending up in crushing plants. While 75 per cent of metal parts are recycled, components made of plastic and glass, around 450,000 tonnes a year, are usually dumped.</p>

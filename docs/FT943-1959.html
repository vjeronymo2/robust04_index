			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (14): Bombay shrugs off VSNL fiasco - Indian equities have hit all-time highs The postponement of a planned USDollars 1bn issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the Indian state-controlled international telecommunications carrier, earlier this year cast a cloud over the country's overseas equity offerings. But business has recovered markedly since the issue was taken off the market in April when fund managers baulked at the pricing of the deal, the largest offering ever made by an Indian company. Today, Indian groups are queueing to tap the market. Buyers are more careful about pricing than they were before the VSNL debacle but still have a strong appetite for Indian equities, which have recently hit new all-time highs. The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading shares has risen by about 35 per cent since early May to reach a new all-time peak last week of 4628. That compares with a record high of 4546 set in April 1992, during a rally which collapsed when it emerged that the market was being fuelled by suspected illegal share-financing operations organised by Mr Harshad Mehta, a stockbroker. The market is now being driven up by hopes of good prospects for the Indian economy, which is emerging from three years of reform and restructuring. The most bullish stockbrokers believe the index is now in sight of 5000. The more cautious point out that the market has already risen 80 per cent since its low of 2633 in the middle of last year and is riding for a fall, with too many investors chasing too few stocks to unsustainably high levels. According to the bulls, increases in corporate profits, which rose 75 per cent at the net level in 1993-94 and are forecast by stockbrokers to rise a further 40-50 per cent in this year, justify current price/earnings multiples for leading shares which trade at about 53 times their net earnings for 1993-94 and 35 times likely earnings for 1994-95. The bears concede the economic outlook is better than at any time in the past three years. But they believe that in their rush to buy, investors have pushed share prices far beyond levels justified by economic logic. They suggest that prices are being pushed to unsustainable levels by the availability of low cost funds, including money raised from equity and bond issues which is being recycled into the stock market. The flow of new issues in the domestic market has been somewhat slower than in the 1993-94 financial year, which ended in April, when Rs322bn was raised. In the first four months of 1994-95, companies raised Rs62bn in domestic issues. However, on the international markets, companies are raising more than ever before, despite the VSNL fiasco. Since April, they have raised about Dollars 1.5bn in equities and bonds, compared with Dollars 2.5bn in 1993-94. The finance ministry introduced controls on international issues in May to try to prevent companies raising money for what it regards as unimportant purposes. Issuers must seek prior approval from the ministry, which attempts to ensure funds raised are to be applied to economically-productive investments and not, for example, for injecting into the stock market. Officials operate an informal queue and give priority to favoured industries, such as power and transport. Even though the total market capitalisation of the Bombay market is now nearly Dollars 150bn, daily turnover is quite low at below Dollars 100m because so little stock is freely traded. The families which control most listed companies typically hold 25 per cent to 75 per cent of the issued capital. Other long-term holders such as development banks are also infrequent sellers. Very little is left for foreign fund managers and other new investors to buy. The difficulties in acquiring shares are accentuated by the cumbersome trading, settlement and transfer procedures, which mean it can take six weeks for sellers to receive payment and three months for buyers to secure full ownership of their stock. Although stockbrokers and bankers are trying to improve the process, they expect dramatic changes only after Bombay Stock Exchange and the newly-formed National Stock Exchange launch computerised on-screen trading and a computerised share depositary is established to handle share transfers smoothly. On-screen trading on the NSE could start this year for top stocks and on the Bombay exchange next summer, but a fully-fledged depositary is two or three years away. These difficulties have already persuaded some foreign fund managers to slow their purchases of Indian stock or to switch to the Euroequity issues of Indian companies. After averaging Dollars 251m a month in the first half of 1994, net foreign buying of Indian equity fell to Dollars 89m in July and Dollars 80m in August. Given that many investment funds dedicated to India have yet to invest, this slowdown is likely to be temporary, but it shows fund managers are paying heed to price levels.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa said if the Yemenis are talking about unity, their  primary objective should be to preserve vital resources and  facilities in Yemen.    In press statements he made in Tunis today on developments  in  Yemen, 'Amr Musa added that the unity that was established based  on the agreement of both sides cannot be imposed by force. The  various parties must show actual commitment to the Security  Council resolution on the Yemeni crisis. If the fighting  continues, however, it will destroy all of Yemen.    'Amr Musa clarified that adherence to the cease-fire in  Yemen  is not mere talk; it should be respected in word and deed. He  said the continued fighting and strikes against installations,  despite declarations that both parties adhere to the cease-fire,  means they reject the Security Council resolution.    Answering a question on the statement the Gulf Cooperation  Council [GCC] foreign ministers issued the day before yesterday  on events in Yemen, 'Amr Musa said the statement contains  important results and expresses the frustration with events in  Yemen. He added that it was only natural to hold a GCC meeting,  because the situation in Yemen cannot be ignored and left the  way it is.    Musa affirmed that the solution to the crisis in Yemen is  respect for the Security Council resolution and the cease-fire  in Yemen. Moreover, the forces must be separated from each other  and dialogue between the various parties must start.</p>

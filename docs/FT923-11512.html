			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Decision day for Walbrook creditors CREDITORS of the stricken Walbrook Insurance, must decide today whether to back a rescue plan which would stave off the company's liquidation. The deal, which could convert many of the company's creditors into shareholders, would close another chapter in the long-running saga of Walbrook's parent, London United Investments, a property and finance company, which was placed in administration in February 1990. However if the creditors refuse approval, the Policyholders' Protection Board, financed by contributions from British insurance companies, stands to meet millions of pounds in insurance claims. During the 1980s Walbrook was one of the leading insurers and re-insurers of US liability business in the London market, specialising in covering US doctors, hospitals, accountants and lawyers, and their insurers, against legal awards for negligence. But the company, along with four other LUI subsidiaries, Kingscroft, El Paso, Lime Street, and Mutual Reinsurance - the so-called Kelm companies - was swamped by a surge in claims. LUI was placed in administration in 1990, and Walbrook and the Kelm group ceased writing new business. In May this year, Walbrook stopped paying claims after actuaries completed a new, more pessimistic, assessment of outstanding claims. Walbrook's unpublished 1991 accounts show underwriting losses of Pounds 178.5m. The company had negative net assets of Pounds 170m after allowing for approximately Pounds 461m in outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported. Under the rescue plan, launched earlier this month, directors are proposing that leading policyholders exchange their debts for equity, in a deal which would raise Pounds 270m and restore Walbrook's solvency. Creditors would receive 100 cents in the dollar, but would then be asked to pledge 60 cents immediately in exchange for preferred stock. More than 200 policyholders are each owed over Dollars 1.0m (Pounds 520,000) in potential outstanding claims. However some creditors are strongly opposed to the deal. Transit Casualty, a Missouri-based insurer which went into receivership in 1985, is seeking to appoint liquidators, which it believes would represent a quicker and cheaper solution. Earlier this week Transit asked Walbrook to supply more material financial information in connection with the rescue plan. As of yesterday, no information had been forthcoming and, according to advisers, Transit was understood to be 'resolutely opposed to the rescue plan'. If the plan fails, the company faces the prospect of a formal scheme of arrangement, or provisional or full liquidation. The UK's insurance companies, already battered by two years of heavy underwriting losses, could well pick up some of the cost. In March this year the PPB paid a total of about Pounds 37m to pay claims from policyholders of the Kelm companies. Under the Policyholders Protection Act, the PPB pays private policyholders of insolvent companies 90 per cent of outstanding claims. A court judgment in April broadened the definition of private policyholders to include firms or partnerships, making it possible for many of Walbrook's policyholders to claim for compensation. Between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of Walbrook's 200 biggest policyholders are understood to be able to claim compensation.</p>

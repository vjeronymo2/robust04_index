			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Accountancy Column: Standards task force takes criticism on board GLASNOST and perestroika have reached one of the more obscure outposts of the Accounting Standards Board. After just over a year of operation, members of its Urgent Issues Task Force - which interprets and clarifies existing accounting standards - are responding to criticism of the way they conduct business. To those who have not heard of it, and particularly those who are familiar with the cumbersome recent history of the development of accounting standards, the concept of an urgent issues task force sounds like a contradiction in terms. To the growing number that do know it, the task force has been the subject of considerable grumbling behind closed doors. Even its more benign critics question whether either its operation is urgent, or whether the topics it tackles are urgent issues. The task force has its origins in the 1988 Dearing Report, the basis for the new system of accounting regulation. It called for a 'capability of high standing' to provide expert guidance when emerging accounting topics arise. It would act more quickly than the process for setting new standards, and its guidance would not have the same status. But it would have the support of the professional bodies. When it was finally launched in March 1991, its main role was defined as seeking a 'consensus' on existing accounting standards or Companies Act provisions that are subject to unsatisfactory or conflicting interpretations. It may also advise the board on new developments in financial reporting. Four of the 16 task force members must be drawn from industry and commerce and nine from accounting firms. (Five currently come from the private sector outside the firms.) At least 11 of the members must be present for a quorum, and only two can vote against and still allow the consensus to be passed. The task force has produced three consensuses since its creation - dealing with the treatment of supplemental interest or premium on convertible bonds, the disclosure of restructuring costs, and goodwill on disposal of a business. It has also announced work on a further four issues now under discussion: transfers from current to fixed assets, post-retirement benefits other than pensions, presentation of long-term debtors in current assets, and low-start finance. The first of these is likely to generate a consensus at the next meeting in May. As the pronouncements have emerged, so have the complaints. Most have come from companies affected by the rulings, and relate to the short space of time between the announcement of an issue, a decision by the task force and its implementation date. The final straw appears to have been the consensus on goodwill, published on December 19 and, in effect, for accounting periods ending on or after January 23. The deadline caused anguish among a number of businesses preparing their year-end accounts, including Marks &amp; Spencer. The first signs that the criticism of the task force had had some effect came during March, with a new format 'information sheet' listing the dates of future meetings and details of the issues to be discussed. A second sheet just circulated lists the progress achieved in the March meeting, and preliminary conclusions on its forthcoming asset transfers consensus. It has also advertised in an effort to boost its mailing list - which already numbers 3,000 and includes the finance directors of all listed companies - to include others such as large private companies. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the task force as well as the Accounting Standards Board, said last week that he had decided to introduce a greater degree of democracy into the proceedings. In future, the task force will make its rulings public, allow discussion and then ratify or modify the consensus when it next meets. 'People have felt they haven't quite understood what's happening,' he says. 'This gives them a chance to comment, and to tell us if they think we're going down the wrong track.' Nevertheless, he rules out issuing formal exposure drafts which are opened to wide-ranging consultation - the approach taken by the board as it draws up its new financial reporting standards. 'We want to keep the urgency,' he says. Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of Prudential, and previously a critic of the task force, welcomes the changes as a mark of its willingness to respond to comments. 'The way they operated in the past, producing rabbits out of hats, was not good,' he says. 'They cannot pretend to know it all.' The accusations of excess haste have raised eyebrows among some members of the task force, who see its discussions becoming more protracted in line with those of the ASB. 'Moving too quickly?' says one. 'I think it's rather slow. The ASB can't move at the pace necessary to really sort out people playing fast and loose with the rules.' On the other hand, a lawyer who has been following the task force says: 'If a company is going to be taken to task, you've got to be sure you are on the right ground, however august your membership. Where speed is of the essence, you may miss something.' So far, it is unclear whether any company has defied a task force consensus. No case is believed to have been referred to the financial reporting review panel for action. But the lawyer suggests that money is 'almost inevitably' going to be spent in the courts at some stage. While a consensus has less status than a new standard, task force rulings become part of accounting practice and may be subject to challenge. Judging from the references to pronouncements which are now appearing in interim and finals statements, a number of companies are beginning to take the task force seriously. Not all are compliant. The second consensus - that restructuring costs should normally be treated as exceptional items - has been ignored by ICI and Unilever, which retained as extraordinary items provisions made in their 1990 accounts. The two companies have not re-stated the amounts as exceptional in their 1991 accounts, although, in accordance with the guideline, Unilever has provided additional information to justify its net Pounds 195m cost as extraordinary, as part of a programme of one-off restructuring driven by the requirements of the single European market. The incident has highlighted the task force's inability to do anything more than clarify current accounting standards. The existing ambiguities and loopholes are not always being closed by its consensuses. Its next ruling - on transfers from current to fixed assets - is likely to be an equally important and controversial testing ground. Even so, one technical partner in a big accountancy firm is unimpressed by the changes taking place. He suggests that the ASB is holding on to the most important accounting issues for itself, so stretching its agenda many years into the future while leaving only the more obscure topics to the task force. 'They tend to deal with issues they know they're going to get consensus on,' he says. 'They are not exactly taking on the hot topics.' It may a long time before a comprehensive framework of ASB standards has been put in place. In the meantime, the task force still needs to prove itself able to operate effectively, plugging the loopholes which emerge. Its authority and ability to resist defiance may be tested rather more quickly.</p>

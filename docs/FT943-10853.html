			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Republicans try for curbs over Haiti Senate Republicans prepared a fresh attempt yesterday to limit President Bill Clinton's authority to invade Haiti, as the US administration continued to lay the groundwork for military action. Mr Bob Dole, Senate minority leader, planned to introduce legislation with other Republicans yesterday afternoon. It would urge Mr Clinton to consult Congress before invading Haiti. The move came after the US had secured the Dominican Republic's approval on Monday for international surveillance of its border with Haiti, in an effort to stop fuel smuggling. Despite the embargo and an international fleet virtually blockading Haiti's coast, petrol has continued to flow to Haiti's military. The accord between the US and Dominican governments allows for about 100 UN observers, half drawn from the US, to patrol the border in six US Huey helicopters, under the US Atlantic Command. 'The operation itself, which is checking the borders and stopping smugglers, will be done by Dominican Republic soldiers and police,' Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said yesterday. The US would supply the Dominicans with helicopters, boats, night vision goggles and other equipment.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOL MOVED TO TOP OF STATE FUNDING LIST  </P> <P> Oxnard has been moved to the top of a state funding priority list for a new  high school because the present one is 1,700 feet from the end of the Oxnard  Airport runway, school officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> However, the state will not fund the project, which will cost at least $20  million, unless voters approve a statewide bond measure on the June ballot.  </P> <P> The measure would provide $800 million for school construction and renovation.  </P> <P> Bob Carter, superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School District, said air  safety was a factor in the state's decision to put Oxnard so high on its  emergency funding list.  </P> <P> "Noise is a factor, but the bigger issue is the safety factor," Carter said.  "The school was there before the airport, but as the school, and particularly  the airport, have grown, there's been more activity, and safety has become more  of an issue."  </P> <P> District officials discussed the new facility at a meeting Tuesday of the  Education Partnership Program, a coalition of business owners, school officials  and community leaders that meets monthly to discuss education-related issues.  </P> <P> Oxnard High School Principal Ruperto Cisneros said the new school, which would  be near Patterson and Gonzales roads, would be 10,000 square feet larger than  the present school.  </P> <P> Construction is expected to be completed by the 1993-94 school year, he said.  </P> <P> Most of the present Oxnard High School facilities will be turned over to the  state, Carter said.  </P> <P> Enrollment in the 11,200-student district is projected to double by the year  2006, Carter said.

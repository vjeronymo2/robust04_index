			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Gibbs Mew rejects Pounds 11m Brierley Invs bid Brierley Investments Limited has announced a 200p per share offer for the 80.3 per cent of Gibbs Mew that its BIL Securities (Far East) subsidiary does not already own. The offer values the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property company at about Pounds 11m. Its shares closed up 15p at 198p. Gibbs Mew is a family-run business. Some 59 per cent of the shares are owned by the Gibbs family and the directors, whose response was terse: 'The board of Gibbs Mew has no hesitation in unanimously rejecting this unwelcome offer which it believes significantly undervalues Gibbs Mew's assets and prospects.' Mr Stephen Bellamy of BIL, which first bought Gibbs shares in 1987 and lifted its stake to 19.7 per cent two months ago, said the aim was to gain control of Gibbs Mew. BIL wanted to strengthen the management team and use its greater financial resources to exploit the potential of the target. Otherwise 'the independent shareholders would have a long wait for the family to get it right'.</p>

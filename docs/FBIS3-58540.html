			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Siegmar Schelling and Romanus Otte: "SPD Offers </F> To Cooperate With CDU/CSU"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Free Democratic Party [FDP] was sharply  criticized on 8 January for its position on the so-called great  bugging campaign. The liberals alone are against the other  large political parties. The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] intends to use the situation politically for a common  action with the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU].    The CDU, the CSU, and the SPD accused the liberals of  adopting an "incomprehensible obstructive stance." CDU Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther had made far-reaching concessions to  the FDP leadership, which continues to strictly reject the  bugging campaign by citing a resolution adopted at its party  congress in Muenster in June 1993. He had suggested to confine  "electronic surveillance of private homes" to serious,  punishable offenses detailed in a catalogue. A judge would have  the authority to order a bugging operation; in urgent cases, a  public prosecutor would order such operation, which would then  have to be authorized by a judge ex post facto.    At the FDP's Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart, party chief  Klaus  Kinkel and Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  strictly rejected Kanther's initiative.    Thereupon, Bavarian chief of government, CSU Vice Chairman  Edmund Stoiber, sharply attacked the liberals on 8 January. He  said that by his compromise proposal, Kanther had "taken all  objections regarding the use of electronic means into account"  as far as possible, without jeopardizing the effectiveness of  this instrument against organized crime. Stoiber told WELT AM  SONNTAG: "Therefore I do not have the slightest understanding  for the FDP leadership sticking to its obstructive position and  even rejecting this compromise. Our people must not be  protected against an overly powerful state, as Kinkel and  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger are trying to make people believe,  but against crime that is technically extremely well-equipped  and represents a huge financial power."    Commenting on the state of the Bonn coalition, Stoiber said  that it was becoming increasingly difficult to convince German  citizens "that urgently necessary and sound solutions do not  come about out of regard for the liberal coalition partner, even  though there are parliamentary majorities for them with the SPD."    In a talk with WELT AM SONNTAG, SPD Parliamentary Manager  Peter Struck called Kanther's compromise proposal "an adequate  basis for talks in the Bundestag committees." However, the SPD  would only accept an amendment to Basic Law Article 13  (inviolability of apartments), "if, at the same time, Article 14  (property, right of succession, and expropriation) is amended."  The problem is under what conditions profits from criminal  activities could be confiscated. "The SPD advocates a reversal  of the burden of proof. This is a linkage for us," said Struck.    The SPD politician added that, if Kanther mustered the  courage, he should "submit a draft law without delay, including  the necessary legal amendments to the Code of Criminal  Procedure." The SPD would, however, not agree to Kanther's  proposal that, in urgent cases, a public prosecutor could  authorize electronic-listening measures.    Struck: "I think understanding between the CDU and SPD is  possible if the CDU is ready to amend Basic Law Article 14 as  well. The CDU and SPD will then, in any case, have a two-third  majority."    The CDU does not understand the liberals' position either.  Deputy floor leader Johannes Gerster told WELT AM SONNTAG that  it was "regrettable" that the FDP leadership "continues to  reject" the bugging campaign, "despite increasing criticism from  its party grassroots and contrary to the advice given by almost  all experts."    Gerster asked whether the FDP really intended to declare the  leadership levels of organized crime, which can hardly be  covered by the instruments of investigation used in the past,  "areas exempt from investigation." Gerster called upon the FDP  to study Kanther's proposals realistically, and not to "put them  aside with a shrug," as party chief Kinkel did in Stuttgart.  He, Gerster, had "no idea" how the FDP was going to make  internal security "an offensive subject" in the upcoming  election campaigns, "while continuing to reject the introduction  of important instruments of investigation to combat dangerous  crime."</p>

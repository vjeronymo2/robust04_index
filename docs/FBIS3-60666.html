In an exclusive interview to Pakistan Observer, and weekly  Hurmat, General Beg, who had been associated with policy  formulation on the subject, revealed that the country had  attained the required capability during the last tenure of the  PPP government and the decision to adopt policy of restraint was  made unanimously by all concerned. According to him, the  decision was taken collectively by the then President, Mr Ghulam  Ishaq Khan; the Prime Minister (then) Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  and the (then) COAS (Mirza Aslam Beg).    Clarifying the position whether the programme has been  capped  or freezed, the former COAS explained different stages of  nuclear weapon programme. He said in the first stage Uranium is  enriched at low or high level. Low Enriched Uranium (between 3  to 6 percent) is used in atomic power plants whereas High  Enriched Uranium (90 to 95 percent) is meant for  weapons-oriented programme. In the second stage enriched  Uranium is given device shape and different components of the  device are manufactured. The third stage involves laboratory  system whereas the whole system is tested in the fourth stage  either through cold test or hot test as done by India in 1974.  Dropping of the nuclear warhead is the fifth and final stage of  the programme. With this background, he said stoppage of all  the stages simultaneously would be called capping and stoppage  of work on one or two stages would be called "freezing". But  there is a third term "restraint" meaning not to proceed beyond  attainment of the required capability.    General Beg said the capability was achieved during BB's  previous rule and she had all the powers to take a decision  about the fate of the nuclear programme. He said the decision  to adopt policy of restraint was taken by GIK, BB and he (Mirza)  himself and Nawaz Sharif inherited this decision. He strongly  dispelled the impression that the decision was taken because of  any outside pressure and said it was a voluntary decision.  After this, the scientists were asked to work on other projects  like missile manufacturing. "Had our programme been rolled  back, all the scientists and technicians working on it would  have been rendered superfluous and sent to their home which is  not the case", he explained.    Replying to a question, General Beg said BB was a party to  the decision to pursue the policy of "restraint" and Nawaz  Sharif too continued this policy during his rule. Therefore, he  said, they ought not blame each other.    To another question, he said the United States wants us to  roll back and destroy the nuclear programme but "no Pakistan  Government could do that". He said the present government  should take the nation into confidence about the nature of the  programme and its present stage as people would never allow any  compromise on this vital issue.    The former COAS was of the view that there was a time when  Pakistan could have detonated its nuclear device but any such  action now would create many problems for the country.    General Beg was also critical of the decision of Pakistan  Government to withdraw Kashmir resolution from a UN Committee  and said India has agreed to talk to Pakistan only to buy some  time. He said the present session of the UN General Assembly is  ending on December 15 and India expressed its readiness to  discuss the Kashmir issue with Pakistan only to deprive Pakistan  of the opportunity to raise the issue at the world body. Now  Pakistan would have to wait till next session. He was of the  view that the forthcoming round of Pak-India talks would be  fruitless. The very basis of the dialogue i.e. Simla agreement  is not relevant because the discussions should focus on how to  implement the UN resolutions.    About (American) General Hoar's visit to Siachin, he said  the  United States wanted to convey a signal to India that it would  be in trouble if it (India) tried to improve its relations with  China. Similarly, when India was going to sign an oil pipeline  project agreement with Iran, the United States openly supported.  Pakistan on Kashmir but when India described the project as  "not feasible", Americans showed a gesture of goodwill by  advising Pakistan not to take up Kashmir issue to UN.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Moscow's mayor thrives in icy waters: Yuri Luzhkov believes he is making headway despite his bitter inheritance MR Yuri Luzhkov inherited three gifts when he took over as mayor of Moscow in June: privatisation which was fast but ineffective, an obstreperous city legislature, and a mountain of corruption allegations. One year after the abortive coup which he played a prominent role in opposing as deputy mayor, this thick-skinned 55-year-old believes he is making headway on market reforms in spite of the setbacks over the past year. Since the euphoria over the coup's defeat, many Russians, ground down by the harsh economic reforms which followed, have also come to feel sympathy for the Communist leaders who claim they were only trying to save the Soviet Union. But Mr Luzhkov opposes calls to let them off. The mayor, who was appointed for his bravery during the coup to the interim committee which ran the Soviet economy until the country's collapse in December, says: 'I am categorically against pardoning them. We have a responsibility to history. If we want to live in a democratic system, they must be severely punished.' He also rejected increasingly fashionable calls by many politicians and industrial plant managers for the resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the young acting prime minister who launched the painful reforms. 'Gaidar is not the the same Gaidar as the man who came to office a year ago. He is a man who has undergone the harshest criticisms . . . and is no longer just building macro-economic models,' he said. As for his own reform plans for Moscow, Mr Luzhkov disclosed that in a few weeks, he would make it legal for anybody, including foreigners, to buy land outright. This has so far not been possible under national legislation because of fears in the Russian parliament that foreigners will buy up the country. He also pointed to the little-publicised fact that foreigners could now buy flats in Moscow, a right so far reserved for Russians. On Saturday, the capital will conduct its first auction of buildings which the bankrupt state building sector has been unable to finish. He said hard currency proceeds of real estate deals would finance the building of municipal housing for Muscovites who had been queueing for years for their own flat under the old state system. Most of what he does involves riding rough-shod over an antiquated city legislature inherited from the Bolsheviks. Mr Luzhkov has also dropped the give-away privatisation methods launched by his predecessor, Mr Gavriil Popov. It had been fast and had kept work collectives happy, but had made little or no improvement to the quality of goods and services. In some cases, the method justified by Mr Popov to 'smash state property at all costs' had made things worse. 'A simple man assesses reforms through his pay packet and the situation in the shops. If these become worse, he will decide that market reform is a load of nonsense and that things were better under the Communists. This is alarming.' A number of shops, for instance, had stopped selling basic commodities like bread, and turned themselves into wholesalers of consumer goods for the little retail kiosks which have sprung up all around Moscow as a result of a presidential decree allowing free trade. He would now try the auction system of privatisation introduced by the government elsewhere in Russia. He would also clamp down on the street sellers despite the continuation of the presidential decree. He also dismissed allegations of corruption which have dogged him and his colleagues, saying hurtful lies were an additional reason for the resignation of Mr Popov, who said he was stepping down to defend democratic politics at national level. In a new departure for Russian politicians, who usually do not sue, Mr Luzhkov, who enjoys swimming in sub-zero temperatures, says he has already won the first of six libel suits he has lined up against Russian newspapers.</p>

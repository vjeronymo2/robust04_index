			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Frantic battle for the Euro-waverers: The two sides that fought for the hearts and minds of Tory rebels LAST NIGHT'S vote marked the culmination of days of frantic lobbying by government whips and leading Euro-sceptics in Westminster's ill-lit warren of corridors and committee rooms. MPs huddled in small groups in obscure corners. Telephone lines buzzed continually. Unlikely alliances were consummated. Whips even acted to postpone a visit by MPs to the Falkland Islands and St Helena. The air of intrigue was overlaid with the scratching of pencils as lists were drafted and re-drafted and both sides engaged in hectic back-of-envelope arithmetic. With expectations of a tight outcome mounting in the final 24 hours, the lobbying of waverers by senior Tories and by Mr John Major, the prime minister, intensified further, and talk of prospective deals between the government and minority parties reached fever pitch. The Ulster Unionists - the group most likely to be talked out of opposing the government - protested to the last that they would not be swayed. However, they delayed making an official decision until the last possible moment. The pro-European Social Democratic and Labour party, meanwhile, was also understood to have been approached by a carrot-bearing minister - apparently to no effect. As the pleas and threats being flung in the direction of waverers grew ever more frequent and ever more vigorous, weary possible rebels began taking refuge in phrases designed to infuriate both camps. 'I am not going to take a decision until I have heard the debate,' said one. Another said: 'I have told the whips that I will vote for the government but I may have to tell them I have changed my mind.' By the time the division bell rang, the government had resorted to every persuasion technique in its repertoire - gentle and otherwise - as the haggard expressions on the faces of several whips bore witness. 'How does it look?' asked one MP among the crowd milling anxiously around the members' lobby. 'Like a spinning coin,' answered an-other, refusing to be drawn. With the government's slender majority of 21 looking ever more vulnerable on a variety of fronts, there was speculation that this sort of backroom bargaining would be a distinctive hallmark of Mr Major's administration. Last week, as the whips worked their way systematically through their quotas of MPs, ministerial involvement in the government push began in earnest with face-to-face meetings with small groups of backbenchers. One MP summoned to a 20-minute audience with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, opined shortly afterwards that the meeting had proved counterproductive. 'Most of the people going in there were Thatcherites,' he said. 'They were not likely to be greatly influenced by Mr Heseltine.' In the wake of the publication of the motion, the whips whittled down internal resistance, with reformed rebels making their revised positions known in letters to The Times and in television interviews. Meanwhile, the ministerial offensive continued with weekend telephone calls to potential rebels in their constituencies. 'It was a very friendly conversation,' said one MP so contacted. '(The minister) displayed no aggression. His main worry was the potential impact (of Britain rejecting the Maastricht treaty) on foreign investment.' Mr Major reserved his chief efforts for this week, inviting suspected rebels to hour-long question-and-answer sessions, side by side with experienced loyalists. The prime minister's performance at these gatherings was generally portrayed as cogent and impressive, although he failed to win over a number of those attending. As pressure built up in the final hours before the vote, Mr Major was reported to have supplemented these group sessions with a small number of individual meetings with hand-picked waverers. In an indication of the government's determination to leave no stone unturned, these meetings were said to be going on even after Mr Major had opened yesterday's debate. The Euro-sceptics, of course, had their own heavyweights to wheel out, and this they did - notably when a small group of new MPs attended a spine-stiffening pep-talk with Baroness Thatcher. The former prime minister's other main contribution to the pre-debate high jinks was a concise foreword to a new book on the Maastricht treaty by Mr Michael Spicer, one of the rebel leaders. Besides maximising their support, the prime concern of the rebel leadership in recent days has been instilling a sense of discipline in their troops in a bid to ensure that as many as possible opted for the same voting tactics. Their parting shot came on Tuesday evening when 34 Tories and one Ulster Unionist assembled to discuss their battle plan amid much laughter and desk-banging in a particularly obscure Westminster committee room. 'We know absolutely accurately what our figures are,' said a defiant Mr James Cran, MP for Beverley, as the gathering broke up. 'Everybody was told: 'If you are not taking a hard line tomorrow, the door is over there.' '</p>

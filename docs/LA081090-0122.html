			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EUREKA;  </P> <P> SPIKES IN 3 TREE LOGS DISCOVERED  </P> <P> Seven 10-inch spikes were found in three Douglas fir logs prepared for sawing  at Louisiana-Pacific's mill in Samoa, the lumber company reported.  </P> <P> "It's fortunate nobody was hurt," the firm's division manager, Joe Wheeler,  said. The spikes were discovered on Aug. 2. It was the first reported incident  of tree "spiking" in about two years. The tactic -- favored by opponents of  old-growth logging -- has been renounced by sponsors of Redwood Summer, Earth  First! Wheeler called on leaders of the groups to again disavow spiking to  prevent injuries to workers.  </P></p>

World Health Organization (WHO) projections indicate that, by  the end of the 1990's, there will be 43 million infected people  in the world. Moreover, 10 million children will be left orphans  of parents who were victims of the disease. "AIDS is one of the  most serious problems confronted by the human race," declared  Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the Health Ministry's  Program To Fight AIDS, yesterday. She spoke during the course of  the World Day To Combat AIDS program, in which health ministers  have participated since 1985, when the program was created.    In Brazil, the statistics from 1980 until 30 October of this  year show an accumulation of 43,964 AIDS cases, revealing that  41 percent of those infected have already died. There are  420,000 Brazilians with HIV. It is expected that, during the  next two years, 87,000 new cases will appear, and that there  will be 85,000 deaths resulting from the disease. According to  estimates, within the same period the government will spend $875  million on patients in an advanced stage alone. Lair claimed  that the government will attempt to reduce the infection levels  over the next three years, based on a comprehensive AIDS control  program financed by the World Bank. The program cost is $250  million, with $90 million in matching funds from the Brazilian  Government.    According to Lair Guerra, a striking feature in Brazil is  the  spread of the disease among various population groups, such as  women and young people. The expert warned: "The use of  injectable drugs is playing a preponderant role in the spread of  the disease among the youth." In 1980, there were 28 cases among  adolescents; and in 1991, 261 cases were recorded, with 50  percent infected through drug use. During the government's  informational campaign disseminated by radio and television, it  had been planned to air a video instructing the drug user on how  to disinfect needles and syringes, but the film was banned. Two  films will be aired promoting the use of condoms, and there will  be two radio spots providing information on the disease.</p>

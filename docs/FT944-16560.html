			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Brussels seeks to validate pact The European Commission has asked the Council of Ministers to give its approval to a three-year-old anti-trust agreement between the EU and the US government, after the European Court of Justice ruled it was void. The agreement, designed to promote co-operation between competition authorities in the US and the EU, was recently used to modify certain practices by the US computer group, Microsoft, after both parties agreed that these violated competition law. Originally concluded by the Commission, the court ruled in the summer that the agreement was void, as it should have been concluded by the Council of Ministers. France, backed by Spain and the Netherlands, launched the court action, arguing that for an international agreement signed with another government, it was not the Commission's place to represent the EU, but rather a matter for the member states. The European Court is also considering whether the Commission or member states have the power to negotiate in certain trade areas, such as transport, services, and intellectual property rights. The outcome of this case should allow EU ratification of the Uruguay Round trade pact before the end of the year.</p>

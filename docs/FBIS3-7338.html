Perry's remarks fully revealed the dangerous scheme of the  U.S. imperialists to unhesitatingly lead the situation on the  Korean peninsula to a catastrophic war phase.    It is the U.S. imperialist war hawks who are creating the  danger of "accidental developments" on the Korean peninsula and  it is again them who are driving the situation to the brink of  war.    Now task forces of the U.S. Navy including an aircraft  carrier are moving towards the waters close to Korea, Patriot  missile units are heading for South Korea and large aggression  forces are ready for departure in the U.S. mainland and  surroundings of the Korean peninsula.    According to foreign press reports, Perry will fly to South  Korea and Japan in a short time to examine and adjust on the  spot the preparations of military operations designed to provoke  a new war which the U.S. imperialists are now promoting  feverishly.    This predicts that the U.S. imperialists will lead the  situation on the Korean peninsula to a more grim phase by their  military frenzy.    If the U.S. imperialits think they can frighten us with  military threat, it is, indeed, a foolish dream.    They must stop running rashly, clearly knowing that the  option of confrontation and war will precipitate their own doom.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (5): Larger deals shrink by number and value  -The Banks WITH the UK economy sunk in gloom, the number of banks among the players in the UK venture capital market has dwindled to a relatively select band. For those that persist, there are still some pickings, but by the standards of the 1980s they are pretty meagre. Perhaps because there are fewer players fighting to share the cake, banks generally agree that there is still a fair flow of business, despite the recession. But there are clear signs of change. Larger deals have shrunk by number and value - 'it is a very difficult year. There is quite a lot of activity at the smaller or mid-corporate end, but very little activity in the large transactions,' says Mr David Scholl, managing director of County NatWest Venture Capital. 'We are investing about 80 or 90 per cent of what we did in the heyday of the market, but now we do more transactions at Pounds 5m or Pounds 10m or Pounds 20m and there are not many of Pounds 50m or Pounds 100m,' says Mr Scholl. Mr Gordon Bonniman, managing director of the venture capital division of Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland says: 'The market has been sorting itself out. There have been relatively few buy-outs. The criteria for returns have certainly come down from the hysterical levels of the late 1980s.' This year, Charterhouse handled the privatisation of the Medway ports - 'at Pounds 40m, it was not a small deal, but in 1988 or 1989, it would not have rated as a large buy-out,' says Mr Bonniman. Development capital deals are enjoying a resurgence. 'Companies may have soldiered on and survived the recession, but they perhaps need to reduce their borrowing in order to take advantage of opportunities. Additional capital can be used to finance plant and equipment,' says Mr Hollidge. Among the banks still active, Lloyds, and Royal Bank of Scotland, (through Charterhouse), have kept up an entrepreneurial interest in the venture capital market in the early 1990s. Lloyds maintains regional offices in Leeds and Birmingham to spot opportunities, and says that a presence in the regions remains a priority. 'We have learned our lessons from two or three years ago and are were not looking nowadays to pay high prices for the businesses we invest in. Rather, we try to ensure that we put conservative financial structures in place,' says Mr Hollidge managing director at Lloyds Bank Development Capital. ONE striking feature has been the withdrawal of foreign banks which used to play a role in creating some of the sell-down liquidity for some arranging banks. 'The foreign banks have closed-up shop. That must be an object lesson about fair-weather friends,' says one UK banker. The remaining bank players tend to be much more cautious - 'we've learned the lessons of the last two or three years and are not looking to pay high prices for the businesses we invest in. And we do want to ensure that we put conservative financial structures in place. Corporate vendors on the other hand often tend to be looking to divest, but are still expecting very high prices,' says Mr Hollidge. Chris Gammon, executive corporate manager at Baronsmead which invests funds on behalf of Barclays bank, says: 'We invest in businesses with a turnover of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 20m, usually putting in between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 750,000. In general, we're looking for profitable companies with an established track record. We have about 30 investments in the portfolio with an average size of about Pounds 400,000.' The receiver's office may also be a source of business - 'we only look at the profitable parts which were dragged down by cross-guarantees. We are loth to look at a parent company which has gone into receivership,' says Mr Gammon. Baronsmead has helped in the buy-out of a small airline from part of the ILG the leisure group which collapsed in the spring of 1991. Lloyds, too, has handled two or three receivership transactions this year. Most are MBOs, though Lloyds says that the deals tend to be 'bimbos' (buy-in and buy-out) involving a combination of the existing management and the injection of new management. 'We would ask why a business has gone into receivership. Perhaps it had an overgeared financial structure and a management which has consistently failed to perform,' says Mr Hollidge. Sectors which do not seem to offer profit opportunities are property and financial services. 'We have tried to analyse our successes and failures in terms of what is good for us. Distribution businesses have been very good, and manufacturing generally has a good track record, for example in engineering. But retailers are still having a very hard time and things are difficult for some specialist sectors like printing,' says Mr Hollidge. Support often takes the form of beefing up the management team. County NatWest keeps a data base of good managers suitable for parachuting into companies. 'We receive CVs every day from managers interested in getting involved in venture-backed business,' says Mr Scholl. Baronsmead says that it will only put managers in if they help the company concerned grow and manage its expansion. It prefers to agree the budget for the year with the company and act as a sounding board for plans for expansion. 'We are designing more conservative packages for those companies we do take up, partly because the banks are not willing to put up more leverage than they did previously but also because we are not sure when the recession will end and we don't want more exposure. We like to think we are laying the foundations for tomorrow's good businesses and a platform for profits in the mid-1990s,' Mr Scholl says.</p>

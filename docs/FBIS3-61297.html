			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with heads of diplomatic missions </F> accredited to Moscow; places and dates not given: "Our  Questionnaire"]    [Text]    [begin boxed item]    Just before the New Year the editorial office posed two  questions to heads of diplomatic missions accredited to Moscow:    1. In your opinion, what event in the past year best  characterizes the relations of your country with Russia?    2. What prospects do you see for our bilateral  relations in 1994?    Here are the answers of our esteemed diplomats.    [end boxed item]  <H3>  Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of Ukraine: "I Hope That the Ice Will Melt..." </H3>   1. In the sequence of events, it is difficult to identify  one  that most clearly characterizes the relations of Ukraine and  Russia in the past year. In my opinion, several could make up  the general background. The joint participation of our sailors  in peacemaking operations in the Georgian port of Poti. Those  days demonstrated: We were together, and we will remain  together. And we are always ready to help others. The same sense  of mutual aid characterized the actions of our sailors who saved  Russians near Zmiyinyy Island in the Black Sea. And on the part  of Russia, specialists from the State Committee for Affairs of  Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Elimination of Natural  Disasters instantly offered help and assistance to those who  suffered during the colossal flash flood in Transcarpathia. All  these events, as you see, are of an emergency nature, but it is  exactly in such moments that relations between people and  nations reveal themselves in a special way.    And another sad event. Ivan Kozlovskiy, the great singer of  the Land, passed away. Prominent cultural figures from Ukraine  and Russia stood in mournful silence at his grave. Kozlovskiy  united our people. His death left a permanent mark on the souls  of people, on the banks of the Moscow River and the Yenisey and  on the banks of the Dnieper.    2. I hope that the ice will melt. I hope that we will  finally  be understood and that there will be an end to the groundless  accusations that "Ukraine is deceiving the world."  <H3>  Otto von der Gablentz, Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the FRG: "We Have Learned To Give Meaning to  History..." </H3>   1. Our relations are so close that there is no one big  symbolical event that characterizes them. Federal Chancellor  Kohl, for example, in 1993 alone personally met three times with  President Yeltsin in Russia. The ministers of foreign affairs of  the two countries, Kinkel and Kozyrev, had 15 personal talks in  the last year and a half.    But our relations are also characterized by the reactions of  Germans to the stirring events that have occurred in recent  months in Russia: the attempted coup at the beginning of  October, the referendum on the Constitution, and the elections.  We are intensively affected by the difficult path that Russia is  taking to democracy, to contacts with the rest of the world, to  a rule-of-law state, and to the market. We are accompanying it  on this path with a sense of sympathy, and where possible we are  rendering effective support.    2. I am confident that we will move forward to a definite  stage on the joint path to building German-Russian relations. An  event is scheduled for the middle of the year that has symbolic  significance for this time. On 3 August 1994 a solemn ceremony  will be held with regard to the conclusion of the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Germany. It will demonstrate that Germans  and Russians have also learned to give meaning to the difficult  chapters of our long joint history with respect and a spirit of  mutual understanding.    In 1994 the cooperation between our parliamentarians with  the  newly elected Russian parliament will very likely occupy one of  the central political places in our relations. It can contribute  to the fact that Russia is taking root in the community of  European democracies, which in the form of the Council of Europe  have established a forum for themselves devoted to the  preservation of democracy and the protection of human rights in  all Europe. Incidentally, in the middle of 1994 Germany, taking  over the chairmanship of the European Union, will assume special  responsibility for the current efforts being applied to the  expansion of relations between Russia and the European Union in  the direction of real partnership.  <H3>  Bakhyt Nadirov, Kazakh Charge d'Affaires Ad Interim: "Russia  Is Our Strategic Partner..." </H3>   1. In my view, relations between Russia and Kazakhstan  cannot  be examined outside the context of the problems of the  Commonwealth as a whole and the mutual relations between its  members. We were all part of the USSR. Including Russia and  Kazakhstan. And in this sense I would note the startup of the  second power unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 [state rayon electric  power station]. This is why: It is a unique legacy, delivered to  us from the Union. Representatives of all the countries of the  CIS took part in the construction of this installation, but  specialists from Russia made a special contribution. The  capacity of the combined electric power system of our countries  grew into a whole Dneprogas! We have already broken out of the  habit of such concepts as international construction. But here  is a real example for you: The power of the joint efforts that  was born in Kazakhstan's Ekibastuz is in a condition to direct  electricity to the Urals, Western Siberia, Central Russia... It  is no accident that President of the Republic of Kazakhstan  Nursultan Nazarbayev took part in the opening ceremonies, a  person who has offered many positive ideas for the development  of integration processes in the CIS.    2. As for the outlook for our cooperation, my attitude  toward  it is quite optimistic.    The adoption of the new Constitution of the Russian  Federation is a chance for civil reconciliation and a chance for  political and economic stability in Russia. But the fact that  Russia is a strategic partner for Kazakhstan needs no proof.    We welcome the election of President Yeltsin as chairman of  the CIS, and we hope that this act will serve to further  strengthen the interaction of the countries of the Commonwealth.  <H3>  Sumio Edamura, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary  of Japan: "A Foundation for Partnership Has Been Laid..." </H3>   1. Two main directions have appeared in our relations.    First--restoration of the track from which Japanese-Russian  relations had been derailed as a consequence of the postponement  of the visit of the president of Russia to Japan the year before  last. Second, the active position of Japan as the country  chairman of the Tokyo country summit of the "Group of Seven" in  coordinating their activity on assistance to Russia.    These two directions, in our opinion, interacting favorably,  brought about positive results.    As a result of President Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October  a foundation was laid for the restoration of partnership  relations between the two countries based on recognition of  common values. Secondly, the Tokyo summit was concluded  successfully. At the meeting that was held by representatives of  the "Group of Seven" countries with President Yeltsin, a high  evaluation was given to Japan for its active role as the country  chairman.    2. I think that the main task is to be able to move our  relations toward the establishment of genuine partnership  relations between Japan and Russia, using the foundation laid  during the visit of the president of Russia.    I would like to hope for a further continuation of the  position for rendering assistance to the efforts of Russia that  are directed at democratization and transition to a market  economy and, simultaneously, at ensuring the reliable  advancement of our relations toward the conclusion of a peace  treaty with the resolution of territorial problems.</p>

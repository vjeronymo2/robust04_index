			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Russia-Ukraine gas row talks Russian and Ukrainian officials are to meet in Moscow tomorrow to discuss a dispute over gas supplies to Ukraine which has strained relations between the two states and raised fears over the security of Russian gas supplies to western Europe. Gazprom, the Russian monopoly supplier of gas, said yesterday it would maintain supplies to Ukraine at between 50m and 80m cu metres a day - enough to keep houses heated, but not enough for industry. Gazprom officials say Ukraine is taking extra supplies from the west European pipeline, but Ukraine said the 200m cu metres a day it was distributing was coming from Russian supplies and storage. The dispute is over an unpaid bill claimed by Gazprom to be running at Rbs1,500bn.</p>

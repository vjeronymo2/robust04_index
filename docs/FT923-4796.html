			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce In many ways Rolls was lucky that its unexpectedly poor interim results came on a day when the stock market generally pepped up. Its share price, down 4p at 128p, admittedly stood out as one of a mere handful that fell; the damage might have been considerably worse, though, if background sentiment had been weak. The chief explanation for a first half profit of just Pounds 20m - almost double last year's figure but well below most hopes for Pounds 30m-Pounds 35m - seems to have been the impact of the dollar. Investors have to take the company's word that this knocked Pounds 10m off the result; in the absence of any information about Rolls' forward cover or the assumptions it makes about realised exchange rates they are nevertheless entitled to be cautious about the outcome for the year. To some extent, however, the market has only itself to blame for getting carried away about the prospects for recovery in civil spares which Rolls was always anxious to play down. The combination of the company's technological and marketing skills still holds out the promise of long-term jam; on the basis of yesterday's figures, though, the progress in getting there is going to be somewhat slower.</p>

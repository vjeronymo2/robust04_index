			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Dynamic Asians join top ten rich nations Three Asian nations count among the world's 10 richest countries when measured in terms of national output per head, adjusted for the purchasing power of their currencies in their home markets, the World Bank reported yesterday. For the first time, the Bank has published gross national product figures for a majority of the earth's countries in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). As a result, Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the so-called dynamic Asian economies, join Japan in the top 10 of the world's richest nations. Two Gulf oil producers, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, also appear in the top 10, displacing Kuwait, which appears 10th in the traditional country rankings measured by GNP per head. The World Bank believes that GNP per capita figures give a better indication of relative standards of living when converted into 'international dollars' at purchasing power parity. It defines PPP as the number of units of a country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as Dollars 1 would buy in the US. Using PPP, Luxembourg emerges as the world's richest country with an output per head of Dollars 29,510 in international dollars in 1993. The US, the world's strongest economic power, appears second in terms of GNP per head measured in terms of PPP but only seventh in terms of GNP per head. As the benchmark nation, US GNP per head is Dollars 24,750 (Pounds 16,000) on both measures. Britain is 19th among the 129 countries for which the Bank has calculated output per head in terms of PPP, with per capita GNP of Dollars 17,750 in international dollars, and 20th among 209 countries measured by GNP per head only. On the traditional measure, UK output per head dropped in 1993 to Dollars 17,970 from Dollars 18,110 in 1992. The traditional measure makes Switzerland the world's wealthiest nation, with a GNP per head of Dollars 36,410 - down Dollars 320 from 1992. Mozambique is the poorest, with a GNP per head of Dollars 80, although this rises to an estimated Dollars 380 in international dollars using the PPP calculation. The PPP calculations have the effect of lifting GNP per head sharply for most developing countries and former communist states. China, for example, had a GNP per head of Dollars 490 last year but, using PPP, this rises to Dollars 2,120. In Russia's case the PPP calculation yields a GNP per head of Dollars 5,240 for 1993 against Dollars 2,350 using traditional measures while the World Bank, using PPP, calculates India's GNP per head at Dollars 1,250 last year against Dollars 290 using the normal method. The PPP method shows that Mexico, which formally joined the ranks of the industrialised countries last year when it became a member of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is less wealthy than several nations that are still considered developing countries. Mexico's GNP per head was Dollars 7,100 in international dollars in 1993 against Dollars 8,630 for Malaysia and Dollars 8,130 for Venezuela. World Bank Atlas, Dollars 7.95.

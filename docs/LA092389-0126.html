			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UNBEATEN MISSION VIEJO ROLLS ALONG;  </P> <P> OFFENSE, DEFENSE SOLID IN ROUTING FOUNTAIN VALLEY, 34-7  </P> <P> Two questions came to mind after Mission Viejo High School's 34-7 victory over  Fountain Valley Friday night at Sheue Field in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Which is more formidable, Mission Viejo's defense or its offense? The Diablos  are averaging 44 points per game in three lopsided victories, but their defense  has allowed only one touchdown.  </P> <P> And second, who figures to become the No. 1-ranked team in Orange County after  previously top-ranked Los Alamitos' 24-21 upset loss to Villa Park on Thursday  night? Mission Viejo or El Toro?  </P> <P> Mike Milner, Fountain Valley's coach, offered some insight to the second  question after watching his team, which was missing six starters because of  injuries, lose for the second consecutive week. El Toro beat Fountain Valley,  27-19, last week.  </P> <P> "El Toro has more weapons offensively, but Mission Viejo's defense is pretty  solid from the front line to the secondary," Milner said. "El Toro has the best  quarterback in the county, and that might mean the difference.  </P> <P> "They're both very good teams, and I'd pay to see the game when they play each  other. It was obvious this wasn't the same Fountain Valley team that played so  well last week."  </P> <P> Which brings us back to the first question: Offense or defense? Mission Viejo's  defense sparkled, allowing only 35 yards rushing and 78 yards passing. Three  opponents have averaged only 108 yards in total offense this season.  </P> <P> But Mission Viejo's offense was no less than imposing. Quarterback Don Disbro  passed for two touchdowns, tailback Mark Gaw scored three touchdowns and  fullback Ryan Darke added two more touchdowns in the second half.  </P> <P> Disbro completed five of eight passes for 69 yards, connecting with Gaw on  scoring passes of 24 and 26 yards. Gaw displayed plenty of power on his first  score when he appeared to be stopped at Fountain Valley's 19-yard line.  </P> <P> Gaw caught a short screen pass from Disbro, but when he headed up field, he  failed to find any blockers. He was hit by three defenders but broke through a  pile and ran 24 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Darke's most impressive run was a 28-yard sprint through the heart of Fountain  Valley's defense that finished the scoring for Mission Viejo in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley managed to avoid a shutout when tailback Brian Williams scored  on a one-yard run with 37 seconds remaining. It was the second touchdown  Mission Viejo has allowed this season, but the first by its defense. University  scored last week on a fumble recovery.  </P> <P> "The kids were pretty upset when they read a comment last week from Fountain  Valley that El Toro is the best team in the county," said Mike Rush, Mission  Viejo coach. "All I'll say is that we're improving every week."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the issue of who is the county's best team won't rest until Mission  Viejo plays El Toro Oct. 27 in South Coast League play.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of resolution adopted by National Assembly on 13 </F> June -- read by Assembly member Abucar Anga Toure]    [Text] Considering the state of insecurity in the northern  regions of our country, considering that it is public knowledge  that the integrated soldiers and the grassroot combatants are  the cause of this unstable climate, considering the creation of  new movements based on a self-defense policy, considering the  need to prevent social troubles that could be triggered by this  new trend, the National Assembly hereby demands that the Unified  Movements and Front of Azaouad take control of the grassroot  elements. The assembly calls on the government to use all legal  means possible to put an end to the insecurity prevailing in the  north by deploying special units, reinforcing military presence,  and training the Armed Forces and security forces so they may  fulfill their mission.    Th government should redeploy the integrated combatants  throughout the national territory and set up camps to train them  to observe strict military discipline. This means that any other  combatants should be evacuated from cities and villages. The  destruction of all combatant bases should be done concurrently  with the integration of the combatants into the government  forces.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Drabek: "Vladimir Zhirinovskiy Will Not Come </F> to Slovakia"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava/Moscow -- [passage omitted]  Grigoriy Serebrennikov, press secretary of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDP] parliamentary group, informed  SME by telephone about the circumstances of the sudden change in  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's program. According to Serebrennikov,  Zhirinovskiy intends radically to limit his trips abroad in the  future. The LDP leader decided not to travel to Slovakia under  the impression of his visit to Saratov on Wednesday [18 May]  where, according to Serebrennikov, he saw with his own eyes the  dramatic situation the country finds itself in. "Factories are  standing still, people have not received any wages since  January, a social explosion is looming. Vladimir Volfovich  reached the conclusion that his task is now to tour Russian  cities and to talk to the people there so that, when the  situation comes to a head tomorrow, they are able to orient  themselves and seek a solution in support of the LDP,"  Serebrennikov said. According to the LDP press secretary, the  trip to Slovakia has not been postponed but canceled. In the  foreseeable future, there will not be a single opening in  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's busy schedule. [passage omitted]    [Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 20 May on pages 1 and 2  carries a 500-word Vladimir Jancura, Boris Latta report,  entitled "Visit Postponed Again," which provides a different  explanation for the cancellation of Zhirinovskiy's visit to  Slovakia. According to the report, Bratislava lawyer Jozef  Lauko, who describes himself as "Zhirinovskiy's friend of long  standing," told the PRAVDA reporters that three members of  Zhirinovskiy's entourage "had problems with their travel  documents. It seems that the 'AB-Sluzhebnaya' stamp,  identifying holders of official passports, was missing in them."  Lauko voices the assumption that the three men in question were  Zhirinovskiy's personal bodyguards and that "for understandable  reasons, the party leadership did not permit Mr. Zhirinovskiy to  travel without bodyguards."]</p>

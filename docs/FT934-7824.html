			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rover loses instigator of revival - The large vacuum at the top left by George Simpson THE DEPARTURE of Mr George Simpson from British Aerospace to become chief executive of Lucas leaves a large gap at the top of Rover group, BAe's motor vehicles subsidiary. The emergence of Rover as one of the more unlikely success stories of the European motor industry in the last couple of years has owed much to Mr Simpson's leadership. He has been instrumental in driving forward the strategy of so-called - moving the former chronically loss-making, state-owned carmaker increasingly up-market into more lucrative segments dominated by producers such as BMW and away from the dogfight of the volume carmakers. The architect of this bold marketing strategy for the transformation of the old, ailing British Leyland volume carmaker into an market manufacturer of executive cars, was Sir Graham Day, Mr Simpson's predecessor as Rover group chairman and the man responsible for returning Rover, then BL, to the private sector in 1988 with its takeover by British Aerospace. Sir Graham picked Mr Simpson to put the strategy into action, however, when he appointed him managing director in 1988, and since 1991 he has been both Rover chairman and chief executive. The decision to leave Rover has not been an easy one. Mr Simpson, a Scottish accountant, has been in the motor industry for most of his career, and virtually all of this time since 1969 has been spent with Rover in its various earlier guises as BLMC, British Leyland or BL. Among his earlier posts he was variously managing director of Coventry Climax, of Freight Rover (BL's van operations), and of Leyland Trucks. He became chief executive of Leyland Daf, when the BL truck operations were taken over by Daf of the Netherlands in 1987 but was brought back to Rover only a year later. After all the years of frustration, decline and restructuring the ugly duckling of BL is fast becoming a swan in the shape of Rover. Mr Simpson has had to weigh up the chances of possibly leading Rover into some form of independence, if BAe should choose to cash in and float off the car-making operations at an opportune moment. The carrot dangled by Lucas was the certain opportunity to head a leading UK manufacturing group now, removing any uncertainty posed by the vagaries of BAe's corporate manoeuvres. Mr Simpson leaves Rover in better shape than it has been for decades. The management team led by Mr John Towers, group managing director, and now BAe's most senior Rover executive, inherits an operation that is moving sharply back into profit this year in vivid contrast with most of the European motor industry that is slipping steeply into loss. Rover group is the only significant carmaker in Europe to have increased its sales volume this year helped by the increase in the UK market and a strong performance - albeit from a small base - in the contracting markets of Germany, Italy and France. Its sales in west Europe have jumped by 12.9 per cent in a market that has fallen by 15.3 per cent. Its sales of four-wheel drive Land Rover vehicles have been growing strongly, and - amidst the swathes of job cuts in the European auto industry - Land Rover has been adding jobs. Rover will be in profit for the full year in 1993 after two years of losses, says Mr Simpson. In the first six months Rover cut its operating loss before interest to Pounds 19m from Pounds 31m in the corresponding period last year. The first half loss included redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds 22m. Excluding the one-off rationalisation charge Rover's trading performance in the first six months improved by Pounds 34m from a year ago and already resulted in a small profit of Pounds 3m. Rover has forecast 'a significant recovery' in its financial performance in the second half of this year. Production, which fell by 6.4 per cent to 200,872 in the first half under the impact of significant stock reductions, has risen significantly in the second half. The benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling, which were delayed by currency hedging arrangements, are also being fully reflected in the second half. The UK car maker's first half financial performance was impaired by launch costs of around Pounds 10m for the new Rover 600 executive car, which was introduced in April. In the second half Rover has benefitted from strong UK sales in August, when its registrations increased by 23.7 per cent in an overall market, which rose by 17.8 per cent. The group has increased its market share in the UK and profitability is being helped by an improving 'model mix' with an increasing proportion of sales coming from its larger Rover cars and fourwheel drive Land Rover vehicles.</p>

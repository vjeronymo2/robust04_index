			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Barings raises Dollars 180m for east Europe fund The Barings group of the UK has raised Dollars 180m for a new investment vehicle for the former Soviet Union, taking the pool of funds targeted at eastern Europe to more than Dollars 1bn. The First NIS Regional Fund announced yesterday that it had indications of Dollars 160m of equity commitments and a further Dollars 20m of guaranteed debt financing. Baring Brothers, the merchant banking subsidiary, sponsored the placing and Baring International Investment Management is to manage the fund. The fund has come to the market at the same time as Invesco's East Europe Development Fund, which last week announced it had raised Dollars 75m, taking its net asset value to Dollars 170m. First NIS Regional Fund will be one of the largest three east European funds, alongside EEDF and CS First Boston's Central European Growth Fund, which raised Dollars 200m on its launch earlier this year. Barings already manages the Barings Emerging Europe Trust and it issued and placed the latest EEDF transaction. Core investors in First NIS Regional Fund are the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. The EBRD committed Dollars 20m. Barings, like most managers of funds in the region, said it was aiming for long-term capital growth. However, it said it expected a large proportion of the fund's investments would be unlisted or, if listed, illiquid.</p>

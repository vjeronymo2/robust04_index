			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Fewer companies leaving London The number of companies moving out of central London has fallen to its lowest level since 1964, says a report by Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors. The number of companies moving more than 100 jobs out of the capital fell to eight in the year to September 1993, compared with 23 in 1992 and 37 in 1991. The number of jobs being moved out also fell sharply from about 11,000 in 1992 to about 3,500 in 1993. The slowdown in decentralisation reflects the impact of the recession and the sharp decline in London property costs, relative to other UK locations. However, 1993 could be a trough in the recent level of decentralisation activity, the report says. JLW expects 27 companies to move out of London between 1994 and 1996, which is similar to the trends in the late 1980s. Two-thirds of companies planning moves are expected to choose new premises in the south-east. JLW said this was a significant break from the recent trend of organisations making long-distance moves to cut accommodation costs and improve labour availability. It attributed this change to the 1995 rating revaluation, which is likely to reduce the cost of rates in the south-east compared with other parts of the country. In addition, the introduction of an Pounds 8,000 ceiling on tax-free relocation expenses for each employee last July has reduced companies' enthusiasm for moving long distances.

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Florida Museum Hires Corcoran Director: Corcoran Gallery of Art Director  Christina Orr-Cahall, who resigned last month after six months of controversy  over her decision to cancel an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, has  been named director of the Norton Gallery in Palm Beach, Fla. After Orr-Cahall  leaves the Corcoran in Washington on Feb. 1, she will spend 2 1/2 months as a  Woodrow Wilson Center guest scholar studying "The Impact of the Print Media on  the Mapplethorpe Controversy."  </P> <P> The Norton is a small private museum with a permanent collection focusing on  19th- and 20th-Century Impressionists. Orr-Cahall worked there as a curatorial  consultant for two years in the late '70s. Her cancellation of the Mapplethorpe  show last June, which she said was intended to keep the museum out of a  political battle over National Endowment for the Arts funding of potentially  offensive art, was greeted with widespread criticism and calls for her  resignation from the arts community. Orr-Cahall resigned as director of the  Corcoran the day trustees were scheduled to vote on her future at the museum.  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PRINCIPAL OF INGLEWOOD'S MORNINGSIDE HIGH DIES  </P> <P> Mallory L. Matthews, who in February took over as acting principal of  Inglewood's troubled Morningside High School, died Wednesday morning after a  long illness.  </P> <P> Matthews, 37, had been hospitalized since Sept. 4, when he collapsed during a  parents' orientation meeting at Morningside. District officials said family  members told them Matthews died of a heart attack at Daniel Freeman Memorial  Hospital at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> Family members could not be reached for comment, and hospital officials said  the family had requested them not to comment.  </P> <P> Matthews was named acting principal of Morningside in February after the  previous principal, Art Murray, was forced out of the job by district  administrators, who held him responsible for problems during last year's fall  semester.  </P> <P> At that time, Morningside was disrupted by scheduling difficulties that kept  hundreds of students out of class and by student walkouts to protest campus  conditions.  </P> <P> "Education has lost a coming star," said former Inglewood High School Principal  Lawrence Freeman, who worked with Matthews for about five years. "Matthews  cared a lot. He got along well with students. He was quite a kid."  </P> <P> Maurice Wiley, the district's spokesman, called Matthews "a very positive force  (who) improved the condition of our students."  </P> <P> Matthews was an assistant principal under Freeman at Inglewood High from 1985  until he was chosen by the school board to replace Murray in February.  </P> <P> Before that, Matthews had been an assistant principal at Morningside from 1981  to '85 and a coordinator of adult education and a summer principal there. He  entered the district in 1979 as a social studies teacher at Inglewood High.  </P> <P> Matthews was a graduate of Serra High School in Gardena and UCLA. He later  earned a master's degree in education from Pepperdine University.  </P> <P> District officials gave no word Wednesday on a replacement for Matthews at  Morningside. Assistant Principal Ed Brownley has been filling in for Matthews  since he entered the hospital; Brownley, however, has not been named acting  principal.  </P></p>

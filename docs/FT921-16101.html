			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Incentives get a boost - Sponsorship This is certain to be a very hard year for arts sponsorship, probably the hardest in the history of a business which has enjoyed unbroken growth since its origins in the mid 1970s. The majority of companies link their expenditure on sponsorship, along with charitable giving, environmental aid, and good works generally, to their profitability. With profits down last year virtually across the board, the tithe for the arts will be reduced. The exception will be those companies which are committed to sponsorship  - either as an act of faith or because they know it makes good business sense. The minister for the arts, Tim Renton, has acknowledged the possibility of a crisis by allocating most of the extra Pounds 1m he wheedled out of the Treasury for the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (bringing it to Pounds 4.5m a year) to those long-term sponsors of the arts who have kept the faith. In the past the BSIS has been geared towards first-time sponsors. That element remains but from April companies returning for a second helping qualify for Pounds 1 in Government money for every Pounds 2 they give, instead of Pounds 1 for every Pounds 4 as at present, and sponsors for a fourth year now qualify for a top up  - Pounds 1 for every Pounds 4 they contribute. This should encourage large multinationals, the hard pressed group most likely to reduce their sponsorship in 1992, to maintain their involvement. This hunt for new applicants suggests that ABSA (Association Business Sponsorship Arts), which administers the scheme, does not expect to be overwhelmed with sponsors. The BSIS scheme has attracted over the years 2,000 new sponsors who have poured Pounds 30m into the arts and attracted Pounds 15m from the government. Renton is allocating some of the additional Pounds 1m to the opening of an ABSA office in the north of England. Last month the London Mozart Players launched its promotional video aimed at sponsors, an impressive advertisement in which Prince Edward, the LMP's patron, acted as anchor man to an enthusiastic gathering of possible contacts. The LMP played and the champagne flowed. The event took place in an empty office suite in Mayfair. The party was hosted by the suite's developers, the Imry Group and Speyhawk, which also invited to the concert prospective tenants of its development. It was yet another example of the synergy that the property crisis has encouraged, using the arts to draw in visitors who, without the incentive of a concert or an art show, would probably not bother to give the offices a first glance. A month or so ago another property company, Lynton, in an attempt to stimulate interest in its Eversholt Street development, commissioned a 25 ft high reproduction of a painting by the American artist Robert Heindel, which depicts Jane Sanig, a principal dancer with London City Ballet, and which is entitled 'Pursued by a Beast called Passion'. Any tenant taking space in the building is presented with a year's free corporate membership of the LCB, worth Pounds 1,000, plus a limited edition print by Heindel. Also in with a potential gain from the deal is the Halcyon Gallery of Birmingham which exhibits the artist. The area which has tried to cash in most on the arts is Docklands. The Canary Wharf development has its own concert hall and a costly programme of free events for the pioneer office workers there. During the summer many Dockland developments, from Tower Bridge Piazza to the Tobacco Dock shopping mall, were giving over empty space for art shows, sometimes to art school students, sometimes to professional artists  - all in an effort to bring some life to dead developments and to lure potential tenants. The Quinlan Terry development over Charing Cross station, a work of art in itself, has played host to numerous events, including an art show organised by the gallery Pomeroy Purdy. This year, in a further turn of the roundabout, even more property developers will be looking to arts organisations for promotional help, rather than vice versa. Arts organisations have not exploited Gift Aid to its full potential  - not that there is much potential in this Treasury-thwarted scheme to offer tax incentives for charitable givers. But the Tate Gallery has just received Pounds 90,000 from a private patron using Gift Aid. The money will pay for an archivist to investigate the Kenneth Clark archive which the gallery received in lieu of death duties. Earlier this year the Tate was able to purchase a Wright of Derby painting, thanks in part to Pounds 100,000 in Gift Aid contributed by property man John Ritblat. Arts organisations have been slow to approach companies with money-raising alternatives in addition to direct sponsorship. They have been especially unimaginative in getting sponsors to pay for services which could in their turn unlock sizeable sums of money. One of the Tate's brightest initiatives in 1991 was to persuade Tate &amp; Lyle, which after all shares with it a funding millionaire, to renew its connection with the gallery and sponsor a three-year membership drive for more Friends of the Tate. The company financed new leaflets, an advertising campaign, and a Friend's desk in the gallery. This has already added 2,500 Friends, which at Pounds 25 a time, makes a useful contribution towards the fund to purchase new acquisitions. The record companies are notoriously stingy sponsors, given their dependence on musical creativity for their profits. But Thorn-EMI is digging deeply into its pocket to pay for a European tour by Beethoven's piano. The instrument was given to the composer in 1817 by its maker, Thomas Broadwood, and is now in a museum in Budapest. It will be played as it travels around the Continent, ending up in the UK in the early summer. EMI artist Melvyn Tan will perform on the piano, which is insured for Pounds 5m, in Bath and at the Barbican, and recordings will inevitably be made. The National Maritime Museum is the most entrepreneurial of our important national museums, the one which at least thinks about an existence without government subsidy. It plans to open a new gallery in the summer dedicated to 'Seapower in the 20th century', thanks to a Pounds 400,000 sponsorship from the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan-based shipping company. The gallery is the first step in a Pounds 4m refurbishment of the museum's south-west wing.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness upset again The resignation of the managing director of United Distillers left Guinness shares trailing as the rumours swirling round the stock over the past week appeared to reflect some element of truth. The shares retreated 15 initially but rallied to close 7 off at 396p, with a hefty 10m traded. Yesterday's decline means the stock has now fallen 23 per cent in the past six weeks as poor results last month have been compounded by a succession of negative stories in the market. Most have concerned LVMH, the French luxury goods group which has a near-25 per cent cross holding in Guinness. Talk in Paris last week that LVMH is looking to raise capital refuses to die away and in London has brought suggestions that it may sell Guinness its spirits business in return for the stake in LVMH. On Monday, Guinness shares were under pressure as a story of an imminent executive departure began to circulate.</p>

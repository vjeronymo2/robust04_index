			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F> Claude Jacquemart; place and date not given: "Alphandery:  `Unemployment To Fall by End of 1994'"--first paragraph is LE  FIGARO introduction]    [Text] The economics minister convincingly defends the  Balladur government while stressing that "one year is long  enough for our inheritance to be forgotten and too short to  harvest tangible results." To those who believe that the  government has not gone far enough down the road to reform and  has been too cautious, he replies: "Rarely have 12 months seen  as many reforms." After pointing out that the budget deficit  "we found when we arrived in office was twice the size reported  by the Socialists," he states: "Privatization has made it  possible to find the resources needed to fight unemployment and  to ensure social progress and jobs."    [Jacquemart] Many people say, and not just in the  opposition,  that the Balladur government has not reformed France to any  great extent, especially in fields such as state education,  where urgent changes are needed. If the government could be  criticized for something, would it not be for being too cautious?    [Alphandery] What more do you want? Rarely have 12 months  seen as many reforms! In a difficult economic context and  without any room for maneuver, we have implemented more reforms  in one year (and a year is a short time) than our predecessors  managed in five years. Moreover, recent polls have shown that  the majority of the French people agree with our actions.    We have implemented reforms in every domain: pensions,  taxation, justice, decentralization of authority toward the  regions, the environment, etc. Where I am concerned, at [Prime  Minister] Edouard Balladur's request, I have devised the tax  structure for the largest loan ever issued in France, worth 110  billion French francs [Fr]; I have started to modernize taxes on  savings; and reformed the status of the Banque de France, the  Banque Nationale de Paris [BNP], Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf.    [Jacquemart] Let us talk about that. Will not this  privatization be used, above all, to plug the gaps in the state  budget?    [Alphandery] A baseless accusation! We need to both respect  the property interests of the state and those of investors. The  price set in each case corresponds to a medium-term price. Do  not forget that the price of shares rises and falls on the stock  market. As a result, we have to keep a margin when we float the  shares. Recent experience has shown that we were right not to  listen to what many people were saying at the time. I should  add that we are subject to a bottom rate set by the  privatization committee, whose independence is recognized by  everyone and was clearly established by a law I had recently  adopted. This is another aspect of privatization in France.  Then again, and I am not afraid to repeat it, this  privatization has proved a considerable success.    [Jacquemart] But you should have used the profits to offset  the national debt.    [Alphandery] In the last six months we have made Fr76  billion. This money was vitally needed, in particular to shore  up economic activity, recapitalize public companies, and  therefore, at the end of the day, to fight unemployment.  Believe me, I would have preferred to have used the money  generated from this privatization to offset the national debt,  but we scarcely had any choice -- necessity knows no limits!  The budget deficit that we found when we arrived in office was  twice the size reported by the Socialists a few months earlier.  In any case, I would like to point out the coherence that  exists between the government's financial and social policies.  Privatizations make it possible to find the resources needed to  fight unemployment and to ensure social progress and jobs.  <H5>  Developing Popular Partnerships </H5>   [Jacquemart] You are therefore privatizing through necessity  rather than conviction. We have come a long way since the  motivations of [the last right-wing government in] 1986!    [Alphandery] Not at all! We have not lost sight of the  essential reasons that encourage privatization. It is precisely  because the French people know full well that the switch to the  private sector is good for companies and therefore good for the  economy, and that privatization is no longer a subject of  ideological controversy.    Privatized companies now have more elbow room, in particular  to face up to their financing requirements. Privatization is  expanding the Paris stock market. Above all, it gives us the  opportunity to make the French people the owners of our major  companies by broadening the public shareholding and employee  participation. Finally, let me add that I agreed that the state  should assume its responsibility as a shareholder, both for Bull  and Credit Lyonnais, solely with a view to their privatization.    [Jacquemart] Of all the reforms implemented by the Balladur  government, which, in your opinion, was the most decisive?    [Alphandery] The Giraud law, even if it is the current trend  to criticize it. After all, it tackles the unemployment problem  at its roots. Why does France have a higher rate of  unemployment than its partners? Because there is not enough  flexibility in the job market; because the labor costs,  especially for unqualified labor, are too high; and because  there is insufficient vocational training for young people and  French companies have taken too little interest in this aspect,  unlike German companies. What we have been doing in the last 12  months has been aimed at solving these problems. That is the  direction taken by the Giraud law. It introduced more  flexibility by annualizing working time and introducing services  checks [to create more services jobs]; it reduced labor costs  for low-paid jobs by including family policy in the budget -- an  idea that I have pushed for for a long time -- and it aims to  get companies more involved in youth training schemes.    [Jacquemart] People were expecting a government for jobs. We  are still awaiting the results. When will the trends begin to  be reversed?    [Alphandery] Of course, that is the crucial question. But  let us tackle one hurdle at a time! First we have to restart  the economy. When I announced last autumn, in a period of  general gloom, that activity should take off again at the start  of 1994 and that we would achieve growth of 1.4 percent this  year, my forecast gave rise, at the very least, to a degree of  skepticism. Today, this figure is being confirmed. I could  even be accused of having been too pessimistic! Of course,  growth of 1.4 percent is nothing to write home about. However,  we should remember that we have only been in office for 12  months. One year is long enough for our inheritance to be  forgotten and too short to harvest tangible results. We need  time before an economic policy can make its effects felt,  especially where unemployment is concerned. Thanks to the  combined measures of supporting the economy and the structural  provisions of the five-year law on employment, it is reasonable  to anticipate that we will see a reversal of the trend toward  the end of the year. Thus, the national accounts show that  France will again see real job creation starting next summer.  That is an optimistic note for the currently difficult social  climate. Moreover, France has perhaps gone too far in improving  productivity in services. Look at the countries that are  standing up best to unemployment, Japan and the United States.  You can see that they have retained many service jobs in shops,  car parks, and public transport. The government is thinking  about how best to create more jobs in these sectors.    [Jacquemart] What are you most proud of?    [Alphandery] In a country where unemployment is rife, that  is  not the question that concerns me the most. However, I am  pleased that I have been able to design a financial policy that  aims to mobilize short-term savings for the sake of economic  recovery. Can this money be plowed into the manufacturing sector  -- where the jobs are created -- and be used to kindle the  economy? That question has given rise to various measures whose  overall coherence has not always been appreciated: Monetary  policy that aims at obtaining a durable fall in short-term rates  faster than the fall in long-term rates; the tax instrument of  the Balladur loan, which I wanted to accelerate the  consolidation of savings; a reform of savings tax to redirect  short-term savings toward long-term investments; and the  ambitious program of privatization which we have already  mentioned: All those measures are intended to spark growth and  curb rising unemployment.    [Jacquemart] What has been the greatest failure in your  domain?    [Alphandery] In a way, our greatest failure is not having  been able to find the right words to dialogue with young people.  Unfortunately, the same holds true for all governments in all  countries, irrespective of their political leanings. How can  you convince them that the CIP [youth job training contract] is  first and foremost their passport to their first job in the  company and that, in that way, it is the key to social  integration?</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / People: Hammerson slims down its board Hammerson, the UK property company, yesterday announced the first of a number of measures designed to cut overheads and rationalise its management structure; they are being introduced by Ron Spinney, the company's new chief executive, who was appointed in April. Jon Scott, the head of Hammerson's property management operation, has resigned from the board and left the company. John Richards will now be responsible for the UK operations which comprise its property management and development interests. Bruce Heyland and Tony Ball have resigned from the board in order to devote their time more fully to operational responsibilities for overseas subsidiaries - in Canada and the US, and in Australasia, respectively. They have not been compensated for leaving the board. Hammerson says these changes are 'designed to provide a clearer division between group and operational management responsibilities'. The group has also cut the number of head office staff from 67 to 57. The redundancies covered property, financial and communications staff. Hammerson is one of the UK's strongest property companies having strengthened its balance sheet with a Pounds 199m rights issue in May. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 31.1m in 1992, down from Pounds 55.5m in 1991.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Yeltsin unlikely to be impeached as rival retreats: Speaker promises qualified co-operation THE IMPEACHMENT of Russian president Mr Boris Yeltsin appeared unlikely last night after his main political rival Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov made a surprise about-turn on his demands for such a move. However, a direct confrontation between the president and parliament is still possible at today's Congress of the People's Deputies. The turnround by Mr Khasbulatov, speaker of the conservative-dominated parliament, came when he remarked that 'frankly speaking, I'm no supporter of impeachment'. This follows his declaration on Tuesday that the case for impeachment was 'as clear as day'. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister, said he expected the parliament instead to invoke a clause of the constitution which strips the president of his powers if he attempts to disband or suspend other elected institutions. The deputies, said Mr Shakhrai, would be invited by Mr Khasbulatov to resolve to bring this clause into play if Mr Yeltsin continued his confrontation with them - and would clarify the clause by laying down that, in that case, the office of president would pass to General Alexander Rutskoi, currently vice-president. Mr Yeltsin, however, is using the special powers he granted himself under a decree published on Wednesday which forbids anybody but the Constitutional Court to countermand his instructions. The government met yesterday to adopt a package of priority measures on the economy under the president's instructions. Interfax news agency reported that these included a plan to delay for six months the repayment of foreign debt while emergency stabilisation measures are in effect. No elaboration of this was immediately available. A fund would would be established to stabilise the rouble, drawn from existing foreign exchange reserves and international credits. A new 8 per cent per month interest rate will be set by the central bank and a rigid limit on credits from the central bank, and a simplification of the system of selling land to the population will be introduced. Mr Yeltsin, speaking on television last night, said that 'an attempt to remove the president is being made behind the back of the voters'. Claiming the support of the executives of most of the regions and republics within Russia, Mr Yeltsin said: 'The more the Congress meets, the more the people are alarmed.' He promised to put a stop to it. In a prior televised interview, Mr Khasbulatov said that 'we cannot let the executive authorities concentrate all power in their hands'. In an extended attack on 'shock therapy', the radical economic reform the government is now attempting to put in place, Mr Khasbulatov promised co-operation with Mr Yeltsin if he would change the economic course and stabilise prices. Mr Shakhrai, in his detailed rehearsal of the Congress's expected tactics, said that it would attempt to wrest control of a referendum proposed by Mr Yeltsin for April 25. It would call elections for the presidency and parliament for June 12, and have the Supreme Soviet - the smaller permanent parliament - prepare an electoral law. Then, forecast Mr Shakhrai, the Congress would be reconvened on June 10 in order to cancel elections. The deputy prime minister said: 'Since we have their scenario we are able to plan our counter measures' - but he refused to reveal his next move. The continued gulf between the two sides, and the determination of Mr Yeltsin to continue with his version of the referendum - seeking support for his measures and a new constitution - now makes any successful compromise unlikely. Many deputies nonetheless expect further attempts at a deal to be made during the Congress today or, if prolonged, at the weekend. Elections in the near future have the rhetorical support of all sides but they differ on the form of a referendum, the need for a new constitution, the powers of the president in the period leading up to the elections and the programme of the government.

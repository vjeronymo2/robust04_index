			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to </F> Italian Parliament on no-confidence motion -- live]    [Text] Esteemed honorable speaker, esteemed honorable  members of the Chamber of Deputies. Having reached this stage  in the debate, I think all the groups have assumed their  responsiblities and that the positions are now clear. I thank  the members of Parliament who proposed confirming confidence in  the Government. I acknowledge that the deputies who tabled the  no-confidence motion eventually withdrew their signatures.    On the other hand, the motion itself -- considering the way  it was tabled and its origin -- shows that there are conflicting  and diverging opinions in Parliament on what it is necessary to  do. I also would like to thank all the groups which, from  different political sides, have expressed their approval of the  program that the Government has implemented, or of the way the  Government has worked.    However, we cannot help considering the fact that, in spite  of the widespread approval of the Government's action, there  have also been deep divisions on the future of the 11th  legislature, which were confirmed by the debate. In some  respects the divisions have become deeper. This schism also  casts doubts on whether there are the necessary conditions for  Parliament to continue productive work. This question, which  concerns the future of the legislature, is a crucial point. It  cannot be overcome with a vote. This is not a matter which  concerns the Government, either in the political or in the  institutional sphere.    In order to allow all the constitutional responsibilities to  be fully implemented, so that a definitive clarification may be  obtained, after a Cabinet meeting, I will go and see the head of  state in order to brief him on what emerged from this debate.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker, esteemed honorable deputies, for the  example that this assembly has given to all citizens through  this debate. An example of absolute loyalty [words indistinct]  to our republic and to its history, and hope for its future.  Thank you.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: State calls halt to bid for BPA The Portuguese government last night vetoed a Es132bn (Dollars 832m) hostile bid for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), the country's second largest bank, by Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP). The finance ministry said it blocked the bid partly because control of BPA by BCP, the fifth biggest bank, could destabilise the financial system. The new group would have controlled 24 per cent of Portugal's banking assets. The takeover would have also interrupted the privatisation of BPA, according to a government statement. The bank has been privatised in stages since 1990 but the state still holds 24.5 per cent. The core shareholders of BPA, a group of 13 Portuguese companies which own 28.7 per cent, have said the government is committed to giving them preferential treatment in the privatation process. But BCP has urged the government to sell its holding to the highest bidder. The government decision is expected to draw strong criticism from financial circles for intervening in the free operation of the market. 'The government is seeking to hold back a trend towards the merger of banking groups that is already widespread in the rest of Europe,' said Mr Vitor Contancio, a former governor of the Bank of Portugal and member of the opposition Socialist Party.</p>

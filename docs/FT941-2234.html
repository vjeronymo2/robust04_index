			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong There is no shortage of excuses for the sharp fall in the Hang Seng index which has left it nearly 30 per cent below its peak. US interest rates have turned up. There are growing worries about the Chinese economy over-heating, not to mention the impact on the territory's trade if the US refuses to renew China's most-favoured-nation status. Even taken together, though, these factors do not seem to warrant such a steep fall in equities. The real cause has been withdrawal of liquidity by US hedge funds and other speculative international investors. The question is whether the decline has now gone on far enough to attract long-term buyers again. Yesterday's pick up in volume suggests this point might be close. So far, the results season has lived up to expectations or even, as yesterday with TVB and CITIC, exceeded them. The consensus puts the market on a prospective p/e of between 12 and 13, which is hardly expensive. Admittedly a further rise in US interest rates would damage confidence in the property market, which must be close to its top. But it would also be easy to over-estimate the impact of higher rates on corporate earnings even if they were passed on to the local market. Hong Kong would probably continue to enjoy negative real interest rates, while the corporate sector itself is under-geared. If one believes the US needs China's support in curbing North Korea's nuclear aspirations, the MFN threat may even recede. That would leave trading companies looking particularly good value for anyone with the courage to climb back on board.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ahmad Idris dispatch from Islamabad] </F>   [Text] Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced in  Islamabad today that, within the next two days, she will  dispatch her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, as a special envoy to  Iraq at the head of a delegation with about 14 tonnes of  medicine. Zardari will bear a message from Bhutto to President  Saddam Husayn. Informed sources say the message is connected to  the release of two Pakistani soldiers and one civilian who were  sentenced to seven years imprisonment in Iraq after entering  Iraqi territory by mistake, as was claimed at the time, while on  the job in a mine field on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border.    Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,  Pakistan dispatched troops within the Desert Shield operation in  the second Gulf war and expelled an Iraqi diplomat.    The two countries relations were not satisfactory during the  rule of General Ziaul Haq.    Informed sources told our radio that the Pakistani  delegation  will discuss with officials in Baghdad the causes for their  tense relations. The sources voiced optimism that Iraq will  release the imprisoned Pakistanis and that relations will be  restored to what they were during the leadership of Zulfikar Ali  Bhutto and Benazir's first government -- a state of utmost  cordiality.</p>

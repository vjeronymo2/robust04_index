			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: SUNDAY CANYON WALK A DELIGHT FOR AUTUMN  </P> <P> The docents at the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom at Franklin Canyon  Ranch say fall is the perfect time to be in the canyon. Fallen sycamore leaves  are a foot and a half deep in many places. Seeds and cones have dropped to the  ground, and animals are scurrying about to harvest them.  </P> <P> Families can soak up all this autumnal ambiance Sunday afternoon when the  classroom and many of its docents will host a family walk followed by a  concert.  </P> <P> The walks begin at 1 p.m. with no more than 20 to a group. The route is the  same for all groups -- around the lake -- but families will be arranged  according to the age of their children. The walk is suitable for children 2  through 12, and is stroller accessible.  </P> <P> At 2 p.m., as walkers return to the center, ethnomusicologist Craig Woodson  will entertain in the auditorium. In his hour show, Woodson will talk about and  play traditional instruments from Africa, Europe and the Americas. Children  will be invited to join him on stage.  </P> <P> The walk and concert are free, but reservations are recommended. Both take  place at WODOC's Sooky Goldman Nature Center, 2600 Franklin Canyon Drive,  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> For taped information: (213) 858-3834.  </P> <P> TEDDY BEAR TALES  </P> <P> A story time featuring tales of teddy bears will honor Michael Hague,  illustrator of children's books including "The Velveteen Rabbit" and "Mother  Goose." Hague is the artist behind the book illustrations attributed to the  character Nancy in TV's "thirtysomething." (Hague had been scheduled to appear,  but will not because of a recent injury.) The story time will begin at 10 a.m.  today at Pages Books for Children, 18399 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana.  </P> <P> Information: (818) 342-6657.  </P> <P> AMERICAN TRADITIONS  </P> <P> This week's Sunday Family Night at the Craft and Folk Art Museum begins with an  art workshop in American folk toys (whistles and whirligigs) and continues with  a concert and storytelling that roams all over the country: New England,  Appalachia, the Southwest. Families should arrive at 5 p.m. (with picnic  dinners) to learn how to make the toys, using wood pipes and decorative  supplies. At 6 p.m., storyteller Martha Stevens and musician John Zeretzke from  the Aman Folk Ensemble will entertain. The museum is in the May Co.-Wilshire,  Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. The cost is $4 for adults and $2 for  children 4 to 16.  </P> <P> Reservations may be left on the answering machine: (213) 934-3082.  </P> <P> ANCIENT MYTHS  </P> <P> Join storyteller Martha Stevens as she relates the ancient myths of Diana the  Huntress and Orion the Hunter at Sunday's Whale's Tales under the "oak tree" at  the Ralph M. Parsons Discovery Center at the Natural History Museum. The  45-minute program is held in conjunction with the museum's exhibit "Carthage: A  Mosaic of Ancient Tunisia." The stories begin at 3:15 p.m. and are free with  museum admission: $3 for adults, 75 cents for children 5 to 12.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 744-3417.  </P> <P> SANTA SINGS  </P> <P> Santa arrives early at Santa Monica Playhouse, and it's a good thing he does.  He's just in time to repel the bad vibes of his wicked twin brother from the  South Pole, who is bent on spoiling Christmas, in this original musical "All  About Santa." The one-hour, 10-minute show is suitable for ages 2 and up. Show  times are Saturdays and Sundays (through Dec. 17) at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. with  extra 11 a.m. performances beginning December 2. Birthday party arrangements  can be made. The playhouse is at 1211 4th St., Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Tickets are $6, and reservations are required: (213) 394-9779.  </P></p>

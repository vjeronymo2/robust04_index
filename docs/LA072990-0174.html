			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Operation Petticoat (Channel 9 Sunday at 1 p.m.): Blake Edwards' biggest  pre-"Panther" hit was this 1959 comedy about commander Cary Grant, con man Tony  Curtis and a subful of unabashed nurses. A bit like a boudoir "Mr. Roberts," it  has daffy slapstick, sexy wit. (2:00)  </P> <P> A Nous la Liberte &amp; Man About Town (TNT Sunday at 11:10 p.m. &amp; 1:10  a.m.): Two Rene Clair comedies from before and after his Hollywood interlude.  </P> <P> "A Nous," often considered his masterpiece, inspired Chaplin's "Modern Times."  "Man" is a joyous Maurice Chevalier vehicle. (3:50)  </P> <P> A Night With Luis Bunuel (Bravo Tuesday at 7 p.m., 9 p.m., 11 p.m. &amp; 1  a.m.): Four films in a row from the cinema's greatest surrealist, fiercest  moralist, thorniest free spirit. In order: the scathing gem, "Discreet Charm of  the Bourgeosie" (1972), Bunuel's favorite, "The Milky Way" (1969), "The Phantom  of Liberty" (1974) and Jeanne Moreau in "Diary of a Chambermaid" (1964; adapted  from Mirabeau, remade from Renoir).  </P> <P> Clash by Night (TNT Saturday at 5 p.m.): Fritz Lang's brooding film of the  Clifford Odets play: an oceanside drama of lust and betrayal with Barbara  Stanwyck and Robert Ryan (a terrific villain). In a minor role: Marilyn Monroe.  (2:15)  </P></p>

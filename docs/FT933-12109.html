			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Another director quits Tomorrows Leisure TOMORROWS LEISURE, the Newcastle-based hotels and leisure group which is quoted on the USM, said that Mr Stephen Lovely, who joined the company barely three weeks ago as managing director, had resigned. Mr Lovely's departure is the second quick exit recently from the senior management ranks of the company, which this month gave a second loss warning for the year to March 31. Earlier this month it announced the resignation of Mr John Roberts, brought in as chairman in February when the founder, Mr John Sanderson, stepped down as chairman and managing director. Mr Sanderson, who became executive chairman following Mr Roberts' resignation, said it was Mr Lovely's decision to go. He said the appointment of a successor was at an advanced stage; an announcement of new board members would also be made soon.</p>

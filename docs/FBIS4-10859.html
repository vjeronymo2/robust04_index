			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Carlos Aponte] </F>   [Text] Subversive activities in Huaraz Province, Ancash  Department, are about 80 percent under control. Therefore, the  population that lived in uncertainty and panic for many years  due to the daily murder of government officials by the Shining  Path is returning to tranquillity and security.    Commander Jorge Fernandez, chief of the Mechanized Infantry  Battalion, told EXPRESO that the pacification process in this  part of the country is in progress through the fulfillment of  all the plans established by the government to dismantle the  small Shining Path groups that still are operating in different  parts of the nation. He added that the Armed Forces -- National  Police and Army -- were successful in dismantling the different  Shining Path groups that were operating in the area because of  the participation of the population that, far from feeling fear,  reported the subversives and gave information that led to their  capture.    Fernandez added that another factor that led to finding out  the whereabouts of top Shining Path military leaders was the  delicate intelligence operation carried out for a long time with  the participation of highly qualified and trained personnel to  face any situation.    During the last two years, the Army has dealt hard blows to  subversion. According to statistics, the Army broke up 53  military and logistical commands operating in different areas,  mainly in Chiquian and Callejon de los Conchucos, areas that  were under Shining Path control for many years.    Fernandez said: "The cooperation of the population and the  peasant defense patrols was a key element in breaking up the  important military commands that were operating in the different  settlements of Huaraz. And now we are seeing the results."    He said that in contrast with other departments in the  country, in Huaraz only a small group of subversives -- seven  all together -- decided to abide by the Repentance Law, because  they realized that their so-called "armed struggle" failed after  the capture of their highest leader, Abimael Guzman Reinoso.    He added that the Army is protecting them and is fulfilling  the orders given by the president through the Repentance Law.  Many of those who repented have given valuable information that  contributed to the capture of the main subversive leaders.    Regarding the possibility that Shining Path leader Julio  Cesar Mezzich may be operating in Huaraz, Fernandez said there  are many reports about his presence in the area but they have  not been confirmed yet.    He did not discard, however, the possibility that Mezzich  may  be hiding in the high area of Huaraz under another name, and  that this is why patrol operations are carried out in all the  peasant settlements.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (9): Handle numbers with extreme care - Andrew Jack discusses the disparities in regulations governing reporting practices in countries across Europe and examines, in particular, the radical revisions being made in the United Kingdom / Accounting Standards Rarely in the subject of financial reporting has so much flux affected so many companies across Europe in such a short period. Radical changes in regulation, accounting and in the search for finance are causing enormous alteration, and presenting new challenges and opportunities to readers of company accounts. Probably the most eye-catching example of reform came in September last year when Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, released first half results which plunged from a net profit of DM965m to a net loss of DM949m. The unexpected swing of nearly DM2bn was the result of a new format of reporting, forced by its need to comply with US accounting standards so that it could gain a listing on the New York stock exchange last October. Under Germany standards, Daimler-Benz continued to show profits of DM168m in the first six months of the year, compared with DM1.02bn in the same period in 1992. The principal difference between the two sets of figures was that German accounting allows the release of hidden reserves to camouflage operating losses. 'It shows that any idea that you could apply a standard adjustment ratio to convert Germany to British figures is ridiculous,' says Christopher Nobes, Coopers &amp; Lybrand professor of accounting at Reading University, who specialises in international accounting trends. 'It was always crazy to try to say that to multiply by two would convert one to the other.' Daimler-Benz - which is likely to be followed by other companies - has had to restate its results as part of a search for new money from investors away from its traditional supporters: domestic banks. But aside from international investor pressure for change, companies are having to adjust to new demands. Probably the most striking instance is in the UK, which is in the midst of radical revisions to accounting standards. The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has considerably more powers than its predecessor body. A legal opinion last year suggested its guidelines have the force of law. A separate body under the same parent institution called the Financial Reporting Review Panel also has the power to force companies to restate their accounts if they do not comply with standards in force. One of the most significant changes brought about by the ASB is FRS 1, the financial reporting standard on the cash flow statement. Over the past few months, FRS 3, a standard on the profit and loss account, has also come fully into force. FRS 3 all but abolishes extraordinary items, brings all remaining such charges above the earnings line, and introduces new disclosure requirements. The ASB's urgent issues task force has also been active, issuing a range of abstracts including a highly controversial one requiring the difference between the purchase and sale price of an acquisition once sold to be passed through the profit and loss account. British companies are now also beginning to reflect in their accounts mooted ASB changes, including a tougher line on debt masquerading as equity, and on the treatment of off-balance sheet finance. Elsewhere across Europe, many countries still present accounts according to tax legislation (which tends to emphasise lower profits) rather than the 'Anglo-Saxon' model geared more to investors. But this is changing. Professor Nobes says Norway, Sweden, Finland and France are all moving towards disentangling their tax from their accounting systems in response to the search for access to new capital markets. In Italy, companies will for the first time begin complying with the requirements of the EC fourth directive, which requires a different format, greater disclosures and the need for an audit. In Portugal, companies will begin to comply for the first time with the EC seventh directive on consolidated accounts. Generally, comparisons between European companies in different jurisdictions remain highly fraught. Professor Nobes particularly stresses discrepancies in reporting of anything affected by tax, such as depreciation, long-term contracts and provisions. He highlights wide variations in valuations of assets: at historical costs in Germany, and at 1991 and 1984 values in Italy and Spain respectively, reflecting the last time the countries required mandatory revaluations. He also raises discrepancies in the treatment of inventories (last-in, first-out is common in Italy and non-existent in the UK), and the treatment of goodwill, joint ventures and associates. National standard setters are increasingly recognising the importance of requirements that transcend their countries' own borders. Meanwhile, the International Accounting Standards Committee continues to strive for a set of rules with fewer alternatives which may be given renewed credibility if ratified by Iosco, the international organisation of securities commissions. But such consensus is still a long way off. In the meantime, readers of accounts should handle numbers with extreme care.</p>

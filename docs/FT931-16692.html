			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Saudi American Bank may double share capital SHAREHOLDERS of Saudi American Bank (Samba), the biggest joint-venture bank in Saudi Arabia, are to meet today to decide on plans to double the bank's share capital to SR1.2bn (Dollars 320m), Reuter reports from Manama. Mr Zakariya al-Kabbaa, general manager, said the extraordinary meeting would review plans for a one-for-one bonus issue, paying for it by transferring SR600m from its reserves. At the end of 1991, the bank's statutory and general reserves stood at SR2.4bn. Mr Mehli Mistri, managing director, said last month that Citibank, part of Citicorp of the US which holds 30 per cent of Samba's equity, would maintain its stake and remain a long-term partner. A year ago, Citibank sold 10 per cent of the bank's shares to two Saudi national social welfare agencies for an undisclosed amount. United Gulf Industries (UGIC), a Bahrain-based conglomearate, is to offer 28m new shares later this week to raise its paid-up capital to BD40m (Dollars 10.6m), Reuter reports from Manama.</p>

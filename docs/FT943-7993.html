			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: NorTel in screen-display telephone venture Northern Telecom, the Can-adian telecommunications equipment maker, has joined NBTel, the province of New Brunswick's telephone company, in a pioneering venture to provide advertising and other consumer information to screen-display telephones. The service, known as CallMall, enables phone-users to receive only the information they request. It can also be used for home banking, electronic shopping and community messages. The joint venture will be 51 per cent-owned by Bruncor, NBTel's parent, and 49 per cent by Northern. The partners will invest CDollars 40m (USDollars 29.2m) over the next two years, and expect to create about 100 jobs. The service will be launched in Moncton, New Brunswick, in October and will extended to the rest of the province in 1995. NBTel has signed up about 50 advertisers, including the Canadian subsidiaries of the Body Shop and several leading North American mail order companies. Some government services are likely to be added. The telephones, made by Northern, are equipped with screens displaying up to eight lines of text.</p>

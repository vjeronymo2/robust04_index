			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japan leans towards Boeing for developing 100-seat jet Japan has indicated its preference for developing a 100-seat commercial jet aircraft, in co-operation with Boeing of the US, rather than a joint development with European companies for a 75-seater turbo-propellor aircraft. The move by Japanese aerospace manufacturers is a blow to European aircraft-makers and is likely to fuel dissatisfaction in the EU over Japan's inclination towards the US in aerospace. The move did not surprise the industry in view of Japan's traditional links with Boeing. Last week, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest aerospace manufacturer, informed ATR, the Franco-Italian regional turbo-propeller aircraft-maker, and Saab-Scania of Sweden, that the Japanese consortium developing the aircraft was 'moving in the direction of' choosing the 100-seat jet aircraft. The proposed aircraft, code-named the YSX, is to be developed by leading Japanese aircraft-makers under the auspices of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The project is receiving Y1.1bn (Dollars 11m) in government subsidies this year for a feasibility study and aims to deliver the first aircraft in 2000. The YSX represents Japan's latest effort to establish a foothold in the international aerospace industry. The YSX consortium has been considering whether to build a 75-seater aircraft with European manufacturers or a 100-seater with Boeing and a Chinese government agency. Miti says that the feasibility study with the Europeans will go on, with a final decision expected next year, and left open the option of co-developing a 75-seater with European companies. However, Mitsubishi indicated that the move to focus on a 100-seat jet aircraft reflected stronger potential. For Boeing, the project would enable the US company to develop a smaller version of its 737 twin-jet aircraft, of 75 to 100 seats, so as to respond to potential demand of around 3,500 units over the next 15-20 years. Boeing and the Japanese aircraft industry are targeting growing demand for smaller jet aircraft in the fast-growing Asian markets.</p>

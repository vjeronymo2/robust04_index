			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: TRAVELERS DISCOVER ANEW THAT SEEING IS BELIEVING  </P> <P> As I have said, one of the rewards of travel is that it validates what one has  read of famous places. Today we see everything in movies or on TV, but there is  still no substitute for being there.  </P> <P> Except for excursions to Long Beach, Balboa and Mojave, I had never traveled  any distance from home until, at 18, I hitchhiked around the Southwest. I went  to Yuma, Phoenix, Albuquerque, Taos, Denver, Salt Lake City and Sacramento,  before coming home.  </P> <P> It wasn't until I got to Salt Lake City, and gazed upon the famous Mormon  Tabernacle, that I had that sense of verification. My books were right. There  was indeed such a place. I was also reassured by the Capitol in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Years later, as a scullion on the Matson Line, I sailed to Hawaii, American  Samoa, the Fijis, New Zealand and Australia. Perhaps my greatest thrill in  traveling was the early-morning sight of Diamond Head from the ship's bow. I  believed then in King Kamehameha, Capt. Cook, Bligh and Mr. Christian, Robert  Louis Stevenson and all the lore of the Pacific.  </P> <P> Since then I have stood inside the Parthenon, heard Big Ben toll from across  the street, stared up into the dome of St. Peter's, heard the singing of  bishops and the glory of Bach in Notre Dame and stood before the Great  Emancipator's statue in the Lincoln Memorial.  </P> <P> Each of these confrontations, as I say, reinforced the beliefs that I had had  about the world. If my books were right, if there was a Parthenon, then there  must be a Colosseum, a Sphinx, a Taj Mahal; and if those edifices indeed  existed, then there must have been a Caesar, a Napoleon, a Washington, a Madame  de Pompadour and a Cleopatra.  </P> <P> I am aware, however, that sometimes our first exposure to great monuments can  be a disappointment. Perhaps that is subjective. I am reminded of the two women  from Iowa who stood on the Palisades in Santa Monica and gazed out for the  first time at the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> One said, "Why, it's not so big."  </P> <P> "Speaking about having to see places to see if they really exist," writes John  Degatina, "I finally went to the Grand Canyon. It didn't look as real or  impressive as it did in Cinerama. . . . Maybe it's just too vast for me to  appreciate. . . ."  </P> <P> Curiously, Degatina says he has never been out of the United States, but he has  more feeling of reality about vacation spots around Paris than he does about  Malibu. He thinks this might be due in part to the French Impressionist  painters.  </P> <P> That may be true. When I saw "A Day in the Country," that marvelous exhibition  of French Impressionism at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, I felt as if I  were actually walking through the French countryside or flying over it in a  balloon.  </P> <P> Degatina makes a provocative point about our own landscape. "Come to think of  it, David Hockney's paintings look more like Southern California than the real  thing does. Can't help but wonder why."  </P> <P> I do not have the language, expertise or insight of an art critic, but I  suspect Hockney's paintings look more like Malibu than Malibu does because they  are Malibu intensified -- the vivid reds and greens, the sapphire pools, the  golden flesh, the sense of time stilled in an exquisitely sensual environment.  Also, they reflect a life too lush, opulent and sterile for ordinary mortals,  yet in his work it seems palpable. If we had entree to that private Malibu, we  would probably say, "Yes, there is such a place."  </P> <P> Oddly, I did not have a sense of America as reality until World War II, when I  was transferred from Los Angeles to Washington by train. I remember that when  we pulled into St. Louis, and I saw the name of some St. Louis brewery painted  on the side of a brick building, I finally realized that America -- the  heartland, the Mississippi River, Chicago, Toledo, Buffalo, New York City and  Washington itself -- in fact existed.  </P> <P> Despite the miracle of jet travel, many children today are doomed to live their  lives in the neighborhoods of their birth. Many Los Angeles children will never  see the Music Center. And most will never see a David Hockney painting.  </P> <P> We should make sure that, at least, they see the books that will tell them  those things exist.  </P></p>

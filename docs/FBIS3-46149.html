According to Liu Shipu, director of the Fire-Control Bureau  of the Ministry of Public Security, direct losses of the fires  in 1993 amounted to 1.12 billion yuan, the heaviest since the  founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.    Liu attributed the frequent outbreaks of the fires to the  increase of sub-standard construction projects and of  enterprises dealing with combustibles, management chaos in the  fire prevention sector in some departments, poor quality of  certain employees, as well as insufficient fire-fighting  equipment.    He said another major factor was that some enterprises and  localities raced for economic profits, at the expense of fire-  prevention.    A breakdown of the fire figures shows that 57 percent of the  206 large-scale fires broke out in the booming coastal areas and  10 percent in foreign-funded ventures.    Liu called on governments at all levels to implement  strictly  the laws and regulations regarding fire-prevention.    He also urged that more funds should be put into the  revamping of fire-control equipment and infrastructure.    In 1993, 36 Chinese fire-fighters lost their lives and more  than 2,000 were injured on duty.</p>

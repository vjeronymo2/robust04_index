			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (3): Old order in a new guise - Virginia Marsh assesses the political scene Like voters in other former east bloc countries, Hungarians returned former Communists to power in this summer's general elections, the second since the collapse of communism. Unlike many of their neighbours, however, Hungarians again elected a potentially strong and stable government. With 72 per cent of seats in parliament, the Socialist-Liberal coalition has a large enough majority to pass any legislation, including amendments to the constitution. The Socialists' control of 54 per cent of parliament means the party is likely to serve a full four-year term. The government, a coalition between the Hungarian Socialist party, the heir to the Communist party, and the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, the election runners-up, has pledged to use its mandate to complete Hungary's transition to a market economy. Its key objectives are to finish the process of privatisation, stabilise the country's heavily indebted economy and lay the basis for strong growth and integration into the European Union. Such ambitious aims, and the radical reforms which are required to achieve them, represent a big challenge for the HSP, a left-wing party elected, in part, to soften the pain of a transition which has already cost 1.4m jobs and caused living standards to plunge for many Hungarians. HSP leaders, however, recognise that the country's poor economic situation means there is little room for manoeuvre. Mr Gyula Horn, the prime minister, says: 'The basic fact is you cannot spend more money than you earn which is what our governments have been doing for decades . . . It is our bad luck that we are the ones who will have to stop that practice . . . Fundamental changes have to be made.' The challenge is to find a balance between the tough reforms needed to cure the economy and his party's desire to create 'a social market economy' which offers protection to the poorest members of society, Mr Horn says. Analysts say finding this balance and formulating coherent, consistent policies will be difficult for a coalition grouping socialists with free market liberals and for an HSP whose members span the political spectrum. The government's three months in office have already seen confrontations between different factions in the party. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the finance minister, who is considered more of a liberal than a socialist, was forced to water down his austere mid-year budget and accept a retro-active 8 per cent increase in pensions after objections from trade unions backed by cabinet members. The soft economic policy line can be partly explained by the government's unwillingness to take unpopular measures ahead of next month's nationwide local elections which will be its first major test since May's general elections. Opinion polls indicate little chance of a defeat for the Socialists. However, the Socialists and the Free Democrats will face a combined challenge from the main opposition parties. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, whose conservative-nationalist government suffered a crushing defeat in the general elections, its ally the Christian Democrats and the liberal Young Democrats (Fidesz) have, for the first time, agreed to field common candidates in some districts. Mr Viktor Orban, president of Fidesz, says it is essential the opposition works together to defeat the government parties in 1998. 'The real challenge is to prevent fragmentation of the opposition. By 1998 the government will be unpopular and people will want to get rid of it. They won't be able to if there is no credible alternative. We have to build up this alternative,' he says. Analysts say co-operation in the local elections could be the start of a realignment in the centre and centre-right parties to counter-balance the socialist-liberal alliance. This could lead Hungary towards a bipolar political structure rather than the present tripolar structure of socialists, liberals and conservatives. Mr Istvan Stumpf, director of the Budapest School of Politics, says: 'The elections are important for the future. The three opposition parties will see if they can gain more support standing together. If they get only 10 per cent of the vote, then moves to form a new centre-right coalition will collapse.'</p>

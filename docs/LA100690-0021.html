			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAME 1: STEWART VS. CLEMENS;  </P> <P> AL PLAYOFFS: PITCHING MATCHUP OVERSHADOWS PROWESS OF THE ATHLETICS AND RED SOX  AS THEIR SERIES OPENS.  </P> <P> There's more to the first game of the American League playoffs than Dave  Stewart pitching against Roger Clemens, the managers of the A's and Red Sox  politely maintained Friday. Stewart and Clemens will face opposing hitters, not  each other, tonight at Fenway Park, Oakland's Tony La Russa and Boston's Joe  Morgan said repeatedly.  </P> <P> They convinced no one. Without question, this series will take its tone from  the meeting between Stewart and Clemens. Stewart symbolizes the efficiency of  the defending World Series champion A's, and brilliant but sore-shouldered  Clemens symbolizes the Red Sox, talented and occasionally accursed, whether by  injury or fate.  </P> <P> The right-handers ranked among the American League's top 10 in victories,  earned-run average, strikeouts, innings pitched and complete games during the  regular season. Stewart, 22-11 in his fourth consecutive 20-win season, edged  Clemens (21-6) in victories, but Clemens' 1.93 earned-run average was the  league's best and stingier than Stewart's 2.56. Stewart has six consecutive  victories in matchups against Clemens since 1986, including three this season.  A loss to Stewart could be devastating to the Red Sox, who must face 27-game  winner Bob Welch in Game 2 Sunday.  </P> <P> "It should eliminate arguments," Stewart said of beating Clemens. "We had a  saying in the neighborhood: If you beat the best, you are the best. If I was  back in the neighborhood, I guess I could say I was the best."  </P> <P> This game will be played in the Red Sox's neighborhood, where during the 1988  playoffs Stewart heard racial slurs from fans while he warmed up in the A's  bullpen. That has fueled an intensity that never seems to wane.  </P> <P> "I was real disappointed because I had a real positive attitude about the city  and the fans," Stewart said. "I don't want to (forget the incident). I've  chosen to feed on it because it's proven to be a motivational factor to me."  </P> <P> Despite Clemens' record against Stewart, and Stewart's 4-0 record and 1.65 ERA  against Boston this season, neither La Russa nor Morgan considered opening with  another pitcher.  </P> <P> "You do whatever's best for your club. Everybody expects (Stewart) to start,  including Bobby Welch," La Russa said.  </P> <P> Clemens will have six days of rest since his six shutout innings against the  Toronto Blue Jays last Saturday in his first appearance since shoulder  inflammation idled him for five weeks.  </P> <P> "Clemens is our big guy. We've got to have it that way." Morgan said. "We've  certainly had many chances against Stewart. We've had men on countless times,  and he keeps getting out of it. He's a challenging-type pitcher. When he gets  in trouble, he reaches back for something extra."  </P> <P> Clemens did not appear at a news conference Friday. Boston pitching coach Bill  Fischer said Clemens "felt fine and is ready to pitch. After last Saturday, the  biggest thing was that his back was a little stiff. He threw as great as he  ever did last Saturday."  </P> <P> While acknowledging Stewart's ability, the Red Sox remain optimistic about  defeating him and the A's on the strength of a solid offense. Their .272  batting average was 18 points higher than Oakland's, and their slugging and  on-base percentages were slightly higher.  </P> <P> "I think we feel like we can beat everybody. When we're hitting like we're  capable of hitting and we get good pitching, we can win," said left fielder  Mike Greenwell, Boston's top hitter from Sept. 1 until the end of the season  with a .423 average.  </P> <P> "They have an awesome pitching staff. But like any great pitcher, you've got to  get to Stewart early. The key for us tonight is to score some runs early and  let Roger do his thing."  </P> <P> The A's thing seems to be everything. From Rickey Henderson, the runner-up in  the AL batting race; to Willie McGee, the NL batting champion; to Jose Canseco,  who hit 37 home runs; and Mark McGwire, who drove in 108 runs, there's no letup  in speed, power, production and pitching. Dennis Eckersley had 48 saves in 50  opportunities -- four more saves than the entire Red Sox bullpen. The A's staff  ERA of 3.18 was also the league's best.  </P> <P> "Speed might be a big factor," said Henderson, who hit .400 and stole a  playoff-record eight bases last year in Oakland's five-game victory over  Toronto. Those feats earned him most valuable player honors in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "We've got a lot of speed, and if we get on, we're going to use it," added  Henderson, who was five for 16 against the Red Sox this season with three home  runs, nine RBIs and three stolen bases.  </P> <P> Stewart probably will pitch again in Game 4 Wednesday in Oakland and could come  back in a seventh game, if needed; Clemens' availability for a fourth game is  doubtful because of his shoulder problems. The later in the series, the better  Stewart is likely to perform.  </P> <P> "Where a lot of guys get into a game of big significance and put additional  pressure on themselves and get tight and nervous and aren't able to execute,  games like that don't faze Dave Stewart," Oakland pitching coach Dave Duncan  said.  </P> <P> The desire to win their third consecutive AL championship should be motivation  enough for the A's to avoid becoming overconfident. "If you don't handle it  right, being the favorite could be a problem," La Russa said. "We put enough  pressure on ourselves all along, (so) it's not going to be something new."  </P></p>

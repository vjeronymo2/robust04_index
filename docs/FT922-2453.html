			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / TML to accept Eurotunnel paper CONTRACTORS building the Channel tunnel said yesterday they would be prepared to accept shares or similar certificates as part settlement of claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn they are seeking from Eurotunnel, the project's owner. Transmanche Link (TML), a consortium of five British and five French construction companies, is claiming additional payments of about Pounds 800m at 1985 prices to cover the increased cost of fitting out the rail tunnels and building two passenger terminals at Folkestone, Kent and Sangatte, northern France. The total claims made by TML rise to more than Pounds 1bn at 1985 prices if contractors' demands for additional payments for other parts of the project are included. Talks between TML and Eurotunnel aimed at trying to resolve the issue resumed last autumn. The negotiations have included the possibility that contractors might accept some form of Eurotunnel paper in part settlement of their claims. TML, in a statement signed by all 10 construction companies said last night that 'in order to help Eurotunnel' it would be 'prepared to accept payment of a limited part of the money owing to them'. Eurotunnel stressed that TML's claims still had to be substantiated and said that it 'was not envisaging a substantial issue to TML'. Any issue would have to be submitted to shareholders for prior approval. The group previously has said that any issue would form less than 10 per cent of the group's equity. It is more likely however that Eurotunnel would want to issue some form of convertible loan stock. Eurotunnel, because it is in technical breach of its loan covenants, has been forced to seek a waiver from its banks to allow it to draw down further funds to enable construction to continue. The breach has been caused by the increased cost of building the project, which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn, and lower revenues expected in the first year of operation due to a delay in receiving sufficient rolling stock to operate a full service. The banks, in return for granting a waiver, have been putting pressure on Eurotunnel and TML to reach an early agreement on their claims. Both sides say many details remain before agreement can be reached. Lex, Page 22</p>

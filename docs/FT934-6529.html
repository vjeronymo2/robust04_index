			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Indian steel group ahead 18% after six months The Steel Authority of India (Sail), the country's largest steel producer, lifted net profit 18 per cent to Rs630m (Dollars 20m) for the six months to the end of September due to increased sales and cost-cutting. Sail's performance contrasts sharply with that of Tata Iron and Steel, the country's second largest steelmaker, which recently reported a sharp fall in profit. Sail, a state-controlled enterprise in which the government has sold a 10.52 per cent stake to private shareholders, stands out as among the most efficient of India's large state-owned industrial enterprises. Its managers have taken advantages of the changes brought about by the liberalisation of India's economy in the past two years, whereas Tata Steel's financial performance has suffered from management upheavals and from the cost of a large modernisation programme. Sail's turnover in the period rose 12 per cent to Rs50.63bn. Production of steel rose 6 per cent to 4m tonnes in the half-year. Mr M. R. R. Nair, chairman, said the product mix had been changed to suit market conditions. The improved performance came in spite of the stagnation in the market, and was attributed by Mr Nair to 'all-round improvement in productivity and reduction in costs. The energy consumption per tonne of steel produced has been brought down significantly.' Exports rose almost fourfold to Rs3.21bn.</p>

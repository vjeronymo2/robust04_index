			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Early solution unlikely over late payment  -Plans to tackle overdue debts Fifteen years after the Law Commission first called for a statutory right to interest payable on overdue corporate debts, the government has launched a fresh debate on how best to tackle one of business's biggest headaches. It promises to be a tough argument to resolve. With the economy emerging from recession and demands on working capital set to rise, there is a fresh urgency behind government efforts to find a solution. Most companies and every business organisation acknowledge the severity of an overdue payment problem that is now endemic in the UK and across most of Europe. It can be immensely time-consuming, plays havoc with cashflow and each year it kills off countless smaller enterprises. The UK is now almost alone in Europe in not having resorted to legislation to try to ease the problem. But invoking the law in other countries of the European Union appears to have had minimal impact, and there is disagreement in the UK on whether to continue to use education and persuasion or to start using a big stick. This week's post-Budget consultative document says ministers are 'prepared to give positive consideration to the introduction of legislation'. But when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, met Tory backbenchers in the Commons after Tuesday's Budget, they were left in no doubt that deep reservations persist within the parliamentary party about the value of legislation. Wide differences also exist in the business community. The Forum for Private Business is demanding a legal right to punitive interest to help reduce what it says has become an average payment time of 81 days. But Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of 3i, the venture capital group, believes a right to interest on late payment would simply institutionalise a bad habit. 'I strongly believe we need a suitable code of conduct and that central and local government must take a lead in offering a good example on prompt payment to everyone else,' he said. Critics of statutory interest say it would simply lead to big customers imposing longer credit periods and coercing suppliers into waiving the right to interest, while smaller businesses could find themselves with double interest burdens - for borrowing on working capital and payments on overdue invoices. Ministers say they have already tried to set an example, requiring government departments to monitor payment performance and publish the results. Prime contractors of government also have to commit themselves to paying subcontractors on time and, from this week, all government contracts will normally nominate a 30-day payment period. The consultation paper raises other options, including a maximum statutory credit period, an idea backed by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. But ministers dismiss the idea as neither desirable nor practicable. The document also raises the possibility of a new British Standard on prompt payment and says preliminary talks held between government officials and outside groups have raised no objections. Companies would have a choice of whether or not to adopt the standard. It would, however, have to be very widely adopted to be effective, and the ultimate threat of withdrawal of British Standard certification might prove less than intimidating to companies for which paying late has become a way of life.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Pay review body considers options ONE OF the main independent review bodies for public-sector pay is still considering whether it is worthwhile preparing the annual report on its sector since being stripped of its ability to recommend pay rises. The doctors' and dentists' review body, like four of the five review bodies, has been asked not to make a recommendation this year. The teachers's pay review body was set up by statute and is obliged to make a recommendation, which the government can ignore. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in his Autumn Statement that public-sector pay settlements for next year would be restricted to a maximum of 1.5 per cent. He asked the review bodies to amend their remits for the coming year and to make no recommendations about overall levels of pay, fees or allowances for April 1 1993. The doctors' and dentists' review body was asked to report on 'miscellaneous matters' including general practitioners' fee scales and merit awards for consultants. The review body at first said that such a report would be 'inappropriate'. It is understood that some members felt the brief was a waste of time and could be handled by the Department of Health. But after correspondence with the government it has been reconsidering its response and will make a final decision on Wednesday. The other review bodies have told the government they are prepared to accept restricted briefs. None of the bodies has agreed on the final content of their reports. That covering nurses and midwives, which was asked whether there should be a flat rate or differentials within the 1.5 per cent pay limit, is still considering whether it should look at recruitment and retention.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HESTON PREFERS THE BIG SCREEN  </P> <P> Charlton Heston says he hates to see epics such as "Ben-Hur" relegated to  videotape and television screens.  </P> <P> "Any film originally made for theaters suffers a great deal in the transfer to  videotape," he said Monday.  </P> <P> "When someone says, 'Oh, I just got a video of "The Ten Commandments" or of  "Ben-Hur," for my birthday,' I have to tell them, 'Sorry, but you haven't seen  it.' "  </P> <P> Heston was in Detroit to mark the big-screen reopening of his 1959 movie  "Ben-Hur" at the Fox Theater.  </P> <P> "Here (at a theater), the moving-image arts are seen as they are meant to be  seen, in all their glory."  </P> <P> Heston, 64, won an Academy Award for his role as Judah Ben-Hur. The film, about  Roman rivalries in Jesus' day, is known for an 11-minute chariot race that  Heston says remains the greatest action sequence ever filmed.  </P></p>

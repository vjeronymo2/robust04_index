			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Ferruzzi family goes to court: Private action against Mediobanca claims documents were falsified The Ferruzzi family has filed a private action against Medio-banca, the Milan merchant bank, for allegedly falsifying documents related to the June 1993 rescue of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire. The action marks one further stage in an increasingly bitter battle between the Ferruzzi family and Mediobanca, which headed the pool of banks that mounted the Ferruzzi-Montedison rescue. It runs in parallel with investigations being conducted by Ravenna magistrates into events surrounding the collapse of the group that have already involved Mediobanca and four other Italian banks. The suit is in the name of Arturo Ferruzzi, the eldest son of the group's founder, and his two sisters, Franca and Alessandra, but not Idina, the wife of the late Raul Gardini, the one-time head of the empire. It alleges that Mediobanca was party to the backdating of documents interpreting the June 4 rescue agreement. Agreement on the inter-pretation was finalised between the family members at various times from July 20 to July 29. The suit claims the agreement was back-dated to June 29. The dates are important because, during June, approval was given for the increase in capital of Fondiaria, the Florence-based insurance company - an increase that removed it from Ferruzzi control, previously exercised through Gaic, a finance group. Until now the Ferruzzi family has contented itself with attacking Mediobanca for allegedly knowing about unpublished losses of L430bn (Pounds 177m) and taking advantage of the group's L30,000bn (Pounds 12.4bn) debts to 'expropriate' the best assets. Ravenna magi-strates are also investigating all these allegations. Last Friday they advised Mr Roberto Dunatov, the head of the Bologna office of accountants Price Waterhouse, that he was under investigation for allegedly falsifying the Ferruzzi accounts. The magistrates alleged that Mr Dunatov was aware of irregularities in the group's accounts including the parallel system of accounts operated out of Switzerland on behalf of Ferruzzi by Mr Pino Berlini. There already two claims totalling L1650bn against Price for damages in relation to the Ferruzzi-Montedison accounts brought by the present administrators.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: TRAFFIC SIGNALS NEVER PLEASE ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME  </P> <P> Perhaps it's the surge of post-Labor Day traffic or the jump in prices at the  gas pump, but there has been much mail lately from Orange County motorists  irked by unsynchronized traffic signals and all the problems they cause --  wasted time at red lights, smog from idling cars, increased gas consumption.  </P> <P> Here are three such offerings: Tim Pickwell of Newport Beach writes about his  disdain for Jamboree Road's fickle traffic lights, while Andres Sullivan pans  the signals in Irvine. Finally, we cap today's column with words of wisdom from  Ed Vanwetswinkle of Costa Mesa, who would like to see a potential solution  imported straight from Deutschland.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> Jamboree Road between East Coast Highway and the San Diego Freeway is a major  artery, yet it seems none of the traffic lights along this stretch are timed or  coordinated.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon to hit a dozen red lights while traveling this relatively  short distance. The posted speed limit is 50 m.p.h., but just getting into  third gear is a major victory.  </P> <P> Most annoying, however, is to move along with the rush-hour traffic and be  forced to stop when a lone car approaches an insignificant intersection (such  as Birch Street, Bison Avenue or one of the several lights at parking lots). It  is neither efficient nor environmentally sound to have 50 cars in either  direction (yes, I've counted) come to a stop, idle, sit and wait, burn gas,  pollute the air and then gear up again just so they can travel the next 100  yards to once again be stopped by a single car coming up to cross an  intersection.  </P> <P> Who is responsible for timing the lights on major surface streets like  Jamboree? Why don't they require a longer waiting period for cars crossing  Jamboree? Why do several office-building parking lots justify having traffic  lights? Are there any plans to time the lights on Jamboree? What can I and  other commuters do to help convince someone that this is necessary?  </P> <P> Tim Pickwell  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> The city of Irvine seems to have adjusted its traffic lights in such a manner  that you get one red light after another when cruising down any given street.  </P> <P> It is my understanding that for years most traffic-light systems were set so  that a vehicle traveling at the posted speed limit would hit green lights. This  has the obvious advantages of allowing traffic to flow and reducing fuel  consumption and exhaust emissions while allowing all those driving to make more  productive use of their time.  </P> <P> Irvine being such a "planned" community, it is surprising to find such  anachronistic traffic controls.  </P> <P> Andres Sullivan  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> Let's start with the general and get to the specific.  </P> <P> Most traffic signals in Orange County are computerized, gleaning information  from wire "loops" embedded in the pavement that can detect cars passing by.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, such signals can never please all of the people all of the time.  Traffic engineers try for a happy medium between forcing motorists on cross  streets to sit forever and interrupting the flow on a heavily traveled arterial  road. It's never perfect -- even in ultra-planned Irvine -- and can be further  complicated if the equipment breaks down or the programming doesn't quite allow  cars on a major street to get through several lights in sequence.  </P> <P> Jamboree Road is a perfect example. At some times of the day, a motorist can,  believe it or not, travel from the coast to the San Diego Freeway nearly  unimpeded by red lights. But such instances are the exception rather than the  rule.  </P> <P> Eager to improve the situation, the city of Newport Beach has hired a  consultant to come up with ways to improve Jamboree's performance.  </P> <P> "We want to try for a balance that gives the preference to the heavy traffic  along Jamboree but doesn't become unreasonable for people waiting at the cross  streets," said Richard Edmonston, Newport Beach traffic engineer.  </P> <P> But he noted that the majority of gripes about Jamboree Road come from  irritated motorists who have sat for what seemed an eternity at cross streets.  </P> <P> During the morning and evening rush hours, the Jamboree traffic signals are  operated by a computer at Newport Beach City Hall, Edmonston said. While this  computer generally does a reasonably good job of keeping traffic flowing  through green lights, the rolling topography of the roadway can cause a queue  of cars to stretch out, he said. Some stragglers, as a result, may miss a  signal or two.  </P> <P> At other times of the day and night, the signals operate independently. If  there's no one at a cross street, a motorist on Jamboree Road will typically  get a green light. But even a lone car can, as Tim Pickwell points out, make a  line of motorists come grinding to a halt.  </P> <P> Some office buildings along Jamboree Road in Irvine warrant signals chiefly  because of the number of cars they host. The heavy traffic from such buildings  could pose a hazard if it wasn't regulated by a signal, transportation experts  say.  </P> <P> While these transportation experts tinker with the existing system, some Orange  County residents see a need for a more foreign approach. Consider the following  letter:  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> In some European countries, specifically West Germany, a traffic system called  Gruenewelle, or "Green Wave," has been used in an effort to reduce traffic  congestion. The purpose of the Green Wave system is to keep traffic flowing at  predetermined speeds on major streets despite the presence of numerous traffic  signals, major intersections and a heavy volume of traffic.  </P> <P> For example, a street like Brookhurst Avenue would display a sign indicating a  "Green Wave at 45 m.p.h." All vehicles traveling at 45 m.p.h. on the street  would be able to move through the signal lights without ever stopping for a red  light. Vehicles exceeding or traveling slower than the Green Wave speed would  be caught at red lights.  </P> <P> The benefits would be cutting down on pollution, gas consumption, freeway  traffic, time and aggravation.  </P> <P> Major streets could be targeted as Green Wave streets. People would tend to use  these streets more often, thereby reducing freeway stop-and-go traffic.  </P> <P> The cost would be far less than that of adding new lanes to existing freeways  or building new ones.  </P> <P> Ed Vanwetswinkle  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> The Green Wave may sound a bit like the title of a 1950s monster movie, but it  seems a worthy idea.  </P> <P> A similar approach was used in some U.S. cities in decades past. I can remember  driving with my parents years ago through San Francisco's Sunset District and  seeing signs advising a motorist that the signals were timed to 35 m.p.h. The  system seemed to work pretty efficiently.  </P> <P> Most cities, however, dropped that practice because of legal problems.  Motorists trying to time the signals would sometimes squirt into an  intersection before the red light had turned to green. If such scenarios were  repeated, the Green Wave could truly turn into a horror flick.  </P> <P>  Street Smart appears Mondays in the Orange County section of The Times.

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> UAL Signs Buyout Deal: UAL Corp. signed an agreement to be bought for $4.4  billion by a group of its unions, but analysts remain skeptical that the  largest-ever U.S. employee-led buyout will succeed. The stock has languished  far below the $201-a-share of the employee group's bid, reflecting the  widespread doubts. On Tuesday, it finished up 25 cents to $161.25 on the NYSE.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has sent a  letter to the residents of the Republic of Crimea. It says in  part: Please accept my sincere greetings in connection with the  glorious date of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of  Crimea from the German fascist invaders. The defense and  liberation of Crimea is one of the brightest pages in the war,  an example of the heroism and courage shown by people defending  their native land.    We now have to live through a difficult time. The changes  our society needs are taking place with great difficulty. But,  the latter says, we have to go down the path of change and I  hope we will manage to go down it, preserving what people have  that is most precious -- accord, mutual understanding, friendly  relations between one another.</p>

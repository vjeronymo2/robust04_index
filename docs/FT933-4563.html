			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Avonside begins to improve PROFITS of Avonside, the building services and housebuilding group, fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.2m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. However, the directors said the increased activity experienced in the opening quarter had continued through the first half. Explaining the downturn they noted that an extremely low level of housing reservations in the final quarter of 1992 had translated into a low level of sales completions in the first quarter of 1993. Operating profits for that period fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 500,000, but for the second quarter improved from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.8m. Sales completions of 31 units in the first quarter compared with 87 in the second quarter. In total, sales for the half year were down by seven units to 118. The directors believed that the worst of the recession in the housing market was now coming to an end and that the sales upturn in both segments of the group in the second quarter would be sustained during the rest of the year. First half turnover expanded from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 28.5m. Acquisitions added Pounds 832,000 to turnover and Pounds 126,000 to profits. Earnings fell to 3.41p (4.37p) but the interim dividend is being lifted to 1.9p (1.8p).</p>

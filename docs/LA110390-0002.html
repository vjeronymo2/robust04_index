			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUBERNATORIAL CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> I read the columns by Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein (Commentary, Oct. 23) on  what each intends to do about education in California, and commend them both  for their serious commitment to early childhood education. Just teaching the  little ones how to speak English well will raise their chances of absorbing  what is being taught in the classroom later on.  </P> <P> However, I was shocked that neither of them mentioned teacher quality, the most  important factor in giving children a good education. If money is to be set  aside for education, it should go into searches among high school students for  good teaching material (as they search for good athletic material), and  teaching scholarships at least commensurate with athletic scholarships;  enhancing teaching as a sought-after career, and providing salaries for  teachers to teach what they know best and are happiest doing.  </P> <P> Good teachers need to be found and nurtured. Both Feinstein and Wilson urged  funds for building new schools. Children do not need new buildings; in many  cases, old ones can be renovated. Buildings we have aplenty, but good teachers  are diamonds waiting to be polished.  </P> <P> GLORIA PARRY WALTER  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

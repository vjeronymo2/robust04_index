			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Accountants escape criticism NO AUDITORS to any of the companies reprimanded so far by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new UK watchdog on company accounts, is likely to be criticised by their professional regulatory body, it has emerged. But tougher regulations introduced last October mean that the audit of accounts covering year-ends since that time are expected to be treated more strictly in future. The investigations committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has decided not to take action against Pannell Kerr Forster, auditor to Williams Holdings, the first company criticised by the review panel. Pannell gave Williams an unqualified audit report on the 1991 accounts, although the company was criticised by the review panel for breaching SSAP 6, the standard on extraordinary items. Although the review panel has the power to take action against companies, discipline of their auditors is left to the accountancy professional bodies. Firms providing unqualified audit reports are automatically referred when there is a critical review panel finding. In a recent letter to Pannell, the institute said there had been a 'prima facie' technical breach of accounting standards in Williams' accounts, but added that the figures were not misleading and it would therefore take no action against the firm for not qualifying the accounts. A senior institute official said there had been no scope to do anything more under the regulations at the time the accounts were approved.</p>

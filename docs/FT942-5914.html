			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Arts: Turkey feathers to tickle our fantasies - Cinema THE SECRET RAPTURE (15)Howard Davies NO ESCAPE (15) Martin Campbell DANGEROUS GAME (18)Abel Ferrara INTERSECTION (15) Mark Rydell There is a funny joke in The Secret Rapture about the difference between erotic and perverted sex. In the first, gurgles raconteur Joanne Whalley-Kilmer to a trio of tired business colleagues in a bar, you use a feather. In the second you use the whole chicken. Hilarity all around. Then seconds later Miss W-K is lunging across the table with a steak knife, trying to stab First Businessman. It is that kind of film. Gestures and apocalypses come from nowhere. David Hare's stage play was an odd, feathery thing. Addressing matters such as grace, faith and the quality of life, it made attractive tickling motions in the direction of our consciences. The film, by contrast, is a turkey, a whole turkey and a plucked turkey. And since this turkeyisation process has happened to Hare before - when Plenty moved from play to film, and when Paris By Night and Strapless trailed clouds of staginess on to the screen - we should ask: What is going wrong? The Secret Rapture has one of those plots, full of designer metaphor, that one accepts while sitting in the hothouse of a theatre. An old bookseller has died, leaving his two daughters to cope with the dear old farmhouse and the deadly young widow: Catherine (Miss W-K), a sort of Hell's Angel on heels; younger daughter Isobel (Juliet Stevenson), good and kind, runs a small graphic design shop; older daughter Marion (Penelope Wilton), more venal, is first caught trying to reclaim a ring from dead Dad's bedside. But there is one thing that plays can get away with and films cannot. Circumstantial vagueness. We do not expect the stage to rotate 45 degrees towards us, exposing the designs on top of Isobel's work-tables. But in a movie we ask, 'What are these people designing?', apart from the single lurid bookjacket being worked over by Isobel's partner-boyfriend (Neil Pearson). So when well-heeled Marion buys into the firm and tries to expand it with harpy Catherine's help, we are meant to cry 'Tsk] Tsk] Do not sell out, Isobel'; but instead we feel, 'What a good idea.' Perhaps the firm will now take on a graspable identity. More vagueness: Penelope Wilton's Marion, who clarion-announced herself as a Tory minister in the play, here seems vocationally less specific. And her husband, a lay preacher on stage full of chortlesome pieties, is played by Alan Howard in the movie as an odd, mute bird with a crick in his neck and few lines of dialogue. Director Howard Davies pushes bits of style at Hare's screenplay as if hoping that they will peck it into life. A moment of emotion produces a tilted angle. A love scene stripes two bodies with Venetian-blind shadows. But when a bird is dead, as Monty Python proved, no amount of shock treatment can help. Plucked of its wit and thrust into the 'real' world, the moral schematic of Hare's play seems trite and sanctimonious. Hold on to that cottage industry. Hug that parental farmhouse (shades, nay swathes, of Howards End). And cherish the mentally distressed, who might be well-intentioned (Catherine), while shunning the mercantile (Marion), who cannot ever be. Nothing is more dopily conservative than some writers with left-wing sympathies. People often ask why British films cannot get their act together. The reason is that modern British cinema, like so much modern British life, is one long apology pro sua vita. 'We have never had it so bad.' And (corollary) 'we shall never have it so good again', unless, quoth Hare, we put a moratorium on all that might expand people's lives, ambitions and imaginations and thereby threaten tight little, green little England. Now a much-needed change of scene. 'The nearest aspirin is 2,000 miles away,' says the doctor (Ian McNiece) on the subtropical island in No Escape. We have all known holiday spots like this, but 'Absolom' is an atoll of a different aspect. Even though the jokey convicts' leader (Stuart Wilson) says 'Welcome to vacation paradise' to the newly arrived hero (Ray Liotta) - and Liotta, picking up the mood, replies 'Hope you take plastic' - this is a futuristic penal colony (year 2022) where torture, riot and sudden death are rife. Can Liotta, sent here after threatening a previous warden with an electric cattle-prod, escape - or at least find a more pleasant part of the island? He does the latter, falling down a mile-high cliff into a river from which the Good Convicts, led by white-haired father figure Lance Henriksen, rescue him. But will Wilson pursue and avenge? The film is a re-tread of Papillon with camp dialogue, wild scenery and costumes that look as if they were designed by Mad Max's aunt. Present is a platoon of British actors, led by Wilson and McNiece, playing the nasties and causing us to ask: What is it with Hollywood and the British? Can America not get one of its own kind to curl a lip, quiver a nostril and deliver a well-egged epigram? Perhaps not. Wilson's jokes steal the movie. Abel Ferrara's Dangerous Game used to be called Snake Eyes. But like last week's Hostile Hostages (US title The Ref) it has been re-baptised for Britain by the banal minds who do these things. No title, though, could do justice to this transportingly batty film about film-making from the writer-director of Driller Killer and Bad Lieutenant. An earnest Madonna and a more earnest James Russo act out a tale of marital hell before the cameras of fictive filmer Harvey Keitel. Whose are the snake eyes? Perhaps Madonna's; but it is mostly too dark to tell on this soundstage within a soundstage. Or maybe they are Keitel's, who has long, writhing Medusa locks to match. The film replays the contest between vice and virtue that we saw in Lieutenant: only with Madonna as the wife who is getting religion and Russo as the man burning out on sex and drugs. No one seems more obsessional, though, than the man behind the camera, OD-ing on celluloid and Stanislavski-babble. Like any genius director Keitel wants more. 'Smell her, Frank, smell her'; 'Dig down into hell, Frank'; 'Piss on the floor'. The audience, on the other hand, wants less. But it has an eerie feeling that this is what life is like on a Ferrara set, and we might as well have the ugly truth while it is offered. Intersection also comes from the world's psychodrama storage-room. Richard Gere takes the Michel Piccoli role in this Hollywood defrosting of the 1970 French film Les Choses De La Vie. Mark Rydell (The Rose) replaces Claude Sautet in the director's chair, blowing warm air all over the tale of a man whose life is torn between two women and whose mind replays that life, in flashbacks, just as his car is about to be torn between two trucks. Gere's past career as a Vancouver-based architect flashes before him. His affair with redheaded Lolita Davidovich flashes before him. And the blonde, curvaceous Sharon Stone flashes before him - but this is not Basic Instinct. Stone, playing Mrs Gere, gets to expose nothing lower than a quivering chin and a pair of Joan Crawford cheekbones. The film is minor but enjoyable.</p>

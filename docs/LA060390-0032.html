			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> A PLO TRICK SHORES UP SHAMIR'S WEB;  </P> <P> WE COULD BE ENSNARED BY MAKING HIS ENEMIES OUR ENEMIES.  </P> <P> Were it not for alert Israeli forces, we would likely have seen, live on CNN,  slaughtered sunbathers, women and children, being carried off the beaches of  Tel Aviv as Israeli troops fought it out with suicide squads.  </P> <P> Five speedboats, carrying 16 guerrillas armed with rockets and machine guns,  were reportedly dropped off a Libyan "mother ship," 120 miles at sea. The  guerrillas were picked up on radar 20 miles off the coast, and intercepted.  Four were killed, 12 captured. The Palestine Liberation Front, a small, radical  faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, claimed responsibility.  </P> <P> But, at whom was this attack aimed, besides Jews?  </P> <P> One target, surely, was Yasser Arafat. Should he denounce it, only days after  Israel brutally crushed a resurgent intifada, Arafat would appear both an  appeaser and a weak leader unable to control his own PLO. Should he remain  silent, the suggestion is that he approves; if he approves, Washington stops  doing business with him. Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens was quick to  exploit Arafat's vulnerability: "An event like this comes along . . . and  proves something that we have been claiming all along . . . . The United States  is holding talks with the PLO based on the assumption that the PLO has stopped  engaging in terror."  </P> <P> A second target was the moderate Arabs. A massacre would have brought Israeli  retaliation (it still might), raising war fever, rallying Arab support for  hawks like Iraq's Saddam Hussein, drowning out and isolating men like Egypt's  President Hosni Mubarak.  </P> <P> A third target was the peace party in Israel. Had a massacre occurred, it would  have reduced to silence those Israeli voices who urge negotiation.  </P> <P> Who benefits? First, extreme elements of the PLO who despise Arafat for dealing  with the Americans, and want to cut his U.S. connection before it produces a  Palestinian state on the West Bank that recognizes Israel and puts an end to  their dream of liquidating "the Zionist entity."  </P> <P> Among other beneficiaries is Yitzhak Shamir, whose party seized upon it as  proof that its hard line against self-determination for the Palestinian people  is the only position consistent with the safety of the Israeli people. Who can  argue with him now?  </P> <P> The answer is: We can and we must, if we do not wish to be led down a road at  the end of which lies a Middle East war that would be a disaster for U.S.  interests in the Arab world.  </P> <P> For Shamir, the attack, like the latest Jerusalem bombing, is a godsend, making  ancient history of his crackdown that left a dozen Palestinians dead and 900  wounded. But the Palestinian question must not be put on a back burner. If it  is, sooner or later, the burner will explode.  </P> <P> Peace between Israel and the Arab states can never come until the core quarrel  is addressed, a quarrel that former Foreign Minister Abba Eban describes thus:  "Our land is a land of two histories, two tongues, two faiths, two national  dreams, two identities. Duality is written so sharply into the very texture of  the land that any unitary solution subjecting one nationalism to domination by  the other is bound to be explosive and morally fragile . . . sovereignty and  territory must be shared by two groups, not monopolized by one."  </P> <P> What Eban is saying, what retired Israeli officers are saying, what a million  Israelis have voted for, is "land for peace," a homeland on the West Bank and  Gaza for Palestinians, in return for guarantees that land not be used as a base  camp to attack Israel.  </P> <P> Utopian? Perhaps. But repression of the Palestinians, brought to the Arab world  on weekly television, is a formula for endless hatred. There is no guarantee  that a Palestinian homeland will bring permanent peace; but, if there is no  homeland, permanent war is guaranteed.  </P> <P> Yitzhak Shamir, Eban writes, is a "sincere territorialist." He "opposed the  Egyptian-Israeli treaty, the withdrawal from Lebanon, the Hussein-Peres  agreement for a Jordanian-Palestinian solution, former U.S. Secretary of State  George Shultz's friendly peace plan and even the renunciation of the  inconsequential hotel on Egyptian soil in Taba." I.e., his interests are not  our interests.  </P> <P> After Suez in 1956, Great Britain extricated itself from the Middle East; but,  after the '67 war, the United States decided to grab the tar baby. What vital  interest of ours was at risk, in this terrible quarrel, is yet difficult to  see. But, even if we have commitments we cannot walk away from, we must not  give Yitzhak Shamir a blank check, to make his enemies our enemies. For they  are legion.  </P></p>

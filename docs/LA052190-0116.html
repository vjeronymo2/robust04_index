			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GIRL, 10, SMELLED SMOKE, MAY HAVE SAVED LIVES OF 5 IN FAMILY  </P> <P> A 10-year-old girl who awoke today to the smell of smoke in her Panorama City  home helped alert and evacuate her family and was being credited by the Los  Angeles Fire Department with possibly saving their lives.  </P> <P> Raquel Guerrero said her spot on the top bed of a set of bunk beds may have  allowed her to smell smoke before anyone else in the house in the 14100 block  of Terra Bella Street.  </P> <P> She jumped down after waking about 1 a.m. and woke her 15-year-old brother,  Romie, who was on the bottom bunk.  </P> <P> The two children then went through the smoke-filled house and woke their  elderly grandparents and an uncle. Everyone escaped without injury.  </P> <P> "I just tried to get everybody out as fast as we could," Raquel said after the  fire was out.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief Robert Teachenor said the fire started in the bedroom of the  girl's mother, Rosina Robinson, when a votive candle left unattended burned  down. Robinson was at work at the time of the fire.  </P> <P> After firefighters arrived, they searched the house and saved five family pets  -- a dog and four kittens, Teachenor said.  </P> <P> Damage to the house was estimated at about $50,000.  </P></p>

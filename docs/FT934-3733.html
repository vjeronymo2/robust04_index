			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / W German economy grows 0.5% The west German economy grew by a real 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, compared with the previous three months, confirming signs of stabilisation after the sharpest downturn since the second world war. Latest federal figures show a positive growth rate for the past two quarters  -there was a similar 0.5 per cent rise in the second quarter  - although overall economic activity remains below 1992 levels. The statistics were published as wage negotiations opened for Germany's 4m-strong engineering workers, with a clear stand-off between employers' demand for a pay freeze and the IG Metall union's goal of 5.5-6 per cent. However, the union is under great pressure to agree a moderate settlement as unemployment rises steadily - by 489,000 in the past year - in spite of indications that the economic slump has bottomed out. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, greeted the latest gross domestic product statistics as confirmation that the economy is gradually recovering. Private sector economists remain more cautious, while accepting that the figures indicate a clear stabilisation. 'It is certainly too early to say this is the beginning of an upswing, but it does show that the worst is behind us,' said Mr Peter Pietsch, chief economist at Commerzbank. The main factors behind the stabilisation are growth of private consumer spending, and continued expansion in the construction sector. The former was up 0.3 per cent on the same quarter in 1992, and building activity 1.8 per cent. Mr Rexrodt pointed out that comparing the third quarter with the previous three months, all elements of domestic demand, with the exception of public sector consumption, had picked up. This included investment in equipment, which had slumped by almost 20 per cent over the five previous quarters. Mr Pietsch warned that January 1 would see the introduction of a whole range of new burdens affecting both consumer spending and industrial costs, among them higher oil taxation, pensions contributions, car insurance premiums, and nursing care insurance, totalling an annual DM40bn (Pounds 15.8bn). 'All those burdens will hold back recovery,' he said. 'Private consumption has been surprisingly resilient during the downturn compared with previous recessions. Consumers are attempting to maintain their spending at the expense of saving. But next year all these extra burdens will affect consumer spending.' The economic squeeze on labour and industry will dominate the engineering industry negotiations, which opened yesterday in both Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. In addition to a pay rise, IG Metall wants assurances of job security. The employers are adamant that real cost cuts are needed and have also served notice of cancellation of their holiday pay agreements. Yesterday they announced they wanted to reduce the holiday bonus by half a month's pay.</p>

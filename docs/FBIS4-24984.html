			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- In the next few years,  China will concentrate manpower and financial resources on  tackling several key chemical engineering technologies which  have an important bearing on the development of the chemical  industry and the economy as a whole to lay a foundation for a  high-technological chemical industry.    A national meeting on scientific and technological progress  in the chemical industry closed here today. According to  information from the meeting, the Ministry of Chemical Industry  has proposed that higher priority be given to the development of  nine key technologies in the Ninth Five-Year Plan of the  chemical industry. They include new catalysis technology, new  separation technology, biochemical technology, and computer  application. The plan also covers 10 major projects, including  a synthetic ammonia plant using natural gas as raw material with  an annual output capacity of 300,000 metric tons and a urea  plant using an ammonia gas process with an annual output  capacity of 520,000 metric tons; and projects for the  development of refined industrial chemicals in the agricultural  drug, dyestuff, electro-chemical, and three other major  categories.    The Ministry of Chemical Industry proposed that 30 major  scientific research results and new technologies be put to use  during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. They include the  10,000- etric-ton-class ionic membrane caustic soda producing  technology and the 10,000-metric-ton-class polyvinyl chloride  resin producing technology. It is reported that China's  chemical industry will develop more than 300 new major chemical  products annually in the last five years of this century; and by  the year 2000, the output value of high-technological chemical  products will account for approximately 10 percent of the total  output value of China's chemical industry.</p>

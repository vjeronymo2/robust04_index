Claims of outstanding performance must be based upon actual accomplishments. Clear, precise documentation will be required. Maps must have a census tract or block numbering area (BNA), and they must be in accordance with the 1990 Census data. Additionally, maps must identify the locations of areas with minorities by census tract or BNA. If there are no minority areas, state so on the map. Only population data from the 1990 Census will be acceptable for purposes of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that a ``minority'' is a person belonging to, or culturally identified as, a member of any one of the following racial/ethnic categories: Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native. For the purposes of this section, the separate category_``women''_is not considered a minority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Counties claiming points under this criterion must use county-wide statistics (excluding entitlement communities). In the case of joint applications, points will be awarded based on the performance of the lead entity only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following factors will be used to judge outstanding performance in these areas. Please note that the criteria are the same for Comprehensive and Single Purpose applicants, and that points for outstanding performance may be claimed under each criterion: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Housing Achievements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 points total). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) 20 Points_Provision of Assisted Housing_Providing assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families, located in a manner which provides housing choice in areas outside of minority, or low- and moderate-income concentrations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Points will be awarded where both of the following criteria are met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) More than one-third of the housing assistance provided by the applicant in the last five (5) years (excluding Section 8 existing and housing assistance provided in place) has been in Census Tracts (CT) or Block Numbering Areas (BNA) having a percentage of minority population which is less than the minority population in the community as a whole; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) With regard to the Section 8 Existing Program, a community must show the location (CT or BNA) of its currently occupied family units by race/ethnicity.

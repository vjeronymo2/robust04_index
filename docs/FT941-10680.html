			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Alusuisse Lonza in SFr400m cash call Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium, chemicals and packaging group, is launching a SFr400m (Dollars 266m) rights issue to help finance its SFr610m takeover of Lawson Mardon, the Canadian packaging group. Alusuisse, which has been restructuring vigorously to reduce its dependence on the volatile aluminium business, revealed that consolidated 1993 net income and sales slid as earlier predicted. According to preliminary figures, net income was down 15 per cent to SFr80m on sales off 6 per cent to SFr6.2bn. However, the directors are forecasting 'a significant improvement in group income in the current year' and are proposing the dividend be maintained at SFr12.50 per share. In September, the chairman had warned of a possible cut. Mr Georges Schorderet, finance director, said the 1993 results were hit by SFr300m in extraordinary restructuring costs. At the beginning of the year, Alusuisse shut down its only remaining aluminium smelter in Switzerland. It has closed a silicon carbide plant in southern Germany and yesterday announced the anticipated closure of an aluminium smelter at Essen. Mr Schorderet said the restructuring charges were offset by proceeds from disposals of non-core businesses and property. Net debt fell during the year by SFr700m to SFr1.3bn and Mr Schorderet said equity has risen to roughly SFr1.9bn, due to the proceeds from disposals and a rights issue last May. When Alusuisse announced its agreed bid for Lawson Mardon last November, it said an increase in its equity was possible in the longer term. The group's registered shares fell SFr24 to SFr610 yesterday following the announcement in a declining market. Mr Schorderet said the timing of the rights issue advanced in part because the public offer for Lawson shares had been so successful.</p>

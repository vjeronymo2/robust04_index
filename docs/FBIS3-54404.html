Other sources stressed that the visit was directly linked to  the peace process and the writing off or reducing the Jordanian  debts, which was the most important issue on the agenda of last  week's summit between Husayn and Clinton.    While press sources stressed that the visit by the U.S.  commerce secretary resulted in a government promise to end the  Jordanian boycott of Israel, acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n  Abu-Nuwar stressed to AL-BILAD that ending the boycott was not  at all raised by the Jordanian or U.S. parties in the recent  talks in Amman. He also said the reports published on this  issue are totally unfounded, especially since the Americans know  full well the true Jordanian firm stand on this issue -- that  there should be a joint Arab position on the boycott.    In another development, the visit by a group of 83-rabbis,  who toured Jordan from Amman to Petra, has drawn various  reactions. Most people voiced concern that the normalization  period has started already before any genuine guarantees to  return the occupied Jordanian territories have been obtained and  away from the comprehensive solution emphasized by the Jordanian  Government. This was denied by Minister Abu-Nuwar, who stressed  to AL-BILAD that this delegation was a tourist group, just like  any other tourist group that visits Jordan. He said the  competent authorities dealt with the delegation in that  capacity, especially since members of the group were carrying  U.S. passports that did not show any link to Israel or contain  stamps to indicate that they had previously visited Israel.    Regarding the official receptions accorded to this  delegation, Minister Abu-Nuwar stressed that they were not  received by any official.    Away from Abu-Nuwar's statements, various Jordanian parties  and public figures issued strong statements warning the  government against falling into the trap of normalization with  Israel and calling for confronting that normalization, which was  started by the government and which means full submission to the  Jewish state.</p>

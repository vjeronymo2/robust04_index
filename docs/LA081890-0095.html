			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HISTORIC OLD OAKS BEING POISONED IN LOUISIANA  </P> <P> Authorities say that more than a dozen oak trees, including some placed on a  national tree register, have been poisoned in the area in the last three  months.  </P> <P> Vermilion Parish County Agent Howard Cormier said the poison, believed to be a  herbicide similar to the one that almost killed the historic Treaty Oak in  Austin, Tex., has reached the vascular systems of some of the trees and  probably will kill them.  </P> <P> One of the poisoned trees is a live oak that is eight feet in diameter and is  150 to 200 years old. Nine trees in Abbeville and five more outside the city  limits have been reported poisoned, Cormier said.  </P></p>

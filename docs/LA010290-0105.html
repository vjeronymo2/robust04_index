			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONGRESSMAN CONVICTED IN WEDTECH CASE QUITS  </P> <P> Rep. Robert Garcia, the Bronx Democrat convicted with his wife last year in the  Wedtech scandal, announced today he is resigning from the congressional seat he  has held for more than 10 years.  </P> <P> Garcia, who was the first Puerto Rican member of Congress, said in a statement  that he will officially step down Sunday.  </P> <P> "It is with deep sadness that I announce my resignation from the United States  Congress," said the 56-year-old politician who earned a reputation as a  national Latino leader by fighting for his constituents in one of the poorest  districts in the country.  </P> <P> "The people of the Bronx have always been the most important part of my life  and representing them is the greatest honor I could ever know," the statement  said. "But I have always said that, if I could not serve their best interests,  I would leave office. That time has come."  </P> <P> Garcia and his wife, Jane Lee, 48, were convicted Oct. 20 of conspiracy and  extortion for their part in the Wedtech scandal. Both face up to 45 years in  prison and $750,000 in fines when they are sentenced Jan. 19 by Judge Leonard  Sand in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  </P> <P> The couple were found guilty of taking tens of thousands of dollars in illegal  payments, loans and jewelry from the now-defunct Wedtech Corp., a small Bronx  machine shop that blossomed into a major government and defense contractor,  allegedly by bribing influential officials.  </P> <P> The couple's attorneys have said they plan to appeal their convictions.  </P> <P> The Garcias' trial was the last major case to grow out of the Wedtech scandal,  which ruined the careers of several Bronx politicians, including 10-term Rep.  Mario Biaggi.  </P> <P> Garcia said he is timing his resignation to allow New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo  to call for a special election to fill out the remaining year of his term.  </P> <P> A handful of Democrats have already lined up to seek the post, but Bronx  Democratic leaders have privately suggested state Assemblyman Jose Serrano is  Garcia's likely successor. The district is overwhelmingly Democratic, and  whoever gets the party's endorsement would be a clear front-runner.  </P></p>

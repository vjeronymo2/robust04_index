			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: Edward Lam Company - Dance At two hours and fifteen minutes (no interval), Edward Lam's Scenes from a Men's Changing Room outstays its welcome to the point where, amid a background of rumbling stomachs, creaking seats and much indiscreet glancing at wristwatches, it induces a steady exodus of people who, most probably, will never again subject themselves to the Lam experience. A pity, because there is much to admire and enjoy in the work of this Hong Kong-born, but now London-based, Chinese director and choreographer. Scenes from a Men's Changing Room, part of the Barclays New Stages season at The Royal Court, was first created in 1991 for Lam's Hong Kong company. But like an earlier work entitled How to Love a Man Who Doesn't Love Me, it has been substantially reworked for a mainly British cast. Originally inspired by Lam's observations of gay men in the changing rooms, clubs and saunas of Europe - and by his own experience of these sexually-charged meeting places - Scenes from a Men's Changing Room is now set on a blank, open stage. Here, the eight performers (all men) use minimal props to suggest a catalogue of settings - a cafe, cinema, hospital - but it is through the patterns and intensity of their physical actions that we begin to recognise a variety of social situations and the environments in which they are taking place. Eschewing linear narrative for a chain of interactive but independent episodes, Lam presents his audience with an uncompromisingly stripped-back, bare-boned style of theatre, its focus lodged not in real time but in the fast-slow, stop-start frames of a collection of open-ended encounters. These range from the profoundly nightmarish - one man trying to suffocate another by tightening a towel around his head and face; another man overcome by a mixture of alarm and disgust as he dabs at his body's excretory orifices - to the sweetly amusing: a brief, trousers-down, apres-shower towel dance for a single man, this demure, but naughty routine later repeated by the entire group; three men arranging their hair in pigtails and behaving like giggly schoolgirls, leading into a wonderfully energetic parody of Charlie's Angels. But Lam also gives us scenes in which sinister events are blended with an uneasy humour, as when one man fornicates with another - both are fully dressed and completely expressionless - across the stage. Scenes is an elegant dissection of fear and guilt, need and rejection. Lam entertains us as generously as he seeks to disturb, but his brand of sparse yet epic theatre gradually loses its power to do either of these things as the evening wears on. Edward Lam Company is at the Green Room, Manchester on June 10 and 11.</p>

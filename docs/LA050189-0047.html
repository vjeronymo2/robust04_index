			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIHANOUK EASES STAND ON TALKS TO SETTLE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT  </P> <P> Cambodian resistance leader Norodom Sihanouk said Sunday that he has dropped  his demands for U.N. supervision of a Vietnamese troop withdrawal and the  dissolution of Premier Hun Sen's regime as preconditions for talks to settle  the 11-year-old conflict.  </P> <P> "I am ready to soften my stance," Prince Sihanouk, 67, said upon arrival from  Bangkok, Thailand, for talks starting Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I have to be realistic," he said. "I have to make possible an agreement" with  Hun Sen, the head of the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh regime.  </P> <P> However, Sihanouk ruled out a deal without consultations with his resistance  partners, including the Khmer Rouge. "I am not going to sign an agreement with  Hun Sen" without the approval of the heads of the two other factions, former  Premier Son Sann and Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan.  </P> <P> Although three previous meetings with Hun Sen in France failed to make any  progress, an unusually conciliatory Sihanouk said, "Both of us may soften our  stands to find a solution."  </P> <P> Since Vietnam announced in April the unconditional withdrawal of its troops by  September, hopes have run high that the talks between Sihanouk and Hun Sen will  result in a breakthrough.  </P> <P> Arriving only five hours before U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle, the prince who  ruled Cambodia for nearly 30 years said he was looking forward to their meeting  today.  </P> <P> "I did not ask for it," Sihanouk said, adding that Quayle requested a "courtesy  call."  </P> <P> Quayle is expected to discuss the possibility of the United States granting  military aid to the non-communist resistance groups.  </P></p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Investors climb yield curve on recovery talk PRICES of long-dated securities jumped as the possibilities of a cut in base rates receded further and hopes rose that the UK might be in for a period of non-inflationary growth. Yields for long-dated gilts fell by about 15 basis points during the week, while those for bonds at the short-maturing end of the yield curve rose slightly. The switching by investors up the yield curve was sparked by indications that the UK economy may be steadily expanding, without too much evidence of rising prices. In this environment there seems little likelihood Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, will choose soon to cut base rates from 6 per cent. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, said: 'All the signs are that we are seeing a happy medium of growth that is not too strong to lead to inflationary pressures, though not so weak that the budget deficit will worsen.' In the past month the yield difference between 10-year German and UK government bonds has fallen by about 30 basis points on the better inflation outlook for the UK and the worrying signs in Germany about economic decline, coupled with high deficits and upward pressures on prices. On Friday, after a modest spurt in gilt prices, yields of 10-year UK bonds were quoted at around 7.7 per cent at the close. However, a reminder that the UK faces its own problems with a likely Pounds 50bn deficit this financial year will come with the next gilt auction a week on Wednesday. Probably about Pounds 3bn of stock will be auctioned, in the seven to 10-year maturity range. The amount of stock and the details of the bonds will be announced tomorrow. Several of the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers, meeting today for the first time since February, are concerned the deficit must be tackled to increase the chances of a sustainable recovery. While Professor Tim Congdon and Mr Gavyn Davies are opting for further tax rises to add to those already due to take effect from next April, Mr Andrew Sentance and Prof Patrick Minford are keener on public spending cuts to bring down the deficit to manageable levels by about 1997. Both Mr Davies and Prof Minford would like to see base rate cuts over the next few months to help the recovery, ideally with a programme of fiscal tightening. The broad consensus among the Treasury advisers - whose report to Mr Clarke is due to be presented next week - is that government borrowing as a proportion of gross domestic product should be brought down to about 3 per cent by this year from the current level of about 8 per cent. Signs that a modest recovery is under way were strengthened by the news that seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 26,100 to 2.914m between April and May, against expectations in much of the gilts investment community of a rise. The fourth monthly fall in unemployment cut the seasonally adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent last month from 10.5 per cent in April. Less welcome for gilt investors was that the public sector borrowing requirement grew to Pounds 5.01bn from Pounds 4.71bn in April and Pounds 3.13bn in May last year. The deficit increased to Pounds 9.7bn in the first two months of the current financial year from Pounds 6.6bn in the same period of 1992-1993, reflecting rapid growth in state cash outlays and low increases in tax income. There was some cheer for the gilt market with the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index last month turning out at 1.3 per cent, the same as in April and the lowest 12-month rate since February 1964. The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, the Treasury's targeted measure of underlying inflation, rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May after a 2.9 per cent rise in April. Retail price inflation excluding food fell to a 33-year low last month. However, inflation at the retail level has almost certainly reached its lowest point in the current cycle, with increases likely over the next few months as the effects of last year's cuts in mortgage interest rates drop out of the RPI calculations. Some commentators have argued that the emphasis on the RPI in calculating inflation is hardly sensible, bearing in mind that the numbers are so bound up with what was happening a year previously. This may give more urgency to the Bank of England's efforts to come up with new inflation indicators more linked to current conditions and which could prove useful as the possibility of price pressures increases in the later stages of any sustained recovery.</p>

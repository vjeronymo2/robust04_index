			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (7): Singular breakthrough - Gibraltar has been revamping its facilities GIBRALTAR is looking more like a successful offshore finance centre than ever before. It has a considerable amount of new office space and markedly improved telecommunications. More important, it was recently the base for the largest placement of preference shares on the US market by a non-US bank. For the past four years the British Crown Colony on the tip of southern Spain has been revamping its facilities and promoting itself as a tax efficient base serving EC banks and corporations. Gibraltar has equipped itself with digital fibre optics and a high quality development has sprung up on reclaimed land. Just as the new offices are being completed so the megadeals appear to have finally arrived on the Rock. The US issue launched from Gibraltar last November, which was fully underwritten and subscribed, raised Dollars 345m, and the capital, in the form of non-voting shares, ranked as locked-in, high-grade capital, or Tier one under the Basle Accord. The key feature of the deal was that capital duty exposure was substantially eliminated by using Gibraltar as its base. It was a singular breakthrough and there is evidence that similar significant business will go to Gibraltar instead of, for example, to Luxembourg. The deal woke up financial directors to the capital-raising possibilities afforded by the colony. However, while there is an unquestioned silver lining to Gibraltar's horizon it is no less evident that the black clouds of the political dispute which envelops the Rock remain in place. Spain is pressing for territorial sovereignty over the colony and the overwhelming re-election of the uncompromising Gibraltarian nationalist Mr Joe Bossano in January as the Rock's chief minister has brought the dispute more sharply into focus. Mr Bossano rejects any cession of sovereignty to Spain and the Spanish parliament has responded by unanimously carrying a motion which significantly strengthens the Madrid government's hand in its equally uncompromising approach to the dispute. The acrimonious stalemate colouring Gibraltar's future political status makes it all the more remarkable that the bank which so successfully used the Rock to raise capital on the US market should have been none other than the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, Spain's largest retail bank. BBV owns a subsidiary on the Rock which holds a B licence and is thus authorised by the Banking Commission of Gibraltar to conduct offshore business. BBV had first examined the possibility of launching its issue from Luxembourg. It opted for Gibraltar, according to well-placed local legal sources, because the system of non-voting shares is better understood on the Rock. Shareholders can be disenfranchised under Gibraltar's UK-based Common Law jurisdiction whereas in general all shares issued in a continental Civil Law code environment, such as Luxembourg's, must carry voting rights. Gibraltar's Common Law gives the Rock's substantial population of specialised lawyers and accountants an obvious edge for certain types of business. The colony's other obvious attraction is its cost efficiency. This is true for share issues because under Gibraltar's legislation capital duty is not paid on the premium, and it is true, also, for bond issues where duty is capped at Pounds 5,000. BBV's initiative nevertheless runs counter to a prevailing official view in Madrid that seeks to pressure Gibraltar, and the UK, by isolating it as much as possible. There is no enthusiasm whatsoever in Madrid for the consolidation of Gibraltar as an offshore centre independent from Spain. Spain's pressure tactics are resisted by the UK which stands by its commitment to the 20,000-odd Gibraltarians that there can be no change in the Rock's sovereignty unless it is sanctioned by them.</p>

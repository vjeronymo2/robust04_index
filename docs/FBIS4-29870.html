			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japanese automakers  purchased 15.53 billion dollars worth of U.S. auto parts in  fiscal 1993, up 14.1 percent from the year before, the Japan  Automobile Manufacturers Association said Tuesday [21 June].    The figure totals such purchases by local units of Japanese  automakers operating in the United States and imports by their  parent companies at home, said Tatsuro Toyoda, head of the  association.    Toyoda, also president of Toyota Motor Corp., expressed  concern, however, that such purchases have not been increasing  enough to reach the earlier targeted amount of 19 billion  dollars by the end of the current fiscal year through next March  31.    "I hope each automaker will make further efforts so we can  accomplish the target," Toyoda said at a meeting with the press.    In fiscal 1993 which ended on March 31, local units of  Japanese carmakers bought about 12.9 billion dollars worth of  U.S. auto parts, up 15.7 percent from the year before.    Purchases by their parent companies amounted to 2.6 billion  dollars, up 6.8 percent. Parent firms were less active in  buying because of sluggish sales in the recession-hit domestic  market.    The year-on-year 14.1 percent increase in the total figure  compared with a 29.4 percent rise in the previous year.    The association said that as long as domestic sales remain  slack it will be hard for Japanese automakers to reach the  target this year.    The United States has suggested making annual purchase  targets for American-made car parts by Japanese automakers for  fiscal 1995 to 1997 one of the "objective criteria" for the  bilateral trade "framework" talks.    The two countries are discussing what kinds of criteria are  suitable for evaluating Japan's efforts to open its market for  foreign products and services.    Industry sources see the slow increase in car parts  purchases  by Japanese automakers this business year as possibly affecting  the talks.</p>

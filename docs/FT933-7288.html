			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Conservative rebels predict rail bill defeat TORY REBELS claimed yesterday that the government faces an embarrassing Commons defeat over rail privatisation if British Rail goes ahead with planned fare increases of up to 16 per cent. According to leaked Network SouthEast documents British Rail's 'preferred option' for meeting its expected revenue shortfall is to raise the price of Travelcards by 16.2 per cent, single tickets by 12 per cent and season tickets by 7.9 per cent. The figures are among three alternatives which will go before the BR board next month. The leaked documents will stiffen the resolve of Conservative backbench rebels to force concessions from the government when the privatisation bill returns to the Commons in the autumn. Their chance will come when MPs vote on a Lords amendment which would allow BR to bid against private companies for franchises to operate trains after privatisation. The government is determined to reverse the amendment, which was proposed by Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport minister. Downing Street claims the amendment in effect wrecks the bill. A leading rebel said yesterday, however, that 'a large number' of backbenchers were willing to defy the government. He said: 'These are not the wild men who are always voting against the government, these are loyal Tory MPs who cannot accept what the government is trying to do.' Another rebel, Mr Andrew Bowden (Brighton Kemptown), said price rises on the scale proposed would go down 'like a lead balloon' with his constituents. 'I think it is quite unreasonable for fare increases to be excessive. I think it's just speculation, but if it did go ahead I would make very strong protests to the secretary of state,' he said. Sir Keith Speed (Ashford), said there would be 'a political storm' if the government approved fare increases of 16 per cent when inflation stood at just over 1 per cent. 'My constituents have the worst service in Network SouthEast. There is no way I could see them paying 16 per cent increases in fares,' he said. Mr Michael Patterson, secretary of the Central Transport Consultative Committee, the BR watchdog, said passengers 'would prefer a hole in the head to fare increases of 16 per cent'. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, said the leaked documents provided evidence that the government would have to abandon privatisation. 'They cannot simply blunder on in the full knowledge that the huge costs involved in privatising and fragmenting the network are destined to be paid for by the travelling public,' he said. Neither the Department of Transport nor British Rail would comment on the documents, or on reports that rural lines - including those on the Isle of Wight and between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth - are set to suffer cuts in Sunday services.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA LIMITS USE OF PESTICIDE THAT KILLS BIRDS  </P> <P> In an unprecedented action to protect birds, the Environmental Protection  Agency on Thursday banned the use of the pesticide diazinon on golf courses and  sod farms.  </P> <P> EPA officials said the order is based on reports of about 60 incidents of  massive bird kills in 18 states in which diazinon was confirmed or implicated  as the main cause.  </P> <P> After a two-year legal fight, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly issued an  order barring continued use of diazinon, marking the first time the agency has  revoked government approval of a pesticide solely because of its harmful  effects on birds.  </P> <P> Diazinon, primarily produced by Ciba-Geigy, is widely used to control a variety  of insects at agricultural and ornamental nursery sites and around homes and  gardens. About 8 million pounds are used annually.  </P> <P> The pesticide has not been used on golf courses or sod farms since March, 1988,  after an initial EPA order banning the chemical.  </P> <P> That order was subsequently contested by Ciba-Geigy in legal action and was  sent back to the EPA for reconsideration in 1989 by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court  of Appeals.  </P></p>

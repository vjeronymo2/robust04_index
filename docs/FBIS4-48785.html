			<p>BFN     [Text] Former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction  Assembly] government President Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor says  Liberia is at a crucial and opportune time for achieving lasting  peace provided the courage of removing all obstacles from the  Cotonou Agreement is put into place. Speaking during a press  conference in Gbarnga today, Mr. Taylor said it is of crucial  importance to remove all external threats presently being caused  by the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] with the help of ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] from the Cotonou peace process in order for disarmament,  encampment, and demobilization to commence.    Mr. Taylor said the LPC and the Nigerian contingent of  ECOMOG  pose a continuous threat to stability in Liberia. The NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader said if Nigeria  must remain a part of the peace process in Liberia, Nigerians  must shape up or else they will have to ship out. President  Taylor said there are some good elements within the Nigerian  ECOMOG contingent but Nigerian soldiers with bad peacekeeping  records must be withdrawn from Liberia.    The former president reiterated the commitment of the NPFL  to  the current peace process but warned of the danger plan by AFL  [Armed Forces of Liberia] commanding General Hezekiah Bowen to  unleash a Kigali situation in Liberia. He cautioned all  factions to exercise restraint and follow the South African  example in order to restore peace to the people of this country  suffering in and out of Liberia.</p>

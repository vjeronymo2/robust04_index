The appeal came at a time when a very grave phase of war  fraught with an unpredictable danger has been created on the  Korean peninsula by the reckless moves of the U.S. and South  Korean bellicose quarters. "If a nuclear war broke out on the  Korean peninsula, the Korean territory would be turned into a  waste land and the Korean nation with a 5,000-year-long history  would suffer from an irrevocable disaster", it warns, and says:    "True patriotism for the Korean nation is manifested in  averting the imminent danger of war and safeguarding the  country's peace".    It calls on all the political parties, groupings and people  of all social strata of South Korea and overseas Koreans to turn  out in a struggle for overthrowing the present treacherous  regime of Kim Yong-sam and thwarting the reckless belligerent  moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose circles.    It appeals to the soldiers of the "ROK" to categorically  reject the criminal order of the war-thirsty elements who are  forcing them to serve outside forces as their mercenaries and  impose a nuclear war disaster upon their families and fellow  countrymen and turn their guns to the aggressors and the  traitors.    It appeals to the South Korean people to resolutely rise up  in the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to get the  U.S. troops and nuclear weapons out of South Korea and convert  the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free, peace zone.    The appeal stresses that all the compatriots must unite with  each other as one nation with the 10-point programme of the  great unity of the whole nation as their common guideline of the  nation and take part in the struggle for removing the danger of  a nuclear war hanging over the nation and opening the way of the  peace and peaceful reunification of the country.</p>

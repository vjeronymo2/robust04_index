Having persuaded the hostile parties to start up a  dialogue, Russia is seeking to reconcile the implacable  adversaries' positions and secure specific moves from them to  break the deadlock.    However, the hopes were not fulfilled. By all accounts there  will be no talks between the Tajik authorities and the  opposition in the foreseeable future. Kozyrev indirectly  acknowledged this when conversing with journalists at the end of  the meeting with his counterparts from the Central Asian CIS  states: "Intensive work with the Tajik opposition is under way.  We are entering into contact with everyone who agrees to  dialogue. But it is too early to say at the moment when these  efforts will yield results and it will be possible to hold  talks."    Comparing this cautious evaluation with recent optimistic  statements by Russian diplomats, it is possible to draw the  conclusion that the results of the Dushanbe meetings were not at  all what Kozyrev hoped for. It is not clear as yet who was to  blame for the postponement of the talks due to start on 16  March. The Tajik leadership blames the opposition for digging  its heels in. According to other information Uzbekistan, which  has enormous influence on the Tajik regime, opposed the talks.  There are serious grounds for thinking that Tajikistan leader  Emomali Rakhmonov felt no great desire to start a dialogue with  the opposition. Having given in to Moscow's pressure and agreed  to talks against his own will, he was merely waiting for an  excuse to reconsider his decision.    That excuse so desired by the hard-liners in both camps was  provided on the night of 10-11 March when Tajik Vice Premier  Mazabsho Nazarshoyev was shot. A native of the Pamirs, which  are regarded as the opposition's main stronghold, Nazarshoyev  represented the interests of the people of his region in the  government. According to one version that I got to hear in  Dushanbe, the vice premier's removal was a carefully planned  provocation by Rakhmonov supporters. The organizers of the  murder achieved their end. Dialogue between the authorities and  the opposition is on the verge of breakdown.    It can be predicted with certainty that all Russian  diplomacy's efforts will be aimed at ensuring that talks do  nevertheless take place. From Moscow's standpoint it it is  essential above all to agree a cease-fire. The political  settlement mechanism has not yet been defined. Russia is urging  that elections involving the opposition be held as soon as  possible; however, there are grounds for thinking that Rakhmonov  and his team are not very keen on this.    According to the experts, if elections are held Rakhmonov  and  the Kulyab grouping, which supports him, are almost certain to  lose. An opposition victory is also unlikely. The influential  and numerous Leninabad clan has the greatest chance of success.  Its representatives in the Tajik leadership are ready for  elections. The next few weeks will show whether these people are  able to influence Rakhmonov and prompt him to make a compromise.    In the opinion of an informed Russian Foreign Ministry  staffer who asked to remain anonymous, time is working in favor  of those who support elections and mutual concessions: "The  military confrontation cannot go on for ever. People's patience  is running out. The collapse of the Tajik economy has reached  dire proportions. Only the end of fighting and political  stabilization can create the conditions necessary to normalize  the situation. Otherwise, Tajikistan will break up. And that is  understood by the leaders of both the belligerent sides."    As far as Moscow is concerned, the last thing it wants is to  be dragged into a long-drawn-out, Afghanistan-type conflict.  Neither the diplomats nor the military cherish any illusions:  It is impossible to destroy the Tajik opposition detachments  operating from Afghan territory. The confrontation between them  and Russian border guards threatens to bring new Russian  casualties and cause a welling-up of discontent in the country  and huge material losses.    "The Tajik problems cannot be resolved militarily. All hope  is pinned on dialogue between the authorities and the  opposition. I hope it will prove fruitful," Colonel General  Boris Pyankov, commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces in  Tajikistan, told journalists. Neither Russia nor the other  Commonwealth members committed to protecting the Tajik-Afghan  border are hurrying to send the promised reinforcements.  According to Pyankov, only Kazakhstan has brought its border  contingent up to full strength. Russia, Uzbekistan, and  Kirgiziya [Kyrgyzstan] have yet to do this. The Russian border  detachments are made up of 70 percent Tajiks right now. That  figure will become even larger in the immediate future.  Rakhmonov has promised Kozyrev that another 5,000 Tajik  draftees will be sent to the border.    Moscow is gradually transferring the protection of the  border  with Afghanistan to the Tajiks themselves. However, it is most  likely that this process will drag on and that the white, blue,  and red flag will fly over the border posts on the southern  marches of Tajikistan for a long while yet. "Russia's special  role in Tajikistan is not a whim on our part but an inescapable  fact. I told this to Secretary of State Christopher in  Vladivostok. If we leave Tajikistan, chaos will ensure here.  Look what happened in neighboring Afghanistan. We cannot allow  that. All attempts to violate the border will be stopped in the  most resolute fashion. There is no point in the opposition's  trying to put our endurance to the test; it is better to rely on  peace talks," Kozyrev told the journalists accompanying him on  his visit.</p>

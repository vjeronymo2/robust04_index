			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Democrats reject Bush package to boost growth THE Democratic majority in the US House of Representatives yesterday rejected a package of measures proposed by President George Bush to boost economic growth, and passed its own package of tax cuts instead. The Bush package, announced in the president's State of the Union message a month ago, would have included a cut in the capital gains tax rate, an investment tax allowance and tax incentives for first-time home buyers. But the Democrats attacked President Bush for helping the wealthy, and for dropping the Dollars 500-per-child increase in personal tax allowances which the president had promised middle-income families in the same State of the Union address. They preferred a package based on a temporary Dollars 200-per-person tax credit, which would benefit 80 per cent of taxpayers, to be financed by a new higher band of income tax and a permanent 10 per cent surtax on incomes over Dollars 1m. President Bush has promised to veto the Democrats' bill because of this tax increase, even though their package would also index capital gains to inflation, an idea backed by many Republicans, Mr Tom Foley, the House Speaker, said yesterday that he was not convinced that Mr Bush would carry out this veto threat. However, the Democrats' bill only narrowly passed the House by 221 votes to 210, well short of the two thirds margin needed to override a presidential veto. The Democrats had some difficulty agreeing their package and had to tinker with the proposals right up to the last minute to ensure its passage. The US Senate last night confirmed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve for a second four-year term, AP-DJ reports from Washington.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis proposed  establishing an arms control system for the Mediterranean.  Arsenis outlined his proposal during an address at an  international seminar titled "Armament Limitation and Security  in the Middle East," which was held in Athens under the auspices  of the International Relations Institute of Pandion University  and the Institute of International Conflict and Cooperation of  the University of California. Arsenis said this arms control  system could be based on the principle of territorial integrity,  inviolate borders, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and not  using force. Greece, he added, is particularly worried about  the issue of nuclear weapons in Central Asia and the Middle East  as well as Turkey's interest in these weapons, given that, since  the breakup of the Soviet Union, the possibilities for nuclear  proliferation have increased, as have the possibilities for the  spread of nuclear technology and know-how to unstable regions.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Chambers warn on fax directory fraud SUSPECTED fax directory fraud on British companies is being fuelled by the advent of the European single market because of companies' anxiety to become more widely known internationally, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce has warned. The association, which has been co-ordinating information on international fraud for the past three years, says there is evidence that some fax or telex directory frauds are used as fronts for money-laundering. Companies are persuaded to pay for entries in directories that will be published only in token editions, if at all. The frauds are difficult to combat since each involves at least three countries, and the payments - large numbers of small sums - can divert banks' suspicions from other payments, representing the laundering of drug money or other criminal funds. The latest suspected fraud is being run in Britain from Hamburg for a classified fax directory. An invoice-cum-order form offers insertion in 'The TVV Business Directory' for Pounds 390. Companies are targeted from The Fax Book, BT's directory, entry in which is free. There is no telephone number for the company, only a fax line. Ms Jocelyn Jackson-Matthews, who co-ordinates anti-fraud activity for the chambers, said a legitimate operator would state the directory's target audience and print run on the form. It would then invite the order. The Hamburg form disclaims liability to publish on any date, and does not specify the size of the print run or distribution of the directory. The form also reserves to the operator the right to design and illustrate directory entries. The forms have been posted from Prague in Czechoslovakia, giving the sender the benefit of cheap bulk mailing rates while muddying any legal trail by adding a third jurisdiction to those of Britain and Germany. 'The forms are illegal under the Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 and 1975,' said Ms Jackson-Matthews. 'Even if the directory is published, no one is obliged to pay. Alleged debts will be entirely un-enforceable under UK law.' Similar fax directory offers in the past two years have led to her dealing with hundreds of complaints from companies. Many people became seriously worried last year when one Swiss fraudster started printing his own counterfeit English court enforcement orders for payment. Mr Otto Kiehl, of Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said that although the latest fax directory operation was illegal in Britain and contrary to his chamber's code of ethics, no criminal offence was being committed against German companies. The police were therefore powerless. 'The only course is for any victims to sue in the German courts', he added. UK police estimate that each individual directory fraud nets up to Pounds 2m for the criminal. A typical mailing involves 100,000 fake invoices with an average demand for Pounds 500. Police think up to 4 per cent of 'invoiced' companies pay. Chances of police action are slight. West Yorkshire Police said yesterday: 'It is difficult to be effective against this type of offence because of different jurisdictions being involved and the law being different in the countries concerned.'</p>

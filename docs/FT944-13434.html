			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: US drugs groups post solid sales growth Marion Merrell Dow and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US pharmaceutical groups, both showed solid revenue gains in the third quarter, but only RPR, a subsidiary of France's Rhone-Poulenc, was able to boost its bottom line. At MMD, a 10 per cent improvement in sales, to Dollars 783m, largely reflected two acquisitions completed over the past year. The company, controlled by Dow Chemical, bought the Rugby Group, a generic drug manufacturer, late last year and Kodama, a Japanese pharmaceuticals group, in early 1994. Excluding their contributions, revenues would have showed a 6 per cent decline from Dollars 709m a year ago. Sales of Cardizem, a cardiovascular medication, were down 1 per cent, although a strong performance by the lower-margin Cardizem CD, a once-a-day formulation of the product, helped to offset the loss. Sales of Seldane, an allergy remedy whose patent expired last April, were down 10 per cent. RPR credited robust sales of its prescription products, especially in North America, for an 8 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 1.04bn. Profits were up 45 per cent at Dollars 102.5m, or 76 cents a share, against Dollars 71m, or 51 cents, a year ago. The 1993 figure reflected a pre-tax charge of Dollars 27m, or 13 cents. The results, which were slightly better than Wall Street had forecast, represent a turnround of sorts from the second quarter, when earnings had come in well under expectations. On Wall Street yesterday, RPR's share price closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 36 1/4 . Although MMD suffered a 12 per cent slide in profits to Dollars 126m, or 45 cents, the result exceeded analysts' forecasts of 36 cents. The stock made steady headway as a result, closing Dollars 1 higher on the day at Dollars 25 3/4 . For the first nine months of 1994, MMD posted earnings of Dollars 330m, against Dollars 375m, excluding a Dollars 180m pre-tax charge. Revenues were up 9 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn. At RPR, net income for the nine months was Dollars 168.8m, against Dollars 284.8m, on revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, virtually unchanged from a year ago.</p>

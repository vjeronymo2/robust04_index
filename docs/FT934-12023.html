			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Toye reduces losses to Pounds 247,313 Toye, the maker of civil and military regalia, reported pre-tax losses down from Pounds 891,216 to Pounds 247,313 for the six months to June 30. The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 5.52m - including Pounds 85,408 from discontinued operations - to Pounds 5.8m. Losses per share were cut from 29.35p to 11p. Interest charges fell from Pounds 85,255 to Pounds 68,871. Mr Bryan Toye, chairman, said the results were beginning to reflect some of the benefits of work undertaken during the past 12 months. The company's performance in the second half should continue to improve, he said, but would be limited by ongoing losses in the corporate clothing area, shortage of hard currency in export markets and low demand for some of the group's products.</p>

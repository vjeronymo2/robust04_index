Takeshita, who heads the governing Liberal Democratic Party, received  the loan from Recruit Co. and repaid it several months later, Kyodo News  Service and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said. Takeshita did not mention the  loan when he told a Parliament panel April 11 that he had received more than $1  million in political donations from Recruit between 1985 and 1987. Recruit, an  information services company, is suspected of using political donations to gain  favors.  </P></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / ITC defends proposed arrangements for ITV THE independent Television Commission yesterday defended proposed arrangements for the ITV network yesterday in spite of implicit criticism of some of the suggestions by the Office of Fair Trading. The commission emphasised in its formal response to the OFT that the 1990 Broadcasting Act allows ITV companies both to broadcast and to make programmes, and that licences have been granted on that basis. 'The competition test should not therefore be interpreted in a way which treats vertical integration of this kind as either undesirable in practice or unacceptable in principle,' the ITC says. The OFT has a statutory responsibility to ensure that arrangements for the ITV network are fair, including fair access for independent producers to the commissioning system. Last month the OFT said it had identified a number of potentially anti-competitive elements in the new ITV networking arrangements. They included proposals that prevent independent producers contracting directly with the ITV network, and ITV insistence that it wants to buy programme rights for 10 years with a further five-year option. On contracting, the ITC says responsibility for compliance with regulatory requirements must rest with ITV companies because the ITC can impose sanctions only on its licensees. The ITC also says that when a broadcaster fully funds a programme 'there should be a period in which it alone can benefit without the programme being available to UK broadcasting competitors'. The ITC does not, however, suggest that period should be 15 years. The OFT made clear in last month's consultative document that it would not reach firm conclusions until the outcome of further discussions had been fully analysed. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, will make a full report on networking arrangements by December. At least 100 jobs are to go at the recently merged Yorkshire and Tyne-Tees Television. At present, the group employs about 1,400 people. The job losses will remove duplication in administration and programme-making.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent eases in spite of cuts in interest rates THE trend on the Continent was weak yesterday in spite of interest rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt was on holiday. PARIS fell on renewed worries about a trade war between Europe and the US. Sentiment was also harmed by the latest survey of business leaders by the Bank of France which showed that industrial output and consumer demand continued to weaken in October and that the investment outlook remained sluggish. The CAC 40 index ended 5.27 lower at 1,759.17 as turnover remained steady at FFr1.76bn. Some stocks bucked the weaker trend. Lyonnaise-Dumez went as high as FFr506 before closing FFr13 better at FFr506 in heavy trading of 129,325 shares after news that a consortium it leads had won a 25-year license to supply Sydney, Australia with drinking water. Peugeot jumped FFr9 to FFr523 after a leading domestic broker recommended buying the stock. MILAN started to consolidate its recent gains, but some stocks were still bought for speculative reasons. The Comit index fell 4.91 to 476.39 as turnover eased to an estimated L300bn from Tuesday's L389bn. Rinascente, part of the Fiat group, rose as high as L9,000 before closing down L70 on reports that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of the Standa retail chain, was considering making an offer for Rinascente. Privatisation hopes lifted Italy's national carrier Alitalia by L263 or 35.2 per cent to L1,010 from Friday. Shares in Buton, a brandy and spirits producer, added L420 or 12.7 per cent to L3,720 on Tuesday's news that Grand Metropolitan of the UK had bought a 34 per cent stake in it. ZURICH saw an early drop of 20 points in the SMI index, still unhappy after the poll suggesting that the December 6 referendum would vote against membership of the European Economic Area. However, it then staged a technical rebound and the SMI closed 6.7 lower at 1,882.8. Banks stayed under pressure with UBS bearers, SFr5 lower at SFr794, topping the active list and CS Holding shedding another SFr30 to SFr1,885. But chemicals staged a strong recovery to close almost at yesterday's level, Roche certificates ending steady at SFr3,800. MADRID extended its rally on an influx of foreign buying, the general index rising 5.27, or 2.5 per cent to 212.04 in heavy turnover of Pta31.2bn, up from Pta23.2bn on Tuesday. Five or six blue chips accounted for as much as 40 to 50 per cent of total trade according to one domestic broker. The Ibex-35, an index of the 35 largest stocks, closed 74.41, or 3.3 per cent higher at 2,306.98. Telefonica moved around 6m shares as it rose Pta70 to Pta1,125 and Repsol put on Pta75 to Pta2,740, both after results this week. Endesa rose Pta85 to Pta3,555. STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading as strong demand for Astra made up for dull trading in other issues. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 1.3 to 724.9 in turnover of SKr686m after SKr708m. Astra rose SKr14 to SKr616 on persistent rumours that the investment group, Investor, intended to sell its holdings in the pharmaceutical company. The tool maker, Sandvik, dropped SKr16 or 5 per cent to SKr325 after its nine-month results disappointed the market. The company's gloomy trading forecast prompted James Capel to lower its 1992 and 1993 EPS forecasts to SKr20 and SKr15 respectively from SKr24 and SKr17 previously. COPENHAGEN subsided as a political storm over budget irregularities threatened to unseat the economy and tax minister and possibly spark premature elections. The KFX index fell 1.06 to 78.41. AMSTERDAM ignored the upward trend in London and a cut in the central bank's special advances money market rate. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.5 to 104.0. Elsevier fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 112.90 after comments by the chairman that that 15 per cent annual profit growth could not be relied upon in future.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 18                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1051.94    1053.01    1052.64    1051.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1105.27    1106.85    1106.04    1105.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1051.01    1051.37    1050.87    1051.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1105.04    1105.32    1106.41    1106.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Nov 17    Nov 16    Nov 13    Nov 12      Nov 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1056.32   1058.27   1059.26   1059.91   1045.16** FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1109.66   1110.19   1114.93   1120.89   1108.98**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1053.29; 200 - 1108.01 Low/day: 100 - 1049.91 200 - 1103.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Partial  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

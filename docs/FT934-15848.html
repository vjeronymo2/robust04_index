			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Major stresses Tory commitment to Ulster MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday cemented his party's understanding with the Ulster unionists by re-emphasising the government's commitment to keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. His unequivocal statement came against a background of continuing uncertainty about the prospects for round-table talks on the future of Northern Ireland, which have been stalled since last November. Achieving the continuing support of the nine Ulster unionist MPs at Westminster would double the government's paper majority of just 17, leaving it much less vulnerable to backbench Tory rebellions on issues such as rail privatisation of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. 'Northern Ireland is part of our democracy,' Mr Major said. 'We are not going to bargain away the people's democratic rights, in order to appease those who seek to rule by bullet or by bomb.' He was vigorously applauded as he insisted: 'No government which I lead will negotiate with those who perpetrate or those who support the use of violence.' Moderate nationalists are uneasy that the government may reward the Ulster unionists for their support on the critical Commons votes on the social chapter in July with changes such as a cross-party Westminster select committee on Northern Ireland. But the prospects of finding a solution also face other pressures. The hard-line Democratic Unionist party has ruled out further participation in the round-table talks process because of the initiative launched last month by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. While the British government is doubtful that the Hume-Adams move will produce progress, Dublin seems more warmly disposed towards it. So long as the round-table talks have a chance of success, British government ministers do not intend to offer any concrete moves to the unionists. Instead, Mr Major hopes to keep the support of the party's MPs by emphasising the government's deep commitment to the Union - both he and Sir Norman Fowler pointedly referred to the Conservative and Unionist party - and contrasting that with Labour's policies. Yesterday he attacked Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for allowing Mr Kevin McNamara, the Northern Ireland spokesman, 'to plan a united Ireland'. While Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, responded yesterday by accusing Mr Major of 'trotting out all the usual Tory platitudes on Northern Ireland', the signs so far are that the Ulster unionists are more amenable to the government's approach. He said the DUP 'will be watching closely' the response of Mr Major and the Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew to the Hume-Adams initiative which received a warm response in Dublin this week. Mr James Molyneaux, the Official Unionist party leader, told a fringe meeting this week that he saw no reason to end the life of the current parliament 'prematurely'. In Dublin, government reaction was low-key because no shift was detected away from Mr Major's previously stated policy positions.</p>

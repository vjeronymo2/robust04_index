The rebels seem to have taken refuge in the Lacandon Jungle,  to where they have been pushed by Army troops, who chase and  bomb them, journalist of the Tuxtla Gutierrez daily "CUARTO  PODER" told EFE.    Military sources told our informants that the chase has  extended to the town of San Juan Chamula, in the Lacandon  Jungle, where residents captured four rebels who were armed with  harquebus-type shotguns.    The Army expelled the rebels from the town of Altamirano,  the  last of seven towns they had occupied and which still remained  under their control.    In Altamirano shooting between the rebels and Army was still  heard, however. Fighting has left at least 121 dead, half of  whom are Zapatista rebels, according to official sources.    A journalist of the daily "CUARTO PODER" told EFE that the  Mexican Army controls totally three of the four municipalities  in which the rebels had concentrated.</p>

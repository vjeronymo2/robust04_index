			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (7): New challenge looms - Tracy Corrigan discusses derivatives THE increasing use of derivative products by investment managers has created new competitive challenges for global custodians. The complexity of the instruments involved, and their relationship with the rest of an investment portfolio, requires more sophisticated reporting than straightforward equity or bond trades, as well as strong operational support. Although futures markets have existed for several decades, it is only recently that derivatives have started to be viewed as investment as well as trading instruments. But, while the development of structuring and trading of derivatives has been at the top of banks' agendas for a couple of years, banks have been slower to react by gearing up their global custody business to meet these new demands. 'Typically , old custodial systems were designed to track the positions of physical securities,' said Mr Aidan Dennis, product development manager, global securities services, at Chase Manhattan. 'Now we're heading into a paperless environment and there are new techniques such as short-selling. Derivatives are just one part of an enhanced investment strategy.' Systems now have to be able to perform an increasingly wide range of functions. Fund managers require a system which can record any open positions, consolidate positions across accounts, value positions, calculate full economic exposure, measure performance and track collateral. With constraints on capital, some banks have been slow to make the necessary investments in terms of systems and personnel needed to offer a full service for derivatives. 'I think one-stop shopping for derivatives will happen, but it requires substantial investment in much more dynamic systems,' said one custody specialist at a large bank. 'It will take a few years before it is widely available.' The reporting of positions forms a crucial part of the global custodian's function in the area of potentially risky derivatives. For institutions to gain the maximum benefit from reporting, it is not enough for custodians to detail every individual position. For example, if an investor has a long position in Company A equity warrants, and is short Company A shares, the overall neutral position should be shown, rather than two separate positions. 'There is a need to account for the use of derivatives in a manner which most accurately reflects the investors' use of strategy,' said Mr Alex Ehrlich, executive director at Goldman Sachs. Investors who have studied the issue agree. '(The reporting of derivatives) will have to become part of the standard service,' said Mr Glyn Peat of Lazard Investors, who chaired the Pensions Research Accountants Group's futures and options working party. Different types of derivative products demand different approaches. For example, for institutions which are active in exchange-traded futures, one function of the global custodian is to handle the payment of margin requirements. Because of their size, custodians can take advantage of economies of scale, as well as swapping an investor's assets for comparable assets which can be used as collateral for margin calls. However, they are effectively competing against brokers, who perform functions such as margining and exposure management. To win business away, they will have to offer a more comprehensive service, which many custodians have not yet developed. The issues surrounding over-the-counter options are more complex. First, valuation of such options is difficult, since there may be no active market and options values shift constantly. Further, price movements are not in proportion to cash market movements. The issue of reporting and performance measurement has come under focus this year, as more fund managers start using derivatives, and trustees struggle to get to grips with the concepts involved. Early this year, the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) and Mercer Fraser published recommendations for the reporting of financial futures and options in investment portfolios, designed to provide UK pension fund managers with professionally-agreed standards of performance measurement of derivatives for the first time. The new guidelines allow trustees to assess more easily whether fund managers are using futures and options for investment or hedging purposes, or whether they are taking more speculative positions. Building on the Liffe recommendations, the Pensions Research Accountants Group (Prag), an association of 200 UK pension fund practitioners, last month published a document on the use of futures and options by pension funds which provides broader guidance for trustees, investment and pension fund managers on how best to meet reporting, control and performance measurement demands. The report focuses on strategies and risks to be considered by trustees and ways of constraining investment managers. Prag supports Liffe's view on reporting futures on an 'associated economic exposure' basis - looking at the total exposure of a particular position, rather than just taking account of the initial margin payment. In the more complex area of options, the compromise solution is to account for premiums paid and received, and mark option prices to market. In fact, this does not fully reflect exposure, since accurate reporting requires technical calculations of the relationship between cash prices and option prices. As the participation of investment managers in derivatives business grows, the attention given to back-office problems will also be encouraged. At present, unfamiliarity with the complex products involved has made derivatives something of a bugbear with the back-office staff.</p>

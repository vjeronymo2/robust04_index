			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Observer: Hyper-market Whatever do the initials 'CHyp' after a person's name denote? If that person is Tom Leigh, director of 3T Publications, one of the companies now in provisional liquidation thanks to the UK government's clamp-down on 'pyramid' schemes, the logical conclusion might be 'Certificate in Hype'. It transpires instead, in a letter circulated by 3T, that Leigh is trained as a hypnotherapist at the 'well-known and highly-respected Proudfoot School of Hypnosis and Psychotherapy at Scarborough'. Here at last an explanation as to why all those 'investors' opened their wallets with such alacrity to a notion so fundamentally flawed?</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US 'drags heels' over Gatt rulings THE US is putting in jeopardy the international trade dispute settlement system because of its 'seriously deficient record' in complying with rulings against it, according to a US study*. The study examined 207 complaints put before dispute settlement panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade during its 42-year history from 1948 to 1989. Professor Robert Hudec and colleagues at the University of Minnesota conclude that 'no resolution of the current malaise in Gatt legal affairs will be possible without a change in the basic US legal policy - some kind of reconciliation between the current US legal preoccupation with obtaining a fair deal, and the recognition of an obligation to use legal means to secure one'. The study nevertheless concludes that the Gatt system of settling international trade disputes 'has produced many impressive successes'. Four out of five valid complaints were dealt with successfully, it says. A high percentage of the Gatt panel failures dealt with disputes over anti-dumping actions, or countervailing duties, the study finds. It suggests this could be due to the 'typical arbitrariness' of the criteria for finding dumping, and the legal rigidity of measures, once taken. The US has ignored Gatt panel rulings on four of the 14 occasions it has been found to be violating international trade rules  - all four in the past decade. Only Canada comes near, having ignored two out of nine rulings against it. 'Just as the US played a leading role in building the Gatt dispute settlement procedure to its present state of effectiveness, so the US has played the leading role in placing those accomplishments in jeopardy today,' the study concludes. It suggests US reluctance to accept Gatt rulings may be due to increasing use of Gatt to settle disputes, and the independence of its findings: 'When a legal system starts pressing harder, the first to resist will be those who are accustomed to having their own way.' * 'A Statistical Profile of Gatt Dispute Settlement Cases, 1948-1989', by Hudec, Kennedy and Sgarbossa, in the Winter 1993 edition of the Minnesota Journal of Global Trade, University of Minnesota Law School.</p>

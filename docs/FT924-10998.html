			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Tourism fails language test ONLY a third of companies dealing with foreign tourists can cope fully with customers' language needs, according to a survey for the British Tourist Authority and the Department of Employment, Michael Skapinker writes. Although more than 90 per cent of the companies responding to the survey said their staff came into contact with native speakers of other languages, 63 per cent relied to at least some extent on customers being able to speak English. The tourist authority said the survey, conducted by the Institute of Manpower Studies, may have presented too optimistic a picture. A total of 1,500 companies were sent the questionnaire and 29.4 per cent responded. The authority said companies with a commitment to foreign language skills were more likely to have responded. Although 70 per cent of respondents said their language needs would increase, only 45 per cent planned to step up training.</p>

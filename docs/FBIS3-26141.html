Autonomous regional leaders  Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun attended  the conference.    In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1993, Xinjiang  unremittingly carried out the central task of economic  construction and endeavored to solve salient problems that had  surfaced during the course of economic operations, in accordance  with the arrangements made by the autonomous regional party  committee's work conference. This helped promote economic  development. The gross regional product in 1993 is expected to  total 37.7 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 10 percent  over the preceding year.    In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1994, Xinjiang  should strengthen the status of agriculture as the foundation of  the national economy, and stabilize the household contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, as  well as the dual management system that combines household with  collective operations. It should make efforts to restructure  the rural economy and crop farming, and steadfastly engage in  the construction of infrastructure, basic industries, and  industries producing major raw and semifinished materials, in  order to ease "bottlenecks" and create fine conditions for  developing the economy and opening up to the outside world. In  1994, we should place greater emphasis on assessing and making  flexible use of our reserves and assets, and intensify  technological transformation, while maintaining moderate growth  in capital construction investment. To meet the demands of  exploration and development at the three major oil fields in  Xinjiang, we should closely integrate technical transformation  with capital construction, develop a number of related  industries that serve the needs of oil fields, and promote oil  field development. We should ensure that oil fields and the  local economy spur each other on for the sake of common  development.    While continuing to accelerate economic development in the  comprehensive economic development belt north of Tian Shan, we  should also place great emphasis on economic development in  southern Xinjiang. We should increase capital construction  investment, expedite poverty relief work, and gradually narrow  the gap between southern and northern Xinjiang.</p>

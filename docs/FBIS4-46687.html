			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by Academician Abel Aganbegyan recorded by </F> Nadezhda Ilyinskaya: "Academician Abel Aganbegyan: The Way Out  of the Crisis Lies Through the Growth of Investment"]    [Text] Beginning in the middle of 1993, a new  condition started in the economy of our country. Before that  time, it was possible to influence the rate of decline in  production with the help of monetary infusions, whereas from the  middle of 1993 on, the fall in the volume of production  deteriorated and measures to provide monetary grants for  production almost failed to influence its dynamics.    This was manifested in a particularly pronounced form at the  end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. Between October and  December 1993, the rate of inflation was reduced from 23 to 13  percent, but this did not influence the dynamics of production  in any way. In January of this year, the rate of inflation  soared to 23 percent again due to the payments made at the end  of last year. It would appear that this should have given an  incentive to producers; besides, consumers also got extra money.  However, contrary to all projections, the volume of industrial  production suddenly fell by 25 percent (compared to January  1992)--a magnitude without parallel to date. In February, the  rate of inflation fell to 13 percent, and in March to as low as  8 percent, but the fall in production remained the way it was in  January. On the whole, the decline in the first quarter came to  24 percent. In the opinion of many experts, we have  entered a new depressed stage of the economic crisis whereby  there already is little dependence between the financial policy  of the state and the continuing slump in production. Many  people agree that at present it is impossible to stop the drop  until the volume of the production hits the bottom of the crisis  which is expected by the end of this year. In the process, the  volume of production at this lowest point will come to  approximately 40 percent of the 1990 volume.  <H5>  What Is To Be Done </H5>   As the experience of the world indicates, it will primarily  be investment that will ultimately help to overcome the crisis  in the economy. Suppressing inflation is the main prerequisite  for a transition to investment activity. The program of  government plans to reduce the monthly rate of inflation to 7-9  percent by the end of the year. In his message, President Boris  Yeltsin referred to an even lower percentage rate of  inflation--5-7 percent. As the experience of the first quarter  and April indicates, this is a realistic task.    Following the lowering of the inflation rate, interest rates  charged by banks will begin to fall. This has already been  announced by the Central Bank of Russia by way of planning major  reductions in interest rates on credit. Lower inflation and  interest rates and the stabilization of the exchange rate of the  ruble and the dollar which is associated with this will provide  incentives for saving. Lower interest rates on capital will  lengthen the period of credit extension. In this manner, the  conditions will first of all improve for medium-term investment,  especially foreign-exchange investment. The demand for producer  goods will begin to grow which will gradually pull along other  sectors of the economy. This process could be accelerated if  more favorable conditions for the attraction of foreign capital  were created.  <H5>  Money Is Available All Right.... </H5>   In essence, the existing severe crisis of production is  primarily a demand crisis. The manufacturing of individual  products is dropping because there is no demand for them. When  production falls the specific cost of production increases thus  hindering price reductions which could stimulate demand.  Characteristically, lower demand is not at all firmly associated  with a lack of monetary funds. By now, more than $20 billion has  been amassed in foreign-exchange accounts in Russia; another  approximately $18 billion (according to realistic estimates) is  being kept by Russian citizens and organizations at foreign  banks. Every day, R0.7-1.0 trillion is produced at currency  trading sessions to be exchanged into Marks or dollars. The  activity of the population in acquiring various shares,  securities, and so on is known. Money is available but, as is  the case in all market economies, an overwhelming proportion of  it is concentrated in the possession of the population.  Meanwhile, our economy which was formed during the era of a  totalitarian state and centralized planning is primarily geared  toward meeting the needs of the military-industrial complex and  heavy industry, and to a lesser degree toward meeting the  requirements of consumers. Hence the structural crisis and a  particularly sharp decline in the output of the  military-industrial complex and heavy industry which used to  thrive on orders and the sectors stimulated through state  subsidies (such as tractor and farm machinery building).    A peculiar situation has emerged: The population (more  precisely, its affluent segment), as well as some of the  enterprises and organizations, have money, but they are not  inclined to spend it to acquire domestic goods of inferior  quality, and at high prices, to boot. It is also difficult to  purchase imported goods because of high duties on imports, and  consumers are waiting for better times to come.    As has already been said, both the reduction in the rate of  inflation which has begun and the hardening of the macroeconomic  policy proclaimed by the government create favorable conditions  for overcoming the crisis through a rise in investment.  <H5>  Who Is Threatened With Bankruptcy? </H5>   At the same time, we should be aware of the fact that lower  inflation will cause the bankruptcy of:    a) many banks, which will be unable to recover the credit  extended due to the insolvency of the enterprises and  organizations using credit which hoped to make money by selling  goods at high prices in the inflationary environment. It is  estimated that more than one-half of the existing banks may pass  from the stage, and both organizations and the population that  have deposited money at these banks will suffer losses. The  above also applies to investment funds and various credit and  finance institutions. This process has already begun, and it  will mount rapidly;    b) many intermediate commercial structures engaging in  speculative operations on the basis of the inflationary growth  of prices will also go bankrupt. Almost all small companies  which profiteered by selling sugar have already disappeared  because the wholesale price of sugar in Russia is decreasing.  Regular trade in it has become unprofitable;    c) many enterprises will go bankrupt whose products are not  in demand at the prices set by these enterprises, prices that  are due to high production outlays (the latter is associated  with the inefficiency of production). Bankruptcy does not  necessarily mean the liquidation of a given enterprise; the  enterprise may be placed under a larger commercial structure  which will assume the debts and in the future may organize more  effective production at the facilities of the enterprise.  <H5>  To Survive Intelligently </H5>   Of course, a majority of the enterprises will survive during  this, perhaps the most difficult time of the period of  transition to a market economy. However, they will be able to  survive solely by reducing the cost of production because it  will be impossible to pass on their excessive costs to the  consumer in the environment of a sales crisis. Reducing the  strength, spinning off the ineffective sections of enterprises,  and switching to strict austerity measures in all areas are the  easiest paths toward cost reductions.    The growth of unemployment will come as a result of this  process which is unfolding before our eyes and which will  intensify. At present, registered unemployed in Russia account  for approximately 1 percent of labor force. By using their  methods for the calculation of the number of unemployed,  unemployment experts from Western Europe have actually found  that the unemployed account for 5-6 percent of the labor force,  including those who work shorter workdays or have been  furloughed without pay. It is projected that by the end of the  year this statistic can grow to 7-10 percent which will  substantially depend on the activities of the state. The state  may provide incentives for the creation of new jobs, organize  public works to use the nonworking population, and so on.    A social program of assistance to the unemployed has yet to  be seriously thought through. The existence of mass unemployment  which is characteristic of countries with market economies is  the largest social problem, social ill, and plague of society  which we will have to encounter to the fullest extent shortly.    The issue of insolvency of enterprises is inseparably linked  to all of the above problems. The total indebtedness of  enterprises has come to about R32 trillion, of which defaulted  payments come to R16 trillion. The volume of indebtedness comes  to approximately 10 percent of the gross national product which  is generally quite significant but not fatal.  <H5>  There Is No Panacea; a Set of Measures Is Needed </H5>   As is known, in the second half of 1992 the insolvency of  enterprises was sharply reduced by way of mutual clearing on one  hand and the provision of funds on preferential terms to  replenish the working capital of enterprises on the other. This  made it possible to reduce total nonpayments from R3.2 trillion  in the middle of 1992 to R400 billion in the fourth quarter of  the same year. That is to say, in comparable prices the  reduction came to a factor of more than 20. Unfortunately, this  experience taught us nothing; no economic mechanism was worked  out for the organization of regular payments in the economy. As  a result, mutual insolvency began to mount gradually in the face  of government inaction during all of 1993 and the first quarter  of 1994. The time has now come to take measures because due to  such indebtedness the payment of wages is delayed and individual  enterprises shut down, which is fraught with the most serious  consequences. A single measure, a panacea for all troubles in  this area hardly exists; a set of measures to fundamentally  improve the system of payments in the national economy is needed.    First, the requirement to pay before the contractual  deadline  should be made stricter. At present, many enterprises have funds  but nonetheless delay payment for the products already received.  The arbitration mechanism is imperfect, slow, and ineffective in  this area. In a number of cases, the supplier may not refuse to  deliver products because this has been ordained by the state  (for example, the delivery of oil to specific refineries). In  the process, neither the state nor the consumer himself is  liable for the timing of the payment, which also needs to be  corrected.    The cycle of nonpayments frequently runs into and is  sustained by the hopelessly ineffective enterprises which are  "in debt up to their eyeballs," and there are no prospects in  view for them. In this case, there is only one way out--to  declare the enterprises bankrupt and to break the entire  insolvency cycle.    The use of bills of exchange, including those with bank  guarantees, is one of the possible devices for bringing  temporary insolvency into regular confines. In this area, the  initiative of the Tveruniversalbank impresses many people.  <H5>  Small Business Is a Major Thing </H5>   The development of small businesses is an important  condition  for overcoming the crisis, alleviating unemployment, and raising  the standard of living of individual groups of the populace.  Russia is virtually the only country that does not grant  major preferences for the development of legal small  businesses. At the same time, small business companies  enjoy major tax relief and financial and other support from the  state in countries with developed market economies. For this  reason, the number of small business companies is usually  counted in millions (France, Italy, Japan, the United States,  and others), and the number of their employees exceeds 3 percent  of the total number of the population.    As far as Russia is concerned, about 450 [as published]  small  enterprises and organizations have been officially registered  (0.3 percent of the total population). At the same time,  hundreds of thousands of other small organizations operate  illegally and engage in small business through stands and flea  markets, through the system of customer orders, and so on,  paying no taxes in the process. The development of small  businesses will make it possible to substantially increase the  employment of the population in the environment of looming  unemployment and also to provide additional income for many  families. Besides, this is the most dynamic sector of the  economy, which quickly adapts to changing conditions and,  consequently, ensures that public needs are met to a fuller  extent.    Large state enterprises, which have been unable to genuinely  plug into the market and largely continue to manufacture old  products not sufficiently in demand are facing the most  difficult situation in the crisis environment. Enterprises that  have technically been converted to the joint-stock format are  among such enterprises. At the same time, privately owned  enterprises and organizations (in our country, they are  frequently referred to as "commercial structures") survive with  greater success, and many altogether prosper. In conjunction  with this, genuine privatization--one of the most important  prerequisites for starting up the market mechanism and turning  it into an engine of growth--becomes tremendously important.  <H5>  Where Is the Genuine Proprietor? </H5>   An overwhelming proportion of Russian enterprises converted  to the joint-stock format has actually passed through the first  stage of such conversion--the private distribution of shares and  check auctions at which on the average 20 percent of the package  of shares were sold. Neither the arrangement of private  subscription nor sales at check auctions have yielded actual  financial resources which are necessary for the recovery and  development of the newly created joint-stock enterprises. The  assembly line of investment tenders that was promised in the  privatization program has failed to kick in. The number of  investment tenders is two orders of magnitude smaller than that  of check auctions. Therefore, an overwhelming majority of  enterprises that converted to the joint-stock format have not  been appraised by the market and, consequently, have not found  their genuine proprietor. Meanwhile, it is precisely finding a  genuine proprietor that is the essence of privatization. To this  end, the stock of a given enterprise needs to be appraised by  the market and sold and bought freely. Such stock will be  gradually redistributed through the stock market, and a  considerable proportion of it will end up in the possession of  individual commercial structures, banks, or groups of persons  whether or not employed at the enterprise in question. The main  point is for this proprietor to have a vested financial interest  in the profitable, gainful operation of the enterprise in  question, to believe in it, to invest funds, and to facilitate  its development, i.e. behave as a zealous proprietor would.    Actually, the entire post-privatization operation of an  enterprise will be associated with determining the market price  of this enterprise, finding a "proprietor"--the main owner,  restructuring, and possibly changing the output mix of the  enterprise in question in order to produce more effective  results.    First, attention should be focused on marketing services. In  the market, the main point is to sell goods rather than produce  them. Large companies should have proprietary or subsidiary  commercial organizations or dealers to sell or service products.  Vertically integrated companies that engage not only in  producing raw materials but include the entire chain all the way  to the consumer are the most effective in the market. Oil  companies whose main business is the processing of oil,  production of petrochemicals, and in particular their own chains  of gas stations rather than oil production are a vivid example.  Compare this to a majority of our oil associations, and their  ineffectiveness and low profit margins will become easy to  understand. However, the first embryos of vertically integrated  companies are also appearing in this lagging sector (Lukoyl,  YUKAS).    Second, the closest possible attention should be paid to the  development of the financial services of enterprises. In many  cases, special financial corporations reporting to large  producers should be established, and industrial enterprises need  to be transformed into industrial and financial groups. Few  joint-stock companies actually use their potential for public  shareholding; meanwhile, joint-stock companies are mostly formed  to attract additional capital. Some Germes or, worse yet,  Neftalmazinvest which have virtually no property raise tens and  at times hundreds of billions of rubles by issuing various  securities, promising high dividends, and so on, whereas our  largest oil and diamond-producing enterprises possessing  enormous property do nothing to this end and go without funds.    Third, strong legal services are necessary.    Therefore, a fundamental reorientation of the operation of  enterprises is necessary. It would also be good to eliminate  from circulation the term "industrial enterprise," and rather  refer to them as firms, companies, and societies, and establish  such, meaning by this the entire cycle of operations that  includes not only production, on which we used be fixated most  of all in the past, but also commerce and finance.    [Begin box] Taxes have altogether smothered  enterprises, and the 1994 budget is no exception. Once again,  additional taxes are being introduced, and some of those already  in existence are being made stricter. Given this tax load, no  leeway is left for maneuvering.    I found the highest tax--92.5 percent--at the  Surgutneft, the only prosperous association. This is a disaster!  Clearly, with taxes like this it is impossible to do anything,  to either drill wells or prospect for oil; nor is there money to  sustain the social sphere.    At present, the government understands that the crisis  will not be overcome with such taxes. I think that a certain  lightening of the tax burden will follow soon. [end box]</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The Long View: Pensions? That's rich] COULD THE government possibly be against motherhood, apple pie and pensions? Well, pensions, anyway? When former chancellor Norman Lamont reduced the tax credit on UK company dividends from 25 to 20 per cent in his March Budget, the pensions industry was torn between pretending nothing had really happened and pressing the panic button. A deafening silence followed while the Society of Pension Consultants calculated that the change would cost occupational pension funds some Pounds 500m in lost income, with holders of personal pension plans losing another Pounds 100m. Measured against the scale of total assets of the order of Pounds 500bn and annual investment income of about Pounds 20bn, these are perhaps insignificant sums in themselves. But the Treasury has begun to attack the tax privileges of pension funds. Moreover, it has done it in a sneaky way, pretending that its main objective was to help companies rather than raise revenue. Now, the pensions industry has decided that fire must be returned against the snipers. A body with the catchy title of the Occupational Pension Schemes Joint Working Group has protested that the tax structure for pension schemes must be preserved. More broadly, the National Association of Pension Funds has launched a campaign dubbed Pensions: Securing the Future, posing the threat of a 'pensions under-class' as state pensions dwindle in size and the coverage of occupational schemes becomes more patchy. There is certainly a case for clearer thinking on pensions. The government appears to have got into a muddle over its tax policies. On the one hand, it expended enormous efforts and large amounts of money in the 1980s in promoting personal pension plans (of which there are now 4.5m holders). But now it is eroding the tax relief which has made such pension plans attractive. Interestingly, Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, added his own angle to the pensions debate this week through his statistical document The Growth of Social Security. His concern was to prevent the bill for social security outstripping the nation's ability to pay. For the time being, pensioners pose less of a problem than other groups dependent on state support, such as single mothers. But as we move into the 21st century and the demographic balance changes, the elderly may become more of a burden. The basic case for state involvement in pensions is that if people become destitute in old age, the state will have to sustain them, anyway, so it is wise to arrange a long-term financial structure through which the retired can be supported. This can be done either through pay-as-you-go systems, in which contributions are recycled immediately to pensioners (which is how the state scheme works), or by the build-up of occupational or personal funds. A subsidiary argument here is that savings should, in any case, be encouraged for various reasons. Yet, Inland Revenue-approved pension schemes are, in many respects, poor ways of doing this because they lock people's savings away for decades in remote funds and institutions of sometimes dubious security; force them to take a certain type of income benefit; and destroy the option of passing personal wealth on to the next generation. In any case, the anti-destitution motive has become confused by the exploits of the well-advised rich. Thus, we have the example of Sir Anthony Tennant, retiring chairman of Guinness, taking legitimate advantage of tax reliefs to collect a Pounds 500,000-plus annual pension. Should the government really be supporting this kind of benefit level though tax concessions? In fact, several years ago the government imposed a 'cap' on qualifying incomes; this year, it has been frozen at Pounds 75,000 rather than rising in line with inflation (Sir Anthony escaped this, as do all employees who joined their schemes before 1989). This ceiling is surely too high; even so, it has attracted great fury from pensions professionals, which shows the extent to which pension regulations have become turned into a great middle-class tax break rather than a solution to the problem of poverty in old age. The poor are always with us, but many retired people are now unusually prosperous. Occupational pension schemes have been heavily in surplus, and have been able to top-up pensions in line with inflation to a greater extent than ever before. Many old people also benefited from the extraordinary house price boom of the 1980s. Between 1986 and 1991 inclusive, equity withdrawal (the extent to which new mortgage lending exceeded physical investment in housing) averaged about Pounds 14bn a year, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's new Housing Finance Review. Retired people will have received much of this. But equity withdrawal collapsed to Pounds 3.5bn last year, and the housing miracle cannot be worked again in the foreseeable future. If we are to have a debate on retirement provision, my initial position would be to say that we should preserve and improve basic state provision and encourage a funded second tier up to twice average incomes. Beyond that, people should be left to accumulate their own wealth. They could still be given access to tax-sheltered investments like personal equity plans. This is not the kind of emphasis that the NAPF itself would make, given that it represents wealthy corporate schemes. Nor would it please the host of consultants who make most of their living by selling tax-saving schemes to executives in small private companies. But if the 'cap' were brought lower down the income scale, it would still be possible for companies to offer various other employee benefits should they wish to do so. As for pensions, the arguments could be focused more accurately on the problems of the poor rather than, as too often happens now, on the needs of the rich.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Ministry 'may cut 30% of jobs' Up to 30 per cent of 11,000 jobs at the Ministry of Agriculture may be cut over the next two to three years, the IPMS civil service union said yesterday. The cuts, part of a government review of civil service staff levels, begin with at least 550 jobs due to go by next March. The initial reduction of at least 5 per cent, designed to cut running costs, is due to take effect through early retirement. But Mr David Luxton, IPMS national officer for agriculture, said fewer than half the 630 staff invited to apply were believed to have done so by this week's deadline. Only those aged over 50 in middle management grades and above have been asked to seek early retirement. 'Our fear is that we will move towards compulsory redundancies next year,' he said. Compulsory redundancies were introduced at the ministry for the first time in June, with 64 consultancy jobs lost at Adas, the advisory agency being privatised, he said. The IPMS, which represents about 3,000 senior and specialist staff at the ministry, said it was expecting more staff cuts as a result of a review of senior grades and a review of all aspects of ministry spending, both ordered by the Treasury. Mr Luxton said the senior staff review was modelled on that of the Treasury, which announced last month that about one in four senior jobs would go. The agriculture jobs targeted would mainly be those of advisers on the rural economy, food production and safety, and animal welfare. Mr Luxton warned that the 'arbitrary' cuts in staff numbers would lead to delays and a deterioration in services to farmers.</p>

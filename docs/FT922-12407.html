			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Travel Books: Notes on the end of history 'IF YOU POSSIBLY can, avoid cottage cheese pancakes in Slovakia, especially cottage cheese and strawberry ones from the Hotel Start in Kezmarok', writes Giles Whittell in Lambada Country: A Ride Across Eastern Europe (Chapmans, Pounds 14.99). 'Just thinking about them makes me want to be sick again. They had tinned strawberries inside and chocolate sauce on top. Never a promising combination. And for cottage cheese, read bacteria bonanza.' A paragraph like that - constructed with the precision of a very expensive cocktail - tells you all to need to know about Giles Whittell and his six-month bike ride, in the spring of 1990, from the Baltic to the Black Sea (Hannover to Istanbul, actually, by way of Prague, Gdansk, Warsaw, Cracow, Budapest, Timisoara, Bucharest, Sofia and Burgas). It tells you that you are in the hands of a really good reporter-writer, someone who knows instinctively about pace and detail and has the wit to shove the stiletto home with bacteria bonanza. As his publisher says, 1990 was too soon to be writing history but a great time to be making notes and writing them up - the boys from Stasi, international pollsters (would you credit it), black marketeers, spies turned locksmiths, vodka bums, rockers, spivs, alpinists, Mormons, Margareta (who is crazy about the mamba), lovers, all of them observed from the inside as the rotten empire writhes in final chaos and disillusion. 'Like thousands of others', says Whittell, 'I wanted to see eastern Europe before it disappeared and became a mere annex of western Europe . . . Once there, the idea was to ask whether the revolutions had made a difference - to the beer, the newspapers, the prospect of going to work on a Monday morning, the way policemen spoke to you, the availability of bicycle spares . . . And, if I'm honest, I had nothing better to be doing.' Lambada Country deserves to sell tens of thousands of copies. Not that the publishing biz is short of energetic young men travelling, by one means or other, from the Baltic to the Black Sea as history coughs and splutters. In Stalin's Nose: Across the Face of Europe (HarperCollins, Pounds 14.99), Rory MacLean rattles from Potsdam to Bucharest by Trabant in the company of Aunt Zita and Winston the pig who fell on Uncle Peter's head and consequently killed him, which is how things got started in the first place. Unfortunately, MacLean is one of those travel writers who relies far too heavily on dialogue. There is so much reported speech in Stalin's Nose that you wonder how on earth he recorded or remembered it all. You can skim through a country in a rented car, hardly touching its surfaces, eating packaged biscuits, drinking bottled water; or you can travel close to the ground, getting under its skin, eating crocodile and monkey, finishing up in prison (if only for eight hours). This is what Lieve Joris, a Flemish journalist, does in Back to the Congo (translated by Stacey Knecht, Macmillan, Pounds 14.99), in which she retraces the steps of her uncle, a Catholic missionary, in Zaire, formerly the Belgian Congo. A book that will appeal to African safari lovers is Aaron Latham's The Frozen Leopard (HarperCollins, Pounds 14.99), part of the Destination series, for which Jan Morris makes some risible claims on the dustjacket. She really ought to control herself. Latham is ok - the book is about Kenya and Rwanda - but it is oh-so-foolish to speak of him in the same breath as Hemingway, Dinesen and Conrad, as naughty HarperCollins does. In the Middle Ages, an estimated 500,000 pilgrims arrived annually at the shrine of St James the Great in Santiago de Compostela. These days, the number is down to about 5,000. Modern pilgrims travel on foot, by bike, by horse, van, bus or car. Many drive as far as Roncesvalles in the Pyrenees and walk the remaining 700 kms, taking about a month. What is it all about? What do they think they are doing? You will find most of the answers, plus some nice pictures by John Miller, in James Bentley's earnestly researched The Way of Saint James (Pavillion Books, Pounds 14.99)  -a journey through faith and history, as his publisher aptly calls it. Escape to the Dales by Bob Allen (Michael Joseph, Pounds 13.99) is charming, with some very fine photographs: 45 walks in and around the Yorkshire Dales. Why labour through Ribblesdale and Dentdale, Wensleydale and Swaledale, Wharfedale and Nidderdale, when you can sit in Notting Hill and have it done for you?</p>

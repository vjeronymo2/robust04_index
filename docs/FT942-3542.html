			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cropper doubles to Pounds 2.6m Increased sales volume and reduced interest charges helped James Cropper, the Cumbria-based paper and board manufacturer, announce record profits. On turnover ahead 13 per cent, to Pounds 45.7m, profits before tax more than doubled from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 2.56m for the 53 weeks ended April 2. The directors attributed a 'significant reduction' in borrowings to the group's strong cash flow. Order books were currently full and sales above budget. A recommended final dividend of 2.4p brings the total for the period to 3.5p (3.1p) covered over 5 times by earnings of 19p (9.4p) per share.</p>

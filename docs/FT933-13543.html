			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Brooke to warn on arts spending MR Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, will tell the Arts Council this week it should be more accountable for the money it spends. He will make a Commons statement following last month's report from Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, which showed that the council spends 10p on administration out of every Pounds 1 it receives for the arts. Last year the council distributed Pounds 225m for arts projects.</p>

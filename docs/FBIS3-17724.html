The decision was  taken at the emergency parliament session which closed on  Saturday night. The session transformed the parliament into a  people's assembly.    Before the decision was taken, the parliament regulations  were changed because deputies of the Russian nationality left  the session. The session also formed the legislative committee  of the Republic's People's Assembly, which consists of 27  deputies representing the main nationalities of the republic.  Elected to it were five deputies from each of the Abazin,  Nogai, Karachai and Circassian nationalities and one deputy from  each of Ossetian and Greek nationalities. It is decided to  elect to the legislative committee five deputies of the Russian  nationality at the next stage of the session scheduled for 1  April.    The decisions of the emergency session have caused a very  negative reaction among the public movements and parties of  Karachai-Circassian Republic which stand for the holding of  democratic elections on 24 April.</p>

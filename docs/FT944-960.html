			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Lira recovers as political crisis nears climax The lira bounced off recent lows yesterday, with markets apparently taking the view that the worst was now over in Italy, writes Philip Gawith. Although the political outlook remains extremely murky, investors are taking heart from the fact that the current period of political instability is nearing a close. The lira closed in London at L1,045 per D-Mark, from L1,049. Earlier it had reached a high in Europe of L1,043. Elsewhere, the French franc hit its lowest level against the D-Mark since December 1, 1993. It ended at FFr3.454, from FFr3.451, as rumours about President Mitterrand's health, and continued political uncertainty, bothered traders. Those currency moves which took place were exaggerated by thin trading conditions. The decision by the FOMC to leave US interest rates on hold elicited negligible market response. The dollar traded in extremely narrow ranges to finish at DM1.5703 and Y100.17, from Tuesday's closes of DM1.5720 and Y100.3 before the FOMC announcement. But in New York the currency firmed to end at DM1.5805 and Y100.47. In Mexico, the peso continued its downward slide after the 15 per cent devaluation on Tuesday. It closed at 3.987 pesos to the dollar, from 3.885. Sterling had a quiet day, finishing at DM2.4527, from DM2.4491. Today the focus is on the meeting of the Bundesbank council. No change in rates is expected, but the announcement of the target range for M3 growth in 1995 will be closely watched. The key features of Mr Berlusconi's address to parliament were that the existing coalition is dead, and fresh elections are inevitable. Analysts said the bounce back in the lira could be attributed to traders, with short lira positions, taking profits. Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said an early election would probably be the worst outcome from a markets perspective. With elections unlikely to be held during winter, it could be as long as May before a new government was installed. The lack of government in the interim would unsettle financial markets. This need not be all gloom and doom. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, points out that in the second quarter of 1993 a consensus non-political figure head (Amato) presided over a 10 per cent rise in the lira against the D-Mark. By contrast, the lira has fallen by around 10 per cent since April 12, two weeks after Mr Berlusconi took office. Rumours that President Mitterrand would be stopping chemo-therapy treatment caused concern, with some observers believing it could advance the election timetable. Another factor worrying investors is the possibility that German interest rates will rise. If the Bank of France fails to follow suit immediately, the franc could suffer. Political risk is also becoming an increasingly important factor with the franc as the presidential elections draw near. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said fears of the public debate 'lurching towards Euro-scepticism', now that Mr Jacques Delors had withdrawn, were overdone. He said it was 'far from obvious that a Chirac victory would mean a permanently weaker currency'. He predicted a downside of FFr3.50 against the D-Mark. In the more likely event of victory for the current prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, Mr Jessop forecasts the franc appreciating towards FFr3.38 by the end of 1995. Helped by the bullish tone of US financial markets, there was a late rally in short sterling. The March contract traded around 24,000 lots, to end 10 basis points up at 92.70. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, commented: 'There have been a lot of stories about tough trading conditions, with retailers putting their hopes on a last minute surge in sales. If that fails to materialise, prospects of an early rise in UK rates look misplaced.' In its daily operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 950m shortage, the bulk of it with late assistance. Mr Parsons said this could reflect clearing banks holding back bills in an attempt to push up short-dated lending rates ahead of a five-day holiday period. The Bank eased liquidity conditions by injecting Pounds 1.73bn into the market through its repo facility.</p>

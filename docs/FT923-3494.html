			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Deal hint helps the generators THE two big power generators, National Power and PowerGen, were the best performers in the FT-SE 100 Index, advancing 9.6 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively, on hints that a new coal supply deal with British Coal, favourable to the generators, is about to be announced. Negotiation of a new contract with the power generating companies is a pre-requisite for the government's privatisation of British Coal which is planned to proceed later this year. Utilities specialists were not entirely convinced by the rumours and British Coal insisted that the supply deal is still in negotiation. One analyst said the rumours perhaps referred merely to proposals put forward by the generators, adding that there was a significant risk that a new deal may not be agreed before the September 16 deadline. In that case, the government would impose its own terms, which might not be viewed favourably in the stock market. National Power closed 22 1/2 stronger at 257p after volume of 13m shares, and PowerGen 18 1/2 up at 270p on 12m traded. Vickers upset Engineering group Vickers registered the day's biggest percentage fall after trading worries and technical factors upset the shares. Problems are said to have surfaced during trials of Vickers' Challenger 2 tank, and a leading securities house is reported to have taken a particularly bearish stance because of continued poor sales at its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary. A line of stock was said to have been on offer early in the session. At worst the shares were down 18 but came off the bottom with the market to end a net 14 off at 84p, their lowest close since January 1985. Cadbury caution Foods concern Cadbury Schweppes fell 14 to 415p on reflection of the group's interim figures. The profits, at Pounds 121.5m, were above the range of analysts' forecasts but the subsequent meeting provoked caution and full-year estimates were brought back to the Pounds 335m level. Cadbury said its main markets were still difficult and exchange rates would have an increasingly negative impact in the second half. The effect of Cadbury's results ran over into the performance of United Biscuits, which is due to release first-half figures today and retreated 10 to 235p. Full-year profits from pharmaceuticals group Glaxo were in line with forecasts but the shares closed 7 down on the day at 746p with 7m traded. It was a classic case of its being better to travel than arrive. The shares had risen ahead of the figures and would have only improved further on unforeseen good news. Goldman Sachs analyst Mr Paul Krikler said of the Pounds 1.427bn profit: 'I think these are good figures and show the underlying strength of the company and its products.' Most analysts were particularly pleased by the continued growth of Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug Zantac. London International Group recovered 12 to 174p after agency broker James Capel published a note pointing out that the shares were cheap at the current level. The latest batch of results from a building sector reeling from dividend cuts and trading losses provided much needed relief. John Laing turned in profits slightly down from last year's but generally well ahead of most estimates, and a same again dividend. The post-results meeting with building analysts was said to have gone extremely well and the shares rose sharply by 11 to 120p. Blue Circle declined to 127p before rebounding to finish unchanged at 134p after delivering half-year profits in line with most forecasts and a maintained interim dividend. Amec, however, was the latest of the housebuilder/contractors to chop its interim, halving the payment and saying the final would get the same treatment. The stock retreated to 58p before ending a net 7 down at 60p. Enterprise Oil forged ahead 6.4 per cent, clawing back some of the ground lost last week when Hoare Govett, acting for a single institution, sold a 2.1 per cent block of the shares. The rise, which left the stock 19 higher at 317p, followed a maintained interim dividend and slightly higher than expected net profits. Mr Alan Sinclair at Smith New Court said that with its production profile growing the shares 'should be nearer 350p', and offered good long term attractions. Shell appreciated 6 to 467p as the market displayed its satisfaction with the near 4 1/2 per cent increase in the interim dividend, at the top end of expectations and 'enough to keep the market reasonably happy', said Mr Keith Morris of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. A couple of big trades in National Westminster accounted for much of the day's business of 4.6m shares and the stock settled 2 higher at 319p. Prudential was aggressively bought, adding 9 at 245p, still boosted by Wednesday's excellent results. Textiles company Coats Viyella receded 10 to 155p after warning that second-half profits were likely to be affected by conditions in Brazil, poor UK trading, a weaker dollar and a debt level which remained higher than expected. Forecasts for the full year were chopped by around Pounds 5m to the Pounds 125m level. The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, recovered 22 to 514p after announcing increased interim results. Food distributor and manufacturer Booker dropped 22 to 325p after reporting lower than expected half-time profits. The company also said it had seen no sign of an end to recession. J. Sainsbury was under continued pressure, with a seller of 800,000 shares prompting the stock price to slide 16 to 430p. A 7 per cent increase in half-year profits and improved dividend at conglomerate BTR helped the shares jump 19 to 425p in brisk trade of 5.1m. Paper recycler David S. Smith saw very heavy turnover after Credit Lyonnais Laing crossed a block of 3m shares, more than 2.4 per cent of the shares in issue, between institutions at 250p. The stock fell 20 to 253p. Granada Group dipped 6 to 240p. A leading broker was reported to have bought a block of around 5m shares at 239p and started selling them at 240 1/2 p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (6).

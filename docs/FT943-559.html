			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine details trading switch arrangements Jardine Matheson has outlined the arrangements for investors to trade in group company shares on the Singapore stock exchange following its withdrawal from Hong Kong. It will bear the costs of switching into the Singapore clearing and settlement system and has further arranged with nine local brokerages to levy a maximum commission charge of 0.5 per cent on retail transactions in shares of Jardine companies. Shareholders will still find the cost of dealing more expensive than in Hong Kong, where the normal trade levy is 0.42 per cent including stamp duty and transaction levy.</p>

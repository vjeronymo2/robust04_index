A government official said on Monday  that the system would be an effective means of preventing  disputes stemming from the two sides' different setups. The  system would also help minimize South Korean investment risks in  North Korea as there are currently no bilateral investment  guarantees.    If the two sides reached agreement, the form of trade and  investment contracts would be formalized at a private level  subject to approval by government authorities.    "We have conceived of the idea in the belief that chances  are  slim for the conclusion of a governmental South-North investment  guarantee agreement in the foreseeable future," the official  said.    The South is now working on a draft and when significant  progress is seen in the nuclear issue, it will raise the issue  with the North, the official said.    Japan and China introduced a standard contract system prior  to normalizing diplomatic relations.</p>

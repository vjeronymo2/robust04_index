			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (8): Impetus for industrial renewal - Buy-outs still dominate the UK venture capital industry THE BUY-OUT continues to dominate the UK venture capital industry despite a two-year fall in the level of activity. For some observers, this represents a diversion of venture capital from its 'true' role of backing the start-up business; for most participants it represents a sensible concentration on what the industry does best. There can be no doubt that the buy-out, and its derivative, the buy-in, have established themselves as important methods of achieving industrial renewal. Some companies still refuse to permit buy-outs from among their subsidiaries and divisions but most see it as a valuable tool for restructuring. Some idea of the scale of buy-out activity can be gained from the fact that there were more buy-outs in 1991 than acquisitions of independent companies. Total buy-out activity over the past decade has amounted to no fewer than 4,144 deals worth Pounds 26.3bn at current prices, according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. There has been a decline in buy-out activity throughout Europe over the past two years from the feverish levels of activity in 1988-89. But buy-outs still accounted for 55 per cent of all UK venture capital investments by value last year and for 35 per cent of European venture capital spending. The highly leveraged billion pound deals of the late 1980s seem unlikely to return but the venture capital industry is now concentrating on small and medium-sized deals valued at up to Pounds 100m. Most fall in the range Pounds 1m to Pounds 20m. The financial institutions which arranged the very large deals have withdrawn; the quoted company boards which saw an advantage in taking their company private, have thought again; and the banks which were prepared to provide the debt finance have imposed far tougher lending criteria. This has left the professional venture capital funds to concentrate on more cautiously financed deals which require industrial rather than purely financial engineering skills. 'We are confident that our niche in the buy-out market - for companies capitalised at between Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m, sometimes going up to Pounds 100m - is the correct one,' says Mr Ian Hawkins, of Phildrew Ventures. 'Our strength is in buy-outs up to Pounds 100m-Pounds 125m though most of our deals are worth Pounds 25m or less,' comments Mr David Shaw, head of County NatWest Ventures. In many respects the current depressed economic climate is ideal for buy-outs, say many of the specialists. High real interest rates, a nervous stock market and uncertainty about the beginnings of an upturn have reduced the number of companies willing to bid against management teams. Hard-pressed corporations are under great pressure to dispose of under-performing or non-core businesses. However, the same economic conditions and the depressed housing market mean many managers are unwilling or unable to remortgage their home to finance a buy-out. They are also less willing to risk damaging their careers if their main board rejects a buy-out proposal. Even when deals do get off the ground they are often far more demanding of the venture capitalist than in the boom times of the late 1980s - 'we do very few deals in the form in which we first see them,' says Mr David Wansbrough of ECI Ventures. 'In the 1980s, deals would come in off the street. Now we might have to put in three months work to turn something into a good deal.' Venture capitalists are also finding that they are having to deal with a new type of vendor: the receiver. Buy-outs from receivership accounted for about 20 per cent of all deals last year. Receivers want to complete a sale as quickly as possible and are usually unwilling to grant prospective purchasers an exclusivity agreement while they carry out their financial checks. Nor will a receiver usually be prepared to provide a purchaser with the warranties normally given when businesses are sold. Receivers also want cash for any sale. Quite often venture capitalists will arrange for deferred payments or a retained interest when negotiating a buy-out from a corporate vendor. And while some vendors are prepared to favour a management buy-out because they wish to retain close links with the buy-out company receivers are interested only in the highest bidder. Some of these factors can work in favour of a buy-out team - managers with a detailed knowledge of the business may be able to dispense with warranties while an outside buyer could not take the risk - but they do require the venture capitalist to modify his approach. An important concern of receivers and of other vendors is that the management team and its venture capital backer can actually provide the finance for a deal. To meet this requirement venture capitalists have had to gear themselves up to be able to provide a 'bought deal,' taking the entire value of the buy-out on to their own book either permanently or with the aim of syndicating it later. 'Vendors often want to talk to a financial buyer, not to the management,' says David Shaw of County NatWest Ventures. This development reflects practice in the US leveraged buy-out market where the buy-out specialists play a far more active role in putting deals together, frequently bringing in management at a very late stage in the transaction. The vendor's preference for talking to the money-men, rather than managers has co-incided with a tightening of the syndication market. Deal leaders will now only deal with other venture capitalists they can trust following problems in some of the larger syndicates. 3i and Prudential Venture Managers, two of the biggest players, took this a stage further when they announced in June that they would collaborate on the joint underwriting of medium and large buy-outs and buy-ins. The aim of this initiative was to make it easier and quicker for managers to put together the funding of deals worth Pounds 15m and more, the two companies said.</p>

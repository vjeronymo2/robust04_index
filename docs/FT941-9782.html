			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The Footsie futures contract for March delivery moved to a sharp discount to the underlying stock market at the start of trading yesterday and pulled the stock market lower on unusually high turnover. Traders looked for ways to shorten their positions at the end of the trading account and ahead of key wholesale prices data from the US which were expected to reflect a pick up in inflation. The March contract traded at a persistent discount of between 12 to 14 points to the market compared with a fair value estimate of parity. However, the PPI figures from the US were far less disappointing than anticipated and futures recovered to close at 3,371 on turnover of 27,715 contracts.</p>

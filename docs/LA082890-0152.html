			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> POSTAL UNIONS IN CONTRACT TALKS  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service and leaders of its two largest unions opened contract  talks today as the nation's mail system is undergoing major technological  changes labor leaders fear will cost employees their jobs.  </P> <P> But both sides at the largely ceremonial opening session of the talks spoke  softly, expressing hope that a negotiated contract could be reached before the  Nov. 20 expiration of the current pact.  </P> <P> Unions involved in the negotiations include the National Assn. of Letter  Carriers, headed by Vincent Sombrotto, and the American Postal Workers Union,  led by Moe Biller. Together the unions represent about 600,000 workers.  </P> <P> "We expect a fair shake and we want an agreement bargained collectively,"  Sombrotto and Biller said in a joint statement at the opening session. "We are  willing to meet as often and as long as necessary to achieve that end."  </P></p>

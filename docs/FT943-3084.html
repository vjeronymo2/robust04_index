			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Australis Media posts loss of ADollars 19m for year Australis Media, the quoted company which holds one of Australia's two commercially-available satellite television licences and which has pledged to set up a pay-TV system by the beginning of next year, yesterday unveiled a loss of ADollars 19.1m (USDollars 14m) in the year to end-June. Australis said that the loss reflected start-up and establishment costs for both its planned broadcast subscription services and its targeted business. The company currently runs a handful of special language services and a news service, which are sold to subscribers in Sydney and Melbourne. The company said that its emphasis over the next few months would be on the completion of programming arrangements.</p>

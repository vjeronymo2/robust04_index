			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: WHY SOME MORTGAGE RATES AREN'T DOWN  </P> <P> QUESTION: I have an adjustable-rate mortgage tied to the 11th District cost of  funds. Recently I have been reading about the drop in interest rates by the big  lenders, supposedly causing a corresponding drop in adjustable mortgage rates.  However, the 11th District cost of funds has not been declining. Can you  explain why? -- R. B.  </P> <P> ANSWER: You are not the only homeowner wondering about this matter these days.  Since the early 1980s, when adjustable-rate mortgages became common, the  otherwise esoteric 11th District cost of funds index has come under a lot of  scrutiny whenever interest rates have dropped and the index hasn't.  </P> <P> To understand why this is possible, you have to understand what the index is  and how it operates. The index is the weighted average cost of all funds  deposited into savings institutions in the 11th District of the Federal Home  Loan Bank, a territory that covers California, Arizona and Nevada.  </P> <P> Among the funds tracked are those in savings, checking and money market  accounts, certificates of deposit and other bank instruments. The interest  rates on all these accounts are averaged to determine the index, a figure that  represents the interest rate, or "cost of funds," that the savings institutions  actually had to pay their customers to attract the money they now have  available to lend.  </P> <P> The district computes the index rate monthly and publishes the figure for a  particular month on the final working day of the following month. The rate for  June, 1989, announced last Monday, was 8.923%. Adjustable-rate mortgages  typically run about two to three points higher than the index, a difference  designed to cover the lenders' overhead costs and profit margins.  </P> <P> Because the index includes both long- and short-term borrowings, it is  considered far less volatile than other measures of the cost of money. For  example, an analysis prepared for Great Western Savings shows that in August,  1981, when the prime rate nearly reached 21%, the interest rates being paid on  12-month Treasury bills exceeded 16%. But the 11th District index reached only  12.029%.  </P> <P> However, just as the 11th District index rises more slowly than other indexes,  it falls more slowly as well. Lenders estimate that it typically lags from two  to three months behind the one-year interest rates being paid to purchasers of  12-month U.S. Treasury bills.  </P> <P> Rates on 12-month Treasury bills have gradually been falling since April, as  have other key interest rates, most notably the prime rate. (This latter rate  is the interest that banks charge their largest and most credit-worthy  customers.) However, over the same time span, the 11th District cost of funds  index has risen.  </P> <P> Why? Because late last year and during the first four months of this year,  interest rates were rising, and the 11th District index is just now catching up  with that earlier rise. Lenders say the 11th District cost of funds index  should begin to drop over the next few months.  </P> <P> The current 11th District rate is available on a taped telephone message to  California callers at (800) 824-6560. A brochure on the subject is available  from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, Communications Department,  P.O. Box 7948, San Francisco, Calif. 94120.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finding Value in 'Worthless' Stocks  </P> <P> Q: Can you please comment on stock certificates that are known to have no value  except as antiques or collectibles? I am specifically thinking about the  certificates of such companies as Dusenberg and Durant, two former auto makers  that have long since gone out of business. Are their stock certificates worth  anything to collectors? -- W. E. D.  </P> <P> A: In a word: yes.  </P> <P> Our advisers say interest in old stock certificates is gradually increasing  among collectors who believe that these documents have both a historical and an  aesthetic value. Europeans are said to be among the primary buyers of the old  certificates at this time, but some brokers predict that the hobby could become  as popular as stamp collecting.  </P> <P> The actual price that these certificates command on the market is quite another  matter, but getting a quote should not be terribly difficult. Our advisers say  several reputable dealers can tell you what they would be willing to pay for  the certificates. When seeking a quote, you should send a photocopy of the  certificates along with your name, address and a stamped, self-addressed  envelope for a reply. Never, ever, send the actual certificates. You may never  see them again.  </P> <P> Among the brokers dealing in antique stock certificates are R. M. Smythe &amp;  Co., 24 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10004, and George LaBarre Galleries, P.O. Box  746, Hollis, N.H. 03051.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Does a Pension Reduce Social Security Checks?  </P> <P> Q: I receive monthly payments from a private pension fund. Am I entitled to  benefits from my husband's Social Security account as well? My pension exceeds  what I would get on his account. I've asked several different people about this  and have received several different answers. It's all too confusing for my poor  addled brain! -- T. S.  </P> <P> A: This is really quite a simple matter, and the answer is sure not to boggle.  </P> <P> Your private pension, whatever its amount, has absolutely nothing whatsoever to  do with your eligibility to collect Social Security on your husband's account.  What counts is whether you are eligible as a wage earner to collect Social  Security on your own behalf.  </P> <P> If you did not contribute to Social Security and are not entitled to collect  anything on your own account, then you would be eligible to draw on your  husband's benefits as a spouse (or widow).  </P> <P> If you are entitled to your own Social Security, then your ability to collect  on your husband's account is limited. In this case, you would be able to draw  spousal benefits on your husband's account only if your own benefits were less  than half the benefits to which he is entitled. Social Security regulations  limit you to picking whichever benefit account gives you the larger payment.  But you may not draw on both accounts.  </P> <P> See, it's not all that confusing.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 98 (588)] </F>   [Text] President Lennart Meri called Estonian-Russian  relations "a No.1 priority in the foreign policy." However,  relations between his country and Russia, in his opinion, "can  be based only on the Tartu Peace Treaty" of 1920.    IF Note: According to this treaty, Estonia included parts of  the present Pskov and Leningrad regions of Russia of the total  square of about 2,000 square kilometers. The Russian side has  repeatedly stated that the Tartu Treaty had lost the [sentence  incomplete as received].    As the president noted at a meeting with residents of the  Parnu city and the district, the Tartu Treaty "allowed the  Estonian people to realize the right for self-determination,"  and in this his sees its "eternal value."    As Interfax was told in the presidential press service, Meri  hopes that "problems which so far have shadowed the  Estonian-Russian relations, should find a constructive and  practical resolution."    In the meantime, Tallin's aspiration to declare the Tartu  Treaty a basis for Russian-Estonian relations was described by a  high-ranking Russian diplomat as "judicially absurd." In an  interview with Interfax he said that Meri's statements about the  of this treaty cause "regret."    "Obviously, if Russia recognizes this treaty, it will have  to  exchange prisoners of war and those interned with the Estonian  side, to confirm the existence of `the neutrality zone' in the  Finnish Gulf and to implement many other provisions of the  treaty which have become hopelessly old," the Russian diplomat  said.    He expressed hope that during a scheduled meeting between  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Estonian  president in Tallinn, bilateral relations will be discussed "in  a constructive spirit." "Russia's position remains the same:  The Tartu Peace Treaty became invalid after Estonia joined the  USSR in 1940," the diplomat concluded.</p>

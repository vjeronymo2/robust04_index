			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the process of developing these proposed regulations, we have consulted with several other Federal agencies, including the Civilian Health and Medical Programs of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH), a number of States, and with a wide array of private organizations concerned with the provision of mental health services to children and adolescents. We propose to establish a policy which will improve coordination of the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit with other services generally being provided to mentally ill children and adolescents, such as educational services, child welfare services, and juvenile justice services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amid widespread concern that the services provided for mentally ill children and adolescents and their families are often overlapping, duplicative, and sometimes at cross-purposes because they have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinated with each other, many States have begun to coordinate the activities of the State and local authorities involved with caring for mentally ill children and adolescents to ensure joint planning and joint provision of services. In many cases these efforts have been based on the NIMH's Child and Adolescent Service System Program. In addition, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded coordinated ``Mental Health Service Programs for Youth'' at 8 sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is especially critical that the possible need for inpatient services be considered in the context of all the services involved in a child's or adolescent's care because an unnecessary admission can put the individual at risk of a lifetime of public dependency. Inpatient admission also inevitably results in trauma and disruption of a child's normal support systems. Intensive services are increasingly available in the community to help resolve crisis situations. When inpatient admission is necessary, it is often needed because early intervention and treatment have been lacking. For this reason, fewer admissions to mental health facilities may be required when a comprehensive care system has been in place for a period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coordinated programs are oriented toward the needs of children rather than being structured according to the requirements of various funding sources, and they result in a wider array of available services. Coordinated programs can lower overall costs because duplicative and unnecessary services can be eliminated, and optimal services can be made available. If the array of services available is uncoordinated, the patient runs the risk of an unnecessary admission because the alternative services that may have been more effective are not as readily available and the admission, therefore, occurs by default.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many studies have indicated that the most important factors in maintaining the beneficial effects of mental health treatment for children and adolescents are the availability and use of a wide range of post-treatment resources. Such resources include appropriate educational and vocational services and supportive services for the family members who will have ongoing responsibility for caring for the children. Many of these services are beyond the purview of the Medicaid program, but they are, nonetheless, vital to the mental health of Medicaid recipients and have direct bearing on future mental health service needs. These proposed regulations would support State coordination and planning efforts in this area (&sect;441.106).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Psychiatric Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many professionals contend that psychiatric treatment should be available in a wide array of settings, including office visits, clinic services, home-based treatment programs, day treatment programs, partial hospitalization (day hospital), therapeutic foster care provided by trained ``parents,'' residential treatment facility services, and acute psychiatric hospital care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

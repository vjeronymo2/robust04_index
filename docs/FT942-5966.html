			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Union chief wants unopposed crowning of Blair The leader of one of Britain's biggest unions last night called on other possible leadership candidates to follow Mr Gordon Brown's example and not to stand against Mr Tony Blair, the favourite for the job. 'They should take a leaf out of Gordon's book,' said Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union. 'This is an act of true statesmanship, true leadership, bringing the party together, showing the country what is needed.' Mr Jordan's call is likely to be echoed by other union leaders who believe Mr Blair is virtually unstoppable - and there is therefore little point in proceeding with an expensive election. However, union leaders on the centre-left believe Mr Blair must be challenged if only to ensure that a real debate can be held on the future policy direction of the party. Many of them believe that Mrs Margaret Beckett is now the only possible serious challenger. Some union leaders fear that if Mr Blair wins a landslide victory as an uncompromising moderniser he may attempt to reduce the power of the unions in the Labour party. Others are confident that Mr Blair supports the party's commitment to full employment and the introduction of a national minimum wage. They also believe he would not wish to re-open the controversial issue of the role of the unions in the Labour party this side of the next general election. Last night a spokesman for Mr Brown said that Mr Blair had agreed to back the employment agenda outlined by Mr Brown in his recent speeches. Union leaders on the centre-left are becoming reconciled to the prospect of Mr Blair as leader - but they remain determined to uphold their authority in the party and hold him to Labour's current economic policies.</p>

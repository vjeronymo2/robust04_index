			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: MIM sale cuts ties with Cominco MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, has sold its remaining 8.65 per cent holding in Cominco, the North American mining and smelting group, for CDollars 164.9m (USDollars 123m). The sale cuts all shareholding ties between the two companies and ends an ambitious international base-metals alliance which was stitched together during the 1980s by MIM, Germany's Metallgesellschaft and Teck Corp of Vancouver. Earlier this year, MIM sold its half share in Nunachiaq, a private investment company, to Teck for CDollars 139.7m. Nunachiaq's principal assets included a 27.7 per cent holding in Cominco, as well as a 22.46 per cent interest in the Polaris zinc-lead mine joint venture. Metallgesellschaft earlier this month sold the bulk of its international mining assets, including indirect stakes in Teck and Cominco, with the disposal of a controlling stake in Metall Mining of Toronto. In the case of the latest Cominco sale, MIM said that the shares had been ''broadly distributed' among investors on a block trade basis at CDollars 24 a share. The disposal of the 6.87m shares will generate a CDollars 11m profit before tax for MIM's Canadian subsidiary.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> TELEVISION;  </P> <P> BILL COSBY  </P> <P> Bill Cosby was more than TV's biggest star of the 1980s. He changed the course  of TV and had historic impact on the medium.  </P> <P> He took one of TV's oldest formats, the family sitcom, gave a modern twist to  "Father Knows Best" and, in one fell swoop, helped destroy decades of insulting  black stereotypes on the home tube and in show business overall.  </P> <P> "The Cosby Show" started as a longshot. When it debuted on Sept. 20, 1984, TV  comedy -- especially with a family setting -- was considered dead. The biggest  hits were soap operas like "Dallas" and "Dynasty" and action shows such as  "Magnum, P.I." and "Simon &amp; Simon."  </P> <P> But after the ratings success of "Cosby," family sitcoms blossomed again:  "Family Ties," "Growing Pains," "Who's the Boss?", "The Wonder Years."  </P> <P> Nothing was more important, however, than the dignified and natural portrayal  of blacks through Cosby, as pediatrician Cliff Huxtable; Phylicia Rashad as his  attorney-wife, Clair, and their children.  </P> <P> Some critics carped that the Huxtable family was an unrealistic, idealized  depiction of blacks -- as if "Father Knows Best," "My Three Sons" and "Family  Ties" were any different for whites.  </P> <P> Cosby had been a TV star previously in "I Spy." But what undoubtedly boosted  his new popularity on his return to series TV was his public identification  with educational and children's matters in private life and on the tube.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.

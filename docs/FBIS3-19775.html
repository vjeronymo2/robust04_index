The single real regret noted was the failure of the  conference to incorporate a "social clause" in international  agreement which fix workers' minimum rights and standards of  treatment.    Sergio D'Antoni of the CISL said it was "positive" for the  industrialized nations to have shown an awareness that  joblessness is not the product of "cynical and cheating destiny"  and that it is possible to agree on policy among the individual  nations to counter and defeat unemployment.    The confederation chief added, "The path to follow is  already  indicated for us" and cited the historic wage pact signed here  last summer by the government and labor and management  representatives. This agreement, he said, provides "important  factors for flexibility, a clear choice for ongoing training and  an indication of reduced work schedules for defending jobs."    The UIL leader, Pietro Larizza, endorsed this thinking in  saying that Italy was able to anticipate "lines of action with  the understanding of last July 3" and citing "continuous  training and the link between training and production (as) the  essential central points of that agreement." He also named on  the positive side in Detroit the point that "everyone stressed  the need not to lose professionalism and specialization, the  wealth of the human factor at work, with the loss of jobs."    According to the assistant secretary general of the big CGIL  confederation, Guglielmo Epifani, "The importance of the summit  is that our government and that of the United States have placed  the employment issue at the center of economic strategy." On  the down side for Epifani was that, "the indications which  emerged are very general and not applicable to all situations."    Also the CGIL official named the July agreement and said he  hoped to see, after the general election at the end of March,  "approval of measure already prepared or provided for in the  understanding but which have not yet been adopted." In this  connection, he called for strengthening part-time work and  stronger attention from business and industry focused on  defending jobs by acting on work schedules.</p>

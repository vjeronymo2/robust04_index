			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Sinn Fein spells out its queries Hopes of a breakthrough in the UK-Irish peace initiative rose yesterday after Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, responded to calls to spell out which parts of the Downing Street declaration it wants clarified. The Irish government forwarded to London a list of questions drawn up by Sinn Fein focusing on the declaration's treatment of self-determination, the so-called unionist 'veto' and Britain's long-term intentions in the province. The move constitutes a potentially significant climbdown by Sinn Fein, which had previously insisted on face-to-face meetings with government officials to discuss its reservations. London is expected to reply to the questions next week. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said last night in a statement that the government would publish Sinn Fein's text together with its own 'comments'. This would take place 'within a matter of days once we have had an opportunity to give them proper consideration'. It will raise hopes that republican leaders may be edging closer to declaring an end to their 25-year armed campaign, paving the way for Sinn Fein to enter the political talks process. London has emphasised repeatedly that Sinn Fein's demand for clarification had never been made specific since to do so would 'attract ridicule and scorn'. But Sir Patrick hinted last month to a US congressional committee that he would consider responding to specific queries. Unionists reacted cautiously to yesterday's development. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said Sir Patrick should send the questions back 'with the envelope unopened'. Dublin had 'persuaded the Provos to do this to keep the British on the hook'. Sinn Fein's move came after Sir Patrick had used a speech in Dublin to try to inject fresh urgency into the search for a lasting political settlement, saying an early end to direct rule in Ulster was needed. In a carefully balanced address, the Northern Ireland secretary said there was a clear role for 'new structures' to develop the relationship between the two parts of the island 'purposefully and profitably'. This meant certain assumptions would have to be made on the shape of democratic institutions in Northern Ireland but there was no need for these to impinge on sovereignty. He said London and Dublin were looking for a 'new and more broadly based' Anglo-Irish Agreement to replace the document agreed in 1985 that gave Dublin a say in Ulster affairs for the first time. Reaching a new agreement would mean 'all of us being prepared to embrace new ideas, new institutional structures and imaginative approaches to constitutional and human rights issues'.</p>

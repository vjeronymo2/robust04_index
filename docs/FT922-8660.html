			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures appeared to lose some of their recent momentum, although a squeeze late in the session helped the June contract end strongly on fairly high turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE started the session at around 2,660, and quickly ran ahead to reach the day's high of 2,772 by mid-morning. It then lost the momentum and was seen to slide back, leading one trader to comment that 'the FT-SE is begining to look a bit tired'. Two-way business characterised the afternoon session, with Wall Street said to have had no influence on June, although a squeeze in the last few minutes of the session helped June end firmly. June eventually closed at 2,764, around 20 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash which yesterday fell to about 8. Turnover was a healthy 7,142 contracts. The traded options market witnessed a quieter session, and turnover at 30,418 was just ahead of the break-even level of the market. The FT-SE contract traded 9,638 lots. Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,649 contracts. The May 240 calls were particularly busy. This was followed by Ladbroke on 2,000 lots.</p>

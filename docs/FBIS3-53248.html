			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jamil al-Tarifi, Palestinian co-chairman of </F> the Civic Committee at the Taba Talks with Israel, by Hasan  Abu-Zayid at Taba Hotel on 12 January -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Tarifi] We convened two sessions yesterday,  including a restricted one attended by committee chairmen and  the chief Palestinian and Israeli delegates. We reviewed the  remaining items -- there were approximately 19 -- on the Civic  Committee's agenda. These include direct and indirect taxes,  the treasury, and other items that were also addressed by the  Economic Committee's talks in Paris. We also (?found) a way to  transfer powers in these areas. As for outstanding issues, we  will try to finalize them next week. These include such things  as electricity, water, highways [al-turuq al-'ammah], pension  funds, etc... Today we looked at archeology; we are not through  with this subject yet. We will also discuss water-related  issues and city planning next week.    [Abu-Zayid] The Civic Committee is said to have made  tangible progress from the beginning.    [Al-Tarifi] The problems the Civic Committee has to contend  with are fewer than those encountered by other committees. This  is not to say that we did not encounter any obstacles.  Yesterday, we worked out ways to surmount hurdles.    [Abu-Zayid] What are the issues that have yet to be dealt  with by the Civic Committee?    [Al-Tarifi] We transferred the work of approximately 20  authorities, and about 19 authorities remain. I think that, God  willing, next week will see us complete their transfer.    [Abu-Zayid] And what about the water issue?    [Al-Tarifi] We will address that next week, God willing.    [Abu-Zayid] You looked at the archeology issue today.    [Al-Tarifi] That's right. We exchanged ideas about the  issue. The Israeli side brought along experts and we had one.  We had a general exchange of ideas ahead of a more detailed  discussion next week about a transfer of authority and powers to  the Palestinians.    [Abu-Zayid] What is your assessment of this week's talks in  Taba?    [Al-Tarifi] I think the resumption of the talks in itself is  something extremely positive. We hope we will wrap up our work  as quickly as possible. However, we should not let ourselves be  unduly constrained by the time element, since this accord is  supposed to meet our national aspirations and the Palestinian  understanding of the accord. The time factor is important for  the Palestinians. We must realize, however, that it is equally  important for the Israelis. But let us not let ourselves become  obsessed with the time factor by committing ourselves to a time  frame of one week or two or three. More importantly, we must  implement the accord so as to meet national Palestinian  aspirations.    [Abu-Zayid] The Security Committee is moving slowly, isn't  it?    [Al-Tarifi] The nature of the problems there, I think, is  somewhat intractable. But we hope they will be sorted out.    [Abu-Zayid] We were given to understand the talks will  conclude today.    [Al-Tarifi] You understood right.</p>

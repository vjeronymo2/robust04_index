			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Unbundling THE UNBUNDLING of South Africa's economy has begun. Gencor's decision yesterday to hand over to its shareholders the stakes it owns in a wide-ranging collection of industrial subsidiaries is the first step in a process that will reshape South African business. It has not come a moment too soon. The tensions that have bedevilled South Africa's economy - between corporatism and free enterprise, between English-speakers and Afrikaners, between the boundless wealth of the mining houses and the slim pickings of manufacturing - have left the country with a top-heavy corporate structure. Six groupings control 80 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Now, prodded by politicians from the National party as well as by the African National Congress, big business is starting to think of becoming a bit less bloated. Tax concessions for unbundling from Mr Derek Keys - the finance minister but before that boss of Gencor - have eased the way. Yet so far only Gencor has indicated a serious interest in the subject. The other big groups are doubtless studying the proposition, but so far without, apparently, making the emotional leap into the unknown. That is a pity. South Africa needs to set its companies free from the strangling embrace of the big groups. Setting operating companies free to sink or swim will itself improve the quality of South African management. The argument against such a process is that it will open the way for corporate raiders, asset-stripping and all the other accoutrements of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. They are certainly a mixed blessing. But if ever a country cried out for them, it is South Africa. Vulnerability to takeover concentrates managers' minds, and gives fresh energy to their actions. South Africans of all races, all incomes and all political persuasions would benefit from the application of a little unfettered capitalism. Gencor has led the way.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Enterprising university Sir, The University of Sussex was built '. . . far removed from the inner cities', according to John Authers and John Willman ('Dreaming spires on city rubble', September 10/11). But the campus is only 5 miles from the centre of Brighton, a town which has suffered more than most in the recession and is characterised by levels of unemployment and poverty normally associated with the large conurbations. Our response, in partnership with the University of Brighton, Brighton College of Technology, the local authorities and the Sussex Training and Enterprise Council, has been to create an academic corridor designed to stimulate the growth of enterprise based on 21st century technology. We have raised Pounds 2m from Brighton and East Sussex councils and Seeboard for a flagship innovation centre which is to be launched next week as an event during the corridor's 'Festival of Innovation'. We believe it is possible effectively to marry research of international and national excellence to significant growth in the local economy, and that the key to success lies in this kind of partnership. Gordon Conway, vice-chancellor, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RH</p>

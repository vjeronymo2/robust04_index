The delegation held two days of talks in Cairo with a  Palestinian delegation led by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, on ways of  implementing Resolution 904, particularly with regard to  providing international protection to the Palestinians in the  occupied territories.    A small Palestinian-Israeli drafting committee held a long  session last night to formulate a comprehensive agreement on  international protection arrangements in Hebron and the  Palestinian police force in the city.    An agreement between the two sides would open the way to  resuming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations aimed at implementing  the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement. The negotiations were  discontinued on 25 February following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre.</p>

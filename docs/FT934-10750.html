			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Indian export surge slows down THE RECENT surge in India's exports slowed down considerably in September, bearing out forecasts that the pace of previous months would prove unsustainable. Exports in September rose by just 6.6 per cent year-on-year, in marked contrast to the increase of 24.3 per cent recorded in April-August, the first five months of the 1993-94 financial year, according to figures published by the commerce ministry this week. The slowdown was partly caused by widespread lorry drivers' strikes. But economists also believe that the summer surge benefited from the temporary effect of the shipping of orders postponed from earlier in the year when cities including Bombay, the commercial capital, were hit by civil unrest. Nevertheless, both government and private sector economists believe that the rate of export growth will remain fairly strong and hit 15 to 20 per cent for the financial year as a whole. They point out that, after allowing for the September slowdown, export growth in the first half of the financial year hit 21 per cent, a record for India. Finance ministry officials say companies are benefiting from economic liberalisation and from currency devaluation carried out since 1991. Exports of food and agricultural products, textiles, garments, gems and jewellery are all performing well above expectations. Exports in the six months to September totalled Dollars 10.35bn (Pounds 6.8bn). Imports were Dollars 10.79bn, leaving a trade deficit of just Dollars 440m. The finance ministry is satisfied with the performance of the trade account, which is helping raise India's foreign exchange reserves to record levels of over Dollars 7bn. However, economists are concerned at the stagnation in imports, which fell 3.4 per cent in the six months to September. This reflects poor demand from recession-hit industry which is suffering from a dearth of orders from the state sector. State enterprises are being forced to make savings due to a squeeze on the government help they once received.</p>

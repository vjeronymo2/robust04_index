			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Appointments: Chasse privee Holland &amp; Holland, the Mayfair gun-makers bought by Chanel in 1989, has appointed a Frenchman to the position of chief executive and chairman. Alain Drach, 43, is not from Chanel, but otherwise Holland &amp; Holland seems to know astonishingly little about its new boss. He has a marketing background and has run a famous French shoot - which just happens to belong to the Wertheimer family that owns Chanel. New deputy chairman is the managing director Roger Mitchell - who contended at the time of the French acquisition, which caused something of a stir among the gunmaker's gentrified patrons, that 'we will remain an English firm under English management'. Stock Exchange chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who has chaired Holland &amp; Holland for the past four and a half years, moves to the sidelines as non-executive chairman of the holding company. While Holland &amp; Holland patted itself on the back over the Chanel deal, which cost the perfume-makers Pounds 10.9m, the company - where a pair of Royal 12-bore tooled by its mastercraftsmen start in excess of Pounds 56,000  -has subsequently been hard hit by the recession. It may also have been affected by the recent successful entry of Asprey into the hand-made gun market - even if one country gent describes the latter's weapons as vulgar enough to frighten away any pheasant. 'The company remains quintessentially English and few, if any, Holland &amp; Holland customers are even aware that it is no longer an independent company,' is the parting shot of the London spokeswoman.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: American Express poised to cut another 4,000 jobs American Express is poised to announce further sweeping job losses in its core plastic cards business in an attempt to bring itself more into line with other, more profitable US card companies. The cuts, which could lead to reductions in the workforce of more than 4,000, will come largely in the US, although the company is also expected to continue the reorganisation that has been in progress in its European business since earlier this year. Under this, it has been centring all activities in London, other than those which have direct contact with customers. 'We have been for some time looking at our operating costs,' American Express said yesterday, adding: 'We have not completed those analyses yet, and have made no decisions.' However, one source with knowledge of the changes said that they were likely to be announced as early as this week, adding American Express needs 'fewer facilities, and functions that work across the organisation'. The changes in part stem from the group's move to expand its range of cards, adding a series of revolving credit products to its basic charge card. Rather than develop separate processing and other systems to handle the new products, it has decided to redesign its entire operating base to handle all card products on a single system. This has created the need to push through a broader-ranging restructuring of its US operations. Under Mr Harvey Golub, chairman and chief executive since early last year, American Express has already been through one wave of cost-cutting. In an interview earlier this year, though, Mr Golub said that the company, while switching its focus to growing its revenues, also 'had much more to do' to bring its costs lower. American Express's shares rose Dollars  3/8 in New York to close at Dollars 30 1/4.</p>

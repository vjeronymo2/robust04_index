			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: A powerful source of revenue for the chancellor Sir, If the UK chancellor is looking for extra revenue, he should consider a one-off capital and profits levy on the regional electricity companies. This would be politically popular, compensating for the embarrassing undervaluation of the privatisation reflected in the trebled share prices. Siphoning off some of the bulging surplus cash, with even more to come from the sale of National Grid Company, would not be seen as unfair, and it is justifiable economically, as it would assist in the reduction of the public sector borrowing and offers earlier scope for beneficial tax cuts elsewhere. A previous chancellor's excess profits levy on the windfall profits of the banks provides a respectable precedent. Peter Rost, chairman, Major Energy Users' Council, Berkhamsted, Herts HP4 1LE</p>

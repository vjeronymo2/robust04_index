			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: DIET AND CHOLESTEROL  </P> <P> Question: I have what to me is a fairly simple question, but I've never seen it  answered anywhere.  </P> <P> If a person has a high cholesterol level, and his doctor says that he should  get it down, why not put him on a diet with absolutely no fat in it?  </P> <P> Answer: When I prescribe a diet for a patient who has an elevated serum  cholesterol level, I have a twofold purpose. The first is to reduce the total  cholesterol and fat levels. The second is to make certain that the patient  continues to have a nutritionally adequate diet. Both goals can generally be  achieved even if the diet includes some fat.  </P></p>

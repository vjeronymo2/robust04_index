The regime's guards and agents have  arrested a large number of the city's residents, especially  youths, in fear of more riots erupting, and this has further  heightened the Zahedan people's anger at Khomeyni's regime.    The valiant people of Zahedan and the families of the  martyrs  of the latest demonstrations in that city have forced the  Khomeyni regime to hand over the bodies of three of the martyrs  of those demonstrations. The regime's officials -- terrified at  the Zahedan people's reaction at the last rites of the martyrs  of the heroic demonstrations, which would fan their fury and  hatred -- had refrained from handing over the bodies.    In the course of the heroic uprising by the people of  Zahedan, in addition to some being martyred, thirty people were  also wounded. Some of the regime's guards and agents were also  killed by the people.    Following the large-scale demonstrations by the people of  Zahedan and the attack on Hashemi-Rafsanjani, which has plunged  the entire regime in fear, Khamene'i issued a decree appointing  Besharati, a (?member) of the shah's SAVAK and the current  interior minister, as his replacement in the law enforcement  forces for the next three years.

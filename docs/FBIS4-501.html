			<p>BFN     [Text] The African National Congress has warned members of  the South African Police not to embark on a proposed strike in  two weeks' time. ANC spokesman Pravin Gordhan said the police  should not become participants in disrupting and sabotaging the  elections. He said they should instead become part of the  process of protecting the election to ensure it was free and  fair.</p>

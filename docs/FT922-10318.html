			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Indian court orders assetsof Union Carbide to be seized THE INDIAN assets of Union Carbide, the US multinational, have been ordered to be seized by a magistrate in Bhopal following the failure of its employees to appear in court in connection with the gas leak tragedy in 1984 which has killed more than 4,000. Mr Gulab Sharma, the magistrate, yesterday ordered that the company's 50.9 per cent holding in its Indian subsidiary should be seized immediately. The company yesterday put the value of the shares and property at Rs420m (Pounds 30.5m). The order came after an application by the government to seize the company's property and shares following reports that Union Carbide was attempting to transfer shares in its Indian subsidiary to a trust for building a hospital for victims of the disaster. The magistrate has already ordered that arrest warrants be issued for Mr Warren Anderson, former chairman of Union Carbide, for failing to appear in court and extradition proceedings are now in progress. Union Carbide is thought to want to transfer the shares in its Indian subsidiary to forestall seizure by the court. The company's move came after its employees had ignored a summons to stand trial on charges of negligence in connection with the Bhopal tragedy. Mr Rajendra Singh, a lawyer for Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary, told the court the US company had 'lost faith' in the Indian government and there was little possibility of the company or its lawyers appearing before Indian courts. In a settlement with the Indian government in February 1989, Union Carbide had paid Dollars 470m in return for quashing all criminal proceedings against its employees. The settlement was later challenged on the grounds that it was inadequate, but was upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

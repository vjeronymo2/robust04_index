			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh deal angers Labour MR DAVID HUNT, Welsh secretary, angered the Labour benches in the Commons yesterday by confirming the existence of a written agreement between the government and Welsh nationalist MPs over the membership of the European Community's proposed committee of the regions. Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, said membership of the committee  -to be established under the terms of the Maastricht treaty  - should be determined at local government level. To cheers, he told the minister: 'Any veto, any trickery or any gerrymandering from you will be completely unacceptable'. Challenging the Labour leadership to say in turn whether they supported the Maastricht treaty, Mr Hunt stressed that without it there would be no committee of the regions - 'and that would be a great shame for Wales'. Mr Hunt also announced investment in Wales worth Pounds 15m, which he said would create 425 jobs and safeguard a further 156. He told MPs that the projects by eight companies setting up, modernising or expanding operations in the principality were being backed by Pounds 2.6m in Regional Selective Assistance from the Welsh Office. Mr Hunt said the new investment was further proof that Wales was leading the rest of Britain out of recession. 'It is the Welsh Dragon which is breathing fire into the UK recovery,' he said. But Labour's Mr Paul Flynn (Newport W) protested there had been no recovery in Wales. 'What has happened is that a reasonably-paid, highly-skilled workforce has been turned into a full-scale sweatshop,' he said.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: India and Oman in accord on gas link OMAN and India have reached preliminary agreement to build an undersea gas pipeline capable of delivering 50m cubic metres of Omani gas a day to industries on India's west coast. Gulf oil executives say the deal will be worth around Dollars 4.5bn and could be completed within four years. The two states have also agreed to build two 120,000 b/d oil refineries in India, with the Omani government partnering India's Hindustan Petroleum and Baharat Oil. The Oman Oil Company, an arm of the country's oil and finance ministries, is to conduct a feasibility study on the 900km pipeline, which would have to pass over the continental shelf off Iran and Pakistan. Oil industry officials said a substantial part of the deal was likely to be financed by export credits. Oman has reportedly proposed a 40-year gas supply contract. The Oman Oil Company has also signed a deal to link Kazakhstan's biggest oilfield with a coastal terminal. Both deals are part of Oman's attempts to diversify and broaden its hydrocarbons industry. The deal with India would give Oman a reliable local market for its gas, proven reserves of which have doubled in two years to 490bn cubic metres. 'If you look at the delivery costs to India, by ship or pipeline, the pipeline comes out favourably,' says one industry official. Oman will also supply crude oil for the two refineries to be built in India, under the memo of understanding signed at the weekend. Oman's national news agency said one would be built in central and one in western India. Industry officials said the two deals offered a natural match between India's growing appetite for imported fuels and Oman's desire to exploit both its natural hydrocarbon reserves and its already strong diplomatic ties with the sub-continent.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Ceasefire followed by the sound of silence: Michael Cassell and Tim Coone review the effects of the IRA's gesture The prospect was tantalising if unrealistic. All the British government had to do, according to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was to talk to republicans for one hour and the door to peace in Northern Ireland could open. This morning, with the IRA's three-day ceasefire over, the door remains stubbornly shut. The IRA's decision to call a post-Easter suspension of violence may have been unconditional and unprecedented - almost certainly arising more from pressure upon it to stop the killing than on any fundamental change of heart  -but it never looked good enough. Given some expectations, especially in Dublin, that the provisionals had planned a more dramatic, open-ended gesture aimed at ending the political stalemate, the 72-hour standstill impressed few people outside the republican movement. Why should anyone be grateful for what amounted to 'a suspended sentence of death', Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, asked yesterday. If the IRA and Sinn Fein were trying to drive a wedge between London and Dublin they will have been deeply disappointed by the two governments' show of unity. If they ever calculated that Mr John Major's own parlous position might force him into taking risks to win a triumphant peace they were wrong again. The Irish government called the respite from murder and intimidation 'pathetically brief' and its senior officials admit privately they expected something longer. The strength of reaction in Dublin is thought to have come as a surprise to republicans, who expected a more positive response after comments from Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, that he would seek to 'build upon' a temporary ceasefire. Having moved to accommodate Sinn Fein by dropping the broadcasting ban on the party and by providing, unlike London, extensive 'clarification' of the Downing Street declaration, Dublin feels let down. Throughout the ceasefire London continued to play a straight bat, repeatedly dismissing it as a 'cynical ploy' to extract concessions under threat of renewed violence. While the government chanted its peace mantra - 'no talks without a permanent end to violence' - unionists talked of IRA volunteers heading for the seaside to plan their next atrocities. Sinn Fein, still battling to extract clarification from London on the joint declaration but refusing to say what Britain could clarify that had not already been made clear by Dublin, hailed the IRA action as evidence of a flexible and open-minded republican movement anxious for peace. Republicans having taken the initiative, Mr Adams said, it was a case of 'over to you, Mr Major'. This week, however, the depth of Sinn Fein's anger at being marginalised in the political process - the price it is made to pay for its militaristic connections - became clear. Britain, insisted Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading Sinn Fein official, must stop treating it as a second-class political party instead of one speaking for those who were 'no longer prepared to be oppressed, humiliated, degraded and discriminated against'. To republicans, their war is an issue of pride and dignity as well as a matter of national boundaries. Sinn Fein has arguably been on firmer ground in citing the British government's previous, lengthy dialogue with republicans. Why, given the chance of a real breakthrough, is the government refusing to talk now, they inquire? Last year Sir Patrick won warm support from MPs for justifying contacts with republicans as an attempt to save lives. But in the wake of a joint declaration which enshrines the principles of majority consent, he now says there can be no truck with active terrorists. Efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides included unsuccessful calls for a go-between to relay Sinn Fein's specific concerns to the government. Hopes that the public rhetoric was concealing secret contacts seem, so far, unfounded, though suspicions linger that they will eventually be resumed. The failure to make any headway this week means further ceasefires will be tough to achieve. The position of those within Sinn Fein, such as Mr Adams, who helped bring it about could be weakened. The IRA knows that if it splits, it dies; it does not intend to split. As the province prepared itself uneasily for evidence that the ceasefire was over, Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, called on the IRA to halt its armed struggle and help break down the barriers in the hearts and minds of the Irish people. The last 72 hours notwithstanding, it does not yet appear ready to heed the call.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Books: Poet hobbled by passion - The work of Stephen Spender, 85 this year DOLPHINS by Stephen Spender Faber and Faber Pounds 12.99 (Pounds 5.99 paperback) 46 pages This month, the great cultural monument that is Sir Stephen Spender will be 85 years of age. It is now more than 30 years since the death of Louis MacNeice, 20 since the deaths of WH Auden and C. Day Lewis and 10 since that of Christopher Isherwood. Spender, the last surviving member of that much-memorialised generation of the 1930s, has survived them all - and he continues to write and review regularly to this day. The poetry, however, has come very slowly. His last full collection, The Generous Days, was published in 1971; his Collected Poems of 1985, though containing some new works (including notable elegies to MacNeice and Auden) was largely a re-presentation - often drastically re-worked  - of older material. In 'Worldsworth', the best poem of his new collection, Dolphins, he records his first brush with poetry. In 1916 the Spenders were obliged to leave their home on the cliffs near Sheringham, Norfolk after two stray German bombs fell nearby. The family decamped to a farmhouse near Lake Derwentwater and it was there that Spender, then seven years old, heard his father reading Wordsworth in the garden. The vocabulary and the cadences of romanticism became a life-long passion and it is a passion that has both enriched and hobbled his poetry. 'Worldsworth' is just one of several autobiographical poems in this short collection. Another, 'Air Raid', captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb, that 'unreasoning fury from an enemy's vision of life', destroys the outer walls of a house, turning what had once been private and inside - a bath, a wardrobe, books, the telephone - into a public spectacle. All that "tender sensitive life" has been thrown away. Variants upon this observation are the over-riding theme of the collection, no matter how widely it may seem to range in subject matter  - from memories of the first and second world wars, through elegies for dead friends, to a long poem which examines the explosive relationship between Rimbaud and Verlaine. What can be preserved of the intensities of the inner life in a world that seems hell bent on its own annihilation? The poet, according to Spender, acts as a mediator between the uniquely private self and the world outside us. There is a lived, shared reality which is both general to everyone and unique to each person, and it is poetry's task to describe it. Unfortunately Spender's abilities in this book are rarely equal to his vision. 'Air Raid' collapses at the end into cliche and verbal redundancy; many of the other poems seem too casually written, as if they are little more than notebook jottings. Only in the Wordsworthian blank verse of 'Worldsworth' do we find a sustained and excellent piece of writing from beginning to end. Sir Stephen Spender, cultural ambassador plenipotentiary, the memorialiser of himself and his famous generation, journalist, editor, essayist, university teacher and literary critic seems to have spent so much time clinking glasses across tables and lurching from glittering lunch to equally glittering dinner (anyone who doubts this should read his Journals 1939-1983) that it is a wonder he has had the time - or the powers of concentration - to write any good poetry at all. The fact is, of course, that he has written a little. But most critics would agree that he has not achieved his life-long ambition to be a great poet. His more enduring achievements have been elsewhere: as a writer of prose, for example, (an autobiography, World within World, is his masterpiece). Here he has found a way with words that is much more subtle, flexible and assured than most of his poetry ever manages to be, marred as it so often is by a peculiar stiffness and Shelleyan rhetoric. As a spokesman for liberal values, no matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be, Spender has also made his mark: to argue for the sacredness of the individual and his impulses is, after all, one of the finest fruits of the romantic movement.</p>

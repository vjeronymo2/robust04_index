			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Drug ills blamed on deprivation THE BISHOP of Hulme, whose diocese includes the rundown Moss Side area of Manchester where a 14-year-old boy was shot dead at the weekend, blamed unemployment and deprivation yesterday for the scale of drug-trafficking and violence in the area. The Rt Rev Colin Scott warned that his own fear was that the rising scale of violence in the area might drive away vital traders and businesses. The death of John Benjamin Stanley, killed on Saturday night while queueing at a West Indian take-away, is the latest in a series of incidents in a 2 sq mile area of 1960s housing estates. Bishop Scott said: 'The background reason is obviously the level of unemployment, a dilapidated estate and very few opportunities for work there, particularly for school leavers. 'If the future doesn't hold any promise, it is tempting to be drawn either into drugs as a personal escape or into drug pushing as a way of making easy money.' He said the area was difficult to police and had become a marketplace for drugs, attracting customers and suppliers from outside the area  - although he said many of the drug pushers were from the estate itself. Bishop Scott, who is also Acting Bishop of Manchester, said: 'The violence only involves a minority of people. But what is frightening is if shops and businesses are frightened away. That will do an even greater harm to the community there.' He said although police had made mistakes in the past and had sometimes been guilty of 'insensitivity', they were working hard to build up a good relationship with the community. Other local initiatives and the City Challenge scheme also held promise, but it took a long time to undo the damage. 'I am frightened, as other people are, at the way young school leavers are turning to drugs,' he said. Moss Side is one of the most deprived urban areas of Britain but is less than a mile from Manchester city centre. In 1981, up to 1,000 people were involved in disturbances in the area.</p>

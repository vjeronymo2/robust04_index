			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Observer: Butler Cox II? Can George Cox, the former chairman of the Management Consultancies Association, recreate the same sort of magic at slumbering P-E International as he did at his old firm of Butler Cox, one Britain's leading information technology consultancies? When an established firm of management know-alls, like P-E, has to go outside for a new boss, it is a sign that all is not well. Having gone public in 1986, P-E prospered in the boom, but has been unable to find the right formula for bucking the recession. The dividend has had to be cut and heads have rolled. Enter George Cox, P-E's chairman since last May. He made a fortune selling his old company at a sky-high multiple to the Americans two years ago. Now he is trying to repair P-E. Having rejigged his board and put another new arrival, Peter Smith, in charge of P-E's management consultancy side, he is addressing the company's big weakness - its lack of a predictable and secure source of income. Cox's latest wheeze, the P-E Centre for Management Research, sounds remarkably like one of his earlier bright ideas, the enormously successful Butler Cox Foundation, a self-help subscription club for large companies. Membership will cost Pounds 20,000 annually, discounted to Pounds 15,000 for the first year, and medium-sized companies are being offered a cheaper rate. The best ideas are usually the old ones, even in management consulting it seems.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Rembrandt print makes Pounds 159,500: Saleroom A PRINT by Rembrandt, 'Christ Crucified between Two Thieves', sold for Pounds 159,500 at Christie's yesterday, at the bottom of its estimate. Executed in dryprint in 1653, the print is extremely rare: Rembrandt altered the com-position dramatically in 1660. It was the top price in an auction of Old Master prints collected in the late 19th century by an aristocratic German family and only now being dispersed. The first group to be sold brought in more than Pounds 2m last December. All told, there were 77 Rembrandt prints on offer. His 'Woman in the Bath with a Hat Beside Her' of 1658 sold for Pounds 121,000, almost double its estimate, and an etching of a shell, the only example of a Rembrandt still life, went for Pounds 66,000. The main disappointment was the failure of Durer's 'Knight, Death and the Devil', engraved in 1513, to find a buyer. A jeroboam - equal to six bottles - of Chateau Latour 1864 from the cellars of Hatfield House, the home of the Marquess of Salisbury, sold for Pounds 6,534 at Christie's yesterday to a German collector. A surviving jeroboam from this vintage is certainly unique - the bottle is wrapped in brown paper to keep out the light and delay oxidisation. A dozen bottles of the 1961 Latour were within forecast at Pounds 4,235, while one bottle of the Chateau Lafite 1844 made Pounds 2,178. It was the property of the late Caria Kaspia, the caviar king, the contents of whose wine cellar totalled more than Pounds 68,000. A bottle of Grande Fine Champagne cognac of 1818, bearing the legend Restauration on the label and obviously produced to celebrate the return of the French monarchy, sold for Pounds 602 at Sotheby's on Wednesday.</p>

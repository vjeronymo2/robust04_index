			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Ministers plan Sinn Fein reply Senior ministers will meet later today to finalise the government's response to the demand by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, for detailed clarification of the Anglo-Irish declaration. Amid pessimism in Whitehall about the prospects for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland, it was clear last night that the government would go no further than to restate the principles underlying last December's declaration. Ministers agreed that the response should not be open to charges that it was obstructing genuine peace overtures from Sinn Fein. Downing Street is also anxious to avoid a serious rift with Dublin in spite of irritation at comments in the US earlier this week by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Good relations with Dublin are vital if, after next month's European elections, the government is to relaunch its efforts to secure a political settlement in Northern Ireland and a successor to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. But ministers agreed that the government could not be seen to be 'sitting an examination paper' set by the IRA. Mr Major believes the government cannot pre-empt any decisions or agreements reached in discussions with the province's constitutional parties, which would give Sinn Fein an advantage while the IRA continues its campaign of violence. In spite of Mr Reynolds' apparent hopes that Mr Gerry Adams still wants an end to the conflict, British ministers are sceptical about the Sinn Fein president's intentions.</p>

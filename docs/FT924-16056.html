			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (10): Strong local control - Why French new towns are different FRANCE has still not resolved the problem of social unrest in impoverished suburbs, but it is breathing more easily over its 20-year-old experience of new towns. There are now seven new towns in France, of which five ring the densely packed capital of Paris. The two others are outside Lyons in southern France and Marseilles on the Mediterranean. The one outside Lille in the north became part of the city in 1982, and one near Rouen was scrapped at the end of 1988 after running into development problems. The statistic the authorities are most proud of is that the number of jobs matches the size of the workforce living in most new towns. This is against a backdrop of an unemployment rate of about 10 per cent. Seven years ago, no-one was counting on achieving this goal. Although initially France modelled its new towns on those in the UK, several differences have emerged in subsequent years. Here, new town planning and management have become much less concentrated in the hands of central government since the decentralisation of power began 10 years ago. For the first 10 years, social housing represented about 90 per cent of the total. But now, about two-thirds of the housing is developed by the private sector, whereas the public sector still dominates in the UK. It is estimated that every French franc of state cash generates up to FFr10 of private money poured into property, industry and other economic activities. Another important difference between the two countries was that the French new towns were carved out of agricultural land at least 25 kilometres from the nearest town, whereas in the UK they were built alongside industrial conurbations. For the French this meant that the basic infrastructure also had to be provided. Social diversity has come to new towns in France with the arrival of large corporate enterprises. The foreign companies are mostly American, Japanese and German, and include IBM, Hewlett Packard, 3M and Honda. Despite doubts at the start, senior executives have opted to live in the new towns, where all the facilities required for them and their families are close at hand. Universities too are being built to cater to the second generation of residents in and around new towns. One of the difficulties facing the student population is the lack of suitable housing. In the absence of rooms to let, the authorities are looking for a new concept. Four universities will be operating this academic year, and will welcome a total of nearly 4,000 students. The 1995 target is 10,000 in each establishment, which concentrate on science and technology, economics and law, and will offer all levels of degree. Thought is also being given to retirement homes to fill in another remaining social gap. Contrary to expectations, people are putting down roots, and are creating true communities. Today the new towns in France house about 800,000 people and provide jobs to 300,000. The five around Paris are at different stages of development. Evry and St. Quentin-en-Yvelines are almost finished, whereas Marne-la-Vallee, which is also home to the EuroDisneyland theme park, is expected to take another 15 years to complete and Melun-Senart another 20 years. Recently, one could be forgiven for believing that nothing happened in Marne-la-Vallee until EuroDisney arrived. But already FFr5bn a year has been invested there in the past decade. With the theme park, the new town is the second largest building site in France after the Channel Tunnel. Until the end of 1991, investments in French new towns held up better than in other areas of the Paris region, according to M. Gilles Carrez, secretary-general of the governmental Groupe Central des Villes Nouvelles. Since then, the pinch has been felt in office and upper range residential property. But the equivalent of council housing and lower priced private homes remain relatively healthy. The fear now is that the continuing drop in land and property prices will narrow the difference between those prevailing in new towns and other parts of the capital area. Meanwhile, lessons have been learned from the mistakes of the 1970s, when split-level urban planning was in fashion. Now there is a return to more traditional ideas of town centres. Those to be developed in St. Quentin-en-Yvelines and Melun-Senart will even include hypermarkets in order to integrate them into the overall scheme of shopping. This will increase development costs sharply, but the human gains are expected to outweigh the financial outlays.</p>

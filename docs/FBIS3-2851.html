He stood and warmly spoke to Shi Haifa, abbot of  Luoyang's Baima Temple: "Please come sit in the front row!"  When the abbot, who is over 70 years old and wore a patchwork  outer vestment, sat down in the front row, Li Changchun,  secretary of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee, stated to  clinch the point: "Comrade Luo Gan is in charge of religious  affairs in the State Council. This is a concrete demonstration  of how he has attached importance to religious affairs!"    When it was time for NPC deputies from Henan to express  their  views, the deputies vied with each other to speak first. Li  Changchun held up his hand and said: "Please, let the abbot  speak first, for people of religious circles have priority!"  Shi Haifa then expressed his opinions on refurbishing scenic  spots and developing tourist resources in Henan.  <H5>  Make a "Report" to Vice Premier Li </H5>   When Vice Premier Li Lanqing took part in a group  discussion,  Director Hao Yanzhong of China No. 2 Grinding Wheel Plant began  to speak. His first sentence was: "Let me report to Vice  Premier Li first!"    In the last year's NPC session, Li Lanqing had asked  Director  Hao: "Can your plant earn more than $10 million in foreign  exchange in 1993?" Director Hao expressed his firm confidence  at that time. Through hard work by staff members and workers of  the entire plant, the plant's foreign exchange earnings  increased from $8.25 million in 1992 to $10.86 million in 1994.  After hearing his report, Vice Premier Li said with a smile:  "Very well! However, you have merely accomplished your goal.  Please work harder this year!" [passage omitted]</p>

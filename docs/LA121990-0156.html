			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ILL-FITTED FOR FILM, IGLESIAS SAYS  </P> <P> Singer Julio Iglesias says he knows his limitations and that means his world is  on a sound stage, not a movie set.  </P> <P> Iglesias said he decided not to pursue an acting career because "I am the worst  actor on earth," the singer confessed in an interview to be shown on "The Joan  Rivers Show."  </P> <P> "I did a film 20 years ago, and when I saw the film again, I felt guilty and  embarrassed," he said.  </P> <P> "I need to sing," Iglesias told Rivers, but "I don't need to spend two hours  singing in a movie."  </P> <P> Iglesias admits that he would "love to do that. It's such a nice situation to  be an actor," but he also says, "I can't make it."  </P></p>

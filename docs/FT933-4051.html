			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: An African Macbeth - Theatre JOHN Mortimer's father used to greet his three-year-old son with 'Is execution done on Cawdor?', expecting a reply from the fledgling barrister-writer. The beauty of this is that the entire play flashes in front of you: the blood, the dark, the assassinations, the multitudinous seas. Macbeth translates well from one place to another. At the Bridge Lane Theatre, clannish Scotland has become tribal Africa, maybe Nigeria or Ghana. This is a predominantly black African Macbeth from Committed Artists UK, a British company which has just finished a tour of the US. The production has moments of great power, but could still quicken and concentrate. The set is a large sandy pancake with oil drums round one side and a smoking pot of incense in the middle. The modern design puts the soldiers in red berets and fatigues; the weapons of choice, a problem when bringing Shakespeare into the era of automatic fire, are machetes. At the opening, the witches curse and spit in the sand, like the exemplary weird sisters in Roman Polanski's violent film version. This is voodoo rather than Celtic sorcery, and the witches are an unsettling presence appearing throughout the action behind a mesh screen at the wall behind the circular stage. Later, the witches work themselves into a fine frenzy, dispelling the thought that 'double double toil and trouble' might have more to do with backgammon than the clairvoyant cassoulet ('eye of newt . . . tongue of dog') they are cooking for Macbeth. Stephen Rayne's direction of this, Shakespeare's shortest play, strings the action out; the acting, especially in the court scenes, is fitful and patchy. Macbeth (Hakeem Kae-Kazeem) starts out matter-of-factly, a trigger-happy guerrilla. But with 'If it were done, when 'tis done' the issues become lucid, even if elsewhere the verse sounds choppy. The Banquo-ghost scenes are a stormy triumph, but Macbeth finishes too quietly, wrapped in a cloak, rocking on his haunches over the body of his wife, clutching a voodoo doll as the witches look on. The play's energies gather at the entrance of Lady Macbeth, superbly played by Jaye Griffiths. From her first lines she finds the urgency and breathiness in the part. She reacts physically as she summons the spirits to 'unsex' her and fill her with cruelty. The production draws on Trevor Nunn's chamber style of Shakespeare from the Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. It shows Bridge Lane at its best; this is a fine space, an Almeida south of the river, just surviving into its 11th year in a harsh financial climate. In repertory, Bridge Lane Theatre, SW11 (071-228-8828).</p>

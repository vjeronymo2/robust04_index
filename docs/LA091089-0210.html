			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE BEST LOW-CASH WAYS TO FINANCE A HOME;  </P> <P> MANY PROPERTIES CAN BE BOUGHT WITH SMALL DOWN PAYMENTS AND AN IMAGINATIVE  APPROACH.  </P> <P> Many potential home buyers are so discouraged about ever owning a home that  they have given up. Too many prospective homeowners think a down payment of at  least 20% of the purchase price is required to buy a home. But that's not true.  If you know the best sources of low-cash home financing you can buy with very  little cash.  </P> <P> However, not all of these methods will apply to every home. But you may be able  to combine several techniques to purchase a home. That's why it is important to  know these best methods and then determine which will work for the home you  want to buy.  </P> <P> To illustrate, if you want to buy a $200,000 home with zero cash, a new VA  mortgage won't work because most lenders limit VA loans to only $144,000.  However, several of the other low-cash techniques will work to finance a  $200,000 home purchase. Or you may be able to combine a VA mortgage with a  seller-financed mortgage. Here are today's five best low-cash home finance  sources to consider:  </P> <P> Your best mortgage source. In these days of abundant but expensive home  mortgage money, most home buyers and their realty agents have forgotten the  home seller is, by far, the best home mortgage source.  </P> <P> Advantages for buyers include low interest rate, no application fees or forms  and easy financing. Seller benefits include welcome interest income higher than  is available at local banks and savings and loans, safety of a mortgage on your  former residence and an easy quick sale for top dollar.  </P> <P> When buying any property, especially a home, always ask why the seller is  selling. Often you will learn the seller is retiring and moving from the area.  I find elderly home sellers are the best candidates for low-cash seller  financing, especially if their home has been for sale several months and is  vacant. You will be amazed how many elderly people own their homes free and  clear with no mortgage and will gladly finance your purchase.  </P> <P> But first you must ask. Please don't be discouraged if the realty agent says  with great authority: "I know the seller won't help finance this sale." Until  the seller sees a written offer on the table, which provides for the seller to  carry back a first or second mortgage, nobody knows for sure if the seller will  become the buyer's lender.  </P> <P> FHA, VA and PMI mortgages. If you can't get the seller to finance your  purchase, consider a new VA, FHA, or PMI (private mortgage insurance) home  loan. The big advantage is low- or no-cash down payment.  </P> <P> However, these loans have drawbacks. The maximum FHA loan is only $101,250  (lower in some areas) and this is not enough in expensive areas such as most of  California. But the FHA mortgage advantages are a down payment of less than 5%  and a fixed-interest rate. Incidentally, the FHA maximum limit is expected to  be raised later this year.  </P> <P> VA mortgages, available to qualified veterans, require no cash down payment  except for a 1% loan origination fee. The maximum VA loan is $144,000 from most  lenders but legally there is no limit set by the Veterans Administration. With  both VA and FHA loans, be sure the lender has automatic approval authority,  otherwise loan approval can take forever.  </P> <P> PMI home loans for 90% and 95% of the home purchase price are available from  most banks and S&amp;Ls. However, many PMI companies have had heavy losses  recently, so PMI borrowers need good income and good credit to qualify. But  there are big differences among PMI companies, which insure lenders against  losses on the loan amount above 80% loan to value. If you get rejected by one  PMI company, apply for a loan with another lender who uses a different PMI  firm.  </P> <P> Lease with an option to buy. My favorite way to finance a home purchase is to  lease with an option to buy. That is how I acquired my personal residence. If I  can do it, you can, too. This method works in all price ranges. For example,  last week I heard from a reader who is lease-optioning a $600,000-house.  </P> <P> Advantages for lease-option home buyers include locking in the option purchase  price at today's market value, investing typically only $1,000 to $5,000 as  non-refundable consideration for the option (this is much less than a customary  down payment), negotiating a partial or full rent credit toward the down  payment and keeping monthly costs below what it would cost to make monthly  mortgage payments on the same property.  </P> <P> Advantages for lease-option home sellers include nontaxable receipt and use of  the option consideration money (it becomes taxable when either the option is  exercised or the option expires unexercised), higher-quality tenant than  ordinary renters, little or no management work and continued income tax  deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes and depreciation.  </P> <P> Assume an existing assumable mortgage. There are millions of existing assumable  home loans such as VA, FHA and ARM (adjustable-rate mortgages). If the seller  has little equity in the home you may be able to buy for very little cash.  However, if the seller has a large equity, but you only have a small amount of  down payment cash, don't hesitate to ask the seller to carry back a large  second mortgage to fill the finance gap.  </P> <P> Trade something you don't need for the down payment. If you own other real  estate, such as a vacant lot or a costly toy such as a boat, recreational  vehicle or exotic sports car, these can be traded as all or part of your home  down payment. For example, a few weeks ago I was selling a house, and a  prospective buyer drove up in a Porsche. He liked the house but didn't have  enough cash for a down payment. When I suggested he trade his Porsche to me for  the down payment, he couldn't bear to part with it. As a result, he is still a  renter rather than a homeowner.  </P> <P> There are many home finance sources in addition to the traditional 20% cash  down payment and 80% conventional mortgage. With the help of a creative real  estate agent and determined persistence, somehow, someway, you can acquire the  home you want.  </P></p>

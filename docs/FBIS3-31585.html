Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase [executive president of  the Social Democracy Party of Romania-PDSR]."    In an article published on the front page of the  aforementioned weekly, the PRM leader claims that "the  information about Madame Roxana Sugurel (former secretary of  Traian Chebeleu when the latter was working at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs -- editorial note), with whom the insatiable  Chebeleu was caught in compromising circumstances inside the  sanctuary of Cotroceni [presidential palace], were telephoned in  to our magazine by an aide to President Ion Iliescu, whose  allegations were also backed by a senator."    After vilifying Traian Chebeleu once more, Corneliu Vadim  Tudor launches a frontal attack against President Ion Iliescu,  insinuating that he might also have been involved in similar  sexual scandals: "Why do you defend his sexual escapades and  aberrations, Mr. Iliescu? Do you want us to believe the similar  press accusations against you on the same subject, regarding  certain affairs you had when you were first secretary of the  Central Committee of the Union of Communist Youth or on your  various assignments in Iasi, Timisoara, the Ministry of Waters,  or the Technical Publishing House?"    Corneliu Vadim Tudor does not forget Adrian Nastase, either,  who is picked as a target for the letter of support he has sent  to the presidential spokesman. The PDSR executive president,  Adrian Nastase, is called "sweetheart beatitude" (preafericitul  bombonel), winner of the great "silver condom" prize.    Finally, in the PRM leader's opinion, the two politicians,  Ion Iliescu and Adrian Nastase, "are surely leading the country  to new disasters."</p>

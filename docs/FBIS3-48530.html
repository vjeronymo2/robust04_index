Passing this message on to the Thai Boon Rong (TBR) company  was what ordinary Cambodians did last Thursday in their third  protest against prices at the TBR-built market in central Phnom  Penh.    "The good investors will drive out the bad," read placards  last week, using a near identical line from Rangsi's speech made  during Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's Cambodia visit.    Support for the dispute has widened since the last  demonstration on December 20. Some of last week's protesters  said they were students from several Phnom Penh colleges.    Apart from supporting the traders' claims that rents at the  soon to-be-completed TBR market are too high, demonstrators said  they were showing their support for Rangsi in his heated war of  words with TBR chairman Theng Bun Ma.    "We come here because we want to find justice for Sam  Rangsi," student leader Pich Moniroat told journalists in front  of 1,000 people gathered opposite Phnom Penh's National Assembly  building.    At a January 11 press conference, Rangsi said King Sihanouk  had sent a message fully supporting the market traders, wrote  the latest edition of Cambodia's fortnightly English-language  PHNOM PENH POST newspaper.    A few days later, the TBR chairman published a letter in  another local newspaper describing Rangsi as "the minister of  destroying national economy and finance" accusing him of using  "inciting" language, and inviting him to "inspect our company".    Rangsi's written response spoke of "the economic colonialist  yoke of the Thai Boon Rong company which has the backing of the  mafia operating in nearby countries". In his letter, Rangsi  promised to send "officials to inspect your company in the  future".    A student from Phnom Penh's economics institute said he had  come to support Rangsi against TBR. "The youth support king,  National Assembly, and Sam Rangsi" read a nearby placard.    "I come here with the youth and business people to ask the  Government to kick the Thai Boon Rong company out of Cambodia,"  said Pich Moniroat, who told journalists he was head of the  Patriotic Youth Association from Phnom Penh University.    "Why didn't Thai Boon Rong settle with excellency Sam Rangsi  in a quiet way (instead) of putting in the newspaper?" asked  Pich rhetorically.    Unofficial Cambodian sources say the REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA  newspaper which ran Theng Bun Ma's criticism of Rangsi is at  least partly owned by the TBR group. In his written reply to  the company chairman, Rangsi refers to the "clarification which  you had your newspaper publish".    The demonstration seems to have caught the imagination of an  increasing number of Cambodians. Details remain sketchy about  TBR itself.    Chairman Theng Bun Ma is a Sino-Cambodian from Kompong Cham  province, a TBR representative told Inside Indochina.    "According to what I receive, he is originally a Cambodian  who fled durihg the war to become a Thai citizen," Cambodia's  Information Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse said in a  telephone interview last week. "The company is a Thai company."    In the TBR chairman's newspaper message to Rangsi, the  letter  accused the finance minister of daring to "denounce the previous  government".    Senior officials in the now-defunct State of Cambodia (SOC)  regime are widely blamed by Cambodians for corrupt selling of  state assets which led to Phnom Penh's December 1991  anti-corruption riots.    The TBR chairman appears to be trying to exaggerate  differences between the former SOC rulers and the FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] party to which Rangsi belongs and  which won the elections in May, observers say.    After the second market demonstration in December, First  Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Cabinet director Li  Thuch said a "positive start" had been made on solving the  dispute and no more protests would occur. Government officials  and protestors last week contradicted him.    "At this time, this thing is not moving anywhere," said  Lapresse.    Inside Indochina at the end of last week was unable to  contact TBR company representatives or Rangsi for comment on the  latest developments.    Apart from the market at the centre of this dispute, TBR is  developing several hotels in Phnom Penh. Early last-month, the  company donated a 12-seater plane to the Government, according  to an AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE report published on December 7.    A few weeks ago, THE CAMBODIA TIMES newspaper ran a  full-page  50th birthday greeting to First Prime Minister Ranariddh "With  Best Wishes" from Theng Bun Ma and all personnel at TBR.    Last week's protesters had a different message for the TBR  chairman: "We want the Royal Government to settle this dispute  with Thai Boon Rong company in front of the people," said  student leader Pich, 30.    "We will demonstrate again if there is no solution."</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAND ON THEATER ALTERED AFTER $10,000 GIFT  </P> <P> Three weeks before it abruptly dropped its opposition last spring to the  demolition of one of downtown's oldest theaters, the region's most influential  preservation group got a $10,000 contribution from the father of the building's  owners.  </P> <P> Stung by criticism after disclosure of the donation, Los Angeles Conservancy  leaders have had to fend off suggestions that a deal was struck with the owners  of the California Theater who sought its demolition to make way for a parking  lot.  </P> <P> The 1918 movie palace on Main Street, with a two-story beaux-arts facade styled  after the Paris Opera, is being torn down. A final bid to save it stalled in  August before a city panel -- in large part, some preservationists assert,  because the Conservancy withdrew support for making it a landmark.  </P> <P> The Conservancy, a private nonprofit group with 6,000 members and a $500,000  annual budget, often acts as an unofficial adviser to the city on preservation  issues and is regarded as a major voice in influencing what sites are  considered for protected landmark status.  </P> <P> Conservancy leaders say the close timing of the withdrawal of their landmark  support and businessman Jack Needleman's $10,000 donation -- the biggest  individual gift in the 12-year-old group's history -- was nothing more than an  "unfortunate" coincidence. Needleman's sons own the theater.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the group's board of directors on Monday ordered the development  of a formal fund-raising policy to provide "safeguards against acceptance of  donations constituting the appearance or actuality of a conflict of interest."  </P> <P> Acknowledging that "questions have been raised," the group's executive  committee said it had "reviewed the full history of our involvement with the  California Theater, and is satisfied that no improprieties have occurred."  </P> <P> But some local preservationists say they remain troubled.  </P> <P> "Because of the timing of the donation," said Rory Cunningham a Conservancy  member for four years, "it looks quite suspicious to everyone. . . . It sends a  frightening message to developers that preservationists can be bought."  </P> <P> Said Hillsman Wright, a Conservancy member who is also chairman of the Historic  Theater Foundation, "I don't know if anyone can ever document that there was a  quid pro quo here, but the issue is the appearance of evil."  </P> <P> The Conservancy was instrumental in temporarily halting demolition of the  California Theater in 1988. But on May 24 it withdrew its nomination to the  city-appointed Cultural Heritage Commission to make the site a protected  landmark. It was the first time the Conservancy has withdrawn such a  nomination.  </P> <P> Needleman's gift had "nothing at all" to do with the group's position,  Conservancy Executive Director Jay Rounds asserted.  </P> <P> Since Needleman owns several historic downtown buildings, Rounds said, "clearly  this was someone with whom it was important for us to develop a relationship,  regardless of what happened on that particular case."  </P> <P> When he and Needleman spoke on May 2, Rounds said, "I asked him if he would  consider becoming a financial contributor in light of the work we were doing  together and he said, 'Yes, how about $10,000?' "  </P> <P> Jack Needleman was out of town this week and could not be reached for comment.  His son, Steven, said that the events leading to the theater's demolition were  "completely aboveboard."  </P></p>

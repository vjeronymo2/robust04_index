			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Spanish organisation delivering the Games goods SPANISH yachting has become a metaphor for the nation's Olympic pride. Halfway into the Games, events are going as well as any Spaniard dare hope, with a clutch of gold medal chances at sea and barely a stumble elsewhere. Organisation, backed by investment, is delivering the Olympic goods. In men's 470 dinghies, helmsman Jordi Calafat and his crew Francisco Sanchez have posted an extraordinary record in the first four races of this most competitive class. Any 'Anglo' given to comments about the erratic brilliance of the Hispanic nations has to argue with Calafat's record of three firsts and a tenth. At the fourth-race stage they were 21.4 points clear as overall leaders, with Britons Paul Brotherton and Andy Hemmings in second place. 'We are going to keep taking risks in order to win, but we have to be calm - tranquil enough not to make mistakes,' said Calafat ashore after another victory. In women's 470 dinghies, Theresa Zabell, a resident of Barcelona though born in Ipswich, has posted a record nearly as impressive as Calafat's. A first, second and third have put her in second place overall. Were it not for a premature start in her first race this supremely aggressive 27-year-old computer programmer, currently world champion in 470's, would undoubtedly be lying first. King Juan Carlos's passion for sailing has been passed on to his children (the Infanta Christina crewed the women's 470 in Seoul) and, apparently, the Spanish people. Yesterday he was at sea with his eldest daughter Elena and the King of Greece watching the Soling race. But more important than a royal lead has probably been the sponsorship of the national sailing squad by Fortuna cigarettes. This division of the giant state-owned Tabacalera tobacco company has provided the yachting squad with around Pounds 6m over four years. 'Sailors have had a salary, the best boats and equipment, plus two years of sailing out of the Olympic harbour in Barcelona,' said an executive. The local Olympic organising committee itself is also benefitting from the undoubted success of the Games to date. A week ago Barcelonans were still grumbling about the income tax increases that start on Monday to help pay for the Olympic festival. However, seven days of praise from ordinary visitors, the media and even the august International Olympic Committee (IOC) has persuaded many citizens to walk tall and not count the cost of the party for a month or two. 'The IOC are hot, tired - and loving it. They think the Barcelona Games are splendid,' said one official who has been holed up with the elite in the closely-guarded Princess Sophia hotel. However, travel to distant sites has been onerous in the heatwave, and the transport provided has tended to be the only weakish link in the Olympic chain. For once the sailors have not been the distant poor relations of the Games. That lot has fallen to the rowers in the lakeside town of Banyoles, 155km north-east of Barcelona. Some of them are unlikey to care. So far it has been a somewhat more successful week for Britain's rowers than the experts had been predicting. Of course, Steven Redgrave and his latest partner Mathew Pinsent can be depended upon like a Swiss watch. In their coxless pairs semi-final they beat main rivals Germany by over two seconds and Redgrave declared himself delighted to have achieved such pyschological superiority ahead of today's final. 'We were thrilled to see that the three medallists from the world championships were drawn in our race as it gave us a very good feel for how the final will go,' said Redgrave. In tomorrow's men's eights final, an inexperienced British team has done a remarkable job to be ranked third. Many rowers from countries not in the medal hunt will be at least as interested in the plans Denis Oswald, president of FISA, the sport's governing body, unveils later today. Olympic president Juan Antonio Samaranch has been warning rowing for some time that it has too many classes, too many different types of boat and costs too much to fit comfortably into an Olympic movement committed to slimming itself. Oswald may announce a savage voluntary diet.</p>

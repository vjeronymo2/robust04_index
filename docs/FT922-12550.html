			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Lloyd Webber pays Pounds 10.12m for Canaletto: Saleroom ANDREW Lloyd Webber, the composer who threatened to leave the UK if Labour won the general election, yesterday celebrated the Conservative victory by paying Pounds 10.12m at Christie's for Canaletto's 'The Old Horse Guards, London'. The view of St James's Park was painted in 1749 just before the present Horse Guards in Whitehall was erected. Along with Mr Charles Saatchi, who buys contemporary art, Mr Lloyd Webber is the UK's leading collector of works of art. His main area of interest is pre-Raphaelite and Victorian paintings but, through dealer Mr David Mason, he has recently bought extensively into ceramics. He decided to bid for the Canaletto on Wednesday morning and secured it for about Pounds 2m less than his upper limit. The Canaletto, a large work in excellent condition, has been in the Harris family since the mid 18th century. There were fears that the painting would be sold to a foreign buyer and the Tate Gallery in London was keen to acquire it for the nation before the auction, but no deal could be arranged. Mr Lloyd Webber's successful intervention keeps the Canaletto in the UK and ensures that it will periodically be put on public display. The price was higher than the Christie's forecast and establishes a record for the artist and for any Old Master sold in the UK, beating the Pounds 8.1m paid for Mantegna's 'Adoration of the Magi' at Christie's in 1985. The Canaletto sale distracted attention from Christie's failure to sell the other leading painting in the auction, Rembrandt's 'Daniel and Cyrus Before the Idol of Bel'. This was unsold when the bidding stopped at Pounds 5.8m, but is close enough to the reserve price for Christie's to hope for a private deal in the next few days. The Old Master auction totalled Pounds 13.654m, but was 40 per cent unsold by value. Demand was patchy, although a portrait of a young girl by Lucas Cranach sold well at Pounds 506,000 and a self-portrait by Salvator Rosa also beat its estimate at Pounds 440,000.</p>

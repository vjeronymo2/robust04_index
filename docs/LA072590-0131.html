			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION FAVORS PHONE FIRMS' ENTRY INTO CABLE, NO RE-REGULATION  </P> <P> The Bush Administration said Tuesday that it favors allowing telephone  companies into the cable-television business but opposes even modest  re-regulation of the cable industry.  </P> <P> In fact, Thomas J. Sugrue, deputy assistant secretary of commerce, said  President Bush may veto legislation to regulate the industry, even if it  includes a provision that would permit phone companies to enter the cable  business.  </P> <P> Sugrue's testimony before a congressional subcommittee broke two years of  virtual silence by the Administration on the subject. Critics charge that  permitting the phone companies into the business could lead to a massive  monopoly over the communications field.  </P> <P> "The Administration believes pro-consumer objectives can best be accomplished  in the long run, not by re-regulating the cable industry, but by expanding  competition," Sugrue said.  </P> <P> The Administration is so opposed to regulation that it also cautioned against  Congress "attempting to specify detailed safeguards" against the phone  companies if they are allowed entry into cable.  </P> <P> Such safeguards would be designed to prevent phone companies from using  telephone rates to subsidize their cable-television business or from engaging  in discriminatory practices against cable competitors that use their telephone  lines.  </P> <P> Sugrue's staunch free market approach came in a Senate Commerce, Science and  Transportation subcommittee hearing on the provision relating to the phone  companies. It marked the first time that a Bush Administration official had  agreed to discuss its ideas about cable before a Senate panel, even though a  bill that would re-regulate the industry already is on the Senate floor and  near passage.  </P> <P> Despite Sugrue's testimony, many in Congress said they still doubt that the  Administration in an election year would veto legislation designed to help  consumers angry with price gouging and poor service in the cable industry.  </P> <P> The only check on free market competition that Sugrue said the Administration  would want to toughen is a provision to forbid phone companies from entering  the cable-television business by acquiring existing cable-TV companies. The  current bill, sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.), would allow phone  companies to acquire minority interests in existing cable companies and in some  cases controlling interests.  </P> <P> The Administration's rigid free-market approach offered so late in the process  clearly annoyed members of the Senate and provoked several sarcastic exchanges.  </P> <P> Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the subcommittee, wanted to know  why the Administration offered its views only after 10 hearings involving 80  witnesses, and just as the re-regulation legislation is ready for Senate  action.  </P> <P> The only other contact from the Administration was a three-paragraph letter  sent the day the Commerce Committee took final action on re-regulation. The  letter said without explanation that the Administration opposes the bill.  </P> <P> Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) asked if the Administration's stance against  regulation means that it does not see the cable industry as a monopoly. Most  cable operators have exclusive franchises in their communities.  </P> <P> "I would say it is not fully competitive and not fully a monopoly," Sugrue  answered.  </P> <P> Danforth continued to probe, asking what constitutes competition for cable  companies and whether the Administration considers over-the-air broadcasters to  constitute effective competition. Sugrue said the Administration is split over  what constitutes effective competition.  </P> <P> The White House said Tuesday night that the Administration will announce  whether it intends to veto the measure when the legislation is passed by  Congress. Most experts believe that it would prefer to see the Senate and House  bills die rather than having to face the politically difficult option of  vetoing a bill favored by many consumers.  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Rolls-Royce cuts pay increase for car workers as sales fall ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars is to halve cost-of-living pay increases for its 3,000-strong workforce because of the continued fall in worldwide sales. Workers had expected a 6 per cent pay rise in February, plus 4 per cent in return for the introduction of new working practices. The 4 per cent will still be paid but there will be only 3 per cent extra as a cost-of-living increase. The increases had been agreed with unions under a two-year deal; the second year of the agreement begins next month. The reduced increase has been approved by unions. Two-year deals are common in motor manufacturing as a way of increasing stability and reducing time spent on pay talks. It is extremely unusual for the second part of a two-year agreement to be renegotiated, even if there is a drop in prevailing rates of pay or inflation slows. The Engineering Employers' Federation said last week that the median among its affiliates concluding pay deals in December was 4 per cent. Ford recently concluded a two-year pay deal for its 29,000 manual workers that led to pay rises of 5 per cent. Vauxhall, in pay negotiations covering 9,000 manual workers, has offered 5 per cent in the first year, again as part of a two-year deal. Rolls-Royce said that in view of market conditions it would have been 'madness' to pay increases of the size previously agreed under the two-year deal. Had the agreement not been in place, the workforce would not have expected any pay increase, it added. The company, which is a subsidiary of Vickers, cut its workforce by more than a third last year and introduced three-day working at one of its plants. Sales worldwide dropped by about half last year compared with 1990. Recessions in the UK and the US have hit sales. The introduction of a US luxury car tax has also had a strong impact on sales of the company's Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars. It said yesterday that it could see no immediate uplift in business.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MANY PEOPLE NEED HELP: LANDERS  </P> <P> Ann Landers says "a lot of people need professional help," including those who  write excessively long letters to advice columnists.  </P> <P> The veteran agony aunt said she skimmed through 1,500 letters on a flight  Friday from Chicago to Seattle where she spoke to the Northwest Women's Show.  </P> <P> Letters on old themes, like those from teen-agers asking how to get more  attention from a potential mate, can be boring, she admitted. And, naturally,  she prefers letters that are reasonably concise.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I'll get people who write 14 pages or so, but those people are  probably psychotic, though," she said. "I tell them they need professional  help. You know, a lot of people need professional help."  </P> <P> One recurrent theme is whether toilet paper should be hung over the top or down  against the wall.  </P> <P> "I'm very compulsive about it," she said. "The toilet paper needs to be hung  down along the wall. I'll actually rearrange it myself if I'm over at someone's  home and I see it hung over the top."  </P></p>

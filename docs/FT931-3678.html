			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / UN general digs in at siege town GENERAL Philippe Morillon, the French commander of United Nations troops in Bosnia, has vowed to stay in the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica until a stranded aid convoy arrives, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. He has set up headquarters in the eastern Bosnia town, which has been under Serb siege for 11 months, said Mr Laurens Jolles of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, who left Srebrenica yesterday. The decision by Gen Morillon, who reached the town on Saturday, was warmly endorsed by the French government. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said: 'There are moments when one man can change the course of events.' The UN aid convoy that had set out for Srebrenica yesterday was turned back by Serb police backed by an armoured car. UN officials said the convoy, carrying 125 tonnes of aid, travelled only 12 miles before being forced back. About 60,000 people in Srebrenica have received no aid by road since December, but the US Air Force dropped supplies by parachute into the area on Saturday night. Thousands of refugees rushed to the hills when they spotted aid palettes brought by parachute and several were reported to have been killed in the scramble for food. Mr Jolles said that thousands of ragged refugees were crowding the streets of the town because there was no housing: 'There are streams of people coming in. At night, you can see thousands of small fires in the streets with people sitting around them.' Gen Morillon went to Srebrenica with a small team after Dr Simon Mardel of the World Health Organisation had reported that sick and wounded people there were dying at the rate of 30 a day. Dr Mardel described yesterday how Moslems in the area were dying in large numbers from starvation or wounds from Serb artillery bombardments. He said in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, that the torment he had witnessed in Srebrenica and nearby Konjevic Polje surpassed his experiences in Ethiopia, Liberia or Afghanistan. Gen Morillon yesterday told the French TF1 television channel that the arrival of the convoy was 'a matter of life or death'. He urged the US to concentrate its aid effort on Srebrenica. A third of Bosnia's lawmakers yesterday endorsed a new package of positions on a peace plan presented by President Alija Izetbegovic, AP reports from Sarajevo. Serb forces prevented other deputies from crossing siege lines to attend. Acceptance came after Mr Izetbegovic and about 30 deputies - those from Sarajevo - had discussed the peace plan drafted by negotiators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. The legislators prevented from entering Sarajevo will meet today in Zenica.</p>

According to the latest statistics, 6,430 foreign-funded  enterprises were registered in this coastal province in 1993, an  increase of 160 percent over the previous year.    These enterprises involve a total investment of 10.58  billion  U.S. dollars including 3.978 billion U.S. dollars of foreign  investment on contract.    So far, the province has 12,600 foreign-funded enterprises,  with a total contractual investment of 7.1 billion U.S. dollars.    A survey shows that the number of countries and regions that  have invested in Shandong rose from 29 before 1991 to 70 by the  end of last year.    Foreign business people have expanded their investment scope  from just the catering trade and motor vehicle maintenance two  years ago to commerce, service trades, transportation, tourism,  information and banking in addition to agriculture and industry.    A local official noted that the proportion of exports from  foreign-funded enterprises last year accounted for one-fourth of  the province's total, up from 17.5 in 1992.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: BCH set to cut petrol unit stake Banco Central Hispano (BCH) may sell 18 per cent of Cepsa, Spain's second-ranked petrol refiner and distributor, as a means of underpinning flagging banking profits. BCH has hired J. P. Morgan, the US bank, as adviser to the sale which could raise between Pta40bn and Pta45bn (Dollars 340m) in what would be the bank's largest disposal so far of its wide spread of industrial interests. As part of the deal, which would reduce BCH's shareholding in Cepsa to 20 per cent, the bank is seeking to retain the voting rights of the shares it is selling in order to remain a controlling shareholder in Cepsa. Cepsa, which has a 25 per cent share of the domestic petrol market, has traditionally been the most important single element in BCH's industrial portfolio. BCH said yesterday that three options were under consideration: to issue Cepsa warrants to outside investors; to create a portfolio company, controlled by BCH, which would buy 18 per cent of Cepsa from the bank; to enlist an investor group, willing to waive its voting rights, as a large Cepsa shareholder. The disposal under any of the three procedures would be conducted with the approval of Elf Aquitaine, the French energy group which has a 30 per cent stake in Cepsa and a 2 per cent holding in BCH. It is understood that Elf does not want to increase its equity in Cepsa. BCH's initiative will be welcomed by analysts in Madrid who have consistently called on the bank to switch funds away from industrial assets and into mainstream banking to improve bank profit margins. This year BCH reduced its stake in Aumar, a toll motorway operator, from more than 60 per cent to 51 per cent via a global share offering. If BCH succeeds in disposing of part of its Cepsa stake while retaining control over the refiner, it is likely that the bank will move on to consider further equity sales, notably at Vallehermoso, a property company; Dragados, a construction group; and at Azucarera, a sugar company. BCH's chief concern is the disappointing performance of its banking operations where greater liquidity is required in order to lift earn-ings. The bank recently appointed a new chief executive, Mr Angel Corcostegui. Mr Corcostegui was a former top executive at rival bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya.</p>

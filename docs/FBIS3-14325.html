			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech delivered by Information Minister Michel Samahah, </F> marking the 16th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the  south, held in the Law and Political Science College Hall in  Beirut -- live]    [Excerpts] O delegates, we address your promising  conference, its research, and recommendations with every  confidence that the cultural struggle for liberation completes  the national struggle and martyrdom in defense of national  dignity and our sacred right to sovereignty and independence.  [passage omitted]    The liberation of our precious territories in the south and  western al-Biqa' concerns us all. It is the responsibility of  the state, which leads all its people, so that we can attain our  objective together, with the minimum cost. National accord is  the first step toward strengthening immunity in the face of  dangers and the occupation. This occupation continued when the  state was eclipsed. The state and its stability are a principal  factor in retrieving our right. Any attempt to deal a blow to  the state means collaboration with the enemy. Do whatever it  takes to strengthen the state.    One-upmanship is like retreat. Both work against the  homeland and the duty of liberation. We are facing contemporary  facts that should be well understood, acted upon, and dealt with  wisely for the sake of the homeland's victory. This stage  demands that reason prevail. Your homeland is rich with reason  and qualifications. It is the age of the responsible decision.  Know that we are now shaping our fate for years to come.    O delegates, the homeland rises with action, not with  emotions. Help to stop your enemy's objective of pushing us into  the trap of emotional behavior. Stoking up crises does not  alleviate the consequences. Solidarity in solving these crises  strengthens the steadfastness.    Our principles are constant: no giving up on the right to  retrieve our occupied territories in the south and western  al-Biqa' and no bargaining or appeasement over consolidating our  national sovereignty up to the internationally recognized  border. The way to do this is to implement the UN resolutions,  primarily Resolution 425. Lebanon has committed itself to  solidarity with the brothers, especially Syria. It has  committed itself to seeking the just and comprehensive peace.    We have declared that we seek the just and comprehensive  peace. But Israel has not refrained from committing aggression  against our people there daily.    O delegates, you know that our domestic unity is the  strongest shield, especially now when things are turbulent with  change. We must all stand united to prove that Israel, by  trying to split our ranks, cannot wrest that which it failed to  wrest at the negotiating table.    The state knows nothing of all this and has confirmed its  ability to confront any treachery or aggression that attempts to  undermine our internal stability. We have repeatedly announced  that security is on a par with freedom and that national unity  precedes politics and its games. [passage omitted]    How can we remain silent over the humiliation inflicted on  our sons detained in Israeli prisons or in al-Khiyam inside the  Lebanese border? How can we accept the daily repressive  practices against our kinsmen and their right to safety,  dignity, and a prosperous life over their land and inside their  homeland? [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From ELTA "NEWS BULLETIN" No. 409] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, Jan 6 (ELTA) -- Lithuanian Premier Adolfas  Slezevicius gave his first news conference after his holidays in  Florida on January 6. He commented on the state budget of 1994  and expressed his satisfaction about the fact that a possibility  had been found to finance restoration of historical buildings.  Then Slezevicius returned to current problems.    At present one of the major problems is the forthcoming  farmers' strike in February. Slezevicius said that he had met  with the chairman of the strike committee Jonas Ciulevicius just  before the news conference. At the meeting which lasted about  an hour possibilities of avoiding the strike were discussed.    "The right to go on strike is guaranteed by the  Constitution,  but the organizers of the strike must know that they have no  right to force farmers to go on strike and stop supplying  processing enterprises with produce. The fact that strikers  will take their produce to market places instead of processing  enterprises shows that this action could hardly be called a  strike as they had a similar right before", Slezevicius said.    Another important problem is the construction of the oil  terminal. Slezevicius emphasized that the construction of the  oil terminal in Liepaja did not mean that another terminal would  not be built in Butinge. Slezevicius told the press once again  that if the terminal is build in Liepaja, Lithuania should have  the controlling block of shares, that is 51 percent of capital.  In addition, Lithuania should get some land in the port  territory for building the joint-venture as well as some land  for construction of the oil pipeline to Mazeikiai. The final  decision on the issue should be adopted next week in Liepaja at  the meeting of Lithuanian and Latvian state delegations.</p>

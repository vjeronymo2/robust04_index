			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLURRING THE LINE  </P> <P> Among the peoples of the developed world, only Americans profess and practice  religious beliefs in large numbers. This singular situation may well derive  from another unique attribute of the American system: the legal separation of  church and state. Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court needlessly blurred that  crucial line of demarcation when it ruled Monday that government-sponsored  religious displays are legally acceptable, as long as they do not have "the  effect of promoting or endorsing religious beliefs."  </P> <P> In the case at hand (County of Allegheny et al vs. American Civil Liberties  Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, et al), the court held that the City of  Pittsburgh violated the First Amendment when it allowed a Catholic men's group  to install a creche inside a court house, but not when it permitted an Hasidic  sect to place an 18-foot menorah on the steps of a civic office building. The  court found that the creche was forbidden because it made no pretense of being  anything other than a sectarian representation of the Nativity, while the the  menorah, despite its ownership, was rendered constitutionally neutral by the  addition of aChristmas tree and an inscription promoting liberty.  </P> <P> Writing for the majority, Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that "the  government's use of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the  effect of endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use  of religious symbolism depends upon its context." Thus, Blackmun wrote,  Pittsburgh's display of a menorah and a Christmas tree was permissible because  it could "be understood as conveying the city's secular recognition of  different traditions for celebrating the winter holiday season."  </P> <P> Such a standard, which invites the appropriation of religious symbols for a  purely secular purpose -- be it political or commercial -- is and should be  offensive to sincere believers. More to the point, it is an open invitation to  endless and needlessly divisive litigation. The fact is that a creche is a  symbol of a Christian feast day; a menorah represents the Jewish festival of  Hanukkah. To pretend otherwise is to invite the insensitive and the unheeding  to affront others through subterfuge.  </P></p>

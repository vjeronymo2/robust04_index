			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (8): Less dreaming in the spires - Profile, Oxbridge OXBRIDGE has just discovered the MBA. Twenty-five years after graduate business education began to be taken seriously in Britain, its ancient universities are finally, tentatively, putting their toes in the water. Cambridge is first off the mark. It was closer to the line in the first place, with a range of undergraduate management courses already running, linked mainly to engineering but including a manufacturing and engineering tripos dating back to the mid-1980s. The university made a decisive shift last year when it launched a fully-fledged management school, named the Judge Institute - after Mr Paul Judge, former chairman of the food operation company Premier Brands, who donated Pounds 8m to get it started. Other large benefactions have come from Mr Simon Sainsbury of the retailing family (Pounds 5m) and accountants Peat Marwick (Pounds 1.5m). 'Management education is a subject which has been strangely neglected by our great universities,' said Mr Sainsbury pointedly when announcing his gift. The institute, currently in temporary premises opposite the Fitzwilliam Museum, will move in a few years to a purpose-built complex on the Old Addenbrooke's Hospital site in the city centre. The first 20 MBA students arrived last October - half of them British, average age 28, all sponsored by companies, and a majority working for international blue chip companies. MBA numbers are expected to rise to 60 a year by the late 1990s. 'We are not going to get in the business of having hundreds of students,' says Dr John Hendry, director of the MBA programme. 'Our course is as much a management development programme as a degree, involving close collaboration between staff and sponsoring companies - that makes heavy demands on tutors.' The MBA is an unusual three-year sandwich course. Students must be sponsored by their employers: after an initial 10 weeks in Cambridge, they return to their organisations for a year, when their work is supplemented by supervised study programmes and three one-week sessions at Cambridge. A second term is followed by another year of work and supervised study, and the course is topped off with a final nine weeks at Cambridge. At Pounds 7,000 a year, the institute is not trading on its name unduly. In addition to the MBA, Cambridge has also launched an M Phil programme: 19 students are in their first year, and about half are currently intending to pursue research at the doctoral level afterwards. It also plans a range of short executive courses, due to start at the end of next year. Oxford has long been a serious player in the executive course market. Templeton College, the university's management school, runs a small master's course in business, but has devoted most of its energy to developing management programmes. In 1990, courses generated 70 per cent of the college's Pounds 3.7m income. Its programmes are mostly commissioned by particular companies: regular visitors include British Aerospace, Ford Europe, Thames Water, P&amp;O, United Biscuits and the British Council Overseas - the last sponsoring a course teaching Indian managers how to work in export markets. Templeton, a nondescript campus founded in 1969, is three miles from the dreaming spires - well beyond the city's ring road. It is the chosen location for the large expansion of business studies planned by the university for the next decade. A Pounds 40m expansion scheme has been agreed: more than Pounds 5m has been raised to date, and fund-raising will start in earnest once a director is chosen. An appointment is said to be imminent - but since the college has been saying that for months, it appears to have had difficulty finding a suitable 'big name'. Oxford's MBA, due to be launched in October 1994, is an altogether more ambitious venture than Cambridge's. From an initial intake of 40, an annual entry of 150 is planned by the end of the decade. Doctoral students included, the school will be about 600-strong, with a teaching faculty of more than 50, plus 25 research fellows. That will make management the largest of the university's graduate departments. An expansion of undergraduate management courses is also planned, with an economics and management bachelor's degree on offer from 1994. Oxford's MBA is to be a two-year full-time degree. 'We think there is a role for a two-year flagship course,' says Dr Derek Morris, one of its architects. 'Few schools in Britain besides Manchester and LBS offer one at the moment, and with a three- to six-month internship included, it offers the right balance between theory and practice.' The university is anxious to dispel any impression that Templeton's location implies a marginal role for management studies in the future. About two-thirds of the MBA students will be members of 'old' colleges, and most of the faculty will hold fellowships in them too. Perhaps Templeton will be for management what Nuffield, a graduate college established in the 1930s, is for the social sciences: a focus and magnet, primus inter pares for graduate studies in its field. But at least Nuffield, with its monstrous tower, can be seen from Carfax. Templeton is 10 minutes away by taxi - and some Oxford dons wish it was further still.</p>

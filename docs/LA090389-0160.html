			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Mohawks fought with baseball bats and clubs outside a casino over the issue of  gambling on the St. Regis Indian Reservation in New York state, an issue that  has sharply divided the tribe. The clash resulted in minor injuries, but state  police, who raided Indian gambling establishments last July, immediately sealed  off the entire 22,000-acre reservation. Last weekend, one casino was set afire,  leading the owner of another to station men with automatic weapons on the roof  of his establishment.  </P></p>

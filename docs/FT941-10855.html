			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Berlusconi wields TV weapon: Coverage of party convention infuriates opponents The launch of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's campaign to head Italy's next government has provoked a long, simmering debate over the politicised use of television. The trigger for the debate was the blanket coverage given by Rete Quattro (Network Four), one of Mr Berlusconi's three national commercial channels, to the convention on Sunday of his newly formed political movement, Forza Italia (Come On Italy]). Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest controls more than 80 per cent of Italian commercial television through a deal agreed by the main political parties in the late 1980s. Ironically, until his political ambitions became fully apparent last December, Mr Berlusconi's networks were considered freer of political interference than the three run by the RAI state corporation. But on Sunday, Rete Quattro cancelled its advertised programmes to broadcast 50 minutes of live coverage of Mr Berlusconi's speech - his first important statement since announcing his entry into politics two weeks ago. This was followed by a special programme on the Forza Italia convention lasting almost 40 minutes. Later in the evening, a barely-edited version of the Berlusconi speech was replayed on Rete Quattro. Mr Berlusconi's other channels gave less coverage, but this was largely because Mr Enrico Mentana, head of news at Network Five, has publicly distanced himself from attempts to fill his news programmes with biased coverage. Supporters of Mr Berlusconi recognise the potential conflict of interest between the terms of his television concession and his political ambitions. However, they say that this is still outside the period of the formal election campaign. That starts on February 25 and thereafter all political propaganda is strictly controlled. Indeed, Mr Berlusconi's opponents believe that one of the reasons behind his running for office is the future of his debt-burdened Fininvest empire. They say Mr Berlusconi fears a victory by the alliance headed by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left in the March 27 general election would lead to an early renegotiation of commercial television franchises to the detriment of Fininvest. Yesterday, the Republicans, Greens and members of Reconstructed Communism all called for tighter government controls on the use of television air time.</p>

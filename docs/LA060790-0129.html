			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NOVEMBER MATCHUPS  </P> <P> Governor: U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, in the shadows while the Democrats fought each  other for their party's nomination, now steps forward as he and former San  Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein head toward the November general election. One  of them will become California's 36th governor. Voters will hear similar  positions from the candidates on issues such as abortion and the death penalty.  Leadership and experience will be key points of contention.  </P> <P> Lt. Governor: A spirited Republican primary ended with state Sen. Marian  Bergeson winning the right to face incumbent Leo T. McCarthy, who is seeking  his third term. Abortion rights -- she is opposed and he favors -- are likely  to be an issue, as is his proposal for a sales tax hike to fight illegal drugs.  </P> <P> Attorney General: With John K. Van de Kamp leaving office, California will  elect a new attorney general in November. San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith  will represent the Democrats, and former Rep. Daniel E. Lungren is the  Republican nominee. The two have starkly different views on issues ranging from  abortion rights to offshore oil drilling.  </P> <P> Treasurer: Republican Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes fought back a challenge within  his own party and now he faces a Democrat, Kathleen Brown. Hayes is expected to  portray himself as the non-politican, while Brown -- daughter of one former  governor and sister of another -- capitalizes on her political connections.  They disagree on state investment policies.  </P> <P> Controller: Matt Fong, whose principle claim to fame is that he is the son of  Secretary of State March Fong Eu, had no opposition in the Republican primary  in his first run for public office. In November, he is the underdog, facing  incumbent Gray Davis, who is seeking his second term.  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner: Democrat John Garamendi and Republican Wes Bannister  came out of crowded fields to capture their party nominations. Garamendi, the  favorite, is expected to argue that an insurance agent like Bannister should  not hold the insurance office; Bannister will argue the reverse, that the  office needs someone with the experience in insurance that he offers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AROUND THE STATE  </P> <P> 37th Congressional District: TV actor-turned-politician Ralph Waite, best known  as "Pa" on "The Waltons," is betting that his Hollywood connections and  homespun image will help him topple veteran Republican incumbent Al McCandless.  But Waite, a Democrat, will have a tough row to hoe in the Riverside County  district, long dominated by GOP voters.  </P> <P> 8th State Senate District: Four years ago, Quentin L. Kopp defied political  convention by winning election as an independent in this San Francisco  district. He is aiming to repeat his feat this November against both Democratic  and Republican foes.  </P> <P> 34th State Senate District: Former Chino Mayor Ruben S. Ayala became the first  Latino elected to the state Senate in modern times in 1974. But Republican  Assemblyman Charles Bader of Pomona is expected to give Ayala his toughest  reelection fight in this east Los Angeles County-west San Bernardino County  district.  </P> <P> 41st Assembly District: Republican Pat Nolan of Glendale, the former Assembly  GOP leader, continues to labor under the cloud of the FBI's probe of Capitol  corruption and could yet be indicted. If he is, Democrat Jeanette Mann, a  Pasadena Community College trustee, could mount a credible campaign to unseat  him.  </P> <P> 72nd Assembly District: Republican Curt Pringle's win in this Orange County  district two years ago was shrouded in controversy because of charges that  "poll watchers" his campaign hired intimidated Latinos from voting. His  Democratic foe this year, Tom Umberg, hopes that furor, plus strong financial  backing from abortion rights activists, will propel him to victory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ISSUES  </P> <P> Environment -- Four initiatives affecting the environment are headed for the  November ballot. The most wide-ranging measure is "Big Green," sponsored by  environmentalists and Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp to eliminate cancer-causing  pesticides in food, protect the ozone layer, preserve redwood forests and  protect the coast from oil spills. A second measure sponsored by  environmentalists would go even further to protect the state's ancient redwood  forests from timber harvesting. A rival initiative backed by the agriculture  and chemical industries would take more moderate steps to reduce pesticide use.  And another rival measure sponsored by the timber industry would allow logging  to continue with few restrictions.  </P> <P> Alcohol -- Law enforcement, consumer and anti-alcohol abuse groups are  sponsoring an initiative that would raise the tax on alcoholic beverages by a  nickel a drink. The measure would raise an estimated $730 million for a variety  of health care, alcohol abuse and law enforcement programs. The alcohol  industry, in an effort to undercut the proposed tax increase, is pushing the  Legislature to put a rival proposition on the November ballot calling for a  smaller tax increase.  </P> <P> Ethics -- Voters will again consider the ethics issue with an initiative  sponsored by Van de Kamp to adopt public financing of campaigns and put a  12-year limit on the time legislators can stay in office. It also contains  restrictions on legislators' outside income similar to the provisions of  Proposition 112, the ethics measure approved by the voters Tuesday.  </P> <P> Crime -- Voters also will see a third measure sponsored by Van de Kamp. This  one would create a superfund to pay for law enforcement, drug education and  treatment and new prisons for drug offenders. The measure would be financed  partly by eliminating tax breaks for corporations. In a move designed to  protect women's right to abortion, the measure also would reinstitute  right-to-privacy language eliminated by Wilson's successful Proposition 115 on  Tuesday's ballot.  </P></p>

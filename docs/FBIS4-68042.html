			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We just received a press communique from the  Albanian Foreign Ministry, which states: Today, 3 May 1994, the  official meeting between the Albanian Foreign Ministry  delegation led by Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, and the Greek  Foreign Ministry delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister  Karolios Papoulias was held in Zurich, Switzerland, a meeting  decided upon long ago to analyze Albanian-Greek relations  following the terrorist action against a recruit training center  in Peshkepi on 10 April 1994. [see item AU1304203694 in 22 April  Terrorism Report] [passage omitted]    The Albanian delegation pointed out that unfortunately, we  determine that we have recently been confronted with a series of  incidents and provocations, but there is no precedence for the  10 April act of terrorism. The furious reactivation and  conspicuous and uninhibited aggressiveness of the Vorio-Epirus  chauvinist circles, the irresponsible anti-Albanian statements  issued by several high-level Greek state personalities, the  exploitation of certain elements of the Greek minority in  Albania to achieve expansionist ambitions, the provocative  interference -- contrary to every diplomatic ethic -- of Greek  diplomats in the internal affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous  Orthodox Church and the Albanian state, the absence of a serious  commitment by the Greek Government to throw light on the tragic  event in Peshkepi and make criminals legally responsible  underscore these incidents.    The Albanian side asked the Greek Government to immediately  take measures to prevent the frenzied warmongering propaganda of  radio stations installed in southern Greece, Corfu, and Konjice,  and publications by the Institute of Vorio-Epirus Studies in  Ioanniana, which calls for making territorial claims so far as  to include armed intervention against Albania, as well as the  measures necessary so that the terroristic acts are not repeated  in the future. Its public stance should be clearly dissociated  from the absurd chauvinistic claims directed toward the south of  Albania.    For his part, after assessing Albanian-Greek relations to be  very important, the Greek foreign minister reiterated his  willingness to cooperate for a rapid normalization of bilateral  relations and assented that the Greek Government will fulfill  the aforementioned demand.    Concerning the investigation of the event, the Albanian side  insisted that the Greek side agree to an investigation from an  international unbiased commission, assessing that both sides  should be interested in an objective and impartial assessment of  evidence.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report in the "Budget" column: "The Duma </F> Intends To Increase Military Spending. Mikhail Zadornov  Believes This Is `Profanation of the Budget Process'"]    [Text] Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Budget,  Banks, and Finances Committee, will recommend to the lower  chamber at its session today not to consider amendments to the  budget involving a change of its basic indicators: revenues,  expenditures, and deficit. According to Zadornov, the Duma is  bound to such a decision by the budget procedure it has itself  approved. Under it, Mikhail Zadornov's committee has singled  out all amendments that affect the basic indicators so that "the  Duma rejects them automatically." Zadornov allows, however,  that "some factions" today are going to return to the discussion  of the main indicators "with a view to increase military  spending to 55 trillion for populist considerations." A return  to the adopted figures of the main budget indicators, according  to Zadornov, "will turn the budget process into profanation."    According to Zadornov, the committee, "in spite of  multiplying rumors about the idea of raising military spending  being supported by the president," so far has only an amendment  on this score by Sergey Glazyev. Zadornov said that "neither  the president nor the government has submitted any amendments on  increasing military spending to the Duma." Zadornov made the  following supposition: "Possibly the president himself or  through his representative will submit his proposals on defense  needs to us at the plenary session itself."    A similar recommendation by the Federation Council was not  executed as an amendment and was not even adopted in principle,  which does not allow to consider it formally. Even so, Nikolay  Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Budget Committee,  speaking at yesterday's session of the Duma New Regional Policy  faction, stated that "the senate will never approve a budget  that places the economy of Russia's 33 regions, which is made up  by military industrial complex enterprises, on its knees."    The committee also rejected Glazyev's proposal to increase  budget revenues with receipts from privatization because "nobody  knows what the system of selling property will be after 1 July."  Zadornov considers it possible to create a targeted  extra-budgetary fund for defense needs if money from  privatization is generated in the volumes promised by Glazyev.  The committee does not advise the Duma to include these  revenues in the budget, however, unless it wants the  government's indebtedness to the Defense Ministry, "which will  be inevitable even with the military spending level as  envisioned under the original draft budget," to become really  catastrophic.    According to information in SEGODNYA's possession, in spite  of the budget committee's opinion, the communists, the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, New Regional Policy, the agrarians,  and the Democratic Party of Russia are ready to vote for a  return to the basic budget figures. The Communist Party of the  Russian Federation, the Agrarian Party of Russia, and the  Democratic Party of Russia yesterday summoned a special joint  conference on this issue. If the agro-communist coalition fails  to get the Duma to return to the consideration of the main  indicators, they can vote against the budget. The Yabloko  faction, with which Zadornov is affiliated, will vote against  both increasing military spending and against the budget as a  whole. Russia's Choice and Women of Russia will in all  likelihood support the committee. The majority of deputies from  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia together with their  leader will go on a trip around the country and will not take  part in the budget process.</p>

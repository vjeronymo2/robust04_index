			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / French TV given highbrow touch VIEWERS switching on to France's fifth television channel at 7pm this evening will see Les Tambours d'Hiver (The Drummers of Winter), a documentary made two years ago on the musical rituals of the Inupiaq indians, an obscure tribe in Alaska. Les Tambours d'Hiver is not simply another documentary intended to add a sober touch to the soap operas and games shows that dominate French TV; it is also the first programme on Arte in its role as France's newest national television station. Arte is an arts channel run by a Franco-German joint venture, which provides one service in French and another in German but saves money by pooling programme purchasing. It will, or so the French government hopes, become a role model for a new breed of European cultural channels. For the past few months Arte's French service has been broadcast on the fledgling cable television network. Today it moves to a new, permanent slot on the fifth national channel, taking the place of La Cinq, the mainstream TV station which went bankrupt earlier this year. La Cinq enjoyed a brief burst of intellectual credibility for its current affairs coverage during the Gulf war, but was best known in France for its soft - and sometimes not so soft - pornographic programming. Arte, by contrast, is unashamedly highbrow. This evening's schedule is typical. Les Tambours d'Hiver is followed by a documentary on Egyptology and Wings of Desire, an art movie by the German director Wim Wenders. A vintage episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus, the 1970s cult British comedy, is thrown in for light relief. Arte is coming on air at a difficult time. There is already fierce competition for viewers among France's existing national channels and from the dozens of stations on the struggling cable system. The competition proved too much for La Cinq. Meanwhile, Antenne 2 and FR3, the two state-controlled channels, are merging part of their operations in an attempt to resolve financial problems. So far Arte's management seems unabashed. Mr Pierre Andre Boutang, head of the French service, claims his channel has one big advantage over its competitors in that 'at last viewers will have the chance to see something intelligent at prime time'.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Russia protests over submarine The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet said yesterday a US submarine had been discovered in territorial waters off the Arctic Kola peninsula and had left only after being given several warnings. Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev said the craft had been detected on Wednesday 8km off the entrance to the narrow Kola Bay, which lies 30km from the huge top-secret naval base at Severomorsk, home to the Northern Fleet. The foreign ministry said the boat was located in almost exactly the same spot where the US nuclear submarine Baton Rouge crashed into a Russian nuclear submarine in February 1992. However, the Northern Fleet later said the vessel's identity had yet to be confirmed. Admiral Yerofeyev said that, given that Moscow had cut its naval operations, 'provocations by western submarines can only spark Russian worry and condemnation'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Members of technical review teams would be selected by the multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team on the basis of their knowledge of resource management or their familiarity with the issues involved in the assigned task. At least one member of each technical review team would be required to be selected from the membership of the parent multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> PART 4100_GRAZING ADMINISTRATION_EXCLUSIVE OF ALASKA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 4100_Grazing Administration_Exclusive of Alaska; General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4100.0&hyph;2&blank;Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would amend the objectives statement for part 4100 by including as objectives the preservation of public land and resources from destruction and unnecessary injury, the enhancement of productivity for multiple use purposes, the maintenance of open spaces and integral ecosystems, and the maintenance of the stability of communities depending on the western livestock industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4100.0&hyph;5&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would remove two definitions, add five new definitions, and revise 10 definitions in section 4100.0&hyph;5. Generally these amendments would reduce redundancy and make the definitions more concise, germane, and understandable. Several changes were made to the definitions presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, most notably, the removal of the definition for ``Affected interest'' and replacement with the term ``Interested public.'' This new term is used to recognize necessary public involvement in decisionmaking and to make 43 CFR part 4100 more consistent with other BLM rules and those of the Forest Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would redefine  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Active use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to include conservation use and exclude nonuse or suspended use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would add a definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Activity plan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to mean a plan for managing a use, or resource value or use, and would clarify that an AMP is one form of an activity plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Actual use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be revised to clarify that the term may refer to all or just a portion (e.g., a pasture) of a grazing allotment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Affiliate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  addresses the controlling interests of a permittee's business relationships. The term is used in determining whether applicants have satisfactory records of performance for receiving or renewing a permit or lease or in receiving additional forage that becomes available for allocation to livestock grazing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allotment management plan (AMP) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be modified to describe more clearly the focus and purpose of the plan, and to make clear that an AMP is a form of activity plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conservation use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be added to mean an activity for the purpose of protecting the land and its resources from destruction or unnecessary injury.

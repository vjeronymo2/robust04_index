			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Taipei] </F>   [Text] Taipei is readjusting its policies towards Hong  Kong in a bid to maintain its influence after the territory  reverts to mainland rule in 1997, a Taiwan official in charge of  Hong Kong affairs said yesterday. Cheng An-kuo, director of  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department under Taiwan's Mainland  Affairs Council (MAC), said the review was necessary due to the  rapid development of cross-strait relations in recent years and  it was part of the ruling Kuomintang's "one China" strategy.    A pressing issue is the renewal of the aviation treaty  between Taiwan and Hong Kong in the post-1997 era because the  existing agreement expires next year. According to Mr. Cheng,  negotiations were already underway between Hong Kong's Cathay  Pacific and Taiwan's national carrier, China Airlines. While  Cathay Pacific wanted to perpetuate its present monopoly of the  Hong Kong-Taipei air route China Airlines preferred to open the  business to competition, Mr. Cheng said.    The official believed the problem could be solved through  further negotiations between the two companies and there was no  need to raise the topics in political discussions between Taiwan  and the mainland.    Mr. Cheng said as 1997 neared, Taiwan would seek qualitative  change in the bilateral relations instead of expanding its  bureaucracy in Hong Kong. For example, Taipei used to measure  the effectiveness of its Hong Kong policies by tallying the  numbers of Hong Kong compatriots attending the island's National  Day celebrations. "Our mutual understanding has become the new  yardstick," he said.    "We would like to improve Taiwan's image in Hong Kong  through  our new policies. To do that, we will evaluate our performance  by monitoring the Hong Kong media," he said. At the same time,  Mr. Cheng's office will strengthen its links with Hong Kong  media.    Mr. Cheng confirmed that Taipei had decided that Taiwan  government offices in Hong Kong would come under the authority  of the MAC after 1997. The subject was likely to be raised in  future discussions between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation  and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.    However, pressure from Beijing and political changes in  Taiwan were likely to prevent Taipei from maintaining an  effective and influential presence in Hong Kong after 1997.    Mr. Cheng said the Government had no choice but to keep a  low  profile in it activities in Hong Kong due to strong pressure  from Beijing. "In order to be able to continue to function in  Hong Kong after 1997, we have to adopt the strategy of `work  hard, talk less' because we don't want to upset the Chinese  Communists," Mr. Cheng said.</p>

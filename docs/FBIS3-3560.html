The provincial government reported that 1,000-plus local  enterprises that used to operate at a loss have gained new  vitality, and consequently 2.3-billion-yuan-worth of idle assets  have been put to use again.    In 1993 alone 408 enterprises in Sichuan eliminated losses  and began to create profits after their property rights were  transfered.    To further expand the reform of property rights, governments  at all levels have somewhat relaxed the relevant restrictions to  permit the sale of a certain amount of state-owned assets.    Known as the "Sichuan model", the province's experience in  transfer of property rights distinctly features careful planning  and good organization.    Property rights exchange centers have been established to  stimulate and supervise the annexing, sale, leasing and auction  of the property of state-owned and collective enterprises.    Frequent property rights fairs are held and the latest  information is released in time to boost the healthy and active  activities of local property rights markets.    In June last year the Sichuan Provincial Government listed  16  small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to be sold to  foreign buyers during trade talks held in Hong Kong.</p>

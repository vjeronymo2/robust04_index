			<p>BFN     [Text] A number of Egyptian and Israeli businessmen have  agreed to set up a joint venture to build an oil refinery in  Alexandria at a cost of $1 billion. The refinery will be run by  a joint company made up of representatives from the Israeli  specialized group "Merhav" [name as published] and an Egyptian  company called the "Salim Group." The Egyptian Government has  promised to buy at least 20 percent of the oil produced by the  refinery, which will begin operating in early 1997. A plot of  land has already been bought for the refinery and an agreement  has been reached with the quarters that will supply the refinery  with oil. Ambassadors of the two countries have taken part in  preparing for the meetings between the businessmen.</p>

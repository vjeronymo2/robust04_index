			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Merger of Matra and Hachette gets go-ahead MR JEAN-LUC Lagardere, the flamboyant French businessman, yesterday secured shareholders' approval for the merger between Matra, the electronics concern, and the Hachette media group. He promised a 'very significant improvement' in their 1993 combined profits. Last spring's announcement of plans to merge Matra and Hachette, both chaired by Mr Lagardere and controlled by his family interests, was criticised by the French financial community because of the apparent incompatibility of the companies and Hachette's financial problems. However, Mr Lagardere has maintained that there will be significant financial benefits in combining the two groups. His proposals were accepted overwhelmingly at yesterday's meetings of Matra and Hachette shareholders. One effect will be to dilute the 8.43 per cent stake in Hachette held by Montana Management, a Swiss-based Panamanian company allegedly linked to Iraqi interests, to 1.8 per cent. Matra-Hachette, the new company, will form one of France's larger private sector concerns with nine operating subsidiaries. Mr Lagardere confirmed that the group should meet its 1992 profit forecast of FFr350m (Pounds 43m) to FFr400m on sales of FFr53bn. He said Matra's shareholders should receive the same net dividend for 1992 as the FFr5.50 paid in 1991. However, he promised substantial profits growth for Matra-Hachette in 1993. One of the chief catalysts will be the rise in Matra's defence orders from FFr11bn in 1991 to FFr20bn in 1992.</p>

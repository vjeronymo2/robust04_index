			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Sviatoslav Richter - Recital Sviatoslav Richter returned to the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday afternoon. A Richter piano recital is always a special experience, with the rarity of its provenance tinged and heightened by the threat of peril (will he turn up at all? will he cancel at the very last moment?). On this occasion it was a breathtaking experience: the greatest living pianist encountered at the peak of his powers, delivering Beethoven and Schubert with awesome concentration of fire and ice, imaginative daring and breadth of vision. Jets of critical superlatives can afford wearisome reading. This time, however, this particular reviewer was left no alternative to spraying out whole streams of them: artistic completeness of the kind demonstrated by Richter's second-half accounts of the Beethoven 'Pathetic' Sonata and the Schubert 'Wanderer' Fantasia has the power to make one feel one has never really heard either the works or the instrument itself before. Two summers ago, when he came to Britain for concerts in London and Aldeburgh, the weight of Richter's septuagenarian years and Slav melancholy seemed to press a little harder on the playing than one had imagined they ever could. On Sunday, the cares of age were cast aside. After a first half of Bach - austere yet full of questing turns of phrase and touch, that was like a testing of the waters - he plunged into the second with an urgency all the more exhilarating for being directed entirely inward, to the music's very centre. The Beethoven was all urgency, every rhythmic pattern alert with immediate forcefulness and long-term significance, the slow movement a taut span of bated energy. The timbre and weight of the Yamaha grand, in some respects not unlike that of a 'period' piano (but without the limitations of volume and inequalities of registration), was made to seem the sound and substance of Beethovenian argument. There was no gap, no shortfall between idea and execution; nor - a handful of forgivable, indeed hardly noticeable finger slips apart - was there in the Schubert, one of the mightiest adventures of Romantic keyboard invention here unfolded in all its majesty. After two Grieg encores, each one a time-stopping marvel of fine-grained pianism, the concert was over, and one was left wrung out, uplifted, cherishing its memory.</p>

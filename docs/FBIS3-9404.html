			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jik": "Radio Free Europe Can Come to Prague, </F> but Only Without Soros"]    [Text] Should the U.S. Administration, which finances Radio  Free Europe [RFE], agree to U.S. businessman George Soros's  investing millions of dollars in the station, negotiations with  the Czech Government about the RFE's relocation to the building  of the former Federal Assembly in Prague would be seriously  jeopardized. This was declared by Minister [of Control] Igor  Nemec yesterday.    THE NEW YORK TIMES wrote on Sunday [20 March] that the RFE  was expected to reach an agreement with Soros within one month  about the privatization of its research center and archives and  their relocation from Munich to Prague.    The government is determined to finance the operation of the  currently unoccupied building of the Federal Assembly until the  end of this month. Should RFE move into the building, it ought  to finance the operation of the building as of April. The  building is to be leased to it for only a symbolic sum. Should  Soros become involved in the radio as an investor, however, the  Czech Government would have no reason, according to Nemec, not  to lease the Federal Assembly building to someone else at a  market price. "There are hundreds of interested parties," Nemec  said.</p>

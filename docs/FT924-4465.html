			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Foreign Affairs: The force of history - The Palestinians face a familiar dilemma in peace talks with Israel which resume on Monday When one says that 'ethnic cleansing' must not be allowed to succeed in Bosnia-Hercegovina because of the precedent that would set for other parts of Europe, the argument may sound far-fetched. Will Slovaks or Romanians or Azerbaijanis really pause, in the heat of their own bitter ethnic conflicts, to ask whether the Serbs got away with it? I believe the answer is yes. 'Ethnic cleansing' is apparently a new phrase, coined either by Serbs or about them to describe their policy of expelling non-Serbs from areas they are determined to control. But it is not a new phenomenon. And it does not consist of purely spontaneous outbursts of fear and hatred. It is a systematic procedure, requiring a deal of organisation, which needs to be planned by strategic thinkers. We may find their thought perverted but it is not unsophisticated; and it certainly involves a calculation about the relative strengths of various forces, the attitudes of great powers, and the likelihood of their intervention. That view is supported by a recently published book, Expulsion of the Palestinians: the Concept of Transfer in Zionist Political Thought, 1882-1948 (Institute for Palestine Studies, Dollars 11.95). The author, Nur Masalha, is an Israeli Arab and a graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He shows, using documents from the Israeli archives, that the flight of the Arab population from what became Israel in 1948 - which Israel's first president Chaim Weizmann hailed as 'a miraculous clearing of the land' - was in fact 'less of a miracle than the culmination of over a half century of effort, plans, and (in the end) brute force'. What is particularly interesting is that in discussions among themselves Zionist leaders repeatedly cited the precedent of the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey which followed Ataturk's defeat of the Greek invasion of Anatolia in 1922. Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the founder of 'revisionist' or more extreme Zionism and mentor of Menachem Begin, alluded to this 'transfer' in several articles during the 1920s and 1930s. He described it as a brutal, coercive action, imposed by the victorious Turks yet ultimately beneficial to the Greeks as well (since it made both states ethnically homogeneous). David Ben-Gurion, the leader of the mainstream Zionists and later Israel's first prime minister, replied in 1936 that the precedent was not applicable to Palestine because 'we (the Jews) are not a state and Britain will not do it for us'. 'The possibility of a large-scale transfer of a population by force was demonstrated,' Ben-Gurion admitted in 1941, 'when the Greeks and the Turks were transferred.' But this had been the result of a crushing Turkish military victory. One could not assume that a victorious Britain would take 'the responsibility of forcibly transferring the Arabs of the land of Israel merely for the benefit of the Jewish people'. Only in 1948, when Israel became a state and was in the process of defeating the Arabs, did Ben-Gurion come to see the Turkish-Greek precedent as fully applicable. It may seem tasteless to drag this up now, when Israelis (among others) are disturbed by signs of resurgent anti-Semitism in Germany, and when Israel, under a new moderate government, is trying to negotiate peace with its Arab enemies, including the Palestinians. But I am not seeking to establish any 'moral equivalence' between Serbia and Israel, or between Ben-Gurion and Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia. Whatever the Jews did in Palestine has to be seen in the context of what was done to the Jews in Europe, though why Palestinian Arabs should pay for crimes committed by Germans and other Europeans is something neither the Palestinians nor I have ever understood. Even the Palestinians now accept that the events of 1948 cannot be undone, and that the land occupied by the Jews in that war has become, irrevocably, the state of Israel. But that history has to be borne in mind when one considers the current peace talks, which are to resume in Washington next Monday. The Israeli Labour party, which returned to power in elections last June, is historically the party of Ben-Gurion. Its present leader and now prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was a military commander in the war of 1948 and played a personal role in the expulsion of Arabs, as he has recounted in the Hebrew edition of his memoirs. He was also minister of defence, responsible for public order in the occupied territories, when the Palestinian uprising (intifada) broke out in December 1988. It was Rabin who gave the notorious order to Israeli soldiers to break the bones of demonstrators as a method of riot control. It was in large part thanks to this tough reputation that he won this year's election, since floating voters could feel confident that he would take no chances with Israel's security. Mr Rabin is tough, but he is also intelligent and pragmatic, not dedicated ideologically to holding all of biblical Israel as was his predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir. He seems sincerely convinced that Israel can now achieve security through peace rather than war. His strategy, however, is not to seek a direct reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. Rather it is to reach an accommodation with Arab states, leaving the Palestinians no option but to accept what they are offered. That is suggested by the fact that he has kept on the hardline negotiator with the Palestinians, Elyakim Rubinstein, appointed by his predecessor, while putting in a new and more flexible negotiator, Itamar Rabinovich, to conduct the talks with Syria (and now to be ambassador in the US as well). Mr Rabin has brushed aside as unacceptable the Palestinian proposals for a 'Palestinian interim self-governing authority' (PISGA), calling them 'a blueprint for a state'. In the past few months the Israeli-Palestinian talks have focused, mainly in 'informal discussion groups', on two documents outlining Israel's ideas for 'interim self-governing arrangements' (ISGA). And the further they have gone into these arrangements, the more restrictive the Palestinian negotiators have found them. The Israeli settlements and the land cordoned off by Israel for security reasons (comprising between them about 30 per cent of the West Bank), as well as the whole of East Jerusalem, would be completely outside the scope of the ISGA. Even in the remainder of the territories Israel would retain some say in almost every sphere of administration, through a complex network of 'liaison committees'. Nabil Shaath, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, has described this arrangement as 'Swiss-cheese Bantustanisation', implying that the areas of limited Palestinian authority would be like the holes in the cheese. Although it would be formally only an interim arrangement, leaving the final settlement still to be negotiated, the Palestinian negotiators inevitably fear that by accepting it they would lose the status of occupied territories in international law, and allow Israel's occupation of the areas excluded from ISGA to become accepted as irreversible, just as the 1948 conquests have been. Such a deal would be hard to sell to an increasingly discenchanted public opinion within the territories. Yet if they refuse, the Palestinians risk being blamed for the failure of the talks and left with nothing at all. It is a painfully familiar dilemma, from which only the active involvement of the US might save them - something they could perhaps have expected from a re-elected Bush administration, but which is unlikely to be so high on Mr Bill Clinton's list of priorities.</p>

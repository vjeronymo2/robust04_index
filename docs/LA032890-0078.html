			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO OPEN OIL FIELDS FOR VENTURES WITH U.S. FIRMS  </P> <P> Soviet energy officials offered Tuesday to create joint ventures with U.S.  companies to exploit vast Soviet reserves of oil and natural gas.  </P> <P> In exchange for their technology and capital, oil companies "could have joint  ventures (with the Soviets) operating by this time next year," said Tom  Russell, chairman of Professional Geophysics Inc., the company that coordinated  a Houston meeting between Soviet officials and U.S. oil companies.  </P> <P> "The time is right," Russell said. "The Soviets are anxious to proceed, and so  are we. It took (PGI) less than six months to negotiate and form our first  joint venture with the Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry and just over six  months for a joint venture with another ministry."  </P> <P> Representatives of 75 to 100 companies met Tuesday with five officials of the  Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry. A similar meeting has been scheduled  in London next Tuesday.  </P> <P> "This is the first meeting in which joint ventures in the Soviet Union are  offered, but it is by no means the last one," said Aklim Moukhametzianov, a  deputy minister and member of the Soviet parliament.  </P> <P> "Soviet oil companies are not experienced (in joint ventures) and the ruble is  not convertible yet; however, all problems can be worked out given the desire  from both sides," he said through an interpreter.  </P> <P> The five territories available for joint ventures include four in the Western  Siberian Basin with an estimated 13 billion barrels of oil reserves. The fifth  is in the Bashkir region of the Volga-Urals, an area believed to have  undiscovered oil and gas far below the surface.  </P></p>

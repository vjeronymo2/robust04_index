			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: Me &amp; Mamie O'Rourke - Theatre There were already two first-class American plays showing in London: David Mamet's Oleanna at the Duke of York's and Tony Kushner's duo, Millennium Approaches and Perestroika at the Royal National Theatre. Out of the blue comes another: Me &amp; Mamie O'Rourke at the Strand is the most intriguing and straight-forwardly enjoyable of the lot. Mary Agnes Donoghue's piece has Hollywood written all over it, which is not surprising since all her previous work has been for the cinema - Paradise and Beaches, for examples. On stage, it is not the glamour, multi-scene changing and technological brilliance of Hollywood that stand out, but rather the sheer hard work that goes into short, terse dialogue that can be witty and touching at the same time. Me &amp; Mamie has only one set, designed by Ultz, and the classical unities are observed throughout. Ms Donoghue has achieved something else. She has written a provocative play that will not offend anyone, except perhaps militant feminists. Never underestimate that talent if you want an audience. Ms Donoghue raises questions, mainly about the role of women, without telling you what to think. She never rants, she keeps her sense of humour in adverse circumstances, and there is not the slightest descent into American sentimentality. Two women dominate the stage, so much so that it is hard to think of another play where a pair of females are in command for so long. Louise (Jennifer Saunders) is the fairly fed-up wife of an unemployed architect who wants to knock down their house in Los Angeles in protest, he says, against middle class respectability. Gradually he does so, though without any greater theatrical ostentation than the dropping of the odd brick and mortar. Louise draws the line at the hacking out of her favourite, imitation Adams, fireplace. Back in the basement, where all the dialogue takes place, Louise talks to her friend Bibi (Dawn French). Should they, they wonder, have a shot at lesbianism? 'We'll have to get a bit drunker first.' They try, they fail, but the experience does not end in tears. Where this scene scores theatrically is that it is not over-explicit. Neither of them takes off many clothes, hardly more than a pair of boots. It scores intellectually because they realise they are getting nowhere, but it was still worth trying. Their simple conclusion is: 'Why can't a man be more like a woman?' The environment is highly intelligent. There are educated Californians who believe that learning should go on long after school. No form of therapy is unknown to them. Bibi is taking a doctorate in animal behaviour; she is also  -as demonstrated by her actions on stage, shaving carrots and making soup while she talks - an accomplished cook. Louise is working quietly in her basement on designer bullet-proof vests and, being set in LA, there is always the possibility of an earthquake underneath. The suitably fast direction of the one-liners is by Robert Allan Ackerman. Strand Theatre. (071) 930 8800</p>

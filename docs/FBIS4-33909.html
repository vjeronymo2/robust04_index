			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lourdes Mijan, province director for </F> aqueducts, sewers, and culverts, by correspondent Heidi Gonzalez  Cabrera at Arroyo Naranjo Municipality; for the "Exclusive"  program -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Gonzalez] We are here at Arroyo Naranjo  Municipality, where we have an appointment with Lourdes Mijan,  province director for aqueducts, sewers, and culverts. She has  kindly accepted our request for a meeting. Lourdes, we have  received many telephone calls since yesterday. I will summarize  them so you can provide the answers. The people ask about  possible programs for the elimination of public faucets; the  outrageous prices charged for water supplied by water tank  trucks in zones where there is no water -- people are really  feeling the effects of this; and the possibility of repairing  the cracks that have appeared at the Vento Canal. That is all  for now.    [Mijan] Well, referring to your first question, I must tell  you we have a program for the elimination of public faucets.  The program began many years ago with the creation of local  aqueduct brigades in each of the people's councils. These local  brigades began to work but their work is currently curtailed by  the lack of resources. We expect to solve certain problems  concerning the availability of materials for the aqueducts  beginning the second semester of 1994 -- through a credit from  France to the Institute of Hydraulic Resources. Some of our  most critical problems involve the lack of galvanized pipes and  copper pipes. I believe we are not in a much more critical  situation thanks to the efforts exerted by the local aqueduct  workers and the presidents of the people's councils, who strive  to help us, as well as the industries, the aid, and all the  other factors. We hope we will be able to have the minimum  amount of materials in a short time to solve the most critical  problems we have concerning public faucets on the streets.    There is also a support program for the faucets installed in  larger pipes. In fact, I can announce the Micons [Construction  Ministry] will help us (?locate) some of the faucets installed  in larger pipes. Specifically, the Micons delegation in Havana  will help us solve the problem concerning faucets on the main  pipe in Ariguanabo and the main pipe from El Gato acqueduct,  which currently faces a critical situation. We are also  preparing a program with the Institute for Hydraulic Resources  and the Havana authorities to get some urgently needed  resources. We expect this will be solved in a few days. Thus,  we will recover the losses -- considerable losses -- currently  experienced by the acqueduct. We believe this will improve the  water supply to the city.    [Gonzalez] What about the water tank trucks?    [Mijan] The service rendered by the acqueduct's water tank  trucks is free and anyone who violates this is liable to be  fined and expelled from his post. The water tank trucks have a  big sign which says free service and that is how it should be  rendered. Many times they are not water tank trucks from the  acqueduct and in other cases the people agree to pay a high  price for the water -- yet they do not want to report the one  who incurs in the violation. We urge the population to report  the license plate, the driver's name, the information they can  get; and we are willing to guarantee the people that we will  strictly deal with whoever uses the people's needs to earn a  profit.    [Gonzalez] We believe you have been very considerate toward  us but I would like an opportunity -- in a future meeting, in  the near future -- to talk with someone from the sewer  department to talk about a very unpleasant topic -- the (?holes)  and drainage ditches we have all over the city. Is that  possible?    [Mijan] Of course. I think Engineer Carlos Menendez, our  assistant director for sewers, would be willing to do that. We  will instruct him to answer the questions you have from the  people, from the program's listeners, on this topic, which is  also an important topic and which affects the people very much.    [Gonzalez] Very well. We believe you and we thank you very  much for the time you have given us. We will talk about the  Vento Canal on another occasion. It deserves a special time.  We have not forgotten it. Well, that is all for today, my  friends. We thank Lourdes Mijan for all the time she has  granted us. She will return to the meeting from which we  brought her out. We will return tomorrow.</p>

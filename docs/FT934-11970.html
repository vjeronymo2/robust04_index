			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (5): The incentive that passes the test - Worker training programmes have brought new investment to states in the south-east US STATES fishing for new investment are baiting their hooks with more than tax breaks and cheap land. Worker training programmes have become the hottest incentive to offer. The reasons are simple. Those states with innovative worker training programmes have been enjoying enviable success in attracting new job-creating investments. South Carolina's worker training scheme was, for example, a key reason for BMW's choice of that state last year for its US assembly plant. Moreover, as a recent survey by the US education department showed, skill levels of the American workforce leave a lot to be desired. More than 26,000 Americans were tested and nearly half were not proficient enough in reading and writing to function effectively in the workplace. Ms Madeleine Kunin, US deputy secretary of education, called the results 'very sobering', particularly as demand for higher level skills had vastly increased in the workplace. With this backdrop, it is not surprising that training programmes of various kinds and quality are offered now by all but four of America's 50 states, according to a study by the Texas Jobs Fund Programme . The programmes offer either to custom train employees for a company at little or no cost or give cash grants to companies to train their local workers. Training, whether a custom programme or a cash grant, is one of the few incentives that have no controversy attached. Generous tax abatements and other such give-aways are sometimes viewed as virtually 'buying' a company's investment. But tax dollars spent on training are considered well-spent. The state gains more and better trained workers, who are an asset even if that company moves away. From a company's point of view, the programmes can reduce start-up costs by millions of dollars, ensuring top quality work and higher productivity. The companies can use the programmes to teach not just generic industrial skills, but the specific ones needed for a particular plant or office. Many programmes also screen workers and have them ready to go when the plant or office building is completed. While many states have such programmes, the US south-east has excelled in this regard. The three states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia offer innovative training programmes that have captured large amounts of US and foreign investment. The Carolinas have virtually written the book on worker training programmes. Back in the 1960s, as the textile industry was either automating or moving abroad in search of cheaper labour, these states realised sooner than most that what they needed to offer was an upgraded, better educated workforce. South Carolina designed an innovative programme to custom train workers, using a network of 16 community colleges created in 1969. Then, they went shopping for foreign investment, making Germany one of their first stops. For instance, Robert Bosch, the automotive components maker, was lured to South Carolina largely because of the state's worker training programme. According to Bosch, the company now operates a German-style apprenticeship programme in collaboration with the state for its two major plants there. The same bait hooked others. South Carolina is now dotted with such corporate logos as Michelin, BASF, Adidas and Hoechst Celanese. In total, some 6 per cent of the state's workforce are employed by non-American firms, not counting those who will eventually work for BMW. In North Carolina, which narrowly missed being the site for the new Mercedes assembly plant, its programme custom trains a workforce using 58 community colleges. It also boasts a top notch research park, drawing on three universities: Duke, North Carolina State and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These lures combined to make the state the first choice in the nation for locating new manufacturing facilities in four of the five years between 1987 and 1992. Since 1963, the programme has trained over 250,000 workers for some 3,000 companies. Among its foreign investors are Burroughs- Wellcome and Daimler Benz. Georgia, similar to its Carolinian neighbours, has also attracted investment with its worker-training scheme. Known as Quick Start, this programme custom trains a workforce using a network of 32 technical institutes and four colleges. Such international manufacturers as Coats &amp; Clark (the Coats Viyella subsidiary), Lever Brothers, Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics and Yamaha Motor have used Quick Start. And service companies including Holiday Inns Worldwide have cited the training programme as a reason for choosing Georgia. The south-east's dedication to upgrading its workforce is widely seen as a model of what the US needs to do to compete internationally. Mr Robert Reich, US secretary of labour, argues that US success in the global economy will depend on the quality, education and skill of the American workforce. And, as competition for investment has grown, the lessons from the south-east appear not to be lost on other states.  -----------------------------------------------------------            RENTAL RATES: SECOND QUARTER OF 1993       Central business district market, rates per sq ft  -----------------------------------------------------------                             Dollars  -----------------------------------------------------------  1 Washington DC              37.10  2 New York: Midtown, NY      34.88  3 New York: Downtown, NY     32.45  4 Chicago, IL                29.90  5 Boston, MA                 26.61  6 Los Angeles, CA            25.19  7 Fairfield City, CT         24.54  8 West Palm Beach, FL        24.43  9 Oakland, CA                24.36 10 Hartford, CT               23.75 11 Miami, FL                  22.89 12 Atlanta, GA                22.62 13 Baltimore, MD              22.59 14 San Francisco, CA          22.54 15 Westchester Cty, NY        22.19 16 Philadelphia, PA           21.88 17 Ft Lauderdale, FL          21.26 18 San Jose, CA               21.24 19 Bellevue, WA               21.18 19 Tampa, FL                  21.18 21 Orlando, FL                20.44 22 Newport Beach, CA          20.16 23 North Orange City,CA       19.32 24 Detroit, MI                19.17 25 New Haven, CT              19.08 26 Portland, OR               19.02 27 Seattle, WA                18.77 28 Dallas, TX                 17.59 29 Houston, TX                16.05 30 Phoenix, AZ                15.13 31 Denver, CO                 13.56  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cushman &amp; Wakefield  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

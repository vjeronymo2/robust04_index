In a statement released today, the Central Committee of the  North side headquarters of Pomminnyon highly estimates and fully  supports a proposal and call of the overseas Koreans'  headquarters of Pomminnyon for setting this as a "year of great  national unity" for national reunification.    Noting that the proposal and call are very just and timely  both in view of the nature of the national reunification  question and the desire of the fellow countrymen for great  national unity and they will help convincingly promote the  reunification in the `90s, the statement says:    "The North side headquarters, in hearty response to the  proposal of the overseas Koreans' headquarters, will vigorously  struggle shoulder to shoulder with Koreans overseas to achieve  great unity of the nation this year.    "Regarding the Kim Yong-sam group as the foe of great  national unity, it will staunchly struggle against it and, in  this way, actively promote great national unity with Koreans in  the South and overseas.    "We hold that anybody must refrain from rejecting  Pomminnyon,  a pan-national umbrella organization for great national unity  and the reunification of the country, and join in the patriotic  movement for reunification."</p>

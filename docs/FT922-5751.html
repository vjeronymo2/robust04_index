			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Russian role in Moldova underlined CHILDREN laid flowers yesterday on four fresh graves of Russian army officers who died in the fighting in Moldova's breakaway region of Trans Dnestr. The graves, in the central square of the region's capital, Tiraspol, seem to back up Moldovan claims that on May 19 parts of Russia's 14th army began to fight openly on the side of Trans Dnestr's Slavic separatists. The war of words escalated over the role of Russian soldiers in the fighting, as a man was reported killed and three injured in a fresh clash between the region's largely Slav national guard and Moldovan militia near the outpost of Bendery. On Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia pledged that the 14th army would be withdrawn from Moldova, whose strong ties with Bucharest have aroused fears among the separatists that Trans Dnestr could one day be swallowed up in a greater Romania. The region declared independence from Moldova in September 1990. Mr Mircea Snegur, the president of Moldova, yesterday described Mr Yeltsin's move as 'a victory for commonsense', but said he feared Russian hardliners might block the withdrawal. The Trans Dnestr Womens' Defence Committee, which has been collecting weapons from unprotesting soldiers at Russian army barracks, said it had been assured by 14th army officials that the soldiers would not withdraw until the conflict was over. Over 100 people have died in the fighting in the past four months. A defiant Mr Igor Smirnov, president of the breakaway republic, said yesterday he expected soldiers and officers from the 14th army to remain in the region and join the Trans Dnestr armed forces. That manpower, combined with Trans Dnestr's strong industrial base which Mr Smirnov said is being geared to military production, would be enough to defend the republic if the 14th army pulled out, he said. Mr Smirnov said entire units of the 14th army might join the separatist side. Guarded by khaki-clad young men toting Kalashnikovs, Mr Smirnov said officers from the right bank of the Dnestr river, where Moldova has taken over most former Soviet forces, had defected to the Trans Dnestr military. Mr Smirnov did not deny Moldovan allegations that the war was costing Trans Dnestr 1m roubles a day but said that funds from Russian enterprises and individuals were offsetting the cost.</p>

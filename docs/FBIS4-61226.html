			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 0800 GMT on 5 May broadcasts a  1-minute report by correspondent Aleksey Deryabin on a new  orbital space station. Deryabin begins his report by noting that  a group of scientists from the central specialized design center  and from the Progress works in Samara have been awarded Russian  state prizes for creating a unique space station which, he says,  is a state secret. "The new satellite is a state secret and we  are unable to show you even a mock-up of it. Let us just say,"  he goes on, "that the wide-angle photographic equipment  installed on board makes it possible to carry out observations  of the Earth's surface with maximal precision. Designers joke  that they will even be able to spot a matchbox," Deryabin says,  adding that 150 discoveries and inventions were registered in  the course of the design work.    Deryabin then interviews V.M. Saygak, deputy chief designer  of the central specialized design center, who says that the  Russian Space Agency has now instructed the center to "conclude  a contract to make use of this complex facility to serve the  needs of the national economy."    Deryabin concludes his report by saying that the facility is  capable of cultivating crystals of especial purity while in  orbit. The crystals could then be regularly delivered to Earth  without any intervention by man. The video shows the design  center and mockups of some equipment.</p>

The unmanned spaceship is to deliver  disposable materials and various cargoes to the russian manned  orbital station "Mir". The "Progress M-22" was put into orbit  with the following parameters:    - period of revolution -- 90.2 minutes;    - orbital inclination -- 51.7 degrees;    - maximum distance from the earth's surface -- 335  kilometers;    - minimum distance from the earth's surface -- 260  kilometers;    According to a spokesman for the press center of the  aerospace military forces, the docking of the launched cargo  spaceship with the orbital manned complex "Mir" is planned for  9:39 a.m. on March 24.    The start of the cargo spaceship originally scheduled for  March 19, was delayed for three days due to heavy snowfalls in  the area of the launching site. The snow drifts were up to six  meters high, a spokesman for the flight control center told  ITAR-TASS on Tuesday adding that the fire which occurred at the  Baykonur cosmodrome on March 7 had nothing to do with the delay  of the launch. The cargo spaceship "Progress M-22" has become  the 1101st space object launched into orbit from the Baykonur  cosmodrome since the beginning of the space era -- October 4,  1957.</p>

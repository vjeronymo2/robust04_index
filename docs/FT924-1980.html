			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (3): Boom with no end in sight - More than one bank branch opens every day SINCE bank network expansion was liberalised, with the easing of the central bank's tight constraints in March 1990, branch blight has hit Italy. Opening thousands of new branches in cities, towns and villages, commercial banks have been aggressively seeking to expand their territories and increase domestic market share. Italy's 1,100 banks had a total of just under 15,600 bank branches at the end of 1989. By the end of last year the figure had risen to nearly 19,100. But an end to the boom in branch openings is still not in sight. This year the milestone of 20,000 branches has been passed, and a further 1,400 new branches were authorised in the first nine months. 'Many small towns are still without bank branches, and most of the new branches we opened last year were in virgin territory,' says Mr Cesare Geronzi, Banca di Roma's general manager. The Rome bank, created by the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma's takeovers of Banco di Santo Spirito and Banco di Roma, has the most aggressive expansion strategy of the main Italian banks. The merger of the three banks, completed in August, has not resulted in branch closures. Quite the contrary. 'The networks of the indiv- idual banks were not suff- iciently differentiated geog- raphically. We have beefed up our presence where we were weak before. At the end of last year we had 850 branches. Now there are 1,060. By the end of 1993 there will be 1,380,' says Mr Geronzi. The bank has used its own internal resources, both financial and human, to ach- ieve network growth. 'Ration- alising back office and head office activities has freed personnel to staff new branches. Most of the openings are leanly-manned sportelli leggeri, (small branches) with high automation and a handful of employees,' explains Mr Geronzi. Banca di Roma's general manager is particularly pleased about the commercial agreement announced this spring with INA, the state- owned insurer. Nearly 180 of the new branches will be located in INA general agencies. 'The arrangement is advantageous for both partners. Our large branch network is ideal for dis- tributing insurance products, while the bank's presence within INA's organisation strengthens its financial activity.' Mr Geronzi sees the expan- sion of the large banks like his own as necessary and inevit- able for the creation of truly national banks able to offer a full range of services to a broad customer base through- out the country. He expresses serious reservations, however, about the expansion of small banks. Many small and medium- sized banks, he believes, have opened in Rome and Milan for image only. 'Opening sporadic branches does not create networks. The competition they offer has no rational basis, and will certainly not help their profit and loss accounts. The newcomers are engaged in a price war to obtain marginal, high-risk business.' The central bank probably has similar thoughts. The analysis it published earlier this year showed that small and medium-sized banks appear to have satisfied their expansionary aims, or that the authorities consider their expansion sufficient. Having won approval for 1,533 new branches in 1990, they received the go-ahead for only 723 last year. Though like Banca di Roma, it is a front-runner in its branch expansion, Turin's Sanpaolo has been one of the least aggressive of Italy's large banks. In the first half of the year Sanpaolo and its Lombardy subsidiaries Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda recorded net openings of only 27 new branches. Even so the group, with just over 800 branches at the end of June, operates one of the biggest networks in Italy. Sanpaolo alone will have almost 500 at the end of the year. The bank has chosen a sharply focused expansion programme, rather than saturation. 'Above all, Sanpaolo has been concerned with consolidating its presence in its home areas of Piedmont, the Valle d'Aosta and Liguria, and in the large conurbations of Turin, Milan, Genoa, Rome and Naples. New branches aim to fill gaps in the market and in the operations of existing branches,' says Mr Gianni Zandano, Sanpaolo's chairman. Mr Zandano explains that branch expansion is a crucial element to achieve the aim of boosting retail activity and strengthening deposit-taking among small and medium-sized customers. Like other banks, in the increasingly competitive Italian banking environment, Sanpaolo's new branches are predominantly sportelli leggeri. Formerly a public law credit institution, Sanpaolo started 1992 in its new form of joint stock corporation and soon made news with the first large-scale partial banking privatisation. Its public offer of 20 per cent of ordinary stock in March was heavily over- subscribed. When its transformation was undertaken at the end of last year, the Sanpaolo had taken its stake in Crediop, the Rome-based medium and long-term institution formerly controlled by the Treasury, to 89 per cent. This represents a major investment. Sanpaolo aims to exploit its own branch network to boost Crediop's business with small and medium-sized companies. Crediop will feature in an important rationalisation exer- cise in the first half of 1993, when its Credipar investment banking arm will be merged with Sanpaolo Finance. 'The two companies are well matched,' says Mr Zandano. He adds that own resources of L500bn and new wide-ranging articles of association will give the operation a sharp competitive edge. Sanpaolo's strategy appears to be paying off. 'In conditions that are certainly not easy, the Sanpaolo closed the first half of the year with excellent results that have been con- firmed by figures at the end of September,' notes Mr Zandano. Contribution margin and gross operating margin were respect- ively 21 and 39 per cent higher than at the same stage last year. Sanpaolo could be among a minority when banks close their books at year-end. Many bankers expect poor figures and an out-turn worse than 1991. Aggregate statistics from the central bank show that the banking system's net profits slipped by 3.8 per cent last year. Though there was a slight improvement in gross operating profit, which rose by 1.1 per cent, given 6.4 per cent inflation, this was a decline in real terms. With economic difficulties becoming evident, provisions for bad loans are likely to increase. Already last year the adjusted ratio of default to lending worsened, from 5.5 to 5.9 per cent. 'Even in Italy the deterioration of assets has now become a concrete reality,' observes Mr Zandano, pointing to the downturn in the econ- omic cycle and the delayed effects of the 1989-90 lending boom as the reasons. However, while circum- stances are making them give even closer attention to the accounts, it is unlikely that Italian bankers will let opportunities slip. With privatisation offering scope for interesting operations, bankers will be keeping their eyes skinned and ears open. After two major takeovers there is speculation that Banca di Roma may still want to grow by acquisition. Mr Geronzi scotches such rumours, emphasising that Banca di Roma will have reached its definitive banking structure by the end of next year and has no large banking operations in mind. And its controlling shareholder, the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, is not a candidate for the 35 per cent stake that the IRI state holding corporation will sell. 'But we would be very happy if a foreign shareholder acquired this stake,' remarks Mr Geronzi. Will Banca di Roma be a detached observer when the Treasury sells INA? Mr Geronzi says that the bank's agreement with the state- owned insurance company is strictly commercial, cont- ractually watertight and not at risk. But it is hard to envisage the bank standing quietly on the sidelines when INA is privatised. Operations like this promise to add colour to Italian banking in coming months, contrasting with the dull tones of banks' accounts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               THE TOP 10 BANKS (FIGURES IN DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Capital    Assets    Pre-tax                                                                 profits  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cariplo                                      5,973   108,076       995 Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino        5,966   178,243     1,258 Banco Nazionale del Lavoro                   5,544   124,954       247 Monte del Paschi di Siena                    4,929   106,544       714 Banco di Santo Spirito                       4,903    54,916       444 Istituto Mobiliare Italiano                  4,074    38,920       250 Banco Commerciale Italiana                   3,854   101,688       546 Banco di Napoli                              3,759    83,962       305 Banco di Roma                                3,473    69,368       198 Credito Italiano                              3,076   81,963       492  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Banker (September 1992)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

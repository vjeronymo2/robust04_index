			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Deed of covenant I HAVE a deed of covenant for my grandchildren (I pay Pounds 20 monthly). For more than two years, the children have been in Oman with their parents. Could you please confirm that no claim can be made for a tax refund because they are (apart from holidays) resident abroad? Since your grandchildren are (presumably) Commonwealth citizens, they are entitled to the same personal allowances while resident overseas as they would be if they were living in the UK. Their parents should write to the Inland Revenue Claims Branch (International), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BB, giving (if possible) the name and reference of the tax district at which the children's previous claims were dealt with, so that their files may be transferred to Claims Branch. You might also like to ask your tax office for the free booklet IR20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). Tax allowances for non-residents are explained in chapter 8 on page 32. (This reply is based on the assumption that the deed was executed before March 15 1988, and received by a tax office before July 1988). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Meciar ahead in Slovak poll The party of former Slovak prime minister Vladimir Meciar (left) is maintaining its lead over political rivals just six weeks before Slovak elections on September 30 and October 1. The private Focus agency poll gave Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia a 28.5 per cent support rating, up from 27.6 per cent in July. The ex-communist Party of the Democratic Left scored 15.6 per cent, up from 14.9 per cent in July. Mr Meciar was ousted in a no-confidence vote last March and is now under investigation for questionable direct sales of state-owned enterprises. The three-party governing coalition took third place in the poll with just 10 per cent backing, up from 8.7 per cent in July.</p>

Office Chief R. Galimbekov, who was appointed to this  position last November, told the representatives of the news  media about the current business and immediate plans of the  structural subdivision of the law enforcement authorities that  is at the forward edge of the fight against crime. In recent  months the UOP has stepped up its activity considerably by way  of the organization of new departments in cities and rayons of  the republic, reinforcement of the physical plant, and closer  interaction with the KGB, criminal investigation, the Office for  Economic Crimes, and other services of the MVD.

The licensee also proposes to revise the reference in Specification 6.8.1.6 to the Westinghouse F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) surveillance methodology in order to reflect Revision 1 of WCAP&hyph;10216&hyph;P, ``Relaxation of Constant Axial Offset Control_F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Surveillance Technical Specification,'' approved by the NRC on November 26, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change involves only the manner in which the penalty factors for F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) would be specified (i. e., a burnup-dependent factor specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) versus a constant factor specified in the TS [Technical Specification]). This is simply used to account for the fact that F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) may increase between surveillance intervals. These penalty factors are not assumed in any of the initiating events for the accident analyses. Therefore, the proposed change will have no effect on the probability of any accidents previously evaluated. The penalty factors specified in the COLR will be calculated using NRC-approved methodology and will therefore continue to provide an equivalent level of protection as the existing TS requirement. Therefore, the proposed change will not affect the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a physical alteration to the plant (no new or different kind of equipment will be installed) or alter the manner in which the plant would be operated. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change will continue to ensure that potential increases in F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> Q <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Z) over a surveillance interval will be properly accounted for. The penalty factors will be calculated using NRC-approved methodology. Therefore the proposed change will not involve a reduction in margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Burke County Public Library, 412 Fourth Street, Waynesboro, Georgia 30830. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Arthur H.

The amendment also proposes a new definition, Shutdown Margin, Section 1.45. The proposed changes address the requirements for SDM demonstration and provide clarification for actions if SDM is not met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendment also proposes administrative changes to Sections 1.7 and 3.2.B.2 (b). The definition, COLD SHUTDOWN CONDITION, was simplified by stating the reactor is in the SHUTDOWN CONDITION which eliminates the need of repeating the requirements for this condition. The note which permitted unlimited reactor startups without the Rod Worth Minimizer during Cycle 11 is no longer applicable. The note and its reference are deleted from the new page 3.2&hyph;2. Starting with page 3.2&hyph;2 in Section 3.2, the pages were renumbered and repaginated to accommodate the changes in text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GPU Nuclear has determined that operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications does not involve a significant hazard. The changes do not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequence of an accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed SDM Limits are more restrictive and provide adequate shutdown margin for various modes of reactor operation. Since the new SDM limits do not modify any initial conditions for the accidents previously evaluated in the SAR [Safety Analysis Report], the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of these accidents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS changes do not modify the function of any structure, system or component. The new Shutdown Margin requirements will still meet the basic criterion that the core in its maximum reactivity condition be subcritical with the control rod of highest worth fully withdrawn and all operable rods fully inserted. Based on these facts, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not reduce the margin of safety, because the new SDM limits where the highest worth control rod is determined analytically (0.38% delta k) or by measurement (0.28% delta k) are more restrictive than the current Oyster Creek limit (0.25% delta k). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

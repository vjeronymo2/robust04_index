			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by German Orlovskiy: "The Debt Predicament"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Federation Committee on Pricing Policy  has established effective 10 March 1994 the maximum index of  tariff increases for freight shipments in intra- and interstate  transportation in the amount of 1.20 of the tariffs in effect  prior to that date.    To what degree does the decision of the Russian pricing  department affect the railroads and clients of the maritime  region? Viktor Yefimovich Lyannykh, deputy chief of the freight  and commercial operations section of the Vladivostok Division of  the Far Eastern Railroad, provides commentary.    "Following the directive of the Committee on Pricing Policy  came the order of the Ministry of Railways with a specific  deciphering of the financial aspects with our business partners.  In particular, it was prescribed that the tariffs for intrastate  transportation would be applied to export-freight shipments  through Russian border and port stations.    "Additional charges will be applied over and above the  tariffs and fees (with the exception of export-freight  shipments, including to the Baltic countries), consisting of a  tax of 20 percent and special 3 percent tax (for financial  support to the most important sectors of the national economy).  The application of a maximum index of 1.20 to existing payment  rates for other operations and services is authorized. But in  order to preclude monopolistic pressure from being applied to  clients, the ministry has established an upper limit of  profitability for operation and services in the amount of 35  percent.    "The measures being undertaken by the ministry are not for  the sake of enjoyment. The ministry itself is operating at a  loss. The Far Eastern Railroad, for example, has entered `minus  6 billion rubles' in the `Profits' column. Losses from  transportation operations include rising costs of fuel and  electric power, spare parts--now in short supply--for diesel  locomotives and freight cars, outlays for worn-out track, cross  ties, and switching-signal sections.    "And prospects for the future are cloudy. The transportation  business is in decline. The enterprises--our clients--are  shutting down production output. Our partners of yesterday are  turning their attention with ever increasing frequency to motor  vehicle transport. Short-run motor vehicle transport has been  more convenient, more advantageous, and quicker. Thus, the  railroads are facing a struggle for clients who want efficient  execution of orders and high-quality service.    "In the meantime, a natural process of reduction of our  worker contingent has begun. We are not taking action to effect  this, but neither are we accepting people for work.    "And then we have that same old situation today concerning  debts receivable. They are colossal! The list of enterprises in  debt to us for transport spans 10 pages--they owe us R12.5  billion.    "We are trying to restrict our acceptance of freight for  transport from those dispatching enterprises that are most  steeped in debt. But this is a two-edged sword: When enterprises  do not ship production output, they do not get paid for it. And  they do not settle accounts with us either. While the state  treasury tells us to hand over the required amount, think about  paying wages later.    "The only aspect, undoubtedly, that does not distress  everyone is the following point of the ministry order: `The  boosted index for tariffs in effect is not applied with respect  to small, lightweight shipments of freight and citizens'  household goods being transported by intra- and interstate  transportation.'"</p>

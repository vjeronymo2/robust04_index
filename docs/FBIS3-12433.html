Another 17 Arabs were wounded:  three were seriously wounded in Nabulus, one was moderately  injured in the village of Tuqu', and 13 were wounded in the Gaza  Strip.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a riot occurred  near  the Cave of the Patriarchs, and an IDF soldier was lightly  wounded by a stone.    Disturbances continue in East Jerusalem, particularly in  Shu'fat and in Al-Tur. Our police affairs correspondent Aviv  Bushinsky reports that the rioters set tires on fire and threw  stones at Border Police units. In East Jerusalem's central bus  station, a burning object was thrown at an empty bus and the  driver's seat was lightly damaged.    Some 1,500 people marched in Haifa for the second day in a  mourning procession over the massacre in Hebron. They marched  from Wadi Nisnas to the municipality building. One of the  speakers was Haifa Mayor 'Amram Mitzna'. Our correspondent Nati  Zilberman reports that a stone was thrown at a police patrol car  during the procession, but nobody was hurt. A 14-year-old boy  who threw the stone was detained for questioning.</p>

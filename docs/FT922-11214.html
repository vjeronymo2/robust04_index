			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / World Bank sets out plan to aid republics THE World Bank yesterday set out an ambitious two-stage plan for helping the former Soviet republics, involving annual loan commitments of up to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.86bn) within two years. The bank, which is holding its spring meetings with the International Monetary Fund in Washington this week, said it was not a supplier of 'short-term money' and would be supporting the republics 'for the long haul'. The first stage, for the 12 months starting this June, would involve Dollars 2.5bn in loans to finance essential imports. The focus would then switch to loans to support radical reform of the oil and agriculture sectors. By the middle of 1994 the bank expected to be lending Dollars 4.5bn-Dollars 5bn a year to the former Soviet Union. About half of its planned lending is earmarked for Russia. Mr Wilfried Thalwitz, vice-president for Europe and central Asia, said the immediate problem was a 'tremendous compression of imports'. Russia's capacity to import had declined by about 40 per cent, delivering a heavy blow to domestic industry. The bank would spend Dollars 2.5bn on a 'general import rehabilitation operation'. A second generation of loans would address structural problems in the oil and agricultural sectors. In the oil industry the priority was to establish a pricing, tax and legal structure that would lead to both a revival of domestic production and foreign investment by western oil companies. In agriculture the pay-off would be less rapid. The priority was to reduce enormous wastage and loss of grain by 'restructuring the entire agricultural chain'. Changes in relative prices were need to encourage production and efficiency. The bank was also looking at road, telecommunications and environmental projects, including cleaning up the Ural Sea. Oil gave Russia the capacity to 'get out of its present predicament relatively quickly'. But the outlook for the poorer republics was bleaker. Russia was running a Dollars 20bn trade surplus with the rest of the former Soviet Union. The other republics would not be able to pay for this scale of imports, putting further pressure on their economies. Mr Thalwitz said the bank was convinced the main republics were 'dead serious' about reform. The bank would provide support for the long haul and the capital it injected would not be short-term money. Tremendous risks, however, lay ahead. A much-needed reallocation of labour in industry was hampered by the lack of a social safety net for the unemployed.</p>

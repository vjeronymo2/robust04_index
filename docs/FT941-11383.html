			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Observer: Locked in silence Here's a rum do. John Gummer, environment secretary, has just appointed as chief planning adviser someone who is debarred from giving advice on one of the biggest issues on Gummer's plate. David Lock has been hired to advise on the development of strategic land use planning in England. But Lock can't talk to Gummer about what is going to happen to the East Thames corridor - a key element in government plans to regenerate London and the south-east - because he also runs a consultancy with extensive contracts in that same corridor. As the environment department has yet to publish its strategic plan for the corridor, Lock must maintain a Trappist silence not just over the corridor but also the Channel tunnel rail link. To make matters worse, Lock's appointment means farewell to the highly respected Peter Hall, special adviser on planning to three environment secretaries since 1991. Hall, Britain's top thinker on planning and urban development, was brought back from the University of California by Michael Heseltine, and has spearheaded the East London corridor concept. He now returns to a full-time chair at University College, London.</p>

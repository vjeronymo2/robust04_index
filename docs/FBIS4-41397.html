			<p>BFN     [Text] Isa Kostoyev, Chairman of the Federation Council  Committee on constitutional legislature and legal issues,  declared to Interfax Friday that there is official statistical  data in the Interior Ministry and Federal Counterintelligence  Service stating that many Russian state enterprises are under  the control of mafia structures.    "There are thousands of criminal trials carried out due to  this fact. For example, the products of industrial enterprises  in many regions is quite competitive with imported goods brought  by commercial structures and criminal elements urge that these  enterprises export their production outside the region. A  director is forced to obey because he does not want to subject  his own life and his family to danger."    "Not to speak about those commercial enterprises which  cannot  make a single move without the knowledge of the mafia," Kostoyev  added. "I know that in the Western world the mafia also exerts  certain pressure, but it does not touch upon state enterprises.  We have already left the West far behind in this sphere, he  pointed out. Given the current situation it is necessary to use  emergency measures to combat organized crime but it should be  done in the frameworks of precise laws so that innocent people  do not suffer," Kostoyev said.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: SFE TECHNOLOGIES LOSSES GROW IN 4TH QUARTER  </P> <P> SFE Technologies, a San Fernando electronics firm, reported its losses widened  to $8.8 million in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Oct. 28 from a  $3-million loss a year earlier. Revenues fell 20% to $7 million from $8.8  million.  </P> <P> The loss in the latest period included a $7-million charge to provide for a  writedown for excess and obsolete inventory. SFE Chairman William Kuehn, who  joined the company in November, said SFE is repositioning itself from mass  markets for electronic components to manufacturing more specialized electronic  components for use by the military and private industry.  </P> <P> For the year that ended Oct. 28, SFE said it lost $9.7 million, compared to a  $4.3-million loss in fiscal 1988. Revenues were $30.4 million, down 16% from  $36.2 million.  </P> <P> Separately, Kuehn said SFE's West-Cap Arizona subsidiary negotiated a plea  agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. West-Cap agreed to plead guilty  to two counts involving violations of quality control testing and reporting  procedures for electronic components West-Cap manufactured for the military.  </P> <P> The maximum penalty West-Cap faces is a $10,000 fine per count, which may be  increased to $50,000, plus restitution, Kuehn said. He expects the West-Cap  matter to be resolved by June.  </P></p>

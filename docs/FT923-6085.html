			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: KNP falls to Fl 158m midway KNP, the Dutch paper and packaging group, reported a 43 per cent plunge in first-half net profit to Fl 91m (Dollars 57.64m) from Fl 158m as Europe-wide over-capacity in paper production, higher raw material costs and slumping prices bit deep into margins. The company forecasts a substantial drop in earnings for the full year. For the six months to June, KNP said sales were unchanged at Fl 2.4bn, the operating result fell from Fl 277m to Fl 173m and cash flow was down by Fl 61m to Fl 235m. Both KNP's paper divisions (coated wood-free and coated wood-containing papers) faced heavy market over-capacity, which exceeded the climb in overall volume demand, which was 10 per cent. In the packaging division, operating results fell, largely due to a slowing of demand in the former East Germany, which last year inflated first-half results. Selling prices overall were also lower. Over-capacity, now slight, is expected to mount and raw material prices to climb in the second half. Overall, 1992 earnings will fall by at least 25 per cent from the Fl 280m achieved last year.</p>

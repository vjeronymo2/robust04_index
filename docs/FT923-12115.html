			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average drops 4 per cent to close below 16,000 SHARE PRICES fell across the board following Friday's drop on Wall Street, and the Nikkei average lost 4 per cent, tumbling below 16,000 for the first time since June 30, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished 663.59 down at 15,884.48 on futures-linked arbitrage unwinding and small-lot selling. The index opened at the day's high of 16,489.86 and fell to the session's low of 15,854.38 in the afternoon. Volume remained thin but increased to 200m shares from Friday's 188m. Declines overwhelmed rises by 951 to 36, with 82 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slid 40.96 to 1,230.14, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index weakened 10.44 to 949.86. Activity in the cash markets was led by a drop in the futures market. Last Friday's fall in the Nikkei 225 futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange discouraged futures traders, and the Osaka Nikkei futures index fell by its daily limit of 600 points to 15,930. Traders hope the Nikkei's six-year low of 15,741.27, recorded on June 29, will act as a technical support level. 'It is hard pinpointing a bottom for the index if it falls below that,' said an analyst at Daiwa Securities. He added that domestic and foreign pension funds, looking to invest for the longer term, were buying in small lots, but short-term funds were reluctant to do so. A total of 120 issues fell to new lows for the year, including leading high-technology shares. High-technology blue chips were sold following last Friday's drop in IBM shares on Wall Street, dragged down by disappointing second quarter results. Fujitsu retreated Y37 to Y583, NEC Y25 to Y786 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y100 to Y1,200. Sanyo Electric shed Y15 to Y402 after announcing an 82.5 per cent plunge in consolidated half-year pre-tax profits to May. Nippon Housing Loan declined Y20 to a year's low of Y235 on reports of alleged tax evasion in connection with stock transfers. In Osaka, the OSE average plummeted 725.14 to 18,368.25, moving below 19,000 for the first time since July 1. Volume rose to 9.2m shares from 7.9m. Roundup TOKYO'S FALL unnerved most of the Pacific Rim, but Manila managed a small gain. HONG KONG lost 100 points in the first 15 minutes and fell further as the session progressed. The Hang Seng index ended 141.57, or 2.3 per cent, down at 5,986.49 in turnover of HKDollars 2.85bn, against HKDollars 2.77bn. Analysts said the lead in the opinion polls of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the US presidency, also sapped sentiment, as some investors fear that a victory for Mr Clinton would harm Sino-US relations. HSBC Holdings receded HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 52.50, Cheung Kong lost 40 cents to HKDollars 25.10 and Sun Hung Kai Properties shed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 32.50. NEW ZEALAND tumbled 2.7 per cent following the sharp falls in European and US markets on Friday. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 42.45 to 1,555.00. Leading stocks were sharply lower, and Fletcher Challenge, down 17 cents at NZDollars 3.25, Lion Nathan, off 15 cents at NZDollars 4.44, and Telecom, 6 cents cheaper at NZDollars 2.25, were particularly hard hit. TAIWAN dropped 2.4 per cent as nervous investors dumped shares in the last hour. The index fell 100.96 to 4,147.59, its lowest close since last October. Turnover was a moderate TDollars 22.88bn, after Saturday's TDollars 16.4bn. Brokers said sentiment was extremely poor, amid fears of pressure from high outstanding margin loans, and news that big players were dumping shares. All sectors fell, with 35 issues closing the day's limit down. AUSTRALIA declined sharply following weaker overseas markets. The All Ordinaries index finished at the day's worst of 1,604.9, down 24.6, or 1.5 per cent. Turnover expanded to ADollars 205m (ADollars 192m). Banks sagged under renewed doubts about the economic recovery. Westpac slipped 8 cents to a seven-year low of ADollars 3.17, NAB 11 cents to ADollars 7.79 and Commonwealth 9 cents to ADollars 7.09. MANILA edged ahead as selling pressure eased and investors bought in anticipation of good third quarter results. The composite index put on 3.52 to 1,453.00 in combined turnover of 158.2m pesos, after 215.7m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR eased as most investors stayed on the sidelines. The composite index dipped 2.57 to 602.76 and falls outpaced rises by 139 to 105. Far East Asset advanced MDollars 1.22 to MDollars 4.06 on rumours that the Hong Leong group will take over management of the company. Telekom Malaysia lost 10 cents to MDollars 13.90. SINGAPORE closed at its lowest level since April, with the Straits Times Industrial index 5.39 down at 1,445.75 in volume of 31m shares.</p>

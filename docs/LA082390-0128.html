			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: SEEING THAT INNING WAS DISBELIEVING IT  </P> <P> Chavez, something horrible happened in your ravine.  </P> <P> Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed what happened  Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium -- and I thought that I had seen just about  everything.  </P> <P> The Dodgers lost a baseball game, 12-11, because in the ninth inning the other  side got nine runs.  </P> <P> Tommy Lasorda, as subdued as ever I have seen him, sat zombie-eyed at his desk  and incanted: "I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it.  Eleven to one. Eleven to one. I don't believe it. Eleven to three going into  the ninth inning. I don't believe it."  </P> <P> Down the hall, in the Philadelphia Phillies' clubhouse, ninth-inning hero John  Kruk, whose three-run pinch-homer tied the score, was as giddy as Lasorda was  grieved. Lasorda looked thin and sad. Kruk looked hippy and happy.  </P> <P> "All I wanted to do was get back to the hotel by midnight, because that's when  room service closes," Kruk said.  </P> <P> Winning pitcher Roger McDowell was a silly Phillie, too.  </P> <P> "Gee, I wish we'd gotten a couple more runs for a cushion," McDowell said.  </P> <P> Meantime, every joke ever made about leaving Dodger games prematurely became  seriously unfunny. This was a blow from which the 1990 Dodgers might never  recover. This one made them bluer than blue.  </P> <P> Losing pitcher Tim Crews sat alone in front of his locker, gazing vacantly into  it, long after the game, after every single teammate had left the premises. He  looked like a man looking for a future.  </P> <P> Starting pitcher Mike Hartley had long since showered, dressed and  half-listened to the last few innings on the clubhouse radio, where he found  the whole thing "kind of unbelievable."  </P> <P> Hartley had had the world's most comfortable lead. You'd have figured the  Dodgers would protect that lead if Lasorda spent the last couple of innings  playing only seven men.  </P> <P> "I thought I had it sewn up," Hartley said. "I'm sure it's not the first time  it's happened, and it's not going to be the last time. But man, it's still kind  of unbelievable."  </P> <P> As midnight drew near, Dodger radio voice Ross Porter called the entire  experience "a killer." Then he had a few more minutes to kill, so he took calls  from listeners.  </P> <P> Some guy from Tustin asked: "What's Lasorda's hometown?"  </P> <P> Presumably too tired or too dazed to wonder why anybody would care about such a  thing, Porter replied obligingly: "Norristown, Pa."  </P> <P> "And how close is that to Philadelphia?"  </P> <P> "Very close."  </P> <P> And the caller said: "Can you add two and two?"  </P> <P> That's the kind of night it was: Kind of unbelievable.  </P> <P> For 100 years, the Dodgers have been playing baseball, and everybody from  Ebbets Field to Elysian Park has been observing the anniversary by  re-dramatizing the great moments: Robinson's ripping down of the white curtain.  Gibson's homer. Drysdale's shutouts. Hershiser's shutouts.  </P> <P> But also, the awful moments: Campanella's accident. Roseboro's being hit by the  bat. Getting swept in the '66 World Series. Pitching to Jack Clark. The  Campanis thing.  </P> <P> This one was just a plain old August game against the plain old Phillies. More  than 39,000 customers turned up, hundreds of them toddler tumblers who  performed before the game. A lot of the kids had to be home early. A lot of the  adults left because they'd seen enough.  </P> <P> Maybe 30,000 of them had split by the ninth when the Phillies hit.  </P> <P> The Dodgers were practically fooling around. Almost anybody would have been,  under similar circumstances. They put an all-new lineup on the field. They let  Fernando Valenzuela pinch-hit. They gave a kid named Dave Walsh the ball and  told him to get three more outs.  </P> <P> His cushion was eight runs.  </P> <P> "We just couldn't get anybody out," Lasorda said later, still staring blankly.  </P> <P> "In shock. I'm in shock."  </P> <P> Walsh, who needed only to throw strikes, couldn't throw one. By the time Crews  took over, when the Dodger pitcher needed to be careful, Crews grooved one.  Saddest of all, the guiltiest party was Jose Offerman, the Shortstop of  Tomorrow, who made two errors in the ninth. Two days before, he made the most  spectacular debut, homering in his first turn at bat, catching everything that  came his way. Two days later, he couldn't handle the simplest grounders.  </P> <P> Ross Porter took one more call:  </P> <P> "I have a suggestion for the Dodgers," the caller said. "Give this Offerman a  one-way ticket to Albuquerque."  </P> <P> In the best Dodger move of the night, Ross took no more calls.  </P></p>

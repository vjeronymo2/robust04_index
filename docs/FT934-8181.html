			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / ScottishPower in British Coal deal SCOTTISHPOWER is to be supplied with more than 2m tonnes of coal a year for the next five years under an agreement with British Coal signed yesterday, James Buxton writes. This secures the Longannet deep mine in Fife and will cut ScottishPower's fuel costs by Pounds 10m in its first year. The agreement, worth about Pounds 400m, replaces the five-year deal due to expire in March 1995 under which ScottishPower has to take 2m tonnes of coal a year from Longannet. Although it means greater security and higher sales volume for British Coal, it has had to accept a lower price and further reductions over the life of the contract.</p>

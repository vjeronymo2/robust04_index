			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Viacom 'in tough talks' with bid partners Viacom, the US cable television company, is believed to be involved in tough negotiations with partners Nynex and Blockbuster Entertainment over the terms on which they might back an increased Viacom bid for Paramount Communications. Viacom has until January 7 to raise its bid for Paramount, which is worth around Dollars 9.3bn, to match a Dollars 10bn offer on the table from QVC Network, the television shopping channel. Blockbuster and Nynex are believed to be seeking better terms from Viacom for a new injection of cash than those they received when they agreed to back its current bid for Paramount. Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the North-eastern US, provided Dollars 1.2bn of funds and Blockbuster, a video rental business, Dollars 600m. In return they each received a seat on the Viacom board and preferred stock with a 5 per cent dividend, convertible into Viacom non-voting class B shares at Dollars 70 a share. Viacom's class B shares, which have been depressed by the takeover battle, stood at Dollars 43 1/2 , down Dollars 1 3/4 at the close yesterday. Viacom has declined to comment on its bid discussions, but analysts suggested its partners might be seeking improved conversion terms for the preferred stock, as well as a greater say in the running of Viacom-Paramount through additional board seats and some voting stock. Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, owns more than 80 per cent of the group's voting stock and would be unwilling to give up control of the business. Analysts suggested that Blockbuster might provide a readier source of funds than Nynex, whose investment in Viacom has provoked criticism from certain New York state legislators, arguing that telephone customers may end up subsidising its foray into the entertainment industry.</p>

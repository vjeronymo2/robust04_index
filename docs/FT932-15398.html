			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Japan package well wrapped, but is it the goods? - Large and impeccable in its timing, the quality is nonetheless open to debate WHEN the Japanese government unveiled its economic package yesterday to a fanfare of surging stock prices, there were broad smiles of self-satisfaction among political leaders and bureaucrats. They had fashioned a package larger than promised, and delivered it just as two senior US officials landed in Tokyo for a meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. Japan is often criticised for getting the timing of its big announcements wrong, as a sluggish bureaucracy works in its own, isolated time zone. But the timing of yesterday's announcement, politically and economically, could not be faulted, prompting Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to declare that the period of economic decline was over. However, the quality of the package's content is open to debate, and the finance ministry's forecast that the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) in spending and tax concessions will produce an extra 2.6 per cent of nominal gross national product growth is certainly questionable. The Sakura Research Institute estimates that it will add 1.2 per cent, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 1.3 per cent and Baring Securities 0.8 per cent - and 'that's generous'. Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, has repeatedly suggested that the economy is weighed down by sluggish consumer demand and corporate capital investment. And the finance ministry, which agreed on the final total after a hard night's negotiation with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, admits there is little direct stimulation in those areas. There is Y520bn in extra funds to government-affiliated institutions for the promotion of private equipment investment, and a tax concession for home buyers, who will have the maximum amount of deductible loan repayments lifted by 20 per cent. But a cut in income taxes was not included, and a finance ministry official said there is no prospect of a tax cut this year. Most Japanese manufacturers are in the midst of restructuring, in particular, cuts in capacity and a trimming of bloated workforces. They have limited room for an increase in capital spending, which was highlighted by a 15.9 per cent year-on-year fall in private machinery orders in February. Nevertheless consumers appear to have the means but not the confidence to increase spending, as was shown by a 6.1 per cent fall in department store sales during February. On hearing of the package's contents, the Japan Department Stores' Association said the absence of a tax cut was 'very disappointing', and final demand was likely to remain weak for the indefinite future. Other business groups were more enthusiastic. The Association of Corporate Executives said the 'economy has already shown signs of recovery and the package will ensure that recovery'. The Federation of Employers' Associations said the timing, coming immediately after the passing of the 1993 budget, was ideal, and would stimulate demand. The euphoria surrounding the announcement yesterday, combined with the stock market's recovery, have also given LDP officials the impression that the immediate economic future is bright. But a separate set of Bank of Japan loan figures for March released yesterday suggest that, instead of providing a quick fix, the package will be part of a long-haul recovery. Outstanding commercial bank loans expanded by only 1.3 per cent in March, the slowest growth on record, and a sign that banks are either wary of fresh lending or that corporate demand for funds is still in decline. The most likely explanation is a mix of both causes. Private economists expect money supply, which expanded by 0.2 per cent in February, to shrink again in March. 'The economy is bumping along the bottom,' said Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities. 'The package will help, but you are not going to see all the growth this year, and a lot of the money is recycled rather than new. But the increase in funds for the Housing Loan Corporation will make a difference.' The Housing Loan Corporation provides a third of all mortgages in Japan, and the package increased the funds available this year from Y7,283bn to Y9,253bn, and provides for a reduction in interest rates from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent. At the same time, Y1.6bn in land for public projects will be purchased ahead of schedule. It is expected that the lending measures will increase demand for new homes, but the package will provide little assistance to banks, burdened with about Y30,000bn in bad property loans - most of which are linked to speculative developments outside the range of the Housing Loan Corporation. In presenting the package, the finance ministry suggested that almost all the funds were 'fresh water', but the reliance on the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme (FILP), funded by postal savings, for about Y4,900bn of the total means that much of the money is being recycled more quickly rather than genuinely fresh. The combination of FILP funds, which would otherwise be used for government bond purchases or for loans to government financial institutions, and funds to be provided by local governments totals Y6,900bn, leaving the central government to muster the remaining money. Finance ministry officials said construction bonds were likely to be used to fill the gap. But the use of construction bonds, which are supposed to be used only for infrastructure spending, raises awkward questions about spending for 'social infrastructure', listed at Y1,150bn. US officials will be told that US companies could provide this infrastructure, which apparently includes supercomputers and other sophisticated electronics, though construction bonds are not supposed to be used for such equipment.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPAN: MAKING ADJUSTMENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The economic package'S size and effect                                            April 1993      August 1992                                              measures         measures                                                 (Ybn)            (Ybn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Increase in public investment   Public works                                  4,170            4,450   Investment in education &amp; social welfare      1,150              550   Investment by local government                3,500            2,800   Housing loans                                 1,800              800                                                10,620            8,600  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lending by financial institutions   Measures for small and medium-sized firms     1,910            1,200   Promotion of private equipment investment       520              900                                                 2,430            2,100  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                          13,050           10,700  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Multiplier effect in per cent of GNP             2.6%             2.4%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Finance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Editorial Comment, Page 21 World Stock Markets, Page 39</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright rises to 165 1/2p Shares in Carpetright, the carpet retailer headed by Sir Phil Harris, closed at 165 1/2 p yesterday, the first day of dealings after the flotation at 148p, writes Maggie Urry. Turnover in the shares was heavy at 22.7m. The basis of allocation favoured smaller investors, and it is thought that some institutions were buying in the aftermarket. A placing of 25.45m shares with institutions was said to have left many such investors with fewer shares than they had wanted, and there were some large institutional applications in the public offer.</p>

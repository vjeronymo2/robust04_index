			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Varity surprises with Dollars 14m net for quarter SHARES in Varity, the US automotive, farm and industrial equipment maker, reached a 52-week high yesterday after the company posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. In the latest quarter, it took a one-time charge of Dollars 1.7m, or 5 cents a share, which left net income at Dollars 14.4m, or 29 cents. In the same period of 1992, Varity had net income of Dollars 14.1m, or 37 cents. Sales in the three months dropped to Dollars 660.9m from Dollars 891.4m, reflecting the disposal of several businesses. Stripping out one-time charges, taxes and earnings of associated companies, Varity earned Dollars 15.4m in the 1993 quarter against Dollars 17.6m a year earlier. The shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 at mid-session. Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive, said the company had cut its interest expense by 73 per cent in the second quarter, reflecting the restructuring and financing actions. The company's consolidated debt is Dollars 1bn lower than last year. Kelsey-Hayes, the automotive components business, had operating income of Dollars 19m on sales of Dollars 256m. On a pro forma basis, earnings were Dollars 13m on sales of Dollars 228m in the 1992 period. The company attributed the rise to higher margins due to improved operating efficiencies. Massey Ferguson, the farm equipment unit, had operating income of Dollars 4m on sales of Dollars 239m. On a pro forma basis, it earned Dollars 4m on sales of Dollars 283m last year. Although Massey's main European market has been weak this year, it expects the business to remain profitable in 1993. The UK-based Perkin's engines business turned in flat earnings of Dollars 11m.</p>

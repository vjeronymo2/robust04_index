			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / A debut of fire for Turkey's premier: First woman PM names cabinet amid troubles at home and abroad MRS Tansu Ciller's first days as Turkey's new prime minister have been nothing if not fiery. The country's first woman prime minister is barely a week into the job, and the international focus is back on Turkey's Kurdish rebellion, its single biggest problem. At the same time, Turkey's image as a secular democracy has been badly damaged by the spectre of Islamic fundamentalism, after the deaths of 37 people, when radical Moslems last week set fire to a hotel where the Turkish publisher of Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses was staying. And Turkey's best efforts to encourage peace in the Caucasus are in tatters, after the ousting of President Abufaz Elchibey of Azerbaijan. Now Mrs Ciller faces dissent from among her own backbenchers over the composition of her cabinet, announced on June 25. As if that was not enough, amid the continuing debate about the status of Turkish workers in Germany, opposition parties have turned on Mrs Ciller, questioning her patriotism after allegations she applied for US citizenship when she was lecturing there in the 1980s. Mrs Ciller's two children have dual nationality. However, after the shock of the fundamentalist violence, *something in here (HP) * deputies rallied behind her yesterday, securing a vote of confidence in parliament. An impulsive character, Mrs Ciller, aged 47, was faulted during her term as economics minister for not building a consensus behind her policies. An unknown force in party terms - she only joined the True Path Party (DYP) in 1990, entering parliament in 1991 - she has now to prove she can handle the rough and tumble of Turkish politics. She has her hands full. The Kurdish crisis deteriorated with the co-ordinated violent protests in European cities two weeks ago in the wake of the breakdown of a recent rebel ceasefire. More worrying, the Kurdish Workers party, the PKK, has for the first time extended its nine-year campaign of violence to Turkey's tourist resorts with a bomb attack recently at Antalya on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. Like Mr Suleyman Demirel, whom she replaced when he acceded to the presidency after Mr Turgut Ozal's death in April, Mrs Ciller promises a two-pronged policy on the Kurds. It offers them legal and cultural rights while giving carte blanche to the military to prosecute what, with the recent backlash against Kurdish properties in western Turkey, looks like becoming a full-scale civil conflict. Diplomats are concerned about her appointment of the untried Mr Mehmet Gazioglu as interior ministry. They fear he may not have the grasp of the difficult law and order portfolio, not just in tackling the rebellion but in curbing the excesses of the security forces - a big problem given Turkey's bid to improve its human rights image abroad. On the foreign policy front, Mrs Ciller's immediate task is Azerbaijan, where Mr Gaidar Aliyev the former communist boss has wrested power from the luckless Mr Elchibey. The Azeri envoy in Ankara, sought to reassure Turkey this week that commercial deals undertaken by the Elchibey administration would be honoured. However Mr Elchibey was the central player in Turkey's policy in the Caucasus, where support for the moderate forces in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia was viewed as the only way to bring peace to a volatile ethnically-riven region. In choosing her cabinet, Mrs Ciller gave a clear warning that she intends to be her own woman and not defer to Mr Demirel, her political mentor. On paper at least, with 17 new ministers, the 32 member cabinet was a radical transformation, with the departure of most of the Demirel loyalists. The changes represent a Turkish version of musical chairs where Mrs Ciller paid tribute to her supporters in the only way available to her, by dispensing ministerials jobs. Mrs Ciller has chosen to retain the economic portfolio herself. She will have a difficult task meeting her promise of farm reform in a party which depends on rural constituencies where subsidies will be hard to withdraw. She can expect even more resistance to her privatisation programme from her coalition partners the Social Democratic Populists SHP, traditionally the party of organised labour and white collar civil servants. As a political outsider her Mrs Ciller's immediate task is to secure her footing in the party and outmanoeuvre her rivals and Mr Demirel who is known to be unhappy about her appointment.</p>

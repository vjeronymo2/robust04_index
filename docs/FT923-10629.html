			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Large users step up demand for lower electricity prices LARGE electricity users yester-day stepped up their campaign to scrap the Pounds 1.26bn subsidy Nuclear Electric receives from consumers as the state-owned generator announced operating profits up 48 per cent to Pounds 482m. Imperial Chemical Industries was prompted by the profits announcement to re-emphasise its call for lower prices at a meeting with Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator. The subsidy or levy, which adds 11 per cent to electricity bills, has long been a sore point with large users. 'We think the size and concept of the levy should be reconsidered in the light of the profitability of Nuclear Electric,' said Mr Chris Hampson, director of ICI. The company's electricity bill was substantially higher than last year, making it hard to compete with other European companies, he said. The Major Energy Users Council, a lobby group representing large electricity consumers, called for a cut in the subsidy. 'When I think that our group is subsidising Nuclear Electric to the tune of Pounds 5m it makes me very annoyed,' said Mr John Topliss, chairman of the council's electricity group. The council is waiting for Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, to reply to a written appeal. Mr Doug Rodger, who heads the Chemical Industries Association, also called for the levy to be ended. 'I think the government should take another look in the light of this improved performance and see if there is scope to give large users a break,' he said. Offer said yesterday the levy had always been designed to lapse in 1998, and it looked forward to that date. But Prof Littlechild, is understood to be considering ending the levy earlier. Yesterday's results for the year to March 1992 show that Nuclear Electric would not have made a profit without the subsidy. Its turnover would have more than halved to Pounds 1.17bn, giving an operating loss of Pounds 783m, rather than a profit of Pounds 482m. That would have turned its bottom line profit of Pounds 62m, after provisions for waste disposal and redundancies, into a loss. Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric's chairman, who attacked critics of the levy, confirmed that the company intended to be profitable without it by 1995. Nuclear Electric will have to demonstrate it is economically viable when the government reviews the future of the nuclear industry in 1994. Mr Collier said the main force behind improving profitability would be increased output. Nuclear Electric's power stations generated 7.5 per cent more electricity last year, giving it an 18.5 per cent share of the electricity market, compared with 17.4 per cent the previous year. Profits would also be improved through job cuts and savings in goods, materials and services, Mr Collier said. The company confirmed it planned to cut 3,500 jobs by 1995. Operating costs per unit had already fallen in real terms, the company said, from 4.2p in the year to March 1991, to 3.9p this year.</p>

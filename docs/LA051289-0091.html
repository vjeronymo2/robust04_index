			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A state Senate subcommittee voted Thursday to restore a $3-million cut proposed  by Gov. George Deukmejian for the $15.6-million budget of the California Arts  Council and to give $2.2 million more to the arts agency. An Assembly  subcommittee is scheduled to vote on the matter on May 24. It has already  postponed a vote in order to study the council's administrative budget, which  some of its members believe should be dramatically reduced, a source who wished  to remain anonymous said.

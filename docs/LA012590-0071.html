			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Portrait of Van Gogh's Doctor to Be Auctioned: Vincent van Gogh's portrait of  Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, who treated the troubled artist during the last year  of his life, will be sold at Christie's New York on May 15. The painting is  expected to bring between $40 million and $50 million.  </P> <P> That estimate places the expressionistic portrait between two other high-priced  Van Goghs -- "Irises," which sold for $53.9 million on Nov. 11, 1987, setting a  world record for an artwork, and "Sunflowers," which brought $39.9 million on  March 31, 1987. The portrait of Dr. Gachet belongs to a trust established by  Siegfried Kramarsky, a New York banker and philanthropist who died in 1961. The  painting has been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since  1984 and has been in major exhibitions there. Van Gogh painted two versions of  the doctor's portrait. The other one hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. BETH  KLEID  </P></p>

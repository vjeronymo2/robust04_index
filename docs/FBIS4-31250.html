			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 3d Corps Press Center] </F>   [Text] The chetniks were not calm on the battlefields in  the area of the 3d Corps of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday again. The most persistent attacks  were in the free territories of Doboj and Tesanj, as well as at  our defense positions that the chetnik artillery had fiercely  turned on. There was no peace on the other battlefields either.  The increasingly frequent movements by motor vehicles, the  bringing in of new forces, and the enemy's regrouping are a sign  of the intensification of the offensive. The chetnik artillery  pounded Doboj-Tesanj villages and defense lines all the time  yesterday. A howitzer at Stanovi pounded Putesici and  Kalosevici, tanks at Sinanovici Guvno and Brze Grane pounded  Zmajevac, and a Bofors gun at Siljato Brdo was firing on Peliva.  A chetnik Bofors gun was active at Plane and a B-1 gun from  (Tomic) Brdo kept destroying Kriz.    In the meantime, four buses full of chetniks arrived at the  Stankova Kosa-Ambariste-Strizijevica line. Chetnik artillery  occasionally fired at Zavidovici battlefields. Mortar activity  was registered at Hajderovici. Much more than that, they used  infantry and antiaircraft weapons to shoot at our defenders  positions. More than 20 trucks and other motor vehicles have  arrived in the Zavidovici region. The replacement of forces,  bringing new ones, and the regrouping accompanied by armored  transporters along the Lukici-Sjenokos and Podsjelovo-Stog lines  are a sign of new chetnik strikes. Infantry, antiaircraft, and  mortar fire, particularly at Privije and Stolac Brdo, marked the  day yesterday in the Seric-Teslic region.    Therefore, there is not as much as one day of the chetniks'  cease-fire on the 3d Corps battlefields.</p>

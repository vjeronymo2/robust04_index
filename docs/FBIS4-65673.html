			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The government wants to build 2,000  apartments for ethnic Germans in western Siberia before the end  of the year. This was announced by the government's  representative for resettlers, State Secretary Horst  Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union), in Bonn today.    The apartments are designed for ethnic Germans who do not  want to emigrate to Germany, but who are looking for new homes  because of the unstable situation in their home country,  particularly in Kazakhstan. The government wants to provide 30  million German marks for these measures and buy houses, build  new homes, or grant credits for self-help measures. At present,  about 600,000 ethnic Germans are living in western Siberia.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Democratic governor candidates win seats THE DEMOCRATS were faring well in the 12 gubernatorial races which took place yesterday, with early returns suggesting a net gain for the party of three state houses. Mr Evan Bayh, a liberal Democratic incumbent in generally Republican Indiana, held his office, as did Governor Gaston Caperton in West Virginia. In Vermont, Governor Howard Dean kept the job he entered last year when Republican Governor Richard Snelling died. Rhode Island's Bruce Sundlun was also re-elected. The Democrats captured three state houses, however. Mr Jim Hunt, governor of North Carolina from 1977 to 1985, will return to the mansion after defeating Republican Lieutenant-Governor Jim Gardner. In Missouri, Democratic Lieutenant-Governor Mel Carnahan beat Republican attorney-general William Webster in a race dominated by the abortion issue. In Delaware, the Democrats also gained the governor's mansion when former Congressman Thomas Carper won. A brighter spot for Republicans was New Hampshire, a traditionally Republican state where Mr Steven Merrill defeated a strong challenge from Mrs Deborah Arnesen, a Democratic state legislator. She had committed herself to a state income tax.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The group of seven Slovene citizens is still on  hunger strike at the Cankar Hall in Ljubljana. They claim that  they will continue insisting that President Milan Kucan resigns  and that the authorities hold early elections.    Four of the people are employed and have taken regular  annual  leave for the time during the strike. Talking with one of the  strikers, Jernej Jung, we learned that they were visited today  by representatives of the Red Cross, Janez Jansa, and Marjan  Podobnik. The strikers are visited regularly by doctors.  According to the strikers themselves, their health is  satisfactory so far.</p>

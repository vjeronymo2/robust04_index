			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Markets Markets on both sides of the Atlantic had worked themselves into such a state of nerves ahead of the US GDP numbers that even the distinctly mixed figures were met with a huge sigh of relief. The initial alarm created by the 3.4 per cent growth figure only exaggerated the bounce when traders digested the lower-than-expected price deflator. Yet this probably had more to do with the shape of trading books ahead of the news than any change in sentiment. Those worried about US inflation were not cheered by the low deflator figure. Their argument is precisely that the Federal Reserve is being lulled by good inflation statistics and will not take the stern action required until it is too late. Nor were they impressed by the large element of stock building in the GDP figure since they believe that inflation is already working its way through the system as a result of past growth. In London, by contrast, markets are more inclined to accept the Bank of England's relaxed view about UK inflation prospects - something likely to be reinforced by next week's quarterly inflation bulletin. This has helped gilts outperform the US and German bond markets. Yesterday's rally made up most of the ground lost earlier in the week. Shares did even better with the FT-SE 100 up 51 points on the week. But they still remain largely at the mercy of Wall Street. Judging by recent experience yesterday's recovery in US bonds and the dollar is likely to be short-lived.</p>

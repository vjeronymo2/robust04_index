			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRANDENBURG SHUFFLES, SDSU DRAWS A VICTORY  </P> <P> Jim Brandenburg, still attempting to find a satisfactory lineup for his 1989-90  San Diego State men's basketball team, wasted no time looking over his  personnel Thursday night as the Aztecs opened their season with an exhibition  game against DAS Delft, a national team from Holland.  </P> <P> By halftime of an eventual 52-42 victory at SDSU's Peterson Gym, Brandenburg  had played 11 of 12 players on his roster.  </P> <P> And the way DAS Delft performed most of the game, Brandenburg probably could  have called a few students out of the bleachers and still come away with a  victory. DAS Delft (1-7) went 9:50 without scoring in the second half after  taking its only lead of the game, 31-30, with 14:30 remaining.  </P> <P> SDSU's starting lineup consisted of Michael Best (6-feet-4) and Rodney Jones  (6-1) at the guards, Neal Steinly (6-11) at center and Vern Thompson (6-6) and  Shawn Jamison (6-8) at the forwards.  </P> <P> Best, Jones and Steinly are three of just five players returning from last  year's team.  </P> <P> But it will be a while, Brandenburg said, before he finds some combinations he  likes.  </P> <P> "At least a couple of weeks," he said. "It's easy for me to say these guys are  going to start, but there has to be some rationale from the coach's standpoint  and from the players' standpoint."  </P> <P> Three community college transfers led SDSU in scoring. Jamison (Pratt, Kan.,  Community College), Marty Dow (Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M) and guard Arthur  Massey (Alvin, Tex., Community College) had nine points apiece. Jamison also  had a team-high 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> Best, who averaged 12.5 points a game last season but is coming back from  surgery to remove two screws from a knee, had nine rebounds but was zero for  eight from the field and finished with just one point.  </P> <P> SDSU shot just 38% from the field. DAS Delft was even worse -- 35%.  </P> <P> "I could sit here and be negative or super positive, because I saw both ends of  it," Brandenburg said.  </P> <P> Brandenburg also said that Terrence Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 forward from Patrick  Henry High School, will red-shirt this season.  </P></p>

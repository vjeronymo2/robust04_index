			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese science and  technology community should make decisive contributions to a  sustaining development of the national economy in the next 50  years, said Song Jian, director of the State Science and  Technology Commission.    Speaking at today's closing ceremony of the general meetings  of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy  of Engineering (CAE), Song said that the community should  continue its efforts to help establish a scientific and  democratic policy-making system.    In the main battlefield of the economic drive, all science  and technology departments must do their part to help solve the  problems which come up in the development of the country's  industry, agriculture and the service industries, said Song, who  is a state councillor.    "Such departments are also expected to help spread the use  of  new and advanced scientific results in order to raise the  productivity of all industries and lead the rural and township  enterprises onto a healthy development track and upgrade their  technologies," he said.    He said that the country's science and technology sector  must  strive to develop environment-protection technology and develop  as well as promote pollution-free production processes and  methods so as to reduce and, eventually, halt the emission of  pollutants.    "Scientists and technologists must contribute more to the  protection of the environment on which people of all  nationalities live and advance," the official noted.    To rule out possible mistakes in major policy-making, the  whole process must involve the active participation of science  and technology departments, Song said.    He said that the Chinese science and technology world must  map out its ninth five-year plan and a 15-year development  program on the basis of science and democracy.    The country's science and technology community should target  some scientific and engineering projects that have a direct  bearing on social and economic development.    He also said that China should train a large number of young  scientists and engineers for the next century and set up  well-equiped research institutions and key national labs.    From now on, the science and technology community should  also  reform itself so as to open wider to the outside world and  expand international cooperation, Song said.    He urged the CAS and CAE, China's two top scientific bodies,  to cooperate closely with each other while tapping their  respective strengths.    "This will help develop the national economy and bolster the  overall national strength," he said.</p>

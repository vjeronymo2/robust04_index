			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Melina, use your marbles I thought: why doesn't the old bat stop whingeing and get down to some serious ministerial work. Why must she go on and on about the return of the Elgin marbles to Greece when she knows, in her heart, that the British Museum will never let them go. Yet I regretted the thought immediately, and scolded myself severely, smacking myself on the wrist, banging the side of my head and punching myself in the ribs. I thought: I like Melina Mercouri, the re-appointed Greek minister for culture. She was a swinger when I was a boy, and is doubtless a swinger still. And I remembered that I have always suspected that the Greek case for the return of the Elgin marbles to Athens is a smidgin stronger than the British Museum's case for their retention in London. What triggered all this brain activity was a report that Melina is working herself into a lather again about the marbles, and has declared that the Greek government, with the help of Brussels grants, has built a 'huge exhibition room' that at present lies 'nude and unclothed', awaiting the marbles' return. The British Museum's argument for holding Melina at bay has been summarised in a statement. It starts: 'Among the sculptures known as the Elgin marbles, the most important are the frieze and other architectural sculptures rescued by Lord Elgin from the ruins of the Parthenon, with the approval of the appropriate authorities, at the beginning of the 19th century.' It goes on to say that the British Museum is forbidden by law to dispose, permanently, of objects in its collections (other than duplicates); that its duty is to preserve its collections for the benefit of international scholarship and the enjoyment of the public; that in fulfilment of this responsibility it opens seven days a week, free of charge, and attracts more than 6.5m visitors a year; that the Parthenon sculptures 'constitute one of the greatest and best-loved of its treasures'; and that they are housed in a museum 'which is universal in its scope and is designed to present as complete and integrated a picture as possible of the development of different, but related, cultures through the ages'. In concludes: 'The trustees would regard it as a betrayal of their trust to establish a precedent for the piecemeal dismemberment of collections which recognise no arbitrary boundaries of time and place.' Two years ago, while walking round Leptis Magna, in Libya, with Dr Susan Walker, the assistant keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum, I asked her about the Elgin marbles. Dr Susan could out-fox Melina Mercouri any day, and can be brilliantly succinct. 'How would I crystallise the case for the marbles' retention in London?' she said. 'OK . . . 1) it would be the start of the end of the British Museum; 2) the marbles' location in London since their purchase from Lord Elgin is part of their history and story - part of the history of art. They belong where they are.' Sorry, Dr Susan; I am not quite convinced. I think the marbles should be sent home to Greece. I am never impressed by thin-edge-of-the-wedge arguments ('piecemeal dismemberment . . . '), and I believe that Britain needs the sort of PR coup which the return of the marbles would precipitate. But the Greeks must buy them back. As it happens, no one in London will estimate an open-market value for the Elgin marbles. Christie's told me to ask the British Museum. I did. 'Can't be done,' said the museum. 'They're priceless and irreplaceable.' So we'll call it Pounds 200m. We can call it what we like. But we won't just settle for Pounds 200m in cash or its equivalent in fetta cheese or bitter Greek olives or that hopelessly terrible wine. We will settle for three islands: Chios ('blessed with great beauty and a fascinating history,' says a handy travel brochure), Hydra ('weekend playground of the rich and famous') and Patmos ('small yet enchanting'). Before the Greeks go berserk, they should note that I haven't asked for Macedonia or for anything especially sensitive. Just three islands. Oh, and unlimited free travel between Greece and Britain for anyone who wins a villa or apartment on Chios, Hydra or Patmos in the UK national lottery starting next year. And a few other things that will occur to me eventually. Get real, Melina; this is 1994.</p>

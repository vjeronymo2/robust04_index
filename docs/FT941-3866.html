			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Cell phone pact lifts US threat against Tokyo Japan has narrowly averted US trade sanctions over its treatment of Motorola, a leading US cellular phone company. A deal was reached after intense negotiations, which removes the immediate threat of sanctions against Japan over US access to its cellular phone market. But it could create an unfortunate precedent by encouraging the Japanese government to become closely involved in the affairs of private companies. Washington, which used the case to signal its dissatisfaction with Tokyo's progress in opening its markets, was due this week to publish a list of likely targets for sanctions. The US wanted to put pressure on Japan to accept quantifiable indicators of the openness of its markets. Last month Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, brandished a Motorola cellphone as he announced the US finding that Japan had breached a bilateral agreement. The agreement calls on the Japanese government to monitor investment by a Japanese group, IDO, in a cellular phone system promoted by Motorola. The government should also allocate more radio frequency to the US system. IDO, the Japanese cellular phone operator, agreed to quicken the pace of its investment in Motorola's system. The Japanese government also agreed to monitor IDO's progress in implementing its plans at three-monthly intervals; to back low-interest loans from the Japan Development Bank; to allow IDO to carry out its investment and to review the situation at any time if there was a request from either party. In a weekend radio programme, President Bill Clinton welcomed the breakthrough. However, Japanese officials, who have emphasised the importance of deregulating domestic industry, said that such a deal was only possible in a sector where bureaucratic involvement was still strong because of the need to allocate frequencies. Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had sought initially to leave the dispute in the hands of the two companies. However, US pressure, and the threat of sanctions at a time when US-Japanese relations have been fraught with difficulty, forced Tokyo to concede. The deal calls for IDO to bring forward its investment in a further 159 base stations for the Tacs cellular phones system which is backed by Motorola, and complete that investment by the early autumn of 1995. IDO also agreed to reallocate some of its radio frequency used for a Japanese rival to Motorola's system. The US had threatened sanctions against Japan on the grounds that a bilateral agreement to provide the US system with 'comparable market access' had not been met. Apple assault on Intel, Page 15</p>

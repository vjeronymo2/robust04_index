			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Case of Sour Grapes"] </F>   [Text] It is indeed unfortunate that British industries,  which are in dire need of foreign business to keep them going,  should now suffer the consequences of their irresponsible press.  The height of its mindless communication, as manifested in its  utterly ridiculous allegations against the integrity of our  leaders, threatens to cripple the British industries and  relations between the two countries.    But nobody, not even the Government there, seems to be able  to imbue the British Press with a sense of being responsible.  Perhaps it is now up to those who suffer and have to survive  the consequences of their fallen fourth estate who must exhaust  their resources to do something about it.    Since the British Government seemed to shy away from doing  anything concrete to rebut the ridiculous and unsubstantiated  allegations made, the maligned Malaysian Government seems to  have no choice but to end all further dealings with British  companies.    Indeed, why should the Malaysian Government give contracts  to  British companies, only to suffer various allegations and  ridicule in the British Press? As the Malaysian Government  cannot expect justice or reasonableness from the once-respected  British Press, it should not be blamed for assuming it could not  hope for justice from a British court should it decide to take  legal action against the offending newspapers.    Perhaps the Malaysian Government, in its wisdom, knows that  taking the newspapers to the British courts would be a lengthy  process bound to tie up human and financial resources which are  better utilised for the development of the country. In any case  the British Press has not shown due respect to its own legal  system. It openly criticised court judgments.    As such, there is nothing that could stop it from further  maligning our leaders should the court rule in favour of the  Malaysian Government.    The British Press always prides itself in being free,  independent and liberal. This may seem so. But while it may be  free from Government influence, it can never be free from  editors who are beholden to the owners. The history of the  British Press is full of examples of independent editors of  newspapers being put out on the streets by the owners. A  landmark example was when Harold Evans had to leave after he  disagreed with Rupert Murdoch, who had just then acquired THE  TIMES.    The British Press and some British Ministers, in trying to  justify the ferocity of their attacks against Malaysia and the  Malaysian leaders, have often referred to the Malaysian Press as  being controlled by the government. What they failed to  recognise is that the Malaysian Press has not only been  responsible but has been instrumental in helping to create a  stable, peaceful and harmonious multiracial Malaysia that is on  the threshold of becoming an industrialised country.    Malaysia, unlike Britain, is built on the foundation of  mutual respect among members of society -- the press included.  It is this respect that is fostered, and allowed to grow and  spread, that has helped establish a strong and industrious  nation. This formula is so successful that even the British  companies benefited by way of trade and contracts.    Unlike the British Press, the Malaysian Press does not  believe in opposing for the sake of proving a point or showing  that it is powerful and independent. It is a part of the  national tradition and we are proud of our role.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EKLUND SCORES WORLD BOXING TITLE  </P> <P> Anders Eklund of Sweden overcame a sixth-round knockdown to earn a decision  Thursday night over Philip Brown of New Orleans and claim the vacant World  Boxing Assn. Americanus heavyweight championship.  </P> <P> Brown, a former sparring partner for former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes,  stunned Eklund with a looping right hand midway through the sixth round. He  followed up with two more roundhouse rights, sending Eklund to the canvas.  </P> <P> Brown, however, did little else throughout the 12-round bout, throwing only  four combinations before the sellout crowd of 1,000 at Harrah's Reno.  </P> <P> Eklund, a 6-foot-6-inch, 253-pound European champion, jabbed weakly but was  effective in throwing solid body shots.  </P> <P> Eklund won handily on two cards. The third judge, Doug Tucker, scored the fight  a 114-114 draw. Eklund improved to 18-4-1, while Brown dropped to 36-4.  </P> <P> Eklund has signed to fight Italy's Guido Turne for the European heavyweight  championship. The bout is scheduled May 10 in Helsinki.  </P></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sydbank to acquire Aktivbanken Sydbank is to acquire Aktivbanken and become Denmark's sixth-largest bank with assets of about DKr50bn (Dollars 7.5bn). The takeover has solved a problem for Topdanmark, the insurance group, which bought Aktivbanken in 1989 for DKr1.4bn. Since then Aktivbanken has run up losses totalling DKr581m. Topdanmark's involvement with Aktivbanken were factors in the resignation last month of Mr Henning Birch, Topdanmark's chief executive, and Mr Oluf von Lowzow, supervisory board chairman. After the deal, Topdanmark will own 22.6 per cent of the shares in Sydbank and Top's life assurance and accident policies will be sold through Sydbank's branches. Sydbank will pay krone for krone for Aktivbanken's net assets with an issue of shares with a market value of about DKr410m. Sydbank will make an underwritten issue of shares with a minimum price of DKr210 per share. Following the share issues, Sydbank's capital adequacy ratio would be about 12 per cent, Topdanmark said. Mr Carsten Andersen, Sydbank chief executive, said cost savings, equal to at least 12 per cent of the combined costs of the two banks would be made.</p>

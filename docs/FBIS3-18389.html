			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lisbet Lambert and Lars Halskov Ritzau: "The </F> Move to Riga"]    [Text] Two years ago, three Danish firms acquired 56  percent of the shares in the Latvian firm of Saiva, Inc., in  Sloka south of Riga. And at machines from the Danish clothing  manufacturing firm of Nybo Jensen, Inc., in Viborg, 80 Latvian  seamstresses now work for a monthly wage that no Danish  seamstress can compete with.    There are Danish machines, chairs, and lamps set up in the  room. And it is work clothing for Danish workers at Danish  companies that is being manufactured in the sewing room.    But it is the pale Latvian winter sun shining in through the  big window panes. And 26-year-old Laila Serritslev, who monitors  the quality of the ready-made clothing, does not get far if she  tries to speak Danish to the seamstresses seated at the machines.    The conversation, though, proceeds briskly in the sewing  room. But it is Latvian and Russian chatter flying across the  room.    The seamstresses' flower-patterned smocks stand in sharp  contrast to the bundles of white fabric that, stitch by stitch  and machine by machine, end up as finished smocks for Danish  hospitals.    The machines come from the Danish clothing manufacturing  firm  of Nybo Jensen, Inc., in Viborg. It took just one weekend to  move them to the Latvian town of Sloka, 25 km south of Riga.    Friday, 2 July 1993 was the last day of work for 44 Danish  seamstresses at the plant in Viborg. The entire sewing operation  was shut down. The Monday [5 July] after that, 80 Latvian  seamstresses were sewing work clothing on the same machines for  the firm of Saiva, Inc., in Sloka.    Currently, Nybo Jensen produces only 300 pieces of clothing  per day in Denmark, and that is done by a subcontractor. There  are still about 35 employees working for the company in Viborg,  but they are only involved in administration and the design,  cutting, and packing of clothing.    Danish seamstresses earning a monthly salary of between  12,000 and 15,000 kroner cannot compete with the Latvian  seamstresses at Saiva, who earn between 240 and 1,200 kroner --  all dependent on how quickly they can get the clothing through  the sewing machines.    Even if the wages are low, the Latvian seamstresses are  happy  just to have work. In just two years, the number of jobs in the  Latvian textile and clothing manufacturing industry has been  more than cut in half. In 1991 about 56,000 people worked in the  industry. Today that number is down to 26,000.    And even those seamstresses who still have jobs at one of  the  state enterprises do not automatically receive their wages. Many  of them must now see to it themselves that they get their salary  because the plants can no longer sell their goods to the former  Soviet Union.    Formerly about 90 percent of Latvia's production of textiles  and clothing went to the old empire. But that is now over.  Business partners in the new SNG [Commonwealth of Independent  States] countries no longer buy goods from Latvian businesses.  <H5>  With Hat in Hand </H5>   So many seamstresses stand in the marketplace behind the  train station in Riga each holding the clothes she has made.  Even if the winter weather is cold, they stand for many hours  and display a sweater or a pair of stockings. To get a monthly  wage, the seamstresses must go to the marketplace themselves to  sell the clothing they have produced at the state factories.    That is why seamstresses stand hat in hand in front of  textile and clothing manufacturing firms that have foreign  capital. Because with them they are certain of getting a wage,  even if that wage is not particularly high.    Many seamstresses have also been let go at Saiva in Sloka,  where the Danish Nybo Jensen clothing factory moved its  manufacturing. During the Soviet period, there were 3,000  employees at the firm, but today there are only 300 employees  working under the new ownership. Factory owner Peder Nybo Jensen  does not own shares in the plant.    The three Danish firms of Spectre, Godske, and Power  acquired  56 percent of the shares when the state enterprise was  privatized almost two years ago. Latvian partners have the  remainder of the shares. Today the plant is entirely dependent  on orders from the west. But the firm's Latvian director is  still the same, however.    "I usually call myself the salaries director," said the  director, Pavel K. Kukel.    "The Danish partners are responsible for the orders, the  technology, the raw goods, sales, and marketing. From our side,  all we contribute is cheap wages and the organization of the  labor. Those are the principles. They are based on one fact: We  have much lower wages than in the west," he said.    The only Dane who moved with Nybo Jensen's machines in the  summer of 1993 was Laila Serritslev. She had been employed as a  manufacturing assistant in Viborg but was offered the position  in Latvia.    Here she sees to it that the quality of the Danish clothes  is  maintained. She is supposed to instruct the Latvian seamstresses  in the use of the modern machines and is responsible for  maintaining the contact with Nybo Jensen in Denmark.    Her base is a small office with a telephone and a fax  machine. And squeezed in between the frequent visits to the  production room, she tries to tie everything together in the  office.  <H5>  Slower Pace </H5>   She discusses the latest patterns with designers and  builders  in Denmark and instructs the Latvian seamstresses. They often  look in with questions for the Danish instructors who follow  along with the cut out clothing from Denmark.    The instruction proceeds with the help of sign language and  individual words in German or English. If things get more  complicated, the plant's interpreter interprets into Latvian or  Russian.    Laila Serritslev has not had problems instructing her  experienced Latvian seamstresses. It has taken more time to deal  with those without experience, but things are not more different  here than in Denmark, she says.    "The Latvian seamstresses are very quality conscious. The  clothing here at the plant is of exactly the same quality as the  clothing manufactured back home," she stated.    The only difference is the pace. The Latvian seamstresses  are  just not used to the pace that is customary in Danish clothing  manufacturing plants.    Laila Serritslev is responsible for seeing to it that orders  are ready on time. And when the seamstresses are not that quick  -- then they have to work for longer periods. The finished  clothing leaves for Denmark by truck each Thursday. That means  that some of the seamstresses have very long work days. From  0600 until 1800 hours is not uncommon. But in the future it will  no longer be Laila Serritslev's job to see to it that the  clothes are ready on time. After working in Sloka for six  months, she has found a new job. Back home in Denmark.    But the Danish manufacturing will continue at Saiva.  <H5>  Cheap Labor </H5>   There are very big differences in the hourly wage in the  textile industries in East and West Europe. Indicated on the map  [not reproduced here] are the average hourly wages for a textile  worker including bonuses but excluding social benefits. Social  benefit costs vary greatly from country to country but if they  are included, the costs are practically the same in West Europe.  The figures here are given in Danish kroner.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Germany                               |60.74                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Netherlands                           |59.70                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Denmark                               |81.32                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sweden                                |66.99                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Estonia                               |2.31                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Latvia                                |1.50                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lithuania                             |1.80                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belarus                               |1.30                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poland                                |8.00                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Slovakia                              |3.70                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Czech Republic                        |3.70                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: The Textile and Clothing Industry                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / People: Constructive careers BT has appointed Alan White as director, group property. White takes charge of one of the UK's largest property portfolios, which is undergoing a period of heavy rationalisation to meet the changing requirements of BT. Technological change and the decline of BT's traditional activities is forcing BT to dispose of substantial amounts of its 75m sq ft of operational space, which currently consists of more than 92,000 UK and 500 overseas properties. White was formerly head of group property operations at BT, which he joined in 1991 from TSB, where he was director of premises. Before that, he was group estates manager of Grand Metropolitan between 1987 and 1990, having worked as group estates manager of Dee Corporation and of Booker.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Ford pulled into Dollars 2.3bn loss as UK turns sour: US carmaker hit by falls in its two leading markets THE HUGE Dollars 2.26bn (Pounds 1.27bn) net losses incurred last year by Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, derived mainly from the US and the UK. The long recession in the US has sapped the big three US carmakers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, but only Ford has seen its main European profit source, the UK, turn sour at the same time. Traditionally, Ford of Britain has been the mainstay of Ford's profits in Europe and helped out its US parent company during periodic crises. Ford is the dominant market leader in the UK with 24.2 per cent of the new car market and a share approaching 50 per cent in some segments of the UK light commercial vehicle market. Now it is the parent company that is having to shell out additional capital to rescue its British subsidiary. Ford's traditional operations collapsed into loss in the UK last year and its woes were compounded by the performance of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, which it took over for Pounds 1.6bn at the end of 1989. Jaguar made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 226m compared with a Pounds 66.2m loss in 1990, reflecting a severe reduction in sales volume coupled with large restructuring costs. Worldwide Jaguar retail sales fell to 25,661 last year from 42,753 a year earlier, under the impact of recession in its two main markets, the UK and the US. It was also burdened last year with the heavy costs of cutting its workforce by around a third to only 8,000. Ford claimed yesterday that it had made money last year in its other main European markets - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - but the huge deficit in the UK forced the overall European operations into loss. Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a net loss last year of Dollars 1.08bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989. Ford's worldwide automotive operations lost Dollars 3.2bn in 1991 compared with earnings of Dollars 99m in 1990. Automotive losses were Dollars 2.2bn in the US (a loss of Dollars 17m in 1990) and Dollars 970m outside the US, compared with profits of Dollars 116m in 1990. The profits made in continental Europe last year and in some other overseas markets were more than offset by losses of Dollars 761m at Ford of Britain and Dollars 354m at Jaguar. Mr Harold Poling, chairman of Ford, held out little hope for an early improvement this year. 'Many of the problems that affected us in 1991 are continuing into 1992 - soft economies, intense competition and excess industry capacity.' He claimed that Ford's operating results worldwide would show a 'substantial improvement' because of the company's 'relentless' cost-cutting programme coupled with a gradual economic recovery during the year. The same main factors hit Ford's automotive profits in the US and UK, namely lower vehicle production, much higher marketing costs in the form of discounts and other financial incentives to push sales, and heavy costs for the development of products. Marketing costs last year jumped in the US to 16 per cent of its revenues from 12 per cent in 1990 and only 6 per cent in the mid-1980s. In the UK, Ford's total costs for 'liquidating' the stocks that it allowed to mount up escalated to 24 per cent of revenues from 14 per cent in 1990. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain, insisted yesterday that the UK operations were now in better balance, but declined to indicate when the company might emerge into the black. 'We have a better balance in our business because we have got our production and stocks under control and have got our marketing expenses down because of that,' he said. Ford of Britain, excluding Jaguar, used only about 70 per cent of its plant capacity last year with its Halewood, Merseyside, Escort/Orion production plant suffering 110 'down days' with no output, and the Southampton Transit van plant suffering 50 'down days'. In January, overall UK car and commercial vehicle sales slumped, but Ford of Britain is forecasting some modest recovery in the second half of the year. In the first two months of this year, the Southampton van plant has been working virtually half-time, however, with output stopped on 24 production days to the end of February. At the same time, the Dagenham and Halewood plants are becoming more dependent on export markets in Europe just as new car demand in Germany in particular is set to slide from last year's record level.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner to </F> unidentified ZDF correspondent "immediately after NATO announced  its new ultimatum to the Serbs" on 22 April in Brussels --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] How great is the risk for UN  Forces stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Woerner] There is certainly a certain risk considering what  we have seen from the Serbs so far. On the other hand, we will  apply much more massive means, and we have left no doubt that we  would not tolerate retaliatory acts without taking appropriate  steps ourselves, for example close air support, to which we  could resort at any time in such a situation.    [Correspondent] Why does the threat only include bombings  within a range of 20 km?    [Woerner] There are a number of reasons, primarily military  ones. But there are also monitoring reasons. We have to be  sure that we can check on what is going on there.    [Correspondent] Is the alliance now not facing the danger of  an uncontrollable escalation of the conflict?    [Woerner] I would not absolutely rule out such danger, even  though I do not regard it as probable. In Sarajevo we had a  different experience. Then, you must not forget one thing:  Look at the pictures that can be seen on your television or any  other television; the bombing of hospitals, even refugee camps  have been shelled, and civilians are killed in the most cruel  way. Should we stand idly by?    [Correspondent] NATO has now shown its determination in the  case of Gorazde. What about the remaining safe areas?    [Woerner] We will discuss this later.    [Correspondent] Where are the problems?    [Woerner] There are many problems because each case is  different. Each of these so-called safe areas has different  problems, a different environment, different countryside,  different weather conditions, different terrain, different troop  strengths of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] forces,  etc. There is no patent solution, which is why we have to  discuss each case individually before adopting a decision. Yet,  I think that a decision will come.    [Correspondent] Still today?    [Woerner] It is certainly going to be a long session, and we  might not arrive at a decision before tomorrow morning.</p>

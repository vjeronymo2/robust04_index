In an incident related to the  disturbances, however, an elderly lady suffered a heart attack  and died. According to a Military Police source, the incident  occurred at Dos Caminos subway station, where secondary school  students sought refuge while fleeing from police after  participating in a protest. As the result of the nervousness  caused by the students' arrival, the woman, some 70 years old,  suffered a heart attack and, although paramedics at the subway  station gave her first aid assistance, she died shortly  thereafter.    The disturbances occurred at the Rafael Urdaneta and Santos  Michelena Secondary Schools early in the morning. Both schools  were vacated and the Military Police forced the students to  scatter. Some of them, however, put garbage bags on the pavement  and set them on fire. Similar protests were staged in front of  the Carlos Soublette Secondary School, located in the San  Bernardino neighborhood, where Special Brigade members helped  restore order.    In Sucre, students from several secondary schools started a  march. When they were dispersed by the police, however, they  sought refuge in the subway stations, where the elderly woman's  death occurred. Traffic was interrupted near the Andres Bello  School on Mexico Avenue, Gustavo Herrera School on Libertador  Avenue in Chacao, and in front of the Caracas Instituto  Pedagogico, located on Paez Avenue in El Paraiso. At all of  these places, students placed garbage and obstacles in the  street while the police cordoned off the areas to prevent an  aggravation of the situation. In the afternoon, hooded  individuals from Ciudad University tried to commandeer a cargo  vehicle, but police thwarted the attempt. Later, the same hooded  men confronted police in the Tres Gracias sector.    [Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish on page D-12 of its 28  January edition publishes a related 800-word report that adds  that hooded individuals who infiltrated student demonstrations  set three trucks on fire near the Central University of  Venezuela in Maracay and near the Technological University in La  Victoria. The report says the students were protesting the  arrest of Juan Valladares, a young worker and student at the  Libertador Pedagogical University in Maracay. The newspaper  also reports that Mario Popoli, third judge for preliminary  investigations on crime, has ordered an expeditious  investigation because six trucks have been looted and set on  fire in less than a week.]</p>

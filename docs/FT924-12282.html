			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (1): Focus has to sharpen - Consulting remains big business, but the recession has caused firms to rethink strategies and expand their range of services and specialisms. In the face of intensified competition, profitability has been hit AFTER the boom of the 1980s and the collapse of the early 1990s, management consultants are beginning to change gear in order to cope with the difficult challenges which they face during the next few years. They have witnessed and participated in powerful shifts in the nature of the services provided, the relationship of consultants with clients and savage competition with their rivals. Meanwhile, their reputation as professionals remains hazy. 'Consulting is a tough industry,' says Mr John Moynihan, chief executive of PA Consulting. 'It wasn't 20 years ago, but now the industry is saturated. I'm sure there will be casualties.' The tone of the quarterly survey from the Management Consultancy Association, the leading UK trade association, has certainly changed markedly in the past few months. In April, it heralded some signs of the start of an economic upturn after 15 months of flat business. In July, it said that the upturn was still awaited, with some signs that consultants would be hiring more staff within six months. By early October, it warned that its members saw 'little scope for optimism', with a continued reduction in general business consultancy, offset by a slightly larger increase in the amount of information technology work. Consulting remains big business. It continues to live on an enormous expansion that has taken place over the past decade. A survey produced earlier this year by Alpha Publications showed that the top 30 firms alone billed Dollars 5.5bn in western Europe during 1991. The UK market has been hit by the recession and is also highly mature. Prospects are a little more promising overseas and many consultancies have sustained their income with work from across Europe, particularly from business in the former Communist bloc. However, while nominal growth in many regions is now static, profitability is still less certain. Getting at the truth is not easy. Secrecy is nowhere more pervasive than at McKinsey &amp; Co, which refuses to say anything about itself, but is ranked in the survey as fourth largest consultant in western Europe with more than 1,100 consultants and fee income of Dollars 336m last year. Most other firms echo that philosophy almost as strongly. They are as subdued about their own financial position as they are vocal about their ability to improve that of their customers. To this end, they are able to take advantage of their private corporate or partnership status in order to reveal as little as possible about profits or losses to clients and competitors. One of the few large players which does present more detailed internal information - by virtue of its public listing in London - is P-E International, the management and computer consultancy. Last month the company reported half-year pre-tax profits down 72 per cent to Pounds 514,000 on a turnover of Pounds 35.5m and halved its interim dividend to 1p. Redundancies have also been on the rise. Last November, Price Waterhouse dispensed with 150 of its 1,000 staff in the management consultancy services division as part of a wider restructuring which raised questions over its future. Other firms have been shedding staff in small, less noticeable groups. In an effort to survive, firms have extended enormously the range of services and specialist areas on offer. 'Change management', 'empowerment', 'quality' and 'the environment' are among the words tripping off management consultancy tongues at present, in keeping with the latest management theories. Firms have also started to talk more about the growing degree of focus needed to pinpoint target industries or specialist areas which they believe are profitable or growing rapidly, such as the public sector and health care. One of the more intriguing developments has been the recent emergence of 'out-sourcing'. Proponents - such as Andersen Consulting which has recently won lucrative contracts with BP and the Stock Exchange - flag it as a radical way to improve the efficiency of what were previously regarded as core headquarters functions. Critics label it a repackaging of facilities management which they consider to be low-grade, low-margin work. Whatever the truth, out-sourcing is providing a rapid growth area and one which a number of competitors have tried to emulate. However, it also raises profound questions over the management of consultancy firms, shifting them from their traditional role as external professionals into a wider position as providers of permanent services. All the firms are questioning their existing recruitment policies as they look for consultants with a broader range of skills and a greater ability to work with more discriminating clients. At the same time, there has been an explosion in the number and range of consultants in the marketplace. The giants of consulting continue to spawn spin-off boutiques with niche specialisms. Even more significantly, in the past two years prolonged recession has turfed many senior executives unexpectedly out of their jobs and large numbers of them have turned to consultancy in order to make ends meet. These two types of consultant pose severe problems for their larger brethren. Their cost base is lower and they are often willing to work for a much lower level of profitability. Their specialist skills may well also give them the edge on particular contracts. On the other hand, their expertise is limited, they cannot compete internationally and the range of skills they offer is far more restricted than that which is available in the larger firms. The quality of service they deliver may also be open to question. That raises a final point: the reputation of consultants. A survey of company directors in Scotland earlier this year suggested that management consultants were rated lowest of any profession for their contribution to business success, ability to understand the company's requirements and value for money. Figures such as these fuel the arguments of Mr Adrian Williams, president of the Institute of Management Consultants which has nearly 4,000 out of an estimated 18,000 consultants in the UK as members. Consultants have to pass an interview to gain entrance and members can be disciplined and dismissed. But while the Institute received 10 complaints last year about the conduct of consultants, eight of these could not be pursued because they referred to individuals who were not members of the institute. Some executives in the larger firms shake their heads sadly at the mention of greater involvement in professional associations. They see them as a threat to their own competitive position, a waste of time or simply something for the smaller consultants with whom they have little in common. But Mr Williams is persistent. He is working on a code of ethics and training modules which might be adopted by the firms. 'A body which is hard to get into and you can be chucked out of distinguishes a profession from merely an occupation,' he says.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Arts: Raw talent from a multi-ethnic world - A collection of ceramic sculptures BRITAIN'S evolving multi-cultural society is not always the subject of admiration, but one of its positive elements is shown in the current show at the Barbican in London. Various potters of different ethnic origin have added stunning ingredients from their own backgrounds and cultures to a ceramic exhibition of 30 contemporary British artists, which takes its title from anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss's 1964 book The Raw and the Cooked. The show tries to prove that Art is Art is Art. Here we go again: that old chestnut, art v. craft. In our visual culture, hierarchical differences are firmly established - in art schools and in government departments doling out money - enhancing wrong-headed perceptions of art status. The need to clear meaningless classification is now overdue. Thank you, Bernard Leach, for pushing the ceramic movement forward; thank you, Hans Coper, for veering off so magnificently into more sculptural forms. Now let us get on with the clay-moulders in Britain and stop slinking behind the rest of the world, decrying any clay work other than a teapot. If a person works with his/her hands - holding a paint brush, a chisel or a clay tool - and produces something of quality and originality, he or she is an artist. This is the third exhibition organised by The Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, surveying British visual culture. MOMA's brief to the curators, Alison Britton and Marina Margetts, ruled out any overtly functional work, looking rather for diverse clay sculpture beyond utility: clay is here being looked at as an art material. Britton (an esteemed potter) and Margetts (former editor of Crafts Magazine and writer) have sought out those doing interesting, innovative work today. The selection process naturally fashions themes, but the curators discarded this approach, not wanting to be restrictive. Preoccupations clearly emerge. Non-western cultures - Chinese, Malaysian, Nigerian and Indian backgrounds - lean on a different civilisation from ours. Lawson Oyekan's huge, hand-built pots evoke memories of African landscapes, the clay wrapping around itself as it might enclose a family group. Consider how differently Ewen Henderson's structures approach landscape and memory with his irregular lava-like mixtures reminiscent of the moon's surface. Pamela Leung, brought up in Hong Kong, has built a ceramic tiled wall mixing, as in a Chinese tale, reality and myth: a man's body with a bull's head rests on a table above a pot and a stringed instrument. Trupti Patel has stacked a tall pentagonal pillar with open niches, combining witticisms like feet and umbrellas with glimpses of thought-provoking figures. It is particularly interesting juxtaposed with sculptor Antony Gormley's 'Twenty-Four Hours', a dramatic march of 24 plodding figures in a single diagonal line, graduating from 2.3cm to 9m. Like Gormley, other British artists are also concerned with identity. Jacqueline Poncelet's large, undulating forms lean against the wall, their patterned, earth-coloured tattoos making them strangely approachable. 'The objects', she writes in the catalogue, are 'simultaneously ugly and beautiful according to our belief in the normal.' Tracey Heyes uses the Grecian-draped dress as a metaphor for repression; Grayson Perry makes confessional vases. Artists, perhaps with the exception of the untutored, 'outsider' artists, are grounded in tradition. This education is obvious in all the works, regardless of their sculptural forms. Exhibition designer John Pawson must have been nervous about breakage and/or theft. To install these three-dimensional pieces along an extended shelf against the wall is frustrating (a mirror might have helped), though somewhat mitigated by the fact that no glass separates the pot from the viewer. This is a show in which the interesting range and technical facility of the artists should awaken a sense of pride in an open-minded British audience. The Raw and the Cooked. Barbican Lower Gallery, London, until September 5, then to Oxford and Swansea.</p>

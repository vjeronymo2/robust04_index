			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 23 MUFFLER SHOPS IN STATE CITED BY EPA  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that 109 muffler shops  throughout the country are violating federal law by installing improper  after-market catalytic converters on cars.  </P> <P> The agency said that violation notices totaling more than $1 million in  proposed fines have been sent to the shops, including 23 in California. Of the  23 California shops, 15 were identified as Midas Muffler outlets.  </P> <P> Most of the violations involved the installation of what the EPA said were  "cheaper, less effective" two-way catalytic converters on vehicles requiring  three-way converters. Three-way converters control emissions of nitrogen oxide  in addition to hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.  </P> <P> Nitrogen oxide is a major ingredient in photochemical smog. It combines in  sunlight with hydrocarbons to form ozone.  </P> <P> However, Richard G. Kozlowski of the EPA's enforcement office said that the 109  shops represent only a small percentage of the estimated 250,000 muffler  outlets nationwide.  </P> <P> Kozlowski said three-way converters are clearly more expensive than two-way  converters. Retail prices on a three-way could run from $20 to $50 more. But,  Kozlowski said, shops will sell a cheaper two-way converter either to draw in  customers in a very competitive business or to "maximize their profits." In  other cases, he said, incorrect installations could result from honest  mistakes.  </P> <P> Owners of several muffler shops that were cited, as well as a senior executive  of Midas International in Chicago, denied that there was a profit incentive for  a shop to install a two-way instead of a three-way converter because the price  difference is small.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that is the case. All the franchisees I spoke to said it was a  misapplication. It was not a matter of cost," Russell Richards, senior vice  president of franchises at Midas International, said in a telephone interview  from Chicago.  </P> <P> Gordon F. Bowley, attorney for the California Midas Dealers Assn., said, "It's  not a fair characterization that it was something installed because it was  cheaper to install. It was an error from the manufacturers."  </P> <P> One Midas dealer, Albert Beattie of Palmdale, said, "I don't think any of the  shops that did it did it intentionally."  </P> <P> They added that all affected customers are being notified and that the correct  converters are being installed at no further cost.  </P> <P> An attorney for one of the converter manufacturers, Car Sound Exhaust System of  La Mirada, said there have been no errors in either the instructions or part  numbers for several years and that mistaken installations were probably the  fault of the shop employees.  </P> <P> Following is a list of California muffler shops that the EPA said were in  violation:  </P> <P> Mike's Muffler, 12222 Garvey Ave., El Monte; Bay Area Muffler, 1924 14th St.,  Santa Monica; Leo's Body, Radiator &amp; Muffler, 901 E.

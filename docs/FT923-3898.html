			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Jack Lang organiser of the government's yes campaign Mr Jack Lang, minister for education and culture and organiser of the government's yes campaign THE modish Mr Jack Lang, 53, star guest of a thousand Parisian dinner parties, has been given the task of bringing the arid details of the treaty alive to the public. His campaign style has been controversial and Yes campaigners on the right-wing have criticised him for not doing enough to bring heavyweight businessmen, economists and trade unionists into the centre stage. Mr Lang's main coup so far has been to conjure up a Comite National pour le Oui of 300 assorted celebrities. They include eight Nobel prize winners - none economists - Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion designer, the chef Paul Bocuse and Johnny Hallyday, the pop star. In fact, the committee is a good mixture of stars and intellectuals, but it has received sometimes sarcastic treatment in the French press, perhaps because of Mr Lang's own image as the embodiment of fashionable bourgeois Socialism, or la gauche caviar. He has added to his reputation for a weakness for gimmicks by distributing postcards proclaiming that Napoleon would have voted for Maastricht, and planning a pop concert to rally Yes voters two days before the referendum.</p>

Speaking in  Bonn yesterday, he said that the objective behind the visit was  to better express the Islamic Republic's stance on important  world issues and to follow up on relations between the two  countries.    Commenting on the topics discussed with the German  officials,  the vice chairman of the Majles Foreign Policy Commission  stressed: We held detailed discussions on matters concerning  Central Asian countries and ways for Tehran-Bonn cooperation in  that region, as well as the Islamic Republic's policy on Middle  Eastern problems and especially on the PLO-Israel accord.  Larijani said that another topic discussed during his talks  with the German officials was the issue of Salman Rushdie. He  said: We pointed out to Bonn officials that the support by  Western statesmen, and especially by Germany, for Rushdie is not  only an insult to millions of Muslims in the world but is also a  tension-creating element among the various faiths and harms  international peace, security, and understanding.</p>

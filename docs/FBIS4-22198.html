			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Kuzmuk, commander of </F> the 32d Army Corps, by Major Vasyl Sadovskyy, under the rubric  "First Interview in a New Post"; time and place not given: "`For  Many, Crimea Is Associated with the Southern Seashore...'"]    [Text] Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Kuzmuk was appointed  commander of the 32d Army Corps -- senior military commander in  the Republic of Crimea -- at the end of last year by order of  the Ministry of Defense. Our special correspondent in Simferopol  met with the commander.    [Sadovskyy] Oleksandr Ivanovich, what is your kith and kin,  as the saying goes? What road did you travel to reach your  present post?    [Kuzmuk] I come from a military family. I was born in 1954  in  Baku. I am a Ukrainian. My biography is the usual biography of  soldier. In 1975, I graduated from the Kharkiv Guards Higher  Tank Command School [Kharkovskoye gvardeyskoye vyssheye  tankovoye komandnoye uchilishche] and in 1983, from the Academy  of Armored Troops [Akademiya bronetankovykh voysk]. I commanded  a tank platoon, a company, a battalion, a separate tank  regiment, a division. I served in the Group of Soviet Forces in  Germany and in the Belarus, Moscow, Leningrad, Carpathian, and  Odessa military districts. I am married and have two children.  My son attends a medical institute, and my daughter is a  schoolgirl. My wife is a homemaker.    [Sadovskyy] At one time, service on the sunny peninsula was  considered a choice posting, for young lieutenant and  gray-haired general alike. Suffice it to say that at the  beginning of the seventies, your post was held by Dmitriy Yazov,  the next to last minister of defense of the USSR. Those days  have sunk into oblivion. Can it be said that only the chosen get  posted to Crimea today?    [Kuzmuk] For many, Crimea is associated only with the  Southern seashore. After coming here, I got to see the other  side of Crimea. You see, the formations and units of the corps  are stationed in difficult climatic and geographic conditions --  in alpine and steppe regions. From this standpoint, the sunny  peninsula looks quite different. As far as the prestige of  serving anywhere, including here, is concerned, my attitude is  that a soldier's job is the same in any region -- wherever his  Fatherland orders him to serve.    [Sadovskyy] The alpha and omega of the functioning of any  army is its combat training. How is this reflected today in the  life of the units and subunits of the army corps?    [Kuzmuk] I have been accustomed since my days as a  lieutenant  to resolve all matters connected with military discipline and  everyday life through combat training. This is the foundation on  which the military machine stands. If there is combat training,  there will be enthusiasm among the officers and the opportunity  to develop their abilities; personal interest in military  service will also appear among the soldiers. Experience shows  that when combat training is extensive and effective, all other  problems such as infringements of regulations [neustavshchina]  and desertion disappear. Speaking of the difficulties  encountered today in organizing combat training, I would like to  note that those commanders who regard combat training of  paramount importance manage to find the necessary resources and  time and utilize the optimum forms and methods. They conduct  lessons and exercises and do so in a comprehensive and  interesting manner. Such commanders include officers Botov and  Makavchuk. This year the training process has been organized and  is being conducted very intensively. We are devoting particular  attention to coordination between subunits.    [Sadovskyy] There is currently a great deal of talk at  various levels concerning the presence of units of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine on the peninsula. Some are not averse to  making political capital on this. What can you tell us on this  score?    [Kuzmuk] Yes, there has been an onslaught from some parts of  the mass media on our presence here, an onslaught that is purely  opportunistic. Moreover, they make use of an expression that is  new to us -- "demilitarization." Who has been militarizing the  Crimea and when? Or the phrase "Ukrainian military formations."  Matters concerning the performance of their duties by the  formations and units of the Armed Forces in the Crimea lie  within the jurisdiction of the commander-in-chief, the president  of the country, and the minister of defense. And there are  exactly as many troops here as are needed to defend Ukraine.    [Sadovskyy] All the same, by its very nature, this talk of  "reductions" offends the military...    [Kuzmuk] The allegations of some politicians that the army  is  not combat ready, that the antiaircraft defense system is not in  place, upset the officers who are laboring selflessly in this  difficult field. I believe that this is simply a tactical move  on the part of activists and politicians, who are trying to  distract the Crimeans from solving urgent problems. And nothing  more. You see, reasonable people are perfectly aware that the  cause of Crimea's economic difficulties is by no means due to  the presence of the troops.    [Sadovskyy] As we know, today anyone who feels like it dons  the mantle of champion of the rights and interests of the people  who wear shoulder boards. I would like to hear your opinion...    [Kuzmuk] Naturally, I am following the situation that is  developing around us. It is characteristic that most candidates  for the office of people's deputy broached military issues in  their programs. These issues included the same notion of  demilitarization I mentioned above (to be sure, now it has an  ecological slant) and military service by Crimean youths to be  performed only on the territory of the peninsula. Yet it is  quite obvious that these points are purely populist in nature.  The fact is that there are documents regarding how many people  to recruit and which units -- of the Black Sea Fleet and of the  land forces. Protocols have been signed on percentages. The  majority of politicians are dilettantes in military matters. For  example, what does it mean to insist that youths must serve in  Crimea? Crimea has no training subunits and units. Consequently,  the youths will learn neither a military nor a civilian  specialization. They will not become signal men, nor radar  specialists, nor operators. In short, they will work only at  unskilled jobs in the army or be doomed to serving in minor  posts. Neither their mothers, nor those who stand behind their  backs, know this. And so, naturally, serving near your parents  appears very appealing at first glance. Although, incidentally,  statistics show that this kind of service -- and we have bitter  experience -- has, as a rule, a negative effect. It means  unauthorized leaving of units, absences without leave, and other  violations.    [Sadovskyy] Do the Crimeans lead in this?    [Kuzmuk] Yes.    [Sadovskyy] Traditionally, the military maintained close  contacts with local authorities, enterprises, and institutions.  Naturally, it is no easy thing to become settled in one's new  position in a few months' time. Nevertheless, Oleksandr  Ivanovich, have you found there to be mutual understanding?    [Kuzmuk] It seems to me that the local authorities are more  concerned with politics than with the practical things that need  to be done. Many problems affecting everyday life have been set  aside for the time being. As to establishing contacts, I have  done so. For example, I have met privately with President Yuriy  Meshkov of Crimea. I asked Yuriy Aleksandrovich to take a look  with his own eyes at the situation and conditions of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine that are billeted in Crimea, with the eyes of  a president. I also offered that we solve social problems  jointly.    [Sadovskyy] What was Yuriy Meshkov's reaction?    [Kuzmuk] I believe that Yuriy Aleksandrovich met what I said  with understanding.    [Sadovskyy] And the last question: What worries you most as  the senior military commander in the Republic of Crimea?    [Kuzmuk] The situation that has arisen on the peninsula.  Nonetheless, this situation cannot affect the combat readiness  and normal activity of the troops to any degree. It is soldier's  duty to perform his main task -- to study and perfect his  professional skills so that he can defend his people in the  event of danger. No one has the right to interfere in our  performance of this task. It is also essential to give the  officers and warrant officers the opportunity to devote  themselves fully to their duties without having to glance over  their shoulders. We also need normal living conditions, normal  conditions for our families, a comfortable life. Everything else  will fall into place. We are fully aware of the hardships that  the people are suffering. But we are not asking anything extra  for ourselves. I would also want the Crimeans to view us not as  some sort of monster but as people who are honestly trying to do  their duty to their Fatherland.    [Sadovskyy] Thank you for this conversation.</p>

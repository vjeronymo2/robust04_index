			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary under the "Theme of the Week" rubric by observer </F> Aleksandr Golts: "The Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol Triangle Could  Become a Bermuda Triangle. For the Black Sea Fleet"]    [Text] If Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis,  were alive today he would surely have written a book about slips  of the tongue by politicians, their press secretaries, and  journalists who write about politics. Because these slips of  the tongue demonstrate in a very curious way a connection which  exists between problems in the subconscious of all those people  but which, aloud, is flatly denied. The recent Russo-Ukrainian  talks are a prime example of that.    Let me remind you that initially it was stated that the  meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian heads of government  would be dedicated to the situation in the Crimea, which has  deteriorated. However, it emerged that this was a slip of the  tongue. The two countries' delegations concentrated not on the  confrontation between the authorities in Kiev and the Crimea but  on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. As far as I am aware,  no one at an official level has made a direct link between the  problems of the fleet and mutual relations between Kiev and  Simferopol, which deteriorate periodically. But this slip of  the tongue makes you wonder. At the very least it sheds light  on why it has proved impossible for so long to reach final  agreement on the fate of the Black Sea Fleet.    A miracle has not happened now either. The Russo-Ukrainian  talks have become bogged down again. Once again on the problem  of the basing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian  Navy. Let us be frank here: Even though the technical details  of the forthcoming division are highly complex, that is not the  essential matter. The nub of the problem is the political will  of the contracting parties or rather the lack of it on the part  of one of them. The fate of the Black Sea Fleet at the end of  the 20th century is paradoxically reminiscent of the fate of  Poland at the end of the 18th century. Two hundred years ago  that country was also being constantly partitioned. The  slightest fluctuation in the balance of relations between the  major European powers aroused in them an irresistible desire to  engage in a trial of strength with one another by embarking on  yet another partition of Poland.    The paradox of the Black Sea Fleet is that the initiator of  each new attempt to divide it up is the country in the weaker  position, namely, Ukraine. A debtor forced to settle its  account with Russia using its most valuable assets -- its oil  and gas reserves -- finds consolation for its complexes in a  petty squabble over for a legacy which will not bring Ukraine  either economic or military-political advantage. The question  here is not so much one of Russo-Ukrainian relations as of the  internal political struggle in Ukraine.    In Kiev they forgot long ago, if they ever knew at all, that  the fleet was designed to safeguard the security of the state.  Just as they seem to have forgotten that it is dangerous to  turn the nuclear missiles stationed on Ukrainian territory into  a bargaining counter. But how else can you explain the fact  that whenever the situation in the Crimea hots up, politicians  close to the Ukrainian president suddenly begin alluding to the  possibility of Kiev's withdrawal from its international  commitments on these weapons. And this causes considerable  unease in the world.    The whole point of this is that in the minds of the  Ukrainian  politicians the fleet is first and foremost a symbol. Not just  of a naval presence but also of the right to Sevastopol. A city  which was created and which exists primarily as a naval base.  But Sevastopol, in the minds of many people in Ukraine, is the  key to the Crimea, which is so determinedly trying to break free  from Ukraine's embraces. But whenever the talk turns to the  symbols that are used in the political struggle, all rational  discussion becomes impossible.    That is because whenever attempts have been made to reach  agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, Ukrainian politicians on  returning to Kiev began interpreting those accords in such a way  that they effectively rendered them meaningless. The solution  to these riddles is simple. The Ukrainian president understands  perfectly well that if he concludes a more or less reasonable  agreement (which, in any event, will be a compromise) his  political opponents will not be slow to accuse him of betraying  the national interests. The fact that it proved impossible to  demonstrate even a semblance of agreement during the present  talks is evidence that on the eve of the presidential elections  Kiev is bound hand and foot.    Meanwhile, REUTER reports from Kiev that a Ukrainian  Government representative, who asked to remain nameless, has  stated that Ukraine "is going to ask the UN Security Council to  examine the question of the unlawful stationing of foreign  troops on its territory and demand their complete withdrawal."  "We mean the Black Sea Fleet, of course," that representative  stated.    The matter is further complicated by the fact that, by all  accounts, it is in Ukraine, not Russia, as many people feared,  that the military are beginning to play an autonomous political  role. The attempts at strong-arm actions against the Black Sea  Fleet followed by threatening statements from Ukrainian Defense  Ministry spokesmen -- all these things are in conflict with  President Kravchuk's official line.    It must also be said honestly that despite its partner's  constantly improper conduct, Moscow is quite limited in the ways  that it can exert pressure. Suggestions about "switching off"  the oil and gas supply in retaliation should be regarded as an  emotional response. After all, a sharp worsening of the  domestic political situation in Ukraine and an increased threat  of the disintegration of Ukraine are certainly not in Russia's  interests. The balanced stance adopted by Moscow during the  present crisis in the Crimea confirms that. Incidentally, it is  obvious that by no means everyone in Simferopol realizes that  the "war of nerves" that nearly began accompanied by overtly  provocative rumors about "tank columns" heading toward  Sevastopol could have extremely regrettable consequences.    By all accounts Russia is going to have to negotiate  patiently and consistently without letting itself be sidetracked  either by Kiev's improvizations or the appeals of extremists,  and such people exist in the Crimea, too. It remains to be  hoped that those people who would like to turn the fleet into a  pawn in a political game will remember that we are talking here  about a major naval grouping equipped with the most modern  weapons. After all, during the incident in Odessa the bolts of  the Kalashnikovs were already being released.... Let us hope  that in the event of further confrontation the  Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol triangle (where only Moscow is  demonstrating a balanced approach) does not become a Bermuda  Triangle for the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

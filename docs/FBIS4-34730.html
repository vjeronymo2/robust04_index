			<p>BFN     [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used the  expression "one can drink milk without owning a cow" in his  proposal for an outlet to the Pacific Ocean without the need for  Bolivia to recover ownership of the territory it lost to Chile.  Opposition congressmen yesterday reported that Foreign Minister  Antonio Aranibar will be summoned to Congress to explain, in a  secret session, the content and scope of the president's  proposal.    Sanchez de Lozada's proposal in Colombia has prompted  different reactions within the Bolivian opposition; while some  congressmen said he is giving up a century old national desire  for a "sovereign outlet to the sea," others called the proposal  an "interesting initiative."    The most adamant opponents of that proposal are Nationalist  Democratic Action leader Jorge Landivar and Democratic Socialism  Alternative Deputy Jerjes Justiniano.    Landivar said Sanchez de Lozada has been hasty in his  attempt  to solve the maritime issue, adding that the president's  proposal is some sort of a "tenancy agreement" because although  Bolivia will have an outlet to the sea, it will be through a  foreign territory.    Justiniano said that we cannot give up a sovereign corridor  to the sea because this is the right of all Bolivians and  because it implies "treason to the fatherland."</p>

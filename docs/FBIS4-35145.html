			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 18 Jun (DPA) -- The United States has  reinforced its combat units at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base,  located 1,000 km east of Havana, a top military officer of the  Cuban Armed Forces reported today.    "For several days, we have noticed the reinforcing of the  military enclave with military personnel and equipment," said  Division General Ramon Espinosa, Army chief in the eastern part  of the country.    In a statement made to PRENSA LATINA after visiting several  military units in the region, Gen. Espinosa said those movements  could be part of a possible U.S. military intervention in Haiti.  "Such an action would increase tensions in the Caribbean area,"  Gen. Espinosa said, adding that the Cuban Armed Forces should be  alert and prepared for any eventuality.    "The Cuban Army in the eastern region is at full combat  readiness to quickly and effectively repel any military action  from the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base," Gen. Espinosa stressed.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Banesto net profits slide 62% BANESTO, one of Spain's 'big six' commercial banks, yesterday announced a 62 per cent fall, to Pta18.3bn (Dollars 150m), in net group profits for 1992, following an erosion of extraordinary earnings and increased provisions. The figures include Banesto's industrial holding group, Corporacion Banesto. Extraordinary earnings, which Banesto usually generates through disposals, fell from Pta 51.6bn to an extraordinary loss of Pta 1.56bn. The group also increased provisions by 19 per cent to Pta97.5bn. The results were largely expected in the markets, which, despite some criticism of Banesto's rush for retail business in the last two years, have also expressed satisfaction with the group's conservative provisioning as a deepening recession in Spain pushes bad debts to record levels. Even the fall in extraordinary earnings invites conflicting responses. Some analysts believe the bank should reduce its traditional reliance on non-core income. Others believe the income Banesto is able to generate from sales of its banking or industrial assets is vital to the bank maintaining its profile among foreign investors. The group's operating margin grew by 14 per cent to Pta228.4bn and it said that total assets had increased by 5.41 per cent to Pta6,960bn. The group held the rise in operating costs to under 8 per cent. The results come as Banesto is poised to make a Dollars 400m rights issue soon.</p>

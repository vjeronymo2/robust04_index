			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Delta Air Lines and AT&amp;T form IT joint venture Delta Air Lines, the third-biggest US airline, is contracting out Dollars 2.8bn worth of information technology work over the next 10 years to a joint venture it has formed with AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, part of US telecommunications group AT&amp;T. The so-far unnamed venture will handle most of Delta's internal computing requirements, apart from its reservation systems. These will be transferred to Worldspan, a computer reservation system jointly owned by three US airlines. Delta and AT&amp;T said the company would also market its computing and communications services to other companies in the travel and transport industries. Delta said it was transferring the work as a cost-cutting measure. lt estimated the joint venture would save it Dollars 400m over the next 10 years by developing innovations that would improve the performance of its business units and reduce annual operating costs. Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, said the joint venture was a 'strategic initiative designed to improve our competitiveness, and it will play a key role in Delta's drive to return to sustained profitability'. Earlier this year, Delta announced a drastic restructuring plan to cut Dollars 2bn a year from operating costs, in an attempt to overcome competition from low-cost US carriers such as Southwest Airlines. Since then, it has unveiled measures which take it some way towards a targeted cut of between 12,000 and 15,000 jobs from a workforce of 73,000 in the next three years. In the latest move, up to 1,200 Delta employees will transfer to the joint venture with AT&amp;T. The new company, to be based in Atlanta, Georgia, will be owned equally by Delta and AT&amp;T. A chief executive is expected to be named later this year. AT&amp;T said the venture represented a 'major win' in the growing market for outsourcing and professional services.</p>

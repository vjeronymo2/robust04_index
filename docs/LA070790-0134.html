			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TUSTIN MAY REZONE AREA FOR HIGHER DENSITY  </P> <P> The Planning Commission on Monday will consider rezoning a recently annexed  strip of residential property to allow higher density.  </P> <P> When the 2.3 acres at Holt and Warren avenues was annexed in 1989, some North  Tustin residents opposed it, predicting that Tustin would rezone it to allow  multifamily units instead of the five single family homes that are there now.  </P> <P> Some of those same people oppose the rezoning, and the city's Planning  Department has received several letters and phone calls about the issue.  </P> <P> "This will be a test case as to Tustin's philosophy on (rezoning) as far as  residential property goes," said one of the opponents, Bill Weber, president of  the Foothill Communities Assn.  </P> <P> The city planning staff has recommended denial of the zoning change, which  would require an amendment to the General Plan. In a report to the Planning  Commission, staff members wrote that reclassifying the property is inconsistent  with the General Plan and could affect future proposals to annex North Tustin  properties.  </P></p>

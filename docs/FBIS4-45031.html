			<p>CSO     [Text] During the First Five-Year Plan, which was extended  for one year, the Ahvaz Steel Company, the Mobarakeh Steel  Complex, and the Kavian Steel Company lost $1.3 billion, $688  million, and $535 million, respectively.    The newspaper SALAM, which reported this in its 7 Khordad  (23  May) issue, noted that the Iran Accounting Court confirmed these  figures.    The expert from the Majles Accounting Court, Budget and  Financial Affairs Commission said that the steel factories are  not profitable and do not give an appropriate return. In  addition to the fact that the domestic steel market has been  saturated, international competition is very difficult for  Iran's steel and thus the Islamic Republic of Iran has not been  successful exporting its products. He cited the high finished  price of Iran's steel as one of the reasons for its lack of  export success.    Recently the executive director of the Mobarakeh Steel  Complex, in an interview with the newspaper RESALAT, called  himself "God's replacement on earth" and said that with regard  to his specialty, in one sense his position is higher than that  of the vice regent and even the Prophet!</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Photographer Jerry Burchfield's Cibachrome mural-sized prints are enigmatic  images that gently take on most of the issues and mind bending conundrums of  modern society. Mildly political, they capture some of the disquiet of the  modern psyche by offering an impression of the fear of death that haunts  society within issues of abortion, ecology and random shootings.  </P> <P> Burchfield's images are multi-paneled prints that result when the artist places  various objects on photosensitized paper and outlines them with light. As  brilliantly colored photograms, they weave poetic meaning from the visual clues  of the odds and ends he assembles. Working like a phantom assemblage artist,  Burchfield makes symbols that occasionally seem trite or get overly didactic --  as in the pictorial cycle of obsolescence in "The User/Interium Final." More  evocative is the tension created by the shooting range target in the tree  shaped crescents of "Abolishing Moonlight." An interesting use of language in  "Seven Progressive Steps," a light drawing with cut out letter phrases,  indicates the strength of the artist's feel for ambiguous threat. It's a  promising direction. (Merging One Gallery, 1547 6th St., to Nov. 29.) SUVAN  GEER  </P></p>

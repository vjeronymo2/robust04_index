			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers 4.2% on short-covering move SHARE prices rose sharply on short-covering as speculators detected a shift in market sentiment. The Nikkei average advanced 4.2 per cent, regaining the 15,000 level for the first time in eight trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 617.02 ahead at 15,267.76, after opening at the day's low of 14,677.64 and registering a high in the afternoon of 15,546.47. Volume rose to 300m shares from 226m, reaching 300m for the first time since July 10. Advances led declines by 950 to 66, with 80 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks strengthened 46.65 to 1,163.77. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained just 0.87 to 967.17. Analysts were cautiously optimistic. 'There seems to have been a shift in market psychology,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. Investors were also encouraged by comments from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, indicating full support for the Finance Ministry's emergency package for the banking system. However, individual investors remained on the sidelines, and only limited buying from institutions was noted. Leading gainers were companies faced with mounting debt and declining cash flow. Nippon Housing Loan continued to head the actives list and rose by its daily limit of Y50 to Y241. Daikyo, the troubled condominium developer, jumped Y90 to Y640. 'It does not say too much for the market when we see garbage floating to the top,' said one analyst. However, blue chips were also strong, led by Sony, which surged Y340 to Y3,880, and Pioneer Electronic, up Y170 at Y2,830. Pessimism ahead of the two companies' quarterly earnings, announced late on Wednesday, had prompted selling. In the event, the figures reported by the companies were better than expected and scotched earlier rumours of downward revisions for the whole year. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y15,000 to Y493,000 on short-covering. Green Cross, the pharmaceutical group, appreciated Y100 to Y880 on hopes for its new Aids drug. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 696.20 to 16,424.36 in volume of 19.7m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, put on Y300 to Y9,950. Roundup TOKYO'S rebound failed to encourage the Pacific Rim. AUSTRALIA lost ground and brokers said there was an ADollars 35m sell portfolio overhanging the market. The All Ordinaries index declined 8.0 to 1,553.6 in turnover of ADollars 263.2m. Trading was also dominated by BHP's offer to buy a 32 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing at the equivalent of ADollars 2.39 a share. Foster's climbed 7 cents to ADollars 1.80 in volume of ADollars 10.3m shares, but BHP receded 16 cents to ADollars 13 with 3.4m shares traded. ANZ slipped 9 cents to ADollars 3.12 on fears about asset writedowns and the effects of the Bombay broking scandal. HONG KONG fell on heavy selling by overseas institutions but closed off the day's lows on late bargain-hunting. The Hang Seng index closed 138.83, or 2.47 per cent, down at 5,481.61, but above the day's worst level of 5,377.14. Turnover rose to HKDollars 3.86bn from HKDollars 2.02bn. One of the most active stocks was Hutchison Whampoa which fell 20 cents to HKDollars 15.10. SEOUL fell on rumours that ruling party members had objected to parts of a proposed government bail-out for the stock market. The composite index lost 11.39 to 467.70. There was also a negative reaction to the government's decision to award the nation's second mobile telephone licence to the Sunkyong Group, a company with close ties to President Roh Tae-woo. MANILA's decline reflected profit-taking after last week's rally on an infusion of new money from foreign funds. The composite index fell 26.77 to 1,490.57. TAIWAN ended mixed after bargain hunting, with the weighted index 0.87 easier at a 19-month low of 3,733.06. Turnover rose to TDollars 22.4bn from TDollars 17.84bn. The construction sector fell a further 2.1 per cent. SINGAPORE saw the Straits Times Industrial index close 11.48 higher at 1,323.59 after a volatile session. Volume came to 53.39m shares, after 69.56m. KUALA LUMPUR rallied further after its recent sell-off, but closed off the day's highs on profit-taking and renewed selling. The KLSE composite index added 4.20 at 564.21. NEW ZEALAND drifted off in the afternoon, led by further weakness in Fletcher Challenge (FCL). The NZSE-40 index shed 7.11 to 1,491.06. FCL fell another 8 cents to NZDollars 2.50 after reporting a maiden loss and a NZDollars 3.5bn asset sale programme on Wednesday.</p>

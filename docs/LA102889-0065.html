			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIALS URGE DRUG DESIGNATION FOR COUNTY  </P> <P> About 25 area officials Friday joined Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) in  calling on President Bush and national drug czar William J. Bennett to give Los  Angeles County a greater share of money going to local jurisdictions under  Bush's drug-fighting plan.  </P> <P> If the Administration fails to designate Los Angeles County as a  "high-intensity drug trafficking area" it may get less money than other cities  around the country, Dymally and the local officials said at a news conference  the congressman organized at Compton City Hall.  </P> <P> Congressional representatives, police chiefs, county supervisors and other  officials have been lobbying Bush and Bennett to grant Los Angeles the  designation, arguing that it has become the largest drug importing and  distribution center in the United States and has never gotten its fair share of  federal drug enforcement dollars. So far, the administration has not announced  which cities will get the designation, which brings with it extra drug-fighting  funds.  </P> <P> Dymally and other House Democrats also have charged that the state of  California will get only $52 million under Bush's drug plan but that federal  budget cuts in other areas such as juvenile justice will cost the state more  than $200 million this year.  </P></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Clinton news awaited DRUG STOCKS provided the principal support for the London market yesterday. They bounced higher on the eve of publication of President Clinton's health reform plan, reflecting the view that it is 'worse to travel than to arrive'. They were also helped by a stronger US dollar. The health reforms were originally set to be published in May and continual delays have given opportunities for endless rumours and scare stories. An analyst said that since the package was leaked to the Wall Street Journal 10 days ago, 150 more changes had been introduced. It could be 1995 before any final version is enacted. One analyst said drug stocks could now benefit as the focus of criticism shifted to other areas, such as North American Free Trade. However, international traders, surprised at a rush of late buying, said most investors now held the stocks, reforms were unlikely to add to the wealth of pre-release information, and there could be a period of consolidation. Glaxo rose 11 to 641p and Wellcome added 6 at 718p. SmithKline Beecham was further helped by talk that a decision had been made not to withdraw SmithKline Units from the FT-SE 100 Index as proposed. Although the London Stock Exchange said nothing would be decided until the FT-SE Actuaries Indices Steering Committee met on October 6, SmithKline 'A' shares advanced 18 to 425p and the Units 19 to 383p. UK tobacco companies traded lower on speculation that a 'sin tax' included in the Clinton health plan could hit cigarettes harder than expected. Rothmans International lost 9 to 649p and BAT Industries 2 to 462p on reports that US congress members now expect a tax of Dollars 1 a pack, against earlier tax forecasts of 50 to 75 cents a packet.</p>

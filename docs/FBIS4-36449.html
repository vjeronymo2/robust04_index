			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (INA) -- Iraq has protested to the Arab  League General Secretariat against the continued facilities  provided by the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to U.S.,  British, and French aircraft violating Iraq's airspace, noting  that this poses a serious threat to Iraq's security and  sovereignty.    In a letter addressed to Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Iraq's permanent representative said these  aircraft continued their violation of Iraqi airspace during the  period 24-31 May. They carried out 352 sorties flying from  their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.    Iraq's representative asked that the letter be circulated,  along with a list detailing the violations, to the Arab member  states to acquaint them with these regrettable facts.</p>

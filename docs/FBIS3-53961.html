Mr. Peres says that to bridge  these gaps, Israel is prepared to view new proposals, provided  they are in line with Israel's security concepts.    The foreign minister made these remarks to our political  correspondent Shlomo Raz prior to his departure for Oslo, where  he will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  PLO head Yasir 'Arafat and attend the funeral of Norwegian  Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst.</p>

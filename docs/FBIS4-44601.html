			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Feature" by reporter Lin Ying [2651 7751]] </F>   [Excerpts] Hong Kong, 18 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) --  Since Zhejiang's Qinshan nuclear power plant and Guangdong's  Daya Bay nuclear power plant went into operation, the Beijing  authorities have started preparations for more nuclear plants to  be built across the country by the end of this century and early  next century so as to alleviate the country's energy shortage.  It has been learned that while Zhejiang and Guangdong are  preparing to build their second nuclear power plants, Fujian,  Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Hainan, and some other  provinces also are making preliminary preparations for building  their own nuclear power plants. Moreover, provinces like Jilin,  Sichuan, and Heilongjiang are already conducting feasibility  studies for nuclear energy development. As the country has only  limited construction funds, the departments concerned are  expected to invite overseas investment and foreign funds to help  with the country's nuclear development.    Slow energy development and a 20-plus percent shortage of  electrical energy supply in the country has impeded the  nationwide economic growth to some extent. In order to meet the  growing demand for electrical energy and to guarantee a  sufficient electrical energy supply across the country, apart  from building more thermal power and hydropower stations, the  authorities also are determined to speed up the country's  nuclear energy development, as this causes less pollution.    It has been learned that since the two 900MW units installed  at Daya Bay went into operation, Guangdong has decided to build  its second nuclear power station in Lingao, north of Daya Bay,  and a third one in Yangjiang. Construction of the Lingao and  Yangjiang nuclear power plants is scheduled to be completed  around the year 2002. The two nuclear power plants are to have  four and six generating sets, respectively. By the year 2002,  Guangdong's three nuclear power plants are expected to have a  combined installed capacity of 10 million kWh, thus basically  meeting the province's demand for electrical energy.    In Zhejiang, a 300MW generator installed at Qinshan during  the first-phase construction has gone into operation. Now, two  other 600MW generating sets are being installed as well as  second-phase construction at the Qinshan nuclear power plant has  begun. The two new generating sets are scheduled to go into  operation in 1996. Zhejiang also has decided to build two  2000MW nuclear power plants along its coast, in Sanmen Bay and  Leqing, respectively. They are scheduled to go into operation  by the turn of the century.    Moreover, a number of provinces with conditions for nuclear  energy development are also preparing to build nuclear plants.  Fujian is planning to build a nuclear plant in Shanqian  township, Huian County, at the mouth of Quanzhou Bay. The plant  will have six 900MW generating sets, with a combined installed  capacity of 5.4 million kWh when its three-phase construction is  completed. The plant will have generating sets when its  first-phase construction is completed early in the next century.    Jiangxi also has decided to build a 3600MW nuclear plant at  Maoziding Mountain in Guze County, Jiujiang City. Hainan  Province is seeking a site on which to build a nuclear power  plant, and is conducting feasibility studies regarding the  first-phase construction of a 300MW generating set. Liaoning  Province has decided to build a 1000MW nuclear plant in  Wentuozi. Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces are conducting  feasibility studies for building nuclear power plants.    It has been learned that apart from inviting urgently needed  funds for its nuclear development from some foreign countries  and regions, the country still will try to raise most of the  funds it needs for this purpose in cooperation with the local  departments concerned. This is why the Beijing authorities  have decided to set up a rotating fund mechanism for nuclear  development to guarantee a continued supply of funds for the  country's nuclear power development. Minister of Power Industry  Shi Dazhen pointed out that under the proposed rotation  mechanism for nuclear development, after a nuclear power plant  is built and goes into operation, the State will not try to  collect its profits. Instead, the plant's profits will be used  to build other nuclear power plants so that more such plants can  be built across the country. The nuclear power plant is allowed  to divert as much as 2.3 billion yuan of profits to other  nuclear plants under construction so that more provinces will be  able to build nuclear power plants.    Guangdong's Daya Bay nuclear power plant has been installed  with French advanced pressurized-water reactors. In the future,  the country is likely to continue purchasing French equipment  for its nuclear plants, but as the Shanghai-made nuclear  reactors installed at Qinshan have proven to be perfectly  reliable and efficient, the country is more likely to use more  domestically manufactured equipment. As a result, Shanghai  certainly will become the country's nuclear equipment supply  base.</p>

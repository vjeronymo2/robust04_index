			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Again More Working Short Hours at </F> Mercedes-Benz"]    [Text] Stuttgart -- In order to ease the pressure caused  by excessive personnel, Mercedes-Benz AG, Stuttgart, wants to  use the instrument of working short hours more intensively again.    This was stated by Heiner Tropitzsch, the company's  personnel  chief, in an interview with STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN. Tropitzsch  justified the change of course toward working short hours  instead of reducing work time by referring to the new framework  wage contract concluded in March. In this contract it was  agreed that wages and salaries may be reduced in line with work  time only if this applies to the entire company.    As a result, special work-time regulations for the  individual  factories have become very expensive compared with working short  hours, Tropitzsch said. The industrial vehicle sector of the  Stuttgart company is suffering very much, while business with  passenger cars is improving.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In furtherance of the ongoing Liberian peace  process, a delegation from the Transitional Legislative Assembly  has arrived in Gbarnga. The latest move comes in the wake of  recent pronouncements by the U.S. Government to cut off all aids  and diplomatic efforts for peace in the Liberian crisis because  of continuing setbacks in the full implementation of the peace  accord.    The Transitional Legislative Assembly subcommittee on  disarmament headed by Dusty Wolokolie, and the committee on  reconciliation, headed by former Margibi County representative  under the defunct NDPL [National Democratic Party of Liberia]  government, David Menyongai, are presently in Gbarnga holding  talks with the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front  of Liberia] in Gbarnga.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / The FT Interview: Softly, softly along Wall Street - Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC Mr Arthur Levitt has a reputation for not rocking the boat. As head for the past year of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the main investment regulator in the US, the 64-year-old Mr Levitt has chosen not to force extra regulations on the US investment industry. Instead, he has sought an accommodation with dealers, managers and underwriters. But that does not stop him taking a swipe at the fastest-growing part of the US stockbroking industry, the 'soft commission' business. Critics claim soft commission arrangements are a form of legalised corruption: an institutional investor agrees to channel a portion of his securities trading through a particular stockbroker in return for services, such as the provision of a Reuters screen. The value of commissions with such strings attached exceeds Dollars 1bn a year. The practice (known in the US as 'soft dollars') should be banned, Mr Levitt says. 'It doesn't feel right, smell right or taste right.' He admits such arrangements have been part of business life 'since the days of Hadrian'. But that does not make him feel any easier about them. 'Would I like to do away with soft dollars? Yes. Can I? I don't know.' For now, he is in the early stages of launching a review of the area. If his determination to take action against soft commissions is followed through, he will face considerable opposition from those who benefit from them: principally the big investment houses. To provoke such a confrontation would be uncharacteristic for an SEC chairman who has otherwise been a consummate diplomat, striving to please both his constituencies: Wall Street and the politicians on Capitol Hill, to whom he is answerable. Take his approach to the markets for derivatives, the complex instruments whose value is based in part on some underlying financial market. The scale of trading in derivatives, the increasing complexity of some of the instruments and their potentially destabilising effect on other financial markets have worried many in Washington. Some congressman fear a repeat of the 1980s savings and loan crisis, when deregulation led to the collapse of many of the country's thrift institutions at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of more than Dollars 100bn. Yet Mr Levitt has argued against legislation to extend his agency's powers in this area. Securities firms, which are regulated by the SEC, run their derivatives businesses through subsidiaries which are outside the scope of the agency's powers. Instead, Mr Levitt began negotiations last month with the six largest derivatives dealers on Wall Street - CS First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers - to create a set of voluntary standards that would govern firms' activities in the market. 'I have a general resistance to asking for legislation at this point, because it will take time to get legislation, and you cannot be certain what the legislation might call for. The process is cumbersome and unpredictable,' he says. His approach is causing concern among some legislators because voluntary codes lack teeth. Mr Levitt counters that such arrangements have been effective before: he recently secured a voluntary agreement among underwriters of municipal bonds not to make donations to local politicians, a practice that had led to allegations of bribery. But that agreement is only temporary, and is to be enshrined in new regulations by the relevant self-regulatory body. Mr Levitt appears anxious not to provoke a confrontation over the issue of derivatives. Legislation may be needed in due course to provide a back-stop to a voluntary approach, he says. He also points out that the SEC is putting pressure on the investment industry to control the risks involved with derivatives by other means. Last month Mr Levitt warned that the use of such 'exotic' financial products was inappropriate for some supposedly low-risk mutual funds (similar to unit trusts in the UK). He was concerned that complex financial instruments were being used without being fully understood. He urged such funds to sell their holdings of risky derivatives. To date, the writing of a stiff letter has been as far as the SEC chairman has been prepared to go. He summarises his approach by saying: 'I've tried to use consensus rather than confrontation. I believe that, in running any institution, it's a good idea to change its style every four or five years. If the style of my predecessor (Mr Richard Breeden) was more confrontational, mine is more consensual.' His concern about mutual funds' involvement with derivatives highlights another priority Mr Levitt has set himself: better protection of the small investor. 'I have moved the SEC towards an investor-consumer bias and away from an institutional bias,' he says. One example of his efforts to protect consumers was his response to criticism that mutual fund managers faced a conflict of interest when dealing in shares they owned personally. Mr Levitt believed there was a danger of undermining individual investors' confidence in the fund industry. Earlier this year, he urged the Investment Company Institute, a trade association for US mutual funds, to introduce a code of practice on the subject. While he puts investor protection at the top of his agenda, Mr Levitt has been busy encouraging more foreign companies to raise money on US stock exchanges. He has visited Germany twice this year for that purpose. A year ago, when Daimler Benz became the first German company to list on the New York Stock Exchange, it seemed a watershed. But no further listings have followed. Mr Levitt believes more will come soon. 'I think that, five years from now, this period will be looked back upon as an aberration. We've thrown a lot of effort into this. It's a major initiative for me.' As always, Mr Levitt is keen to be obliging and to examine aspects of listing rules that might prove offputting to foreign companies. The SEC's new policy, he says, has been 'to seek out those areas that are either poorly understood (by foreign companies), or confrontational, and see whether they're fundamental to my goal of protecting American investors. If they're not fundamental to that, I'll seek an accommodation.' That does not mean, though, that the SEC is about to make big changes to help foreign companies. On issues such as whether non-US companies should be forced to adhere to US accounting and disclosure rules, Mr Levitt does not budge. When head of the American Stock Exchange, Mr Levitt argued for the relaxation of regulations to make it easier for foreign companies to tap US markets. Now, he says, his views have changed: 'Probably nothing did that more for me than Daimler. When they listed, if they had used German (accounting) standards they would have shown earnings that were a multiple of Chrysler's, but using US standards . . . they showed a loss. It's impossible for us to justify to US companies or US investors that inconsistency.' Despite this, the SEC chairman insists that promoting US markets internationally remains one of his main priorities. When points of great importance are not involved, his style has been flexible: procedures for admitting foreign companies have been streamlined, for instance. 'I'm absolutely committed not to lose America's pre-eminence in this area, and I'll do whatever I have to do to accomplish that.'</p>

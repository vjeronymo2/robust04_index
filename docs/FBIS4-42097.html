			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio by </F> Giovanni Valentini; place and date not given: "Senate Will Work  the British Way"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Valentini] Mr.  Scognamiglio, you were elected by the Senate by a single vote,  and the government obtained its confidence vote by a margin of  two. Can the majority proceed in this way?    [Scognamiglio] If the climate of suspense were to remain the  same, it would become so intolerable as to cause a virtual  paralysis. But I must admit that the parliamentary opposition  has already displayed the desire to allow the legislature to  proceed normally, showing a praiseworthy sense of responsibility.    [Valentini] Do you trust their words?    [Scognamiglio] Apart from their words, it seems to me that  the opposition wants to allow this government -- the only  possible one at present -- to start its work and to show whether  it is capable of achieving the changes that the country expects.  And this, without hindering its activity with quibbles,  filibustering, or sabotage. At least, this is my impression.    [Valentini] Perhaps it is also a hope.    [Scognamiglio] Yes, both a hope and a forecast.    [Valentini] In the institutional context, how do you intend  to ensure governability in the Senate under such conditions?    [Scognamiglio] First, I want to stress something that has  never happened before, namely, the existence of a different  majority in the two houses. This is a very new situation, which  raises all kinds of legitimate questions. But it is also a  situation of extraordinary openness and stability.    [Valentini] Why do you say that?    [Scognamiglio] Because it is a situation that influences and  binds the majority to observance of the ground rules. The need  to take account of the arguments of the minority is not only an  ethical matter but has become a political one too.    [Valentini] Do you not think that it would have been much  better, for this very reason, to involve the opposition at the  parliamentary level -- from the election of the speaker to the  election of the committee chairmen?    [Scognamiglio] Perhaps it all happened rather by accident.  Be that as it may, there is a high degree of innovation  compared to the past: The majority's policy is to create a  majority without negotiating. Previously, however, the dividing  lines were never clear.    [Valentini] What if the experiment fails?    [Scognamiglio] Then we would probably return to the  compromises of the old system. But in fact this is the solution  that provides the most guarantees for the opposition, insofar as  its strength can exercise an external influence, a curb, in  order to make the government's action more cautious.    [Valentini] Do you mean that there will be a continuation of  the "votes market," as happened in the Senate vote of confidence  in the government?    [Scognamiglio] Actually, I saw no such market. Indeed, the  speeches announcing the votes were extremely consistent with  principled positions. The majority presented the reasons why it  supported the government, and the opposition, those why it was  voting against. And a group of senators, including Mr. Cossiga,  announced that they did not intend to hinder the majority's  right to form a government; some of them therefore voted in  favor, while others abstained. It all happened out in the open.  This itself is something extremely new.    [Valentini] However, the anomalous situation whereby there  are 11 life senators in the Senate was decisive...    [Scognamiglio] No, numerically, their votes were not  decisive: Three voted in favor, two against, two more abstained,  and the rest were absent. Everyone can form their own opinion  regarding the existence of life senators. Personally, I  consider it appropriate for the republic to recognize with such  a senior office citizens who have shown special merits, and I do  not consider it a negligible matter that such figures as  Cossiga, Spadolini, or De Martino, to name just a few, ensure  the continuity of a traditional memory.    [Valentini] Yes, but the Constitution provides for five life  senators.    [Scognamiglio] Frankly, I dislike the fact that some people  have decided to debate the matter right now, in connection with  the vote of confidence in the government. It does not show good  taste.    [Valentini] Some people questioned it long ago, when  President Cossiga extended the numbers....    [Scognamiglio] Then the question may have been a legitimate  one. Not now.    [Valentini] The progressive forces' leader in the Senate,  Cesare Salvi, has announced a "British-style" opposition. What  do you think of that statement?    [Scognamiglio] Coming from Salvi, and from Napolitano in the  lower house, it shows that some opposition representatives have  understood the new political and institutional situation  perfectly. And this could rightly lead to greater advantages for  everyone.    [Valentini] Berlusconi said that, whatever happens, the  majority will not change along the way. Are you not afraid that  the weakness of the present majority in the Senate could prompt  recourse to an early election?    [Scognamiglio] Judging from the present situation, I would  say not. If the political situation changes, it could happen.  Be that as it may, it would certainly not be useful to the  majority now. And perhaps not to the opposition either.    [Valentini] What do you think the Senate's role should be in  a new constituent period? Will it become the Chamber of the  Regions?    [Scognamiglio] Perfect bicameralism is not a frequent model  in Western democracies. When the entire constitutional  architecture changes, so too must the duties of the two houses.  At the moment, however, it is too early to say how: first, the  rules, then the roles.    [Valentini] As a liberal economist, what is your opinion  regarding the conflict of interests between Berlusconi the  businessman and the government leader?    [Scognamiglio] Let us be realistic. There are some pros and  some cons. The cons stem from the fact that the conflict is  obvious to everyone. Berlusconi's economic interests are so  open as to provide a guarantee of openness against any abuses.  If, for instance, his government were to adopt any measures  against RAI [state radio and television], we could all draw  certain conclusions.    [Valentini] In other words, as far as you are concerned, it  is an insoluble problem. So what is the point of the three  "wise men" appointed by Berlusconi himself?    [Scognamiglio] Whether there is a solution, I do not know.  The three "wise men" correspond to a common law juridical  institution designed to separate the physical person from his  property. They, if anyone, will suggest a solution.    [Valentini] Let us consider RAI: What do you intend to do,  as Senate speaker, to safeguard this public service against  private television?    [Scognamiglio] The present law, approved in a different  political situation, makes the speakers of the two houses  responsible for appointing the board of directors, not for any  management or monitoring duties. If the law remains as it is,  when the time comes we will appoint new board members in  consultation with the speaker of the lower house. We cannot and  must not do anything else.    [Valentini] What did you mean by your reference to "a  different political situation?" Do you think that law should be  changed now?    [Scognamiglio] The law is obviously obsolete, anachronistic.  It might have made sense under previous conditions. But now the  two speakers have been elected by a majority, so that form of  guarantee no longer exists. In the case of a limited company,  it is an entirely atypical juridical formula.    [Valentini] Who do you think should appoint the RAI board?    [Scognamiglio] There could be a hundred different solutions.  The decision lies with the parliamentary majority. Be that as  it may, in order to ensure the independence of television news,  it is also necessary to protect the opposition with a view to  mutual rotation.    [Valentini] As the state's second most senior authority, are  you not afraid that the presence of post-Fascist ministers in  the government could cause Italy's international isolation?    [Scognamiglio] During the period between the end of the  previous legislature and the formation of the new government  there was indeed such a danger. Especially from a distance, it  was difficult to understand what was new about the National  Alliance. But now that the government has been formed and the  foreign minister has been able to provide ample reassurances to  all our partners, the controversy is dying down.    [Valentini] And yet foreign investors are pulling out of the  Italian stock market, and some countries are even threatening a  trade boycott against our goods....    [Scognamiglio] Foreign investors have withdrawn because they  have already made money; and in any case they will return, as  soon as the privatization process takes place. As for a  boycott, it is an incredibly remote possibility. The WALL  STREET JOURNAL's assessment of the government is enough to  thwart it.    [Valentini] What about your hand in your pocket [habitual  attitude], Mr. Speaker?    [Scognamiglio] Well, it brought me luck!    [Valentini] Would you do the same again?    [Scognamiglio] Yes, I would.</p>

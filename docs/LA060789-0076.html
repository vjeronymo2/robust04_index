			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTALISTS HIT STATE PLAN ON WATER ALLOCATIONS  </P> <P> Environmentalists on Tuesday hammered a state plan to revamp the process by  which it will reallocate water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, roughly  two-thirds of the state's fresh water.  </P> <P> The new process would govern the San Francisco Bay-Delta hearings, a years-long  analysis that resulted last fall in a recommendation to cap water exports from  Northern California to Southern California.  </P> <P> Several powerful water agencies opposed that idea, which might have limited  urban growth and agriculture. They persuaded the State Water Resources Control  Board to design a new Bay-Delta hearings process.  </P> <P> Environmentalists blasted that process Tuesday for stressing existing water  rights while inhibiting a far-reaching reallocation of water resources.  </P> <P> Environmentalists said the process is legally suspect because it assumes  reallocation is the last resort, judges proposals under a vague  "reasonableness" standard and permits new water exports even as the board is  supposed to be debating export reductions.  </P> <P> The board is scheduled to vote June 22 on the proposed new process.  </P></p>

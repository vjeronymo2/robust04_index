			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] -- On the government's  moves to accelerate the reform and lift the country out of the  economic crisis -- Report of the Council of Ministers at the  Supreme Kenges session on 23 July 1994 (presenter Prime Minister  S.A. Tereshchenko):    Esteemed Chairman, esteemed deputies of the Supreme Kenges  of  Kazakhstan:    The Council of Ministers has submitted a new document for  consideration by the parliament, a memorandum which includes  information on the government's moves to implement the program  of urgent anticrisis measures and broaden the reform, as well as  the main program objectives of the government's economic midterm  policy resulting from the president's address to the Supreme  Kenges.  Besides, the government has completed its elaboration of the  program of actions aimed at accelerating the reform and  stabilizing the economy, making specific the main provisions of  the president's address to parliament and the memorandum you  received earlier.    This program is based on the proposals selected by the  commission set up by the president in January this year. The  program takes into account the opinions of entrepreneurs,  industrialists, researchers, ministries, and departments. It  was discussed at the congress of industrialists and  entrepreneurs and at yesterday's session of the Council of  Ministers. President Nazarbayev made some comments on it. The  program will be further elaborated and submitted for your  discussion. Its main guidelines are depicted in the memorandum  and in the illustrative materials.    To avoid repeating the aforementioned documents, I believe  it  appropriate to dwell in my speech on an analysis of the reform's  progress and on the main problems, and also to highlight the key  directions of our work, the essence and substance of the  government's measures to be taken in the coming period.    The toughness and duration of the process of radically  transforming a planned economy into a market one depend mainly  on which approaches are used.    In our republic, the government's course comprises three  basic measures:    1. Economic liberalization through removal of controls over  prices and manufacturers;    2. Macroeconomic stabilization through regulation of the  money in circulation and achievement of a balanced budget;    3. The sale of state property to individuals and/or  organizations.    The course of reforms carried out by the government in  previous years was objectively predestined and unavoidable. One  can say that it was mistaken; one can object to it; one can, so  to say, "forcefully" express lack of confidence in it. However,  nothing can change the realistic assessment of that course. No  matter who headed the government or who the members of the  government were, the government would have pushed the reform in  the same direction. To say that some things might have been  done better is quite another matter, but that would be to speak  only of some quantitative changes, not qualitative ones. The  results would have been exactly the same -- deterioration,  inflation, a decline of living standards.    Can one seriously speak about implementing any other  measures  given that the USSR and the common economic area have  disintegrated but the common ruble is still there, and that we  lost big financial sources and inherited an exceptionally  unbalanced economy at the start of the reform after Russia began  its reforms? Certainly not!    Anything the government says or does is now criticized. I am  quite sure that somebody will again ask: "How long are you  going to keep referring to the former USSR to 1992?"    Nevertheless, unless we look back to the starting point, one  cannot digest the logic and dynamics of changes, one cannot  understand what we have already achieved or the position in  which we find ourselves, the point we have reached in the course  of transition and what our next steps will be.    In this respect, the further away we are from 1992, the  better and deeper we see the underwater part of the whole  iceberg of the problems we have had to tackle.    It is absolutely clear today that to transfer the economy  from one state into a qualitatively new one which is on a much  higher level demands money, and a lot of money.    We began our reform under ultimately unfavorable conditions  when, after the collapse of the USSR, we lost large subsidies  and subventions from the center, when the source supplying us  with cheap petrodollars was depleted, and when "Gorbachev's"  foreign loans were coming to their end.    All this meant knowing full well first, that the budget  demanded significant cuts even without reforms, second, that we  would have to implement the reforms at our own expense. The  latter meant in fact that we would have to be very tough toward  the production and social sphere. In fact, we have done that.    The burden of taxes was constantly increasing. The debit  side of the budget was kept within the necessary limits at the  expense of continuing cuts in the social sphere.    When we were in the ruble zone, we could for a certain time  compensate for all our production budget cuts with the help of a  softer crediting policy. But after Russia had introduced  corresponding accounts, and later when the ruble zone collapsed,  we had to be much tougher in our crediting policy.    Any softening of loans or budget after the introduction of  our own national currency would have meant inflation and a fall  in the tenge exchange rate, and further blows for the production  and social sphere.    If you like, this is all there is to know about the ins and  outs of the ongoing processes, and this is the state of finance  in the period of reforms.    Of late, we have got so used psychologically to negative  processes in our society and economy that we do not pay  sufficient attention to positive phenomena. Without timely  evaluation and support for the latter, we cannot view the long  term prospects or correctly grasp our strategic development.  Since the beginning of the reform and Kazakhstan's acquisition  of state independence two and a half years ago, we have done  quite a lot. This enabled us to achieve noticeable positive  changes which ensure the irreversibility of our society on its  way from the command-distribution system to a market economy.    1. First of all, cardinal changes are occurring in the  ownership relations which are the basis for all structural and  economic reforms.    The ratio between the state and private sectors of the  economy are changing significantly. The private sector's share  in the overall gross domestic product in the previous five years  has almost trebled -- from 9 percent in 1988 to 26 perceent in  1993.    The ongoing process of privatization, which is strictly  channeled along all three directions, enhances the growth of the  private sector.    2. A complete replacement of the centralized state pricing  system by a free market pricing system is a positive step.    The previous state pricing system disguised deep structural  biases and disproportions which had emerged in the republic's  economy. Very often the system did not react to the dynamically  changing demands and requirements of specific consumers, and  systematically generated a devastating shortage of various goods  and services.    Today most of the prices are set by manufacturers  themselves,  by distributors and sellers who take into account the ratio  between supply and demand on the commodity markets. Currently,  free market prices, which very quickly react to any changes in  consumers' demands and even to decisions made by the government,  very often force enterprises and individual entrepreneurs to  radically restructure their work.    3. The government has achieved positive changes in  liberalizing domestic and foreign trade. The discredited system  of centralized distribution of material and technical resources  has been practically fully dismantled. It did not allow state  enterprises to independently sell their products directly to  buyers. Because of this, useless stockpiles of unwanted  products built up in warehouses and resources were in short  supply.    Today enterprises are absolutely free to choose their trade  partners and they can freely determine with them all contractual  provisions and all agreements on production and delivery of  goods. The government no longer interferes in the establishment  of economic links; on the contrary, it strives to assist  domestic enterprises, especially when mutual deliveries to  enterprises in Russia and other CIS member countries are  concerned.    The list of licensed and quoted goods has been significantly  reduced, both for exports and imports.    Restrictions on the export of goods sold for the national  currency have been lifted. Customs duties and tariffs have been  seriously re-examined.    Social and economic stability, and the government's  consistency in implementing the reform, have provided firm  guarantees for foreign investors. During the previous two  years, the volume of investment has nearly trebled. The  republic had a positive trade balance in 1993 for the very first  time.    4. As far as the budget reform is concerned, the government  and the previous Supreme Kenges established a system of taxes  and tariffs which is an integral whole, though it may be far  from perfect. Direct budget subsidies for enterprises have been  eliminated. Subsidies for regulated prices are also being  eliminated. The government has consistently decreased budget  expenditures on subsidies for loss-making enterprises and  compensations for differences in related costs and prices. In  1992 they equalled 11.6 percent of all expenditures, and in 1993  they were only 6.2 percent. Import subsidies have also been  discontinued.    Apart from implementing its nationwide objectives, the  budget  is becoming more and more socially oriented owing to the  targeted support for the least protected groups of the  population. Along with this, the Finance Ministry is gaining  more control.    The government's relations with the national bank are  becoming more market oriented. The national bank is  concentrating on monetary circulation matters and on  strengthening the national currency in the framework of the  two-tier banking system.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Rules of the game become ever tighter  -United States It was only about 30 years ago that an intrepid reporter summoned up the nerve to ask Orval Faubus how it was that since he was born dirt poor and had never earned more than Dollars 10,000 a year as a multi-term governor of Arkansas he was able to retire to a splendid mansion. 'I was parsimonious,' was the reply, and that was pretty much the end of the story. He could not have got away with the answer today. Hardly a week passes without an elected or public official coming under the investigative gun of the media and a federal, state or independent counsel. This year two Washington heavyweights bit the dust. Mr Dan Rostenkowski, quintessential product of the Chicago Democratic political machine that always used money to grease its efficient political wheel, was forced to step down as chairman of the House ways and means committee after being indicted on several counts of misusing congressional funds. (He was later defeated at the polls.) Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, resigned because it was alleged he had accepted sports tickets and other favours of fairly nugatory value from agribusinesses he was supposed to regulate. It is said, with some accuracy, of Mr Rostenkowski and Mr Espy that they failed to understand there had been changes to the once lax rules of the game applied in Congress where often modest favours (such as hospitality) were received and dispensed. At the heart of the Whitewater affair is the suspicion, still unproven, that money flowed in a clandestine manner from business interests to then Governor Bill Clinton's campaigns in Arkansas and, perhaps, subsequently at the national level. Congressman Newt Gingrich, the next Speaker of the House, is the subject of persistent questions about the funding and uses of his political action committee, the legal device through which so many politicians channel contributions. Congressmen are also, by definition, beholden to powerful constituent interests. Senator Jesse Helms from North Carolina and Congressman Thomas Bliley of Virginia, for example, have never disguised their protection of their home state tobacco farmers, who have returned the favour with campaign money and, equally important, jobs for voters. In an era of ever more expensive elections, disappointing such interests can be costly. Indeed, the rules of the anti-corruption game are forever changing, with the appearance of impropriety seeming to take precedence over the act itself. The Clinton administration came to power having campaigned against Republican 'sleaze' and promised the highest ethical standards. Under its rules, no government official, high or low, may accept gifts or entertainment worth more than Dollars 20 per occasion or Dollars 50 per year from any single source, which has put a bit of a crimp in the Washington lunch trade, if nothing else. Those who leave government now face tougher than ever curbs on their ability to walk through the revolving door into related commercial activities, especially if run by non-American interests. The restrictions may seem petty, even a disincentive to public service, but the climate of the times and voices such as that of Ross Perot demand them. The administration also touts reform of campaign financing and lobbying as effective antidotes to the appearance of an unhealthy relationship between politics and money. But two bills to this effect foundered in the autumn on the rocks of Republican filibusters. Lobbying reform, which had enjoyed broad bipartisan support, may resurface in the next Congress with new ceilings on entertainment and travel and possibly a mandatory register of lobbyists and fuller disclosure of their activities. But public financing of congressional elections, the simplest way of levelling the financial playing field and already in effect in the race for the presidency, profoundly divides the two parties. Experience of previous experiments in campaign finance reform - which do now place limits on individual and special interest contributions - merely prove that money will find its way to its destination regardless. Curiously, US politicians may be held in low regard for their ethical standards but the evidence of endemic and wholesale political corruption remains relatively thin. The main difference is that any American hand caught in the cookie jar, no matter how small the haul, may end up raised in front of a grand jury.</p>

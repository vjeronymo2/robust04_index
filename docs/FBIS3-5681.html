			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] The employment ministerial talks (the employment  summit) will be held for two days, 14-15 March, to discuss ways  to resolve the unemployment issue, which is common in  industrialized nations, and a draft of the statement of the  chairman of the employment ministerial talks has come to light.  As the most important task, the draft of the chairman's  statement calls for reforming the structure of industries that  can create new jobs. The United States is poised to set forth a  macropolicy for creation of more jobs at the employment  ministerial talks, and Japan, with a huge trade surplus, will  certainly be pressed to expand its domestic demand at the talks.  Japan plans to seek the understanding of other nations by  presenting plans for reform of the industrial structure, but the  possibility has emerged that both Japan and the United States  will confront each other over the employment issue.    Among the industrialized nations, with the exception of  Japan, the jobless rate has increased since around 1990 and  unemployment has become a social issue. The jobless rate is  falling in the United States and some other industrialized  nations, but four industrialized nations of the Group of Seven  [G-7] industrialized nations still suffer a high, double-digit  jobless rate. For this reason, the United States has proposed  that the G-7 industrialized nations hold the employment  ministerial talks to discuss wide-ranging ways to resolve the  unemployment issue.    The draft of the chairman's statement points out that it is  necessary to reform the industrial structure in order to raise  the flexibility of the labor market and to create new jobs. The  draft of the chairman's statement notes that, to that end,  promoting the wide use of new technology through the information  revolution, strengthening education and training to adjust to  new technology, and liberalizing trade are indispensable.  Reflecting the view of the United States, which maintains the  macropolicy, is a prerequisite for reforming the industrial  structure. The draft of the chairman's statement explicitly  indicates that reform of the industrial structure is effective  only when it is supported and supplemented by the macropolicy.    At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United  States  expressed strong discontent with Japan, contending that Japan's  policy centering on tax cuts is inadequate to stimulate the  economy and cut its surplus. This is a factor responsible for  the breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks.    At the employment summit, the United States plans to  emphasize the need for the macropolicy and that the employment  summit will unavoidably focus its debate on the issue of Japan's  surplus. It is highly possible that other nations will ask Japan  to implement the macropolicy which will expand domestic demand,  claiming "Japan's surplus is depriving other nations of  employment opportunities."    Japan plans to avoid being criticized over the macropolicy  by  stressing its posture to work on reform of the industrial  structure. Japan intends to explain to other nations the  contents of plans to reform the industrial structure which have  been compiled by the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry and to urge other nations to work on reform of their  respective industrial structures. The plans cite such industries  as housing, information, communications, environment related,  medical, welfare, and other domestic-demand-oriented industries  that are expected to grow in the future, and stresses the need  to upgrade the existing infrastructure, to promote deregulation,  and to raise funds smoothly to develop those industries.</p>

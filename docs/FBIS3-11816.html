Honduras has  been adversely affected by a series of incidents aimed at  pressuring the government and which concern the population in  general.    The actions that have been carried out range from strikes in  the processing industry areas (assembly plants), cement  industries, high schools, and freight transportation to multiple  cases of trespassing, especially in the capital of the Republic.  As for the labor strikes, especially those in the two cement  plants operating in the country, the situation is creating a  crisis in the construction industry and immediately generating  unemployment for more than 100,000 workers.    The trespassing into the city's communal and private lands  obstructs its orderly growth and creates difficulties for local  authorities, who are in charge of urban development policies and  who face the problem of being unable to evict the invaders  because they do not have a police force.    The strikes at the high schools are due to the student's  rejection of compulsory military service just as the Armed  Forces would like to maintain it.    Likewise, the constant increase in family basket prices is  the focal point of constant demonstrations by the various mass  organizations, who conduct protest marches in front of the  Economy Ministry and the downtown streets of Tegucigalpa. The  military, however, views these events with indifference and even  though several of these events have led to violence, the public  security forces have not taken any action.    The attitude of the Honduran Army is considered by the  different sectors of society to be a pressure mechanism to avoid  the reforms announced by President Carlos Roberto Reina aimed at  turning compulsory military service into voluntary service.  Likewise, the military officers' budget has been adversely  affected because it will be reduced by 10 percent this year.    In view of all these incidents which could create situations  of anarchy in Honduran society, President Carlos Roberto Reina  ordered the Armed Forces today to cooperate in maintaining  public order. Adolfo Facusse, the top Honduran business leader,  and Tegucigalpa Mayor Roberto Acosta said that if the Armed  Forces do not want to take any action in view of the situation  experienced in the country, the existence of certain posts makes  no sense "and are good for nothing," according to Mayor Acosta.    The top military hierarchy said their reason for not  interfering in the different actions being carried out in the  country is they do not want to show a lack of respect for the  human rights policy, which is a priority for the current  Honduran Government.    Police Chief Colonel Mario Hung Pacheco said the military  officers are learning to coexist with "the new policy of respect  for human rights" and that is why they have to be very careful  in their actions. He pointed out that they will only intervene  in those actions where their presence is requested through a  judicial order or at the explicit request of the president of  the Republic.</p>

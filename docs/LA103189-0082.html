			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENER RAISES BUMPER CROP OF GHOULS  </P> <P> Hands that actually move reach up from the graves in Florencio Morales' front  yard in Montecito Heights. Eerie background music sets the mood for the ghosts,  goblins, witches, skeletons and werewolves lurking about.  </P> <P> The macabre production has made Morales a legend in his neighborhood, and his  holiday decorations attract visitors from as far away as Mexico and Italy to  his home at 4225 Griffin Ave., creating small traffic jams -- especially on  Halloween.  </P> <P> Morales, 40, began the tradition of decorating his front yard on holidays eight  years ago with a single, grisly figure -- a hanged man -- on Halloween. Each  year, the displays have become more elaborate. Morales, a gardener, digs into  his own pocket to foot the bill for putting up the scenes.  </P> <P> His Halloween display -- overseen by a huge devil atop his house -- has led  some superstitious visitors to call him brujo, witch in Spanish. A  fundamentalist minister prayed for his salvation after seeing the decorations.  </P> <P> Morales, who dons a Dracula costume as part of his show, explained to the  minister that he also puts up decorations at Christmas and other holidays. And  Halloween is as much a time for laughter as anything, he said. How else to  explain the cigar in his werewolf's mouth?  </P></p>

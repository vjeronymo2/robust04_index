She called on the Security Council to take a  firm stand in this connection.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH before leaving Medina, Bhutto  said  that the international community has a moral responsibility to  ease the suffering of unarmed civilians in Kashmir. Their  plight is the same as that of other Muslims throughout the world  such as the Somalis, the Bosnians, and the Burmese. She pointed  out that Pakistan has urged international organizations to  intervene for the recognition of the Kashmir people's right to  self-determination. She accused the Indian Government of  dithering on this issue in order to maintain its occupation of  Kashmir despite the mounting opposition to Indian rule among the  majority of the population. She said that "the genocide  operations carried out by the Indian forces against the Muslim  population coincide with the persecution of Muslims by the  Hindus. These moves are a prelude to a plan to impose Indian  hegemony on the region." She warned that the "apparent failure  of the international community will charge sentiment in the  Islamic world."    Bhutto stressed that her country was making global  diplomatic  efforts in support of the principles of human rights, regardless  of the legal aspects, and in support of the principles of the  Geneva Convention for the prevention of massacres and the  punishment of perpetrators. She asked: "Will the people of  Kashmir meet the same fate as the Bosnians, who are the target  of premeditated liquidation?" She added that "the struggle of  the people of Kashmir is based on the quest for freedom, which  is a legitimate demand in all civilized societies." She  reaffirmed Pakistan's moral and material support "for the  struggle of the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir."  *</p>

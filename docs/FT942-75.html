			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford's German arm sees return to black Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, said it would move out of the red and make at least DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) profit this year, but warned that the German car market was making only a tentative recovery. Mr Albert Caspers, chief executive, said new registrations in Germany were likely to increase by just 2 per cent compared with very bad figures the year before. Ford-Werke is the largest subsidiary of the US group. It exports to 60 countries and lost DM132m last year compared with a loss of DM469m in 1992, but says it made a first-half profit this year. Mr Caspers blamed the 1993 losses on lower sales and foreign exchange losses. Turnover in 1993 fell 3.7 per cent to DM21.2bn. Ford increased its share of the European car market in 1993 to 11.5 per cent, from 11.2, and maintained a German market share of 9.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524) and </F> correspondent Zhao Peiya (6392 1014 0068)]    [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- China's macroeconomic  regulation and control has yielded initial results in the field  of fixed asset investments, with the growth rate of investments  falling sharply, newly-started construction projects being  brought under effective control, and the overall investment  structure showing a noticeable improvement.    According to the latest statistics released by the State  Statistical Bureau, in the first four months of this year, fixed  asset investments by state-owned units grew 38.4 percent over  the same period last year, showing a decrease of 30.5 percentage  points in the growth rate. Of this, the growth rates for  capital construction and technical transformation investments  dropped 32.5 and 28.4 percentage points, respectively. What is  most eye-catching is that the growth rate of real estate  development investments fell 72.8 percentage points, thus  further cooling the "heat of real estate markets."    While the investment scale was brought under control, the  growth momentum of newly-started projects nationwide was also  effectively restrained. In the first four months, a total of  6,316 state projects involving capital construction and  technical transformation with an investment of 50,000 yuan or  more each were launched throughout the country, 1,715 less than  those of the same period last year; and investments totaled 47.5  billion yuan, down 32.3 percentage points. A total of 5,106  local projects were launched, 1,680 less than those of the same  period last year; and total investments decreased 1.2 percentage  points.    The overall investment structure was improved as compared  with the same period last year. In the first four months,  excluding real estate development investments, state-owned units  invested a total of 1.8 billion yuan in primary industries, up  13.6 percent. In secondary industries, state-owned units  invested 60.8 billion yuan, up 27 percent; the ratio of such  investment to total investment decreased from 56.2 percent to  52.7 percent. In tertiary industries, state-owned units  invested 52.8 billion yuan, up 47.5 percent; the ratio of such  investment to total investment increased from 42 percent to 45.8  percent.    In analyzing Chinese investments in fixed assets,  authoritative economists said: Despite initial successes in  macroeconomic regulation and control, the demand for investment  remains strong in various sectors. It is still rather difficult  to reduce fixed asset investments to an appropriate scale.  Localities should not relax their efforts, but should continue  to resolutely implement the State Council's "circular on  continuing to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control  over fixed asset investments." Meanwhile, the relevant  departments should pay keen attention to and adopt effective  measures to promptly solve problems related to the western  region's slow investment growth and lack of funds for a number  of key construction projects.</p>

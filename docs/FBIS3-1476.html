			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SAP Colonel Dave Bruce by CCV announcer </F> Reggie Morobe on the "Newsline" program -- live]    [Text] [Morose] Colonel Bruce, good evening.    [Bruce] Good evening to you.    [Morose] Let me say, from yesterday, there were reports that  there was intimidation which was a build-up to the march. What  did the police do?    [Bruce] Well, you're quite correct. A number of incidents  did take place from late last night right through the night  until this morning. And consultations were again held with both  political parties involved, that is to say the IFP and the ANC  this morning. Our fears were obviously expressed to the  leadership of the IFP regarding what could possibly take place.  We asked for assurances, as we were given in the beginning,  that's on Friday when application was made for the march to take  place. And assurances were given that this march would be  peaceful.    [Morobe] Is this the time for assurances, taking the  volatile  situation. We saw the pictures from Ulundi where AK-47  gun-pointing people were running with. We know the volatile  situation. Do we just need just assurance?    [Bruce] No, you don't need just assurances, but I think one  has to realize that the political leaders and the organizations  of parties that wish to hold demonstrations and gatherings of  this nature really have a tremendous responsibility to ensure  that the assurances given to them which motivate the reason for  the march are indeed kept, and obviously it is up to them to  ensure that their followers do not come to these gatherings  armed.    [Morobe] Now today we saw what happened. Assurances did  nothing. Now it's within the city where people are going to  work, there's shopping, the normal day should go on amid the  march, what precautions, measures, did you take as the police?    [Bruce] Well, the South African Police [SAP] were there in  great numbers, we had close on 700 policemen in the Johannesburg  area to monitor this particular gathering. We expressed our  problems regarding this particular march as well, we gave ...    [Morobe, interrupting] What were your problems?    [Bruce] Well, because of the problems that took place during  the night, we felt that there was a possibility that violence  could break out, and we had, specifically, talks with the  African National Congress on this matter this morning, and  assurances were given that we would police this particular  march, but it must be understood that we could only ensure that  public order is kept, we could not ensure that we're going to  carry out the law to the letter of the law, because that would  be futile. If I can put it very, very simply, it is just not  possible for 700 policemen to disarm 10,000 persons of their  weapons, it is absolutely impossible, and it's time that people  took note of this.    [Morobe] Was the route cordoned. Was the route to the  Library cordoned with a wire fence?    [Bruce] As far as possible, yes, it was certainly done. I  can't tell you where each and every, or which each and every  area was cordoned off and so on, but certainly the razor wire  was used, the police were there, they cordoned off certain  areas. I don't think that anybody can expect the South African  Police to cordon off each and every street within the city.  However, we maintained a very strong presence in that area.    [Morobe] As strong as in Durban that we saw over the  weekend?    [Bruce] Oh, I couldn't tell you what happened in Durban, I  couldn't tell you that.    [Morobe] Because the contingent was far larger than in  Johannesburg, and taking again the volatile situation from  Soweto, intimidation was reported, and from early in the  morning, gunshots were reported, couldn't police act swiftly,  700, did it do its job, is the police now having problems in  terms of controlling (?violence)?    [Bruce] Those are questions. And I must really state that  it's very, very early in the day to answer questions of that  nature. I can assure you that an investigation, and I mean an  in-depth investigation is taking place, and I will not be  surprised if there is actually an inquiry, a commission of  inquiry, into today's happenings that will be conducted. And I  can assure you, if the police were found wanting, or did not  plan strategically, that will come out, but that is not the  question that we should discuss tonight. What we should really  be looking at is the fact that at least 18 persons, human  beings, have died, and the fact of this particular aspect is  that it was the IFP who asked to do a march, to hold a  gathering, and it was their followers that were partly  responsible for this. Also one must take into account that  shots, automatic gunfire were fired from within the African  National Congress' headquarters, which also resulted in deaths.  These are the things that one has got to look at, and you know  to apportion blame now, one way or the other is not going to  solve this particular problem.    [Morobe] On that note, the IFP, Themba Khoza, has just said,  they actually gave a report that they were made aware that there  will be an infiltration, if I should use the word, of the MK  [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing]  within the group, and also on the security, to ensure that  people are killed today. Did you get such a report?    [Bruce] No, not from the IFP. Let me stress that had any  reports of that nature been available to the South African  Police before the march, obviously, then one could reconsider  the decision to grant the march. However, I must point out of  course the march was okayed by the chief magistrate on Friday  already. These, as I pointed out, are aspects that have to be  drawn to the attention of the persons investigating these  occurrences, or the commission of inquiry which will result out  of this particular happening.    [Morobe] But it's reported Cyril Ramaphosa called you, the  police, at 7:45 and it took only up to 10 o'clock for the  arrival of the police. What takes so long in such a volatile  situation?    [Bruce] I cannot say what Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa reported. What  I can tell you, that at the time that these shots took place  from within the ANC headquarters, our regional commissioner  General Calitz, was actually in Shell House himself, so I can  assure you note has been taken of exactly what took place, but  for anybody now to point fingers at the South African Police, I  think at this very early stage it's astounding that anybody can  come to a conclusion that one party or the other is at fault.  This is what will emanate from an investigation.    [Morobe] Now, at the court, the garden itself, it's reported  a minibus came and showered bullets. I'd like to believe from  what you say that the presence of police was there. How can  such a thing happen, and what action are we going to see from  the police?    [Bruce] I think you have to realize that at the Library  Gardens, that was an estimated 9,000 or 10,000 persons. And for  anybody now at this stage, and I must state it again, at this  early stage, to actually say what took place is impossible, we  really can't, these are things that will receive attention, and  will be investigated, and will be made known to the public.    [Morobe] And finally, is the police, South African Police,  able to maintain law and order?    [Bruce] I think that the South African Police, and indeed,  any policemen in the world is able to maintain law and order  under reasonable circumstances. We are able to police marches  and demonstrations, and so on, but when it degenerates into what  we saw today, which essentially was an example of the political  conflict which is taking place in South Africa, then it makes it  very difficult for anybody to police that. I think South  Africans should take note now that what we saw today is what has  been taking place in the rural areas, and the inaccessible areas  for quite some time. Perhaps it's coming as a bit of a shock to  South Africa to see what reality is.    [Morobe] On that note we leave it there as we have run out  of  time. Thank you for availing yourself to us?    [Bruce] It's a pleasure.</p>

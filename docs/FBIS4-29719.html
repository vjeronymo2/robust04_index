			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand yesterday suggested the Cambodian  government and the Khmer Rouge try to agree on the agenda before  starting peace negotiations to ensure progress.    "It is better than talking about the issues which each side  cannot accept.    "Otherwise, there would be no breakthrough," Foreign  Minister  Prasong Sunsiri said when asked to comment on the failure of the  round-table discussions in Phnom Penh on Thursday.    The second round of talks, which resumed on Wednesday  following the one hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk in Pyongyang  last month, was a deadlock as both sides could not agree on the  agendas.    Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong reiterated that the peace  negotiation could not be successfully concluded in just one  meeting and encouraged the Cambodian leaders and the Khmer Rouge  representatives to find opportunities for more talks.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DENG LAUDS SUPPRESSION OF PROTESTS;  </P> <P> LEADER IS BACK ON SCENE; 50,000 HOLD RALLY IN SHANGHAI  </P> <P> Senior leader Deng Xiaoping emerged Friday to praise the Chinese army as a  "steel Great Wall" for crushing the movement for democracy, and sources said  that police were arresting intellectuals accused of encouraging the protests.  </P> <P> Military presence was felt throughout the city. Convoys of trucks and foot  soldiers patrolled by day. More than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers  rumbled through the center of Beijing after dark.  </P> <P> The Foreign Ministry advised embassies to keep staff members indoors at night  but did not impose a curfew.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Democracy Demonstration  </P> <P> In central Shanghai Friday, a day after Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji issued a  warning that illegal disruptions will no longer be tolerated, about 50,000  people staged a pro-democracy protest.  </P> <P> Student leaders also demanded that flags on public buildings be flown at  half-staff to mourn the deaths in Beijing and that a dialogue be established  between students and Shanghai government officials. There was no word on the  government's reaction.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, state television showed soldiers patrolling Chengdu, in the  southwest, and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters. Police  were shown making arrests in Wuhan and Harbin, two of the cities where crowds  burned buses and blocked roads.  </P> <P> A Chinese witness said police, in their pursuit of suspect intellectuals, had  searched one hotel room by room for a suspect, who was not identified.  </P> <P> "We live now under terror," a student said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quashed Rumors  </P> <P> Deng, 84, quashed rumors that he was seriously ill or out of power by making  his first public appearance since May 16, when he met with visiting Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> On the evening television news, he was shown with other conservative leaders,  including Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, posing for a picture  with senior military officials at Communist Party headquarters.  </P> <P> The officials stood for a minute of silence in tribute to soldiers who died "in  putting down a counterrevolutionary rebellion" last weekend, the official news  agency Xinhua reported.  </P> <P> "Facing a life-threatening situation, our troops never forgot the people, never  forgot the party, never forgot the country's interest," Deng said, speaking  forcefully and gesturing for emphasis. "Our troops are worthy of a steel Great  Wall."  </P> <P> Party chief Zhao Ziyang was absent, as were fellow reformists Hu Qili and Tian  Jiyun. Reports have said Zhao was stripped of power for opposing the May 20  declaration of martial law in Beijing.  </P> <P> Diplomatic and Western intelligence estimates say about 3,000 people were  killed when the 27th Army entered the city a week ago Saturday and cleared  student demonstrators from Tian An Men Square. The government puts the figure  at 300, most of them soldiers, and has said no one was killed in the square.  </P> <P> In Washington, the White house said reprisals against protest leaders were  "repugnant."  </P> <P> "Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its citizens,"  White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.  </P> <P> Soldiers stood at most intersections in Beijing and stopped cars at night to  demand identification.  </P> <P> Hundreds were posted on college campuses, where the protests began in  mid-April.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Order Issued  </P> <P> Martial law authorities issued a new order banning "counterrevolutionary"  posters and pamphlets, and non-military security forces entered campuses to rip  down anti-government posters.  </P> <P> One apartment block still bore a huge sign proclaiming: "The students must be  victorious. Long live the people." But most buildings had government banners  urging unity against the rebels.  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador James Lilley said 70 more Americans left Beijing on Friday,  including his wife. The embassy estimated that 400 Americans remained in the  city, including 100 embassy employees, down from about 2,500 before martial  law. Most other foreigners were gone.  </P> <P> There were no confirmed arrests of student leaders or dissidents, but Chinese  sources reported police taking suspects from homes and a Western diplomat said:  "We know that they're picking people up all over the place."  </P> <P> The government has announced arrests of dozens of people in Beijing and other  cities, all accused of attacking soldiers or burning buses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dissident at U.S. Embassy  </P> <P> A letter read on television, the writer not identified, said China's best-known  dissident, Fang Lizhi, was a traitor and should be arrested. Fang and his wife  took refuge in the U.S. Embassy last week.  </P> <P> Increased patrols indicated a new confidence by the military that citizens  would not attack. Also, the troops were clearly united after several days in  which small skirmishes were reported with units opposed to the crackdown.  </P> <P> Soldiers raised the flag over Tian An Men Square, site of the protests, for the  first time since retaking the 100-acre area from the students early Sunday.  </P> <P> Television showed a military band playing the national anthem as the red flag  was raised, and broadcast an aerial view of the square with hundreds of trucks  and dozens of tanks lined up.  </P> <P> Some buses resumed operations Friday and were allowed to cross the square's  northern end.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Debris Cleared Away  </P> <P> Soldiers continued clearing away charred frames of buses, tanks and trucks  burned by crowds trying to stop the army advance last weekend. Neighborhood  committees organized teams of residents to help.  </P> <P> Army trucks with loudspeakers drove through the streets proclaiming: "Our task  is to protect social order . . . . We want your understanding."  </P> <P> In the English-language China Daily, a headline said saboteurs should be  crushed with "iron fists."  </P> <P> A bicyclist said: "There are plainclothes police everywhere. No one dares to  talk. I still support the slogans 'Uphold democracy' and 'Oppose official  corruption,' but now there is no way to express such ideas."  </P></p>

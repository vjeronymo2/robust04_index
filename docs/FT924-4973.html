			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Steeped in beauty beyond the Norm I DON'T imagine I would ever spend Pounds 1m-plus on a David Hockney painting, as some people have. And I think I agree with the critic who said that while Hockney is 'one of the most successful and acclaimed artists of his generation, in demand wherever today's western art finds a ready and eager public,' he is also 'preposterously over-rated . . . superficial, turning out a kind of 19th century saloon art refurbished from the stockroom of modernism.' But I like and admire Hockney, especially his mixture of bluntness and sensitivity. And I enjoy what he says about art. Recently, in an interview, he said he was not sure that tragedy was a suitable theme for painting. 'Strauss always said: 'I thought artists were for providing beauty'.' Hockney described how he had been captivated by a small picture in the Matisse exhibition in New York, a vase of flowers with a bust on a table. 'I looked at the date, and it was 1942. And, of course, Europe was ripping itself apart. But I thought: 'Well, I'm glad he painted it. I'm glad that there was somebody . . . making something beautiful from the world around him'.' So inspired was I by Hockney's sentiments that this week I suddenly hurled all the papers on my desk into the air, stabbed the computer Off button and dashed in search of something beautiful. I rushed to the Tate Gallery, paid Pounds 4, and dived into the Swagger exhibition - 300 years of grand manner portraiture in Britain, from Van Dyck to Augustus John. 'Swagger' portraiture can be showy and ostentatious, but also rhetorical, glamorous, exuberant and sexy. There are 79 paintings in this exhibition, all of them beautiful. You can drown yourself in sumptuousness - Batoni, Zoffany, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Millais, Sargent, and so on. I had only one bad moment. I was admiring Sir Thomas Lawrence's Catherine Gray, Lady Manners (1794) when two twitterers strode up to it. I expect they were part of the Barnes mob. The thing about Lady Manners is that it sorts the men from the boys. It is glittery, luscious and showy, the highlights of the dress laid on in thickly impasted white. It even has a peacock. Is it chocolate-box art, or something much weightier? Weightier, I rather think. I find it immensely sad. But the Barnes pair were outraged. 'Dear God in Heaven,' moaned the female, when confronted by Lady Manners. 'God, what a mess. She looks like a chicken.' I have been known to start arguments in galleries on less than that, but I let the fools go, so wrapped had I become in the glamourousness of swagger. I went home. I felt uplifted. I decided that for the next 24 hours I would look only at beautiful things, would let the world and its sorrows pass by unheeded. Just as I was settling down, Miss Lee, my executive assistant, burst in. Dressed in designer gear. Expensively rouged and carmined. Bosom rising and falling. She had obviously been to Harvey Nicks with one of her dreadful friends. 'The world is going mad,' said Miss Lee. 'The government is shaking and heaving. Iraqgate's exploding. The French are revolting. And a comet's heading for Earth.' 'I don't want to know,' I said gently. 'For 24 hours I am ignoring the world and its comedies. I am steeping myself in beauty. Please don't disturb me.' For the next four hours I idled through a favourite book, Ruskin Today, an anthology chosen and annotated by Kenneth Clark 'to reintroduce this fascinating and complex figure to the modern reader.' I read Ruskin on the sacredness of colour - 'the loveliest (colour) is melancholy'; on the snobbishness of English painters, and on the evil of decorating railway stations. At 7pm, Miss Lee burst into the room again. Her hair was awry. There were Beaujolais stains on her front. 'Michael, you have got to snap out of your reverie,' she shouted. 'Amazing things are happening. A dozen members of the cabinet have assassinated Norman Lamont. They stabbed him at the Commons. Heseltine plunged the first knife in, then Howard and Hurd and so forth. Lamont did not go quietly. Squealed like a pig, they say. The blood you wouldn't believe. Finally, John Major stepped from the shadows and finished poor Norman off.' I smiled kindly at my assistant. 'I am afraid you will have to remind me,' I said. 'Who was Norman Lamont?'</p>

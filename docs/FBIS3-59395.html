The utilization  of $58.8 billion in foreign capital was agreed upon, and the  amount of foreign capital actually utilized was $9.4 billion, up  300 percent and 180 percent, respectively, over the same period  in 1992, roughly equal to the total for the entire year last  year and about half of all foreign-funded investments for the  previous 13 years. As of late June 1993, the grand total of  foreign-funded investment projects nationwide stood at 134,423,  actually utilizing $43.75 billion in foreign capital. Over  50,000 foreign-funded enterprises have gone into production,  most of them doing well.    Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, the United States, Taiwan, Italy,  Germany, and South Korea continued to be the leading investors  in China, primarily its coastal provinces and municipalities.  Nevertheless, China's inland areas have been catching up fast.  Among the various sectors, industry continued to attract the  most capital, especially electronics communication equipment,  machinery, chemical, and electrical appliance industries.  Meanwhile, however, investment in the tertiary sector posted  faster growth, with the scale of foreign investment increasing  steadily. Agreed-upon foreign investment averaged $1.35 million  per project in the first half of this year, a gain of 22 percent  over the corresponding period a year ago.    Exports and imports by foreign-funded enterprises in China  continued to grow steadily in the first half of 1993, with a  total value of $24.63 billion, 49.7 percent higher than the same  period a year ago and 31.7 percent of the nation's overall  imports and exports. Of the $24.63 billion, exports accounted  for $9.32 billion, up 36.9 percent over the corresponding period  last year, and 21.5 percent of the nation's total exports. Most  leading exports were found in light industry, textile industry,  and electrical machinery industry. Imports were worth $15.31  billion, an increase of 58.7 percent over last year and 37.7  percent of the nation's total imports. Leaving aside  investment-related imports, there was a rough balance between  exports and imports made necessary by their operations.  Foreign-funded investment enterprises nationwide remitted  overseas $3.39 billion in foreign exchange in the first half of  this year, at the same time moving $1.676 billion in foreign  exchange to China, for a net outflow of $1.714 billion. Overall  foreign-funded investment enterprises had a foreign exchange  surplus.    That foreign investment in China maintained such a strong  momentum when the rest of the world was in the grip of an  economic recession fully testifies to China's political and  social stability and the soundness of its investment climate. On  the other hand, China is a latecomer to attracting foreign  capital, so foreign investment still accounts for a  significantly smaller share of China's total fixed assets and  gross domestic product than in other fast-growing developing  nations. Since most foreign capital is concentrated in  processing industries, the overall quality of our drive to  attract foreign capital has yet to be improved.  <H5>  Focuses of Drive To Attract Foreign Capital </H5>   In the wake of the deepening of economic structural reform  and changes in the global economic environment, China will  adjust its policies after reviewing its experience for the past  14 years so as to achieve new breakthroughs in the attraction of  foreign capital. Judging from the string of policies the country  has adopted recently, we see that China will concentrate on the  following at least in its drive to attract foreign capital:    1. Continue to work hard to improve the investment climate,  particularly the intangible investment climate. By and large  China has created the framework of a body of laws on foreign  capital utilization; it has signed an investment protection  agreement with more than 55 nations and other agreements to  avoid double taxation with over 20 nations. All that provides  basic legal safeguards for the foreign investor. Still there is  much room for improvement on the legal front. To better the  legal environment, China will continue to improve its laws and  regulations, making them more coordinated, more open, and more  workable; tighten law enforcement; and render its laws and  regulations uniform nationwide, all of which is most critical to  improving the investment climate. It is also essential that  government departments improve their management methods. The  procedures for reviewing and approving a project are currently  being simplified. Some localities have set up a single body to  review and approve project applications from foreign investors.  In other localities, all the departments involved have decided  to work together, for instance, by setting up joint offices and  holding joint meetings, to examine and approve projects, thus  streamlining the examination-and-approval process and enhancing  work efficiency. Vigorous steps are being taken by the  government to encourage the establishment of a host of  service-providing organizations, such as consulting, legal,  accounting, and property assessment services, to make available  a complete lineup of social services.    2. China's open policy began in its coastal region, which  had  a stronger economic foundation and a long history of overseas  trade, and gradually spread to the rest of the country, from  south to north, from east to west. Practice proves that this  progression is sound and inevitable and has played a significant  historical role. Be that as it may, with years of development  behind it, the open policy today should be applied across the  board. The coast and the interior must develop in a balanced  manner. Last year China opened up cities along the Chang Jiang,  provincial capitals in the interior, and a number of border  cities, and took some steps to encourage the interior to utilize  foreign capital. Indeed, the interior has made rapid progress in  utilizing foreign capital since last year, chalking up an  increase rate higher than that of the coast. With its weak  foundation and late start, however, the interior still trails  the coast; the role played by foreign investment in its economic  development remains minuscule. In the future China will  gradually replace its policy of favoring some regions with one  favoring some industries, which means that even as it continues  to promote the utilization of foreign capital in the coast, it  will work diligently to create the conditions that would steer  foreign investors into the interior by playing up the interior's  resource advantage and strong industries. In particular, it  would encourage foreign companies to invest in agricultural  development, resource development, technology development, raw  material industries, and the technological transformation of  old-line enterprises in the interior. It would also support  foreign firms which want to invest in remote border areas,  impoverished areas, and areas inhabited by minority  nationalities.    3. Further optimize the industrial structure and widen the  range of industries open to foreign investment. After 14 years  of development, the industrial pattern of foreign investment has  become more and more rational. In the last couple of years, in  particular, a host of projects in the energy, transportation,  and high-tech industries went under way across the nation that  involved a large amount of capital, utilized advanced  technology, and had substantial impact on the national economy.  Substantial headway was also made in the tertiary industry. As  we pursue foreign capital in the future, we must continue to  abide by the principle of balancing development among the  primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, with equal emphasis  on large, medium, and small enterprises. Special pains must be  taken to encourage agricultural technology development projects,  infrastructural projects, capital- and technology-intensive  projects, export-oriented projects, and projects in basic  industries that would turn out more Chinese-made raw materials  and parts and components. Export-oriented enterprises along the  coast should be encouraged to upgrade themselves by graduating  from labor-intensive products to high-tech products with a high  added value. China has eased restrictions on foreign investment  in the tertiary industry since last year. Now foreign investment  is finding its way into finance, insurance, retail commerce,  foreign trade, tourism, consulting, information, accounting,  advertising, and shipping. China must continue to broaden the  reach of foreign capital in the tertiary sector in the days  ahead both to meet the needs of economic structural reform and  the operation of the market economy at home and to satisfy the  objective requirements of rejoining the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade and acceding to other related international  organizations. In industries mentioned above that are already  opened to foreign investment, the scope of the pilot projects  will be broadened after reviewing the experience, while new  experiments will also be launched in areas untouched by foreign  investment so far.    4. Diversify the methods of foreign investment. In  traditional methods of foreign investment, the investor invests  directly by setting up a Sino-foreign joint venture, a  Sino-foreign contractual joint venture, or a wholly  foreign-funded enterprise. Or he may invest in compensation  trade or a processing or assembling project. In recent years,  especially since 1992, Sino-foreign shareholding companies have  mushroomed, with dozens of them already in operation so far.  More than 30 companies are trading special B shares denominated  in renminbi on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. The  shareholding system has become the way to go for enterprises  interested in restructuring in a market economy. Investing in  shareholding companies is now a new option for the foreign  investor in China and promises to become increasingly important  in the long haul compared to traditional methods. Furthermore,  as China's financial climate further stabilizes and the Chinese  stock market matures, a growing number of companies will issue  shares for trading on the market. Foreigners will then be able  to invest in China through the stock market, a method of  investment that is simple, quick, and convenient in that it  allows the investor to move his investment dollars around  freely. The foreign investor no doubt will become increasingly  interested in the stock market. To promote the development of  Sino-foreign joint venture shareholding companies vigorously but  cautiously, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and  Trade is in the process of drawing up the "Management  Regulations for Sino-Foreign Shareholding Companies Ltd."    To encourage large foreign companies that have ample capital  resources and advanced technology to carry out their  multi-industry interregional investment plans in China, the  country has in recent years approved the establishment of a  number of investment companies (controlling companies). On  behalf of their parent companies, these investment companies  carry out their investment plans and manage the enterprises that  have been set up. Judging from practical results, the investment  company does a better job in helping the investor grasp any  favorable opportunity to increase his investment in China. The  Chinese government looks upon with special favor multinational  companies setting up this kind of outfit in China. Recently an  investment seminar for multinationals was jointly organized in  Beijing by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and  Trade, the University of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade,  and the United Nations Center for Multinationals.  Representatives from the various multinationals who attended the  seminar expressed the utmost interest in this form of  investment. Those representing some of the most famous companies  also asked to set up regional headquarters in China, a request  taken very seriously by the government agencies and figures  involved.    5. Intensify the management of foreign-funded enterprises  already in existence. As foreign-funded enterprises  proliferated, it is increasingly essential that China step up  their management. The management of foreign-funded enterprises  entails, on the one hand, creating a favorable operating  environment for such enterprises, especially by nurturing and  perfecting the financial, foreign exchange, materials, and labor  markets; helping them solve any problem relating to the supply  of energy, raw materials, parts and components, and  transportation; curbing the arbitrary collection of fees and  apportionment of expenses, irresponsible fund-raising, and  unjustifiable administrative intervention; and establishing a  sound social service system. On the other hand, it means  tightening the supervision of foreign-funded enterprises in  accordance with the law. Currently the majority of  foreign-funded enterprises are established and operate in  accordance with the law. Nevertheless, there are some highly  problematic enterprises. For instance, a number of them fail to  deliver the capital or technology specified in the contract,  import inferior technology at high costs, operate beyond the  authorized limits, evade paying taxes, infringe upon their  workers' legitimate rights and interests, and set up bogus joint  ventures. The departments responsible take these problems most  seriously and will work out the necessary measures to tighten  supervision and management, urge enterprises to operate in  accordance with the law, and crack down on illegal operations.    In short, China will be even more diligent in the future in  improving the industrial and regional distribution of foreign  investment even as it continues to work to attract more foreign  capital. It will work harder to improve the quality of foreign  investment as well as the economic returns and social benefits  of foreign-funded enterprises. This is where the utilization of  foreign capital is headed in China.</p>

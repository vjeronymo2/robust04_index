			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Appointments: London Stock Exchange: Insurer's payment pleases Third best performance among the Footsie stocks came from General Accident, the composite insurance group, after the board maintained the final dividend in the face of a steep increase in losses over the year. Insurance specialists said fears that General Accident's dividend might have been threatened were strengthened after Royal Insurance passed its payment. Although the loss for the year was in the middle of the market range of forecasts, it included a significant transfer to reserves. Stock market analysts were favourably impressed at the post-results meeting with the company, Mr Youssef Ziai at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew describing the shares as 'good value on such a small premium to asset value.' The shares raced up 18 to 455p on heavy turnover of 4.7m, with income funds keen buyers. There was hefty switching out of General Accident and into Willis Corroon, the insurance broker. Willis jumped 12 to 257p on good turnover of 2.2m. General Accident's confidence in maintaining the dividend gave a boost to Sun Alliance - due to report on April 1 - which put on 7 to 270p. Abbey switch An initially favourable reception for Abbey National's preliminary figures gave way to straightforward selling of the stock as well as switching into other banking issues. The immediate reaction was to hoist the shares to 307p. Thereafter they came under persistent pressure, closing a net 11 lower at 292p as analysts reassessed the outlook following the post-results meeting with the company. Turnover reached a hefty 9.2m shares. Mr Chris Wheeler at Shearson Lehman described the figures as 'fine,' but said the market was now focusing on the recovery plays in the sector rather than on defensive merits. He said the downside in the shares was limited but then 'so is the upside.' Mr John Wrigglesworth at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew turned seller for the first time since Abbey was privatised. 'We recommend a switch into Lloyds which we expect to double profits in two years,' he said. Lloyds rose 6 to 426p, while Barclays moved up 9 to 371p. Fisons upset Healthcare group Fisons dropped back after announcing results largely in line with City expectations, but containing a number of unwelcome elements. Most concerns concentrated on company comments at the post-results analysts meeting over Inferon, the group's anaemia drug, which has yet to be cleared by the US authorities. Chairman Mr Patrick Egan hinted that if the drug failed to meet US standards, it could be withdrawn. Together with the Opticrom hay fever treatment, also sidelined in the US, analysts complained that it was difficult to make recommendations on the stock. Other anxieties included continuing debate over the vacant chief executive's post, and some analysts raising questions over Fisons strategy. Profit forecasts for 1992 were largely unchanged in the Pounds 220m-230m range. The shares, down 21 at one stage, rallied to close at 384p, for a net loss of 9 on the day. Volume was a hectic 6.4m. Ladbroke easier Uncertainty ahead of trading figures tommorrow from Ladbroke Group saw the shares slip 6 1/2 to 225 1/2 p in busy turnover of 3.9m. Barclays de Zoete Wedd downgraded the leisure group, mainly on continuing worries over Ladbroke's exposure to depressed property markets, both in the UK and the US. Analyst Mr Peter Hilliar said: 'Ladbroke's property portfolio is concentrated in the central London and north-east US seaboard office markets, which have been particularly hard hit in the downturn.' BZW has lopped Pounds 92m off the property division's asset value and is consequently forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 192.5m against Pounds 210m previously. These will still be satisfactory, says BZW, but the house is moving to a short-term sell. Smith New Court, which also reviewed the stock yesterday, remains more bullish, with Mr Peter Joseph, part of the leisure team, optimistic on hotel disposals bolstering the balance sheet. Smith's forecast remains at Pounds 210m. Recurring talk of a price war in the DIY market - Ladbroke owns the Texas Homecare chain - also added to the negative sentiment. The regional electricity companies were strongly supported and made good progress after BZW highlighted the attractions of the sector which it said now largely discounts the possibility of a Labour victory in the forthcoming general election. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was also said to have been a keen supporter of the sector. BZW also favoured the Scottish electricity companies, as did Smith New Court, where the electricity analyst described the two issues as the premier stocks in the sector. Mr Alistair Buchanan at Smith said the two stocks offer fundamental value and told clients to buy the shares up to 120p. The Electricity Package jumped 55 to Pounds 2925, while Scottish Hydro edged ahead to 105 1/2 p. Scottish Power held steady at 103p. Speculation about a possible rights issue hit Cadbury Schweppes ahead of today's results. The market is looking for 1991 profits of about Pounds 310m compared with Pounds 279.6m the previous year. Fears of a cash call pushed the shares down 9 to 463p, but Mr Carl Short, at Nomura Research, said the company has spent some time restructuring its debt and there appears to be no need for a rights issue unless a large acquisition is contemplated. He added that the shares have been strong recently and this may have tempted investors to take profits. Although there were few surprises at Granada Group AGM yesterday, the shares rose as the market took heart from the positive tone from the management over prospects for BSkyB. Policies on cost-cutting, quality and strategy were also reaffirmed, the shares adding 9 to 250p in good volume of 4.4m. Switching operations saw Wembley partly-paid the third biggest turnover stock of the day with 9.4m shares recorded. The shares were firm at 3p, the fully-paid edging a half-penny to 33p. Pharmaceutical group Glaxo Holdings gained 13 to 798p as US buyers moved into the market. Wellcome continued to tumble as buyers stayed away on the implications of Monday's share sale announcement by the Wellcome Trust. The shares lost 41 to 1,025p. Fears of a price war among the large do-it-yourself chains continued to cast a cloud over the store sector. Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, fell 4 to 541p and the 'A' shares in WH Smith, with its interest in Do-It-All, lost 3 to 463p. Meanwhile WH Smith increased its presence in the US through the purchase of 59 recorded music stores for an undisclosed sum. The expected flotation of Hillsdown Holdings' housebuilding subsidiary, Fairview New Homes, encouraged a further recovery of 8 to 162p, on turnover of 3.9m shares. Food groups, spotlighted on Monday, as potential bid targets gave up some of their gains. Spanish supermarket operator, Ashley Group, declined 3 to 47p, while food manufacturer Dalepak fell 15 to 418p. The large UK food retailers gained ground as safe havens ahead of the general election. Argyll put on 2 1/2 to 336 1/2 p and J. Sainsbury improved 7 to 394p. News of a Pounds 500m missile order for British Aerospace helped the shares initially but they drifted back to end only 2 up at 327p after analysts said the order had been expected. Shares in Serco Group jumped 9 to 624p after the company reported a 21 per cent rise in full year profits to Pounds 5.2m, and increased the dividend from 10.6p to 11.9p. Siebe retreated initially on accountancy practice worries but calls to analysts to reassure the market saw the shares bounce to end only 2 down at 577p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (71).

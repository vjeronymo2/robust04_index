			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TASK FORCE FORMED TO STUDY LEGALIZING OF STREET VENDORS;  </P> <P> WOO SAYS L.A.'S LAWS ARE TOUGHEST OF ANY MAJOR CITY  </P> <P> Maria Elena Chacon sat silently on the steps of City Hall on Friday morning,  another face in the crowd as Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo announced  plans for a task force on legalized street vending.  </P> <P> Unlike many onlookers, however, Chacon had more than a passing interest in the  proceedings. The Salvadoran refugee, who supports her family by selling food  and clothing on the streets of her inner-city neighborhood, said she is tired  of police cracking down on her business.  </P> <P> "My friends and I have been arrested; they've confiscated our goods; they've  even taken our personal belongings," the 32-year-old Chacon said through an  interpreter. "All of us are afraid right now. . . . We fled from oppression. We  expected to find more opportunity here."  </P> <P> Chacon is looking for answers from Woo's task force, which will spend the next  three months studying ways to legalize street vending. The task force, made up  of business people, police and vendors, was appointed by Woo and will make  recommendations to the city.  </P> <P> Chacon and other vendors, selling everything from hot dogs to hydrangeas, say  it is time Los Angeles joined other like-sized cities in legalizing the street  sale of goods.  </P> <P> "This is a problem that the city should have taken into account a long time  ago," said Francisco Flores, who heads the Assn. of Ambulatory Street Vendors,  a group of about 200 people who make their living from outdoor sales. "People  should be able to sell comfortably on the streets, especially when you  (realize) that this is a city of immigrants."  </P> <P> Woo said he supports the vendors. While the councilman did not offer any  specific proposals for legalizing street vending, he agreed that there is no  reason why local vendors should be hounded off of the streets.  </P> <P> "This city has the most restrictive street vending ordinances of any major city  in the country, maybe even the world," Woo said. "That's absurd. Properly  regulated, street vending adds vitality to the streets of a city. It also  provides a livelihood for immigrants."  </P> <P> Street vending has been a problematic issue in Los Angeles for years. While an  estimated 2,000 vendors, many of them Central Americans, ply their trade here,  city laws prohibit the great majority of curbside sales. Past efforts at  legalization have met some resistance from merchants, who say street vendors  interfere with business. Others say a health hazard is posed by the open air  sale of such food items as baked goods, fresh fruit and frozen desserts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Health  </P> <P> But Woo said there should be a way to regulate the industry to everyone's  satisfaction. He said certain "street sale zones" could be established.  Licensing could also be restricted to certain items that do not pose a threat  to area businesses or the public health, he added.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Capt. Gregory R. Berg, who joined Woo at the press  conference, said police would welcome a change in the laws, because they have  better things to do than arrest street vendors.  </P> <P> "It's refreshing to see the city doing something about this problem," Berg  said. "This is a good opportunity for us to make some sense of a persistent  irritation."  </P> <P> Under current city laws, flowers and hot dogs are among the only items that can  be legally sold on the streets. Flower vending is allowed within the confines  of the city's central business district and hot dog sales are permitted if  local health codes are met.  </P> <P> Albert Sappietro, an immigrant from Argentina who operates a downtown hot dog  cart, said street vending offers newcomers one of their best opportunities for  success.  </P> <P> "This is better than any other job I've had," said Sappietro, who spent several  months picking grapes. "Besides, people like the idea of walking down the  street with a hot dog and a soda."  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Members of NYSE turn in strong quarter THE New York Stock Exchange reported that its member firms made an after-tax profit of Dollars 1.14bn in the second quarter. This is the second-best performance and further proof that the US securities industry is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The second-quarter earnings comfortably beat the Dollars 859m earned at the same stage a year ago, but did not quite match the Dollars 1.36bn made in the first three months of this year. The combined profits of the first two quarters was Dollars 2.51bn, smashing the previous best first-half performance, which was the Dollars 1.82bn achieved in 1991 and 1983. The NYSE's 315 member firms have enjoyed record profits this year because of low US interest rates which have stimulated record issues of underwritten securities by US corporations, and attracted a flood of investors into the equities and bond markets. Low interest rates have also sharply reduced the cost of securities firms' capital. This has been put to profitable use in domestic and international securities markets, and provided many broking houses with the opportunity to earn big profits from their proprietary trading businesses. The NYSE said its members' strong profits in the April to June period represented an 11.3 per cent annual return on their average net worth of Dollars 40.4bn.</p>

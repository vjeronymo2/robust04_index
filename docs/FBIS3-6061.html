Currently, Korean firms or individuals  wanting to register with local administrative bodies as the  suppliers of goods and services to the U.S. army have to meet a  set of requirements. For instance, the firms should be  capitalized at 50 million won ($62,000) or more, while  individuals need to maintain a minimum daily deposit of 10  million won for one month upon application. In addition, the  suppliers also have to meet certain qualification conditions in  terms of manpower and facilities stipulated by separate business  laws.    The biggest obstacle for the would-be suppliers, however,  has  been the requirement to join a cooperative of purveyors which  awards a clean bill for security to its members, another must to  become a military supplier government officials said. The  capital and qualification requirements will be abolished under  the new rules, which will be fixed at an administrative  deregulation meeting next week. The provision which obligates  the obtaining of security approval will also be removed, the  officials said. As of the end of last month, there were 534  purveyors to the U.S. army, and their 1993 business volume  reached $327 million, they said.</p>

The announcement came after a police investigation linking him  to drug-trafficking activities.    In a televised address to the nation, Paz Zamora said during  his term in office (1989-1993) "there was no crime, but there  were errors," in reference to his relations with Isac Chavarria,  alias Oso, allegedly Bolivia's most notorious drug trafficker.    Paz Zamora appeared dispirited on the television screen. He  stood as he dramatically delivered his statement beside a  crucifix.    The Special Force for the Struggle Against Drug Trafficking  [Fuerza Especial de Luchas Contra el Narcotrafico--FELCN]  revealed this week there are indications that during his  presidential administration, Paz Zamora received and obeyed  instructions from Chavarria to appoint officers in the Armed  Forces and the government.    FELCN also delivered to a parliamentary commission a report  indicating relatives of the former president as well as  distinguished members of the social democratic Movement of the  Revolutionary Left [MIR], Paz Zamora's party, gave protection to  the drug trafficker.    Among the accused are Susana Seleme, Paz Zamora's secretary  when he was president, and MIR leader Oscar Eid.    Colonel Faustino Rico Toro, who in 1991 was appointed  commander in chief of the antidrug struggle, was arrested on 22  March. The U.S. Government asked the Bolivian Government for  his extradition on drug-trafficking charges on 23 March.    In announcing his withdrawal from politics, Paz Zamora,  current vice president of Socialist International, acknowledged  implicitly his relations with Chavarria but said he always acted  in "good faith, close to naivete."    Several MIR leaders and relatives of the former president  have admitted an old friendship united Chavarria and Paz Zamora  who appear together in various old pictures the media have  published.    Although he admitted his "mistakes," Paz Zamora said today  he  is astonished by certain people's "intention to treat  maliciously" his personal relations, referring to his relations  with Chavarria, who is in La Paz' maximum security prison.    The president said the charges against him "have not been  proved" and accused his accusers of "tarnishing my family's  honor."    The former president said he is concerned only with "the  international impact" the charges against him and his party may  have. He said "an effort is being made now to deny the results  of the antidrug struggle" that his government waged, a struggle  that has been acknowledged by the international community, he  claimed.    Since handing the Presidency over to Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada following the 6 June 1993 elections, Paz Zamora has  secluded himself in his private residence in the town of Tarija,  on the border with Argentina.    He made his only public appearance today since then. It came  several months after the first reports of the drug-trafficking  charges against his party, charges that in the past few days  have centered on him.</p>

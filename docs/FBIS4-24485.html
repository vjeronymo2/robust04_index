			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamed is confident that the uptrend of  Malaysian-Chinese relations will be further reinforced in the  future.    He said this in his message to his Chinese counterpart Li  Peng today on the occasion of the 20th anniversary (May 31) of  the founding of the diplomatic relations between the two  countries.    "Links between Malaysia and China actually stretched a long  way back into history, but it is only over the last two decades  that our bilateral relationship has reached a new level of  understanding and cooperation," Mahathir said.    "The policy of friendly relations with neighboring countries  has encouraged positive developments in our bilateral relations,  particularly in recent years," he said.    He added: "In the past five years or so, bilateral relations  have increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation.    "I am confident that this trend will be further reinforced  in  the years to come. Aside from the rapid increase in economic  cooperation, trade and investment, cooperation in other fields  such as tourism, cultural exchanges and people-to-people  contacts will further encourage better understanding and  friendship between Malaysia and China."</p>

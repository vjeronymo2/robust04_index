			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Electricity generators to escape monopolies reference Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry's regulator, is today expected to announce that National Power and PowerGen, the UK's two largest power generators, will not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The move will clear the way for the government to sell its 40 per cent stake in the companies later this year, probably in July or October, and realise at least Pounds 4bn of the Pounds 5.5bn target it is aiming to raise from privatisation receipts in the next financial year. The sum the government will raise may grow significantly in the next few months as the two companies' share prices have been held back by fears of a possible reference. Shares in both companies, and in the entire electricity sector, were down yesterday amid market uncertainty over Prof Littlechild's announcement today. PowerGen fell 17p to 525p and National Power 12p to 461p. However, in a statement of more than 20 pages, Prof Littlechild will say that both National Power and PowerGen 'have agreed to give undertakings such that a reference is not required'. It is thought that the generators have agreed with the regulator that prices in the electricity pool - through which suppliers like the regional electricity companies buy their power supplies - should not rise above a certain level. The most likely cap is for two years at between 2.4p and 2.55p per kilowatt hour, about 7 per cent below levels in the first half of the 1994-95 year. Today's statement is also likely to include reference to the possibility of generators selling some of their power stations to other companies. Immediate disposals are unlikely, however. Prof Littlechild promised last July to make an early decision on a reference after a sharp rise in pool prices. He has missed two deadlines to make a decision, promised at first for 1993 and then for mid-January this year. The generators play a crucial role in the determination of pool prices. They bid a series of prices for each of their power stations for every half hour of the day. The main determinant of prices is the price of the most expensive plant needed to supply electricity throughout the country in any half hour period. Critics of the pool system say it gives the generators too much power and that the generators effectively operate a duopoly. However, few critics supported a reference, which they believe would affect the whole electricity supply industry. Prof Littlechild has been keen to see the generators selling some of their power stations since this would increase competition and, he believes, reduce prices. London stocks, Page 40</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, it may not be feasible in some cases to design two credible alternative instruments. For those cases, the test would involve one alternative instrument reflecting either an expansion or a contraction of the environmental insult from that described by the base instrument. This would be the least preferred test. In all cases, trustee officials would be required to document the rationale for the selected scope test. The Department solicits comments on the need for and desirability of such a hierarchy of preferred scope tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the scaled instruments were pretested, all three instruments would be employed in a split sample design. Since inferences to the relevant population would not be part of a scope analysis, true probability sampling would not be required and convenience samples could be employed so long as random assignment of the different treatments were maintained. Trustee officials would endeavor to employ large samples in these analyses since changes in scope could be small and large samples may be needed to attain significant differences in WTP. Trustee officials would be free to demonstrate sensitivity to scope using statistical techniques of their choosing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The validity of the scope test could depend on the respondents' perception of differences in the scope dimensions across the three treatments. Trustee officials would include questions that could be used to determine whether respondents understood and found credible the description of the injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three-scenario approach would not be required when trustee officials provided a reasonable showing that it was infeasible due to considerations of cost or lack of plausibility of the scenarios. In such circumstances, trustee officials could perform the analysis using only the original scenario and one alternative scenario. However, as CV surveys are routinized and their costs fall, trustee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials may find that the three-scenario analysis is feasible in most cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concern has been expressed that differences between the scenarios not be so large that passing the scope test would be a foregone conclusion, nor so small that it would be very difficult to demonstrate statistical differences without extremely large (and costly) split samples. The issue is complicated by the possibility, based on the State of Alaska-sponsored study of the Exxon Valdez spill, that a significant minority of the population may be insensitive to any reasonable differences in scenarios: Some individuals may not be willing to pay anything for any environmental cleanup, others may be willing to pay unrealistically high (and invariant) amounts for any size environmental cleanup. In response to this concern, NOAA has proposed that trustee officials should develop procedures for identifying and eliminating these responses, so that the demonstration that the scenarios are meaningfully different would rest on the remaining participants. To accept the scenarios for the scope test, no more than 95 percent of the remaining participants could indicate that the differences between the scenarios were real and meaningful, i.e. that the values of the respective commodities differed. The Department is seeking comment on ways to design such a procedure to demonstrate differences in scenarios, and on alternative schemes to achieve a comparable goal. For example, should ``insensitive'' individuals be excluded from the survey and, if so, how should such individuals be identified? How should the threshold defining ``meaningful differences'' be characterized? Should the threshold criterion for determining ``meaningful difference'' be adjusted, since individuals impose internal consistency on their answers in the face of direct comparisons (recognizing much finer differences than in split samples)? Once a procedure has been developed to determine if individuals are sensitive to the scope of the environmental insult, should this information be incorporated into the selection of the sample for the scope test?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While NOAA's proposed rule would require a split sample with multiple scenarios for demonstrating the scope test, the Department seeks comment on the option of alternatively using an indirect test to explain variation in WTP as a function of a set of explanatory variables, including belief in the size of the damage scenario, and/or effectiveness of the prevention or restoration program. Commenters should consider under what circumstances such an indirect test should be allowed for performing the scope test. An indirect approach examines the sensitivity to scope indirectly through the use of a WTP valuation function, relying entirely on the base instrument. In the context of a single dichotomous choice referendum (or a double-bounded formulation), a WTP valuation function may relate the probability of a yes vote to a list of variables assumed to underlie the voting decision (e.g., the amount the household is asked to pay, household demographics, etc.). The indirect approach may expand this list to include variables based on information collected from respondents that are related to the scope dimensions of the discharge or release. These measures must be meaningful to the respondent given the information provided in the survey. For example, a useful question following the WTP elicitation question is one that asks whether the respondent believed the injuries caused by the discharge or release to be more or less severe than described. All other things being equal (i.e. similar preferences, budget constraints, etc.), respondents believing the injuries to be worse than described, and having equal confidence in the prospects for restoring the injured resources through the offered plan, might be willing to pay more. Such a finding would be an indirect verification of scope sensitivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taha Yasin Ramadan, Revolution Command Council  member and vice president, has called for spreading health  awareness among citizens and enhancing ways to prevent disease  through domestic educational programs and popular seminars in  the cities and villages of our great Iraq in order to prevent  illnesses before treating them.    During a meeting with the head and members of the Iraqi Red  Crescent Society, Ramadan described the suffering of the sons of  our people, particularly the children and elderly, due to the  blockade and resulting shortage of medicines as the crime of the  age, a violation of human rights, and an encroachment on divine  values and international charters.    The vice president added that the continued food and  medicine  blockade on the Iraqi people has exposed both the enemies of  mankind and those who are using the defense of human rights,  peoples' freedom, and peoples' prosperity, as a disguise. He  noted the importance of moves by charitable and humanitarian  organizations to reject the U.S.-led hostile policy which is  implemented by the U.S. allies who are fighting the Iraqi people  using food and medicines after they failed to harm them through  a wide military aggression.    Dr. Sa'dun Khalifah, head of the Society, reviewed its  efforts to alleviate the illnesses which the children and  elderly are suffering as a result of the continued blockade.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE ARREST WIFE OF MAN SUSPECTED OF KILLING COMPOSER  </P> <P> A woman whose husband was arrested in the fatal stabbing of a Hollywood Hills  television composer has also been taken into custody in connection with the  murder, Los Angeles police said Friday.  </P> <P> Michelle Purugganan, 20, was arrested late Thursday night in a Riverside motel  room she was sharing with the couple's two small children. Riverside police  found her at the Arlington Motor Lodge only four hours after her husband,  Juanito Pascua Purugganan, was arrested in connection with last week's slaying  of 29-year-old composer Doug Timm, said Detective Rick Swanston of the Los  Angeles Police Department.  </P> <P> Their 2 1/2-year-old daughter and 10-month-old son were being cared for by  grandparents in Santa Ana, Swanston said.  </P> <P> The couple is being held without bail on suspicion of murder. They are expected  to be arraigned next week, but no date has been set.  </P> <P> Juanito Purugganan, 29, was arrested Thursday about 6 p.m. while driving Timm's  sports car through Riverside, but Michelle and the children were not with him.  Swanston said Purugganan directed police to his wife and children.  </P> <P> The detective alleged that the couple killed Timm to rob him of the expensive  recording equipment the composer kept in his two-story home. He said police are  also investigating the possibility that the suspects may have been involved in  similar crimes in Los Angeles County and surrounding areas, but he declined to  elaborate.  </P> <P> The detective said the partially decomposed body of Timm, who worked on scores  for television programs such as "The New Mike Hammer" and "Designing Women,"  was found Wednesday at the bottom of a living room stairwell in his home in the  6900 block of Camrose Drive.  </P> <P> Swanston said Timm was stabbed several times in the upper torso -- probably  with a 12-inch butcher knife recovered from his home -- either on July 21 or  July 22.  </P> <P> Timm, who lived alone but was engaged, had invited the Purugganans to his home  following a "chance meeting" in Hollywood, Swanston said.  </P> <P> "It looks like he had known them for a very short period of time, probably less  than a week," the detective said.  </P> <P> The day before the Purugganans were arrested, Swanston said, police officers  recovered "several thousand dollars worth" of the dead composer's keyboards and  digital recording equipment from the Long Beach home of an acquaintance of the  suspects. The man said the Purugganans sold him the items, the officer said.  </P> <P> "The man who bought the equipment became suspicious about the circumstance and  started making inquiries," Swanston said. "Eventually, he and the police made  contact."  </P> <P> After Timm's body was found, the man's statements helped police track down  Juanito, who was arrested Thursday as he drove Timm's black 1987 Toyota MR-2  sports car.  </P> <P> Swanston described the couple as drifters who had recently returned to Los  Angeles after living for several years in Hawaii, where they worked as a waiter  and waitress.  </P> <P> "They seemed to be very transient," Swanston said Friday. "Apparently, in the  last few months, they have just been street people."  </P> <P> He said the Purugganans were married three years ago -- when Juanito divorced  Michelle's mother to marry her.  </P> <P> "He had been with Michelle's mother for about six or seven years," Swanston  said. "He was (Michelle's) stepfather for a period of time, but he left her  mother for the daughter."  </P></p>

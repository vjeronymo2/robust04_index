			<p>BFN     [Text] Asked how the next government should be created,  Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, of  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], in an interview with  reporters at the Diet building on 25 June, stressed the need to  create a "conservatives-conservatives alliance" -- composed of  such conservative forces as Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  the LDP -- saying: "I hope a stable government will be formed  with those who share the same views. Even if the right and left  wingers get together, they will agree with the plan in principle  but oppose it in practice. What we need are tolerate minds to  iron out minor difference of opinions for the best common  interests."</p>

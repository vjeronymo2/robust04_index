			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent Valeriy Golovin: </F> "Will It Be Necessary To Open Up the Far East All Over Again?"]    [Text] Taking into account the extreme situation that  has taken form in the economy of Khabarovsk Kray in connection  with the liberalization of prices for energy sources and the  raising of transport rates, and also with a view to stabilizing  the socioeconomic situation in the kray, the Council of  Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation  decrees:    1. The State Committee of the Russian Federation  Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North, the  Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian  Federation Ministry of Finance, jointly with the administration  of Khabarovsk Kray, shall, before 1 January 1994, present to the  Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation a  proposal on the inclusion of the entire territory of Khabarovsk  Kray on the list of localities that are considered pertaining to  the Far North by virtue of the conditions of delivery and  transport of output of production and technical designation and  of consumer goods.    2. The Russian Federation Ministry of Finance, the  Russian Federation Ministry of Economics, and the Russian  Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy, for the maintenance of  the cost of one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy at the level  of 40 rubles [R] (rated cost), shall provide for the  apportionment to the Khabarovsk Kray Administration of R19.6  billion from the Russian Federation's republic budget, as a  selective targeted subsidy for November-December 1993, for  compensation for the difference between the cost of electrical  energy put out by the Khabarovskenergo joint-stock company and  the rated cost....    (From the government decree "On Measures for  Stabilization of the Socioeconomic Situation in Khabarovsk Kray  for 1993-1994." Analogous documents were adopted for Maritime  Kray and Sakhalin Oblast.)    Khabarovsk--Last August, during a trip around the eastern  regions of the country, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin promised  that the state would, without fail, close out its debt to the  defense complex in September. And of course, he vowed, the  government would not allow the economic potential of the Far  East and the Transbaykal region, which occupy more than 40  percent of the entire Russian territory, and which for that  reason play an important geopolitical role in the fate of the  whole country, to collapse utterly. "We came here in order to  examine the problems and to try to come to some solution," said  Viktor Stepanovich, at a meeting in Khabarovsk Kray.    "Not only have the circumstances in the region after your  visit only failed to stabilize, they have gotten worse," reads  the address to V.S. Chernomyrdin and signed by the heads of  administration of nine eastern krays and oblasts five months  later. The authors of the message explain the situation that has  taken shape by an inadequate appraisal of the specific features  of the region and by a disregard on the part of the central  authorities for the interests of the Far East. The ministries  and departments are in no hurry to carry out the government  decree, which was adopted in October-December of last year with  respect to individual territories of this extensive kray.  Although there has been little success with the concrete  promises that were made during last year's trips, either (at  that time, in addition to the prime minister, almost all of his  deputies also visited the East).    If a few months ago, the defense plants of the Amur region  were demanding R30-40 billion of the government for output  already produced, today this debt has reached R70 billion.  Because of a shortage of financial resources, many enterprises  are operating at only 30-50 percent of production capacity. And  since enterprises of the military-industrial complex in the Far  East have a significant specific gravity, they are objectively  turning into a millstone around the neck of the regional  economy. Should we be surprised that at the end of last year the  slump in production in that same Khabarovsk Kray amounted to 22  percent?    Other state programs are also being carried out in an  analogous way. For example, in 1993 the Amur region was allotted  only 37 percent of the funds it needed from the federal budget  for the construction of housing for servicemen who had been  released into the reserves. As a result, it was possible here to  rent out only 15,000 square meters of new living space, instead  of 70,000. The agro-industrial complex received an amount that  was short approximately R10 billion from the budget. The large  debt that Moscow owes the people of the Amur region is also for  the organization of freight deliveries to the northern regions.  Last year they delivered everything necessary there on a timely  basis. But the government is to this day in no hurry to  apportion all of the financial resources promised for this.    At the Khabarovsk Kray Economics Committee it was calculated  that, in order to resolve the territory's most burning problems  today, about R100 billion is necessary. One should take into  account the fact that the Amur region, by virtue of its  remoteness, must endure the pressure of completely impossible  transport rates and must pay more for energy resources. All of  this is shifted to the output produced here, which becomes  simply noncompetitive because of its high price.    How to get out of this dead-end situation--where to find the  money necessary for this? At the end of January, Viktor Ishayev,  head of the kray administration, was compelled to introduce an  emergency regime in the area of financial guarantees. It was not  from good living that he, at one press conference, even  announced the temporary cessation of tax appropriations to the  federal budget. True, Aleksandr Katsuba, head of the finance  administration, later hastened to explain to the journalists  that they had misunderstood the governor.... Although, if you  think about it, the people of Amur region have absolutely  nothing to deduct in any case.    Everyone needs money today. The deputy head of the  Khabarovsk  Kray administration, who is also the chairman of the economics  committee, Aleksandr Levintal, with whom I talked about today's  situation in the Amur region, is convinced that until the  government, for populist considerations, just patches up the  financial holes, the federal budget will remind us of Trishka's  caftan, which unraveled in another place every time a hole was  mended. The main thing, Levintal believes, should still be the  balancing of the budget, oriented, as much as possible, on  tomorrow. At the very least, it is important to the people of  the Far East that the offices in Moscow take heed of the  specific peculiarities of a region that is compelled, simply by  virtue of its remoteness, to bear considerable expenses and  outlays.    But standing up for their righteousness, the local  administration workers must, sometimes not without a fight,  overcome rigid barriers of the simply inimitable government  bureaucracy. A. Levintal cited this example. In the Decree "On  Measures for Stabilization of the Socioeconomic Situation in  Khabarovsk Kray for 1993-1996," which was signed by V.  Chernomyrdin back on 4 December, the Ministry of Economics and  the Ministry of Finance were to work out within a month's time a  proposal on the targeted allocation of 20 percent of customs  duties for the development of the foreign economic  infrastructure of the Amur region. But for the bureaucrats this  document of the prime minister's did not signify a call to  action. First of all, if that was necessary for the Far  Easterners, then they themselves should come to Moscow and  collect all the numerous signatures, again independently pushing  the necessary documents through the necessary levels. Otherwise,  they simply get lost in government folders. So this is already  the second month that they are wandering the corridors of power.  In the second place, the formula "work out and introduce for  approval" by no means signifies that this should be done some  time in the future. Today, for example, the negative attitude  toward the given point in the government decree of the currency  department of the Ministry of Finance is well known. Planning on  sending this 20 percent of the collected duties for the  construction of border customs crossings in Khabarovsk Kray, it  is orienting itself on the interests of Russia. After all, the  deductions from the profit received during the exploitation of  the customs crossings would be covered by none other than the  federal budget. Does Moscow really not understand this?    In the end, it must be taken into account that only more  than  [as published] 10 million people live in the Far East and  Transbaykal, which occupy, as I have already said, more than 40  percent of Russian territory. To ignore the interests of people  who live under more than specific conditions is more than  unwise. Let us just hope that in the near future we will not  need a new Dezhnev and Khabarov to again open up and develop in  Russia these severe but amazing parts.</p>

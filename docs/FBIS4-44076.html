			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [New conference by European Commission President Jacques </F> Delors and Andreas Papandreou, Greek prime minister and European  Union president, with foreign and domestic correspondents at the  Municipal Theater in Corfu--live; Delors speaks in French with  simultaneous translation into Greek]    [Excerpts] [Karelias] Yeoryios Karelias, from the newspaper  ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Mr. Delors, during the period when Greece held  the European Union [EU] Presidency it was criticized, not only  by the press, that it was taking advantage of the presidency to  promote a serious, national issue. I am referring to the issue  of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM].  However, Greece never reached the point of sabotaging a serious  EU decision. During the past two days in Corfu we have seen that  at least one country was led to the point of sabotaging the  election of your successor to the Commission for clearly  domestic reasons. How do you comment? I would also like the  prime minister to comment on this.    [Delors] The only thing we can say about the incidents  regarding the election of a new European Commission president is  that this is not just an issue about a person. It is also an  issue of ruling out people according to intentions about  Europe's construction. This is why this crisis is important.    [Papandreou] I would like to add that Mr. Leon Brittan  resigned from running for the position. Therefore, the British  insistence not to accept the proposal of the others was possibly  due to a completely different perception of the meaning of a  United Europe and of the obligations of being a member. Is this  a satisfactory answer, Mr. Karelias?    [Correspondent] (Kimgeton) Sky News, London. A question for  President Delors and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. Could  you answer in English for the national television? What do you  think is the message stemming from failing to elect a European  Commission president? What is the message regarding democratic  procedures, the message that we sent to the rest of the world?  Will new candidates emerge before 15 July?    [Delors] From my point of view it is better not to add any  comment right now because the German presidency will take over  the weight of finding a solution, an agreement. If we enter a  battle on this issue we will redefine the achievement of the  German Presidency. Excuse me, but I think that right now it is  in the European Union's interest not to add any comment on the  current answer.    [Papandreou] I would like to answer the question myself. We  proposed that we follow--and we did follow--a very democratic  procedure. Every member state proposed a ranking of the three  candidates. The numerical superiority of Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene came out democratically. Following that,  everybody but Britain supported Dehaene. So, we followed a  democratic procedure but Great Britain literally vetoed this  procedure and did not accept this decision. I have to say that  I do not know what Great Britain will know in two or three  weeks, when the next meeting is held, that it does not know now.  This is a problem because I believe the rest of us will  continue to support Dehaene's candidacy. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] For Mr. Delors first. During  the news conference held in Zappion Palace in January 1994, you  stressed the need to maintain a family-spirit climate, as you  said, regarding relations among the partners. Do you believe  that Greece's reference to the European Court is a gesture  within this framework?    The question for the Greek Prime Minister concerns Cyprus'  application for EU membership. What is the difference between  the reference in the conclusions of today's summit and the  respective reference in the conclusions of the Copenhagen summit?    [Delors] Madame, I believe there is a political dimension in  your question on which I have never expressed any view. There  is also a legal dimension. The foreign ministers reminded us  that the European Commission is a trustee of conditions. This  means that the issue should have been referred to the European  Court where Greece presented its arguments. Not implementing  the treaty would have been a political decision. We have  specific jurisdiction and duties that are attributed to us by  the treaties. We have the authority and the monopoly, I would  say, of submitting proposals. We must implement the decisions  of the European Council, and we are trustees of the conditions  within the framework of our jurisdiction. This is the job we  are doing. It was unpleasant but we did it.    [Papandreou] Mr. Pangalos will reply to the question on  Cyprus.    [Pangalos] I do not suppose you have in your hands the text  of the conclusions, because if you did you would have seen the  difference. First of all, Cyprus is now included in the  candidate states chapter. It is not a separate Cyprus issue  with all of its extensions, but it is contained in the candidate  states chapter, that is the expansion. There are two important  references to the development of relations with Cyprus. It is  noted that both sides of these relations, the trade-technical  aspect and the financial aspect, fall within the prospect of  accession. Finally, there is an explicit commitment that Cyprus  and Malta will be included in the next expansion. The reference  also mentions Hungary and Poland. Regarding Turkey, the European  Council characteristically notes only the convening of a  meeting--which would happen anyway--that will deal with  concluding the customs union agreement. I recall that the  European Union pursues the customs union agreement, but the  Turkish side is in no position to conclude it. I believe this  is a significant development and I believe that I have answered  your question, which was without reason.    [Correspondent] [name indistinct] representing the Yugoslav  News Agency. A question for Prime Minister Papandreou. Mr.  President, after six months of a very successful presidency  during which you pointed out many times the urgent need for  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, do you believe that a just solution  will be found soon and, if so, when? Also, what are the details  of the peace plan that you have been discussing at the EU summit  regarding the policy of the contact group that is playing a very  crucial role but we know nothing about?    [Papandreou] I will ask Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias  to  answer the question.    [Papoulias] The EU effort for finding a just and permanent  solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina was continuous, and the EU peace  plan still guides the EU efforts toward a solution. I believe  the contact group continues its work and thoughts are being  discussed about a second Geneva meeting. The visit of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian foreign minister  provided the opportunity for meetings for a better preparation  of a second Geneva meeting. The discussion we had on Friday  night [24 June] at the working dinner--international mediators  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were present--gave us  adequate hope that the contact group's efforts will have a  positive outcome in the next few weeks and that a more general  solution, especially on the territorial problem, will be found.    [Unidentified correspondent] President Delors, do you rule  out the possibility that we will have the pleasure of seeing you  in the same position for the next five years? And how do you  believe the four new countries will mainly affect the European  Union's course?    [Delors] Regarding your first question, I rule out such a  possibility. On the second question, despite Papandreou's  efforts and the fact that we must realize that the four  candidates are fully respected by him and me, I would have  preferred that during their first EU summit, the four new member  states not attend discussions on the election of my successor.  I was particularly happy with the reaction on the white paper  because we ascertained that these are countries with economic  and social democracy, which are firmly connected to the  political democracy. These are countries that really attribute  particular significance in finding a new development model.  These are countries that have made superb experiments about  managing the labor market and devoted two or three times more  means--human and financial--than we did. Therefore, they are  countries that agreed on all issues that are contained in the  white paper. This really pleased us because the presence of the  four countries enriches us in the fight against unemployment and  the promotion of the community's social and environmental  dimension.    [Evstathiadhis] Evstathiadhis from the newspaper VIMA. A  question for Prime Minister Papandreou. It has been  determined--you have also said it in writing--that the EU people  did not show great interest in the idea of a union. This has  also been proven in the recent European Parliament election. In  your opinion, what is the message that the Corfu summit gives to  the European people on how to become more active in favor of the  United Europe's ideas and realities?    [Papandreou] Undoubtedly, the latest European Parliament  elections proved that the European people are only slightly  interested in the course of a United Europe. This is a  phenomenon that must be examined. However, we can add the  following: With the passage of time and the escalating role of  the European Parliament and given that many of the national  decisions will be dictated by our capacity as members of the  United Europe, I believe that this course will be overturned. I  have no fuller explanation.    [Unidentified correspondent] My question is for both Mr.  Delors and Mr. Papandreou. Europe very much wants to be a  single family. Within the framework of the EU summit, did you  discuss the issue of the Greek border and FYROM [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and the Greek embargo against it?    [Delors] No, we did not discuss this issue but having  presided at the dinner of the European Union Foreign Ministers,  Mr. Papoulias could tell you something more.    [Papoulias] Indeed, at the EU Foreign Ministers meeting I  briefed my colleagues on the contacts between the Greek  Government, mine personally, with UN mediator Cyrus Vance. You  are aware that I will be in New York in a few days to meet Vance  and U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz in an effort to find  a solution to this problem.    [Pelekis] Nikolaos Pelekis from FLASH radio. Mr. President  and Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask whether Britain's  decision not to consent with the unanimous election for Delors'  successor, sets in motion a serious crisis within the European  Union and what could this mean for EU's unity? How serious is  the crisis?    [Papandreou] Right now it is difficult for someone to  evaluate this. If such a stance is maintained, then we would be  able to speak about a crisis. Today was an unfortunate event  that somewhat stained the overall work of the EU summit, which  was excellent. If it continues, then it would mean something  deeper. I do not want to predict a big crisis right now. I do  not want to make predictions. Thank you.</p>

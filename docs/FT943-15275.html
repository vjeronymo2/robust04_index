			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Smiles all round in readiness for a scrap next year - A look at the harmony in Naples as G7 leaders agree to look at what world institutions are needed It was a case of smiles all round at this year's double decker summit in Naples of the Group of Seven and the 'political G8,' comprising the G7 plus Russia. The marked improvement of the industrial world's economy, the completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks earlier this year and the absence of any truly bruising rows made for a harmonious, if rather bland, gathering. Next year could be different. When they meet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will begin reviewing the institutions of global co-operation with the intention of making them more suitable for the post cold-war world. Taken to its logical conclusion, this could mean big changes for some of the smaller members of the G7 club. The world has been transformed since the first economic summit in 1975. Communism has collapsed and the countries of east Asia have emerged as an economically potent force. Globalisation has greatly increased the interdependence of industrialised and industrialising countries alike. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said yesterday that the international situation was changing at 'bewildering speed'. And yet, as President Bill Clinton pointed out on Saturday, the links among countries are governed and regulated largely by institutions 'that we settled on at the end of World War Two'. With this in mind, the G7 agreed in its communique that next year's summit will ask what institutions will be required to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 'That is a commitment to discuss in Halifax what we want the world to look like 20 years from now,' President Clinton said. The review will encompass those institutions which were set up to foster co-operation in the post-war world, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year, and Nato. It will see how these fit in with newer initiatives such as the European Union, the World Trade Organisation, and the Partnership for Peace. Inevitably, the nature and role of the G7 will be discussed. Although conventionally described as the group of the world's 'leading industrial nations' it imperfectly reflects the global economy. It is heavily Eurocentric, excludes the Hispanic nations (even though Spain can claim to have a bigger economy than Canada) and barely represents Asia. The Group's attempts, in recent years, to co-ordinate economic policy closely have as often ended in failure as success. This was the case when attempts to hold exchange rates steady after the Louvre Accord in 1987 proved detrimental to the overall goal of steady, non-inflationary growth. On the other hand, the G7 heads of government clearly gain some benefit from the meetings. President Francois Mitterrand of France, who at times in the past has been scathing of G7 summitry, said they got through a 'wealth of work in extremely fruitful discussions' at the weekend. The G7 enhances the networking capacity of its members in other groupings. The US, France and Britain are members of the UN Security Council. All except Japan are in Nato. It contains four European Union members; two signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and, with Japan, is represented by three countries in the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. The G7 is especially valued by Japan, which is not represented in Nato, Nafta, the EU or the UN Security Council. The leaders were enthusiastic about the greater informality of the weekend summit and plan an even less scripted approach next year. Mr Major spoke of a 'sea change' in the way the summits are conducted. They also agreed to carry forward to Halifax this year's format of following the G7 economic gathering with a political G8 in which Russia is a full, equal ranking partner. According to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, this recognition of Russia's contribution to global politics was the most important aspect of this year's summit. For President Boris Yeltsin, the highlight was recognition of Russia as a partner and democratic state. If the presence of Russia at yesterday's meeting is any guide, the G7 can claim to have exercised a positive influence in helping the former communist countries along the difficult road to market-based economies. But two big doubts remain. The group is at its most effective when dealing with short-term crises. It is unclear how far seven such different states can reconcile national interests and achieve Mr Clinton's goal of setting the agenda for 20 years hence. Looking ahead to 2014, it is uncertain whether the present G7 membership can be justified. Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday made clear that Russia was not hurrying to join the economic G7, because of its current difficulties, Russia's long-term ambition is to join the group. Four EU nations in its ranks will look even more imbalanced then. There is the also question of Chinese participation if Beijing ever moves to pluralism and democracy. Although Chancellor Kohl yesterday went out of his way to praise the 'better climate of co-operation', such questions will be lurking in the background when the leaders meet in Halifax. As the questions involve pecking order and prestige, they could make for much more vexing discussions than in Naples this year.</p>

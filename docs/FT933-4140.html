			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Japanese cut costs of labour THE economic downturn has forced 60 per cent of Japanese companies to trim employment costs, according to a labour ministry survey, writes William Dawkins. Cars and steel were among the six out of eight sectors surveyed which told the ministry they had less work in late August than earlier in the summer. This bodes ill for the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business confidence, considered the most important indicator of corporate intentions, due out today. Companies' methods of cutting labour costs included staff relocation, practised by 21.6 per cent of the 1,000 companies surveyed; lending employees to other companies, practised by 11.4 per cent; and temporary lay-offs, in the case of 7.6 per cent. A small proportion, 1.5 per cent, have dismissed people or made early retirements. So far, Japanese industry has avoided big redundancies, so that unemployment has been contained at 2.5 per cent, according to official figures. Ministry officials believe widespread redundancies are unlikely because companies fear being short of workers when an upturn materialises.</p>

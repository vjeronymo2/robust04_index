			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas today received separately the  representatives of the political parties not represented in the  coalition government and briefed them on recent developments and  his contacts regarding the Cyprus issue. He first received the  National Unity Party delegation headed by leader Dervis Eroglu  and then the Communal Liberation Party delegation headed by its  leader Mustafa Akinci. Denktas later received the Free  Democratic Party delegation headed by Ismet Kotak, the  Nationalist Justice Party delegation headed by Zorlu Tore and  the Unity and Sovereignty Party delegation headed by Arif Salih  Kirda.    In a statement after the meeting, Eroglu said that the  president briefed them on the recent developments. Pointing out  that it is a mistake to accept the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] package, Eroglu noted that his party has opposed the  CBM's from the very beginning, adding that the Cyprus problem  should be solved in its entirety. Claiming that the CBM package  has been eliminated, Eroglu said that solutions directed toward  the essence of the problem should be sought. Noting that the UN  secretary general should try and bring the two sides together  instead of putting forward proposals, Eroglu said that if a  solution is sought to the Cyprus problem based on where it was  in 1992 then the NUP will oppose it. Pointing out that the  talks should be based on the existence of two states, Eroglu  referred to the UN secretary general's report saying that it  should seek a solution taking into consideration the views of  the people living in Cyprus and not those of the secretary  general himself. Noting that the Turkish Cypriot political  parties should clearly express their wishes, Eroglu added that  everything should be discussed from the very beginning.    Akinci drew attention to the fact that the meeting with the  president was held soon after the UN secretary general's report  was announced adding that such contacts should be held before  everything is concluded. Akinci said that they got the  impression that the report accused the Turkish Cypriot side and  added that currently the rights of the Turkish Cypriot side are  being abused. He added that this report shows that the Turkish  Cypriot side has not been successful in explaining its just  cause in the international field. Pointing out that the thing  to be done now is to achieve a communal conciliation, Akinci  added that only then can one meet on an international platform  to plan the future. Akinci concluded by saying that one cannot  defend a just cause through an intransigent attitude and that  everything is not over yet.</p>

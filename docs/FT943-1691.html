			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch retail sales slip 4% Dutch retail sales fell 4 per cent in the year to July, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported yesterday. July retail sales in the non-food sector were 8 per cent lower than a year earlier, while sales of outer garments in speciality shops were 14 per cent down. The fall reflects last year's boom, as well as unusually hot weather this year. While food sales rose a nominal 1.3 per cent in the year to July, after adjusting for price rises sales fell by 1.3 per cent. Total retail sales, adjusted for inflation, were 5.2 per cent down. In contrast to the retail performance, seasonally adjusted industrial output for July was 3.6 per cent up a year earlier. Sweden's current account showed a surplus of SKr2.8bn in July, but a deficit of SKr0.6bn in the 12 months to July, central bank figures showed, outperforming most expectations. French household spending on manufactured goods rose 1 per cent in July, due to a strong rise in car sales, and rose by 0.4 per cent in August despite a decline in the car sector, national statistics institute Insee said. Italy's industrial output rose an unadjusted 3.8 per cent in July from a year earlier, following the rise in June of 5.3 per cent.</p>

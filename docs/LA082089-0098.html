			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TETTLETON CAN FEEL GOOD IN BAD TIMES  </P> <P> Just when Mickey Lee Tettleton was achieving the ultimate in performance, a  storybook career year and contributing bountifully to a winning team concept,  he was dealt a sudden jolt that literally took his left knee right out from  under him.  </P> <P> The most famous Mickey to come from Oklahoma since Mantle had produced 22 home  runs and was on his way to establishing a record for a Baltimore Orioles  catcher. But then the knee locked and the searching hands of the surgeon  uncovered cartilage damage and a cyst on the upper part of his calf.  </P> <P> The team misses the thunder he can create with a bat, booming home runs and  authoritative line drives. But Tettleton, after an operation 10 days ago,  already has thrown away his crutches and is getting on with rehabilitation.  </P> <P> "I expect to be swinging lightly, off a batting tee, next week," he said the  other day, "and then we'll see how it goes. I don't rule out being able to at  least pinch hit in early September. The only thing Dr. Charles Silberstein  doesn't want me to do is start running. That can wait."  </P> <P> Tettleton has accepted this cruel turn of fate -- which took him out of the  lineup and put him on the disabled list -- with a mature reaction. He knows it  would be foolhardy to start venting his disappointment by breaking up the  living room furniture with one or more swings of his Adirondack bat.  </P> <P> He's too well versed and wise in the vagaries of baseball to let the injury  dismantle his outlook, preferring instead to recount and savor all the good  things that have happened in a remarkable season. This is known as being a  professional.  </P> <P> At a down time like this, Mickey even casually reflects on his days as a high  school and college player. He is especially grateful for the decision that  turned him into a catcher and, consequently, made all this belated rush of  success possible.  </P> <P> Had it not been for the perceptive judgment of his two college coaches, Gary  Ward and Tom Holliday at Oklahoma State, baseball might never have heard of  this mighty Mickey from Oklahoma City. They first awarded him a half  scholarship and decided he would make a good catcher.  </P> <P> "I did a lot of blinking," is how Tettleton looks back in describing the  position transition. He now works three sides of home plate -- swinging from  either side as a switch-hitter and catching behind it.  </P> <P> The important physical mechanics -- the shifting to keep behind the pitch and  give the umpire a better chance to call it a strike, receiving the ball with  soft hands, throwing to all three bases, running down foul flies, blocking home  plate and deciding the sequence of signals -- are all in a day's or a night's  work.  </P> <P> "I didn't become a full-time catcher until I signed in professional baseball  with the Oakland A's," he recalled. "Bob Didier and George Minterwald spent a  lot of time working with me. I had to learn to move with short, quick steps and  be faster throwing the ball; not like in the outfield where you get to sort of  wind up."  </P> <P> Tettleton says the lowest point he experienced came on March 28, 1988, when the  A's gave him an outright release. But, as so often happens, in baseball and in  life, the negative became a positive.  </P> <P> That's when the Orioles called and offered a chance to catch at Rochester,  N.Y., in the International League. He could have signed with other  organizations, notably the Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds  or Montreal Expos.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to be a backup to some phenom coming along," Tettleton said. "I  wanted an opportunity to go to triple-A so I could play, not watch."  </P> <P> That's precisely what the Orioles provided and here he is, a little more than a  year later, blinking his eyes, but not behind the swish of a bat, as he deals  with the reality of it all and how quickly fate can spread an exciting new  hand.  </P> <P> Tettleton went from a veritable nobody to a somebody, and the Orioles, listed  at 400-1 on the preseason oddsboard, have stunned the major leagues by holding  on to first place in the American League's East Division for 93 days.  </P> <P> "I thought coming out of spring training we were a young, talented team and  that our main goal was to play fundamental baseball. I never thought so many  good things would happen to the team and to me. I think we'll keep on winning."  </P> <P> Tettleton's wife, Sylvia, disclosed a family secret when she told sportscaster  Tom Davis in an early-season interview that the reason Mickey was hitting for  consistency and distance was attributable to a packaged breakfast food known as  Froot Loops.  </P> <P> "It brought me a lot of attention and recognition," he remarked, not realizing,  of course, how he has influenced the eating habits of young America. "There are  a lot of Froot Loop boxes coming in the mail for me to autograph. I don't mind  it. If it helps the fans have a good time, then I think that's the important  thing."  </P> <P> Oddly enough for the natural right-hander, 15 of his 22 home runs have come  left-handed.  </P> <P> Tettleton, with an erect stance and arms somewhat close to his body (the  opposite of what most hitting theorists say to do) has been difficult for  pitchers to get out. They've tried everything but novenas to negate him, but  he, before he got hurt, was starting to see more off-speed pitches when he was  ahead in the count.  </P> <P> "I just try to keep my arms comfortable, free of tension. Jim Lefebvre (now the  Seattle manager) worked with me when I was with the A's and Frank Robinson made  the point in the spring I was holding my hands too high. I dropped them down  and that made the swing quicker."  </P> <P> Tettleton is thankful for the opportunity that has come to him and decides it's  much better than what happened to his father, now a director of security for  Safeway Stores in three southwestern states. The New York Yankees wanted to  sign him, but there was a disturbance known as World War II and Roy Tettleton  had to respond -- with his baseball skills deteriorating in the process.  </P> <P> So now Mickey Tettleton contemplates the future, of recovering from the knee  surgery and then resuming a career that has become more noteworthy and exciting  than his boyhood fantasies ever dared let him imagine.  </P></p>

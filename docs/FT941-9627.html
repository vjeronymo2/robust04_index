			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Flight of fancy Our account last week of travellers' difficulties with airlines requires a correction, according to the Air Transport Users Council, a UK body which represents air passengers' interests. Mr David Darby, a London patent agent, received cash compensation for his wife and two children after they were bumped off a flight from the US to London. Mr Darby argued, and Continental Airlines eventually accepted, that compensation was due under European Community regulations because the flight ended in the EC. The Council points out that the regulations apply only to flights departing from the EC. Mr Darby was entitled to compensation, but that was because the flight originated in the US. Passengers bumped off flights leaving the US or the EC are entitled to compensation. In other countries, compensation is entirely at an airline's discretion.</p>

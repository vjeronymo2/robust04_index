			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hoskyns plans job cuts to reduce central overheads HOSKYNS, the computer services company, is making redundant 150 of its 3,000 employees in preparation for what it sees as a long haul to the end of the recession. About one third of the total are senior managers. Mr Geoff Unwin, chairman, said the restructuring move was designed to reduce central overheads while leaving intact staff dealing directly with customers. He said the business plan for the year had been based on a belief that the recession would have started to lift by the end of 1992. Yesterday he said there was no sign of an improvement, 'and no compelling reason why there should be one. We are pessimistic about next year'. The company, which is owned by Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, Europe's leading computing services company, said it would further focus its activities on the finance sector and on outsourcing - running customers' computer systems for them - which have been traditional strengths. The company had a unbroken record of growth until 1991 but the recession has hit the computing services sector hard as prospective customers have postponed or cancelled new projects. At the half-year stage Hoskyns made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.6m on sales of Pounds 95.7m.</p>

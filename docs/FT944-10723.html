			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: AGF cuts jobs at Spanish division Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group which is due to be privatised, is to cut the workforce at its Spanish subsidiary by more than a third in the next three years to try to make it profitable by the end of 1996. The company said yesterday it planned to reduce the 2,100 staff at AGF Union Fenix by more than 730 as part of a series of management initiatives designed to trim costs and reduce its dependency on its parent. Fenix had a Pta35bn (Dollars 277m) deficit last year. AGF gained control of Fenix, the fifth largest insurance company in Spain, earlier this year from Banesto, the Spanish banking group. The French group holds more than 60 per cent of the shares. AGF said it was committed to expanding the operations of Fenix Autos, which it claims is the first telephone insurance service in Spain and now has more than 160,000 customers. It said it was beginning to use the same subsidiary to sell multi-risk household insurance and would increasingly use it for the telemarketing of its products. AGF has invested heavily in Spain as part of its strategy of international expansion, espoused in the late 1980s, to generate 40 per cent of its turnover from operations outside France - a target it achieved last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Nigeria signed  an agreement on promotion and protection of investments Thursday  [7 April], Taiwan's first such accord with an African nation.    The two countries also signed an agreement on cooperation in  export processing zone development.    The two agreements were signed here by P.K. Chiang and  Nigerian Trade and Commerce Minister Melford Okilo on behalf of  their respective governments.    Okilo, who arrived in Taipei Monday for a trade promotion  tour, said Taiwan businessmen are welcome to invest in Nigeria.    "Nigeria spans a large area and has a huge population and  rich natural resources," Okilo said. "We welcome foreign  investment to help boost our economic development."    Chiang said Nigeria is an important country in West Africa.  "It is also a promising market worthy of exploration by our  businessmen," he noted.    Chiang said Taiwan will help the oil-rich African country  develop an export processing zone (EPZ) in Calabar, a port city  in southeastern Nigeria.    Nigeria has sent personnel to Taiwan to study EPZ  administration and other related expertise during the past two  years.    Chiang said Taiwan will use its international economic  cooperation development fund to offer practical training for  more Nigerian administrators and professionals following the  signing of the EPZ cooperative agreement.    Taiwan does not maintain an embassy in Nigeria, but has a  representative office in Nigeria's largest city of Lagos and a  consulate-general in Calabar.    Taiwan exported U.S.$140 million worth of goods to Nigeria  in  1993, but no official records of imports from that country was  available.    In addition to Nigeria, Taiwan has signed similar investment  protection agreements with 11 other countries -- Argentina,  Indonesia, Latvia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, the  Philippines, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Omron joins Japanese trend on job cuts OMRON, the Japanese control component maker, joined the country's growing number of corporations altering their long-held employment practices due to the prolonged economic slowdown. The company is reducing its workforce by 9 per cent over the next three years, said Mr Yoshio Tateishi, president. The company will reduce its total workforce of 16,000 by 1,500, but Omron plans to achieve this by natural wastage and by reducing its graduate intake. Omron's taxable profits, hit by a fall in capital spending, were 80 per cent down to Y1.28bn (Dollars 10m) for the six months to September.</p>

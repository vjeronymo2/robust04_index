			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Rival companies seek to buy remains of Canadian insurer Rival North American insurance companies are already expressing interest in buying elements of Confederation Life Insurance, Canada's fourth-largest insurer, which was seized by financial regulators last week. Their reaction comes against a background of concern about the longer-term damage Confed's collapse will inflict on Canada's insurance market. With assets of CDollars 19.2bn (Pounds 8.9bn), Confed is the largest insurance company to fail in North America. Ms Suzanne Labarge, Canada's acting superintendent of financial institutions, said regulators would move quickly to sell assets before their value was eroded. Mr Paul Cantor, Confed chief executive, said negotiations announced last week to sell the company's British operation to a financial services group were continuing, and the sale should be announced 'very soon'. The UK arm provides insurance to 250,000 policyholders and is one of the biggest pooled pension providers to medium-sized British companies. It is believed the buyer may be a Canadian insurer with UK operations, suggesting Sun Life as a possible bidder because it has cash for acquisitions. The UK operation is estimated to be worth more than CDollars 350m, but Mr Cantor has acknowledged that it will be much harder now to sell assets for the price they would have realised before the regulators intervened. Insurers that have expressed a public interest in acquiring parts of Confed include Great-West Life Assurance, North American Life Assurance and Aetna Canada. Canadian regulators took control of 123-year-old Confed last Thursday to prevent a run on its policies and deposits after the failure of long-running efforts to bail it out. The mutual insurer had suffered a rapidly eroding capital base leaving it unable to meet liabilities. The regulators will apply today for a court order to wind up the company and will order accountancy firm Peat Marwick Thorne, which is managing the company for the regulator, to sell as many of Confed's assets as possible to other insurers. But the cheap buying opportunities for rival companies will be eclipsed by the severe damage the Canadian industry will suffer for years, according to the country's insurance officials. The fund protecting policyholders, known as CompCorp, is fully industry-sponsored, and analysts predict companies will be overburdened by the contributions they will have to make.</p>

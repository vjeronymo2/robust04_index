			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Free traders jubilant over Dole deal The deal announced yesterday by President Bill Clinton and Republican leader Robert Dole strengthens the chance that the Uruguay Round world trade pact will be passed when it comes to a Senate vote next week. Supporters of the Gatt yesterday were jubilant; 'I think we've just won,' said Mr Harry Freeman, a free trade lobbyist who has been urging newspaper editors to endorse the Gatt deal. Mr Bill Lane, of the US construction machinery group Caterpillar, said: 'It is a great deal for our customers and a sad day for our foreign competitors. This is the breakthrough we have been waiting for.' Supporters were particularly pleased with Senator Dole's vow to work for a 'big big' bipartisan victory in the Senate. This may have recovered some ground lost by his earlier effort to link Gatt passage with the Republicans' long-sought cut on capital gains taxes. All week lobbyists and moderate Republicans have been grumbling that 'he stands for nothing' when Mr Dole seemed to risk abandoning his long-held free trade views to jeopardise passage of the world's largest trade pact for an unrelated issue. In the end, he received a vague promise from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, to work with the Congress on capital formation and 'to give it a serious and careful review'. 'It was never my purpose to kill the Gatt,' said Mr Dole. 'I wanted to fix the Gatt. Maybe I haven't done a perfect job but I think. . . we've moved it a long way.' President Clinton said: 'An understanding has been reached with Senator Dole to reaffirm our United States sovereignty and to make sure that reaffirmation will be protected in the Gatt process.' The World Trade Organisation's (WTO) arbitration of trade disputes caused Mr Dole and some other members of Congress to question whether US sovereignty would be adequately protected. White House officials said the president had agreed to Mr Dole's demand for a special US review panel to oversee decisions of the WTO. This panel could trigger a congressional vote on US withdrawal from Gatt. However, Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, described the sovereignty issue as a 'red herring'. He said: 'There are those who want to do damage to the agreement who continue to raise that issue. It is a non-issue. There is nothing in the Gatt that restricts our ability to enforce our own trade laws.'</p>

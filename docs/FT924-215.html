			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Lebanon rejects joint aid for deportees THE Lebanese authorities yesterday rejected an Israeli proposal that both governments should simultaneously allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the 415 expelled Palestinians who have been stranded in south Lebanon for the last 12 days. Mr Rafif al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, dismissed a suggestion from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, his Israeli counterpart, that medical supplies be forwarded from Israel to the deportees' camp in no-man's land between Israeli and Lebanese forces, while food and fresh water was delivered from Lebanese-controlled territory. He then refused to allow Mr James Jonah, a UN undersecretary general, to visit the deportees, alleged by Israel to be Islamic fundamentalist militants. 'Jonah is wasting his time with us. This is a wasted trip. Our position is firm,' Mr Hariri said. Mr Jonah was sent to the region by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, following the adoption of Security Council resolution 799 calling for the return of the deportees to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Lebanon, backed by Syria and other Arab states, says Israel should implement the resolution immediately. Israel confirmed yesterday that it was willing to take back 10 men whom it said were deported mistakenly. But the army said they would be put on trial when they returned. Mr Rabin, who will see Mr Jonah for the second time this week in Jerusalem today, has refused to consider reversing the deportations. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said the deportations were successful because they had hit at extremists opposed to Middle East peace talks, without destroying the talks themselves. But he admitted the issue had caused some negative effects - including the postponment until February of a visit by a European Community delegation to discuss closer EC-Israeli economic co-operation. The Israeli finance ministry is to utilise Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7m) in US loan guarantees granted earlier this year to aid the absorption immigrants from the former Soviet Union. This would start next March, when Israel would seek to borrow Dollars 1bn backed by the guarantees.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 5 April (MTI) -- Audience protests  disrupted a Hungarian Government minister's speech to a World  War II Jewish Holocaust conference today. Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky's speech, greeting an international conference on the  Hungarian Holocaust at the Budapest University of Arts and  Sciences, was drowned out by stamping and slow handclapping from  audience members showing derision at the minister's ideas on  1940's history.    Jeszenszky said one should never forget that Hungary gave  refuge to the Jews until 1944 and that the German invasion  marked not only the start of deportations but also atrocities  against non-Jewish Hungarian citizens. As a Hungarian citizen,  historian, politician, and presidium member of the ruling  Hungarian Democratic Forum, the minister said those not  sympathizing with the victims of 1944 have no place in the  Hungarian nation.    He asked listeners to mourn not just the 600,000 Jewish  victims, but also nearly 500,000 Hungarians who died in World  War II.    The minister reminded politicians and scholars at the  conference of the link between the Hungarian Holocaust and the  Peace Treaty concluding World War I, a treaty very damaging for  Hungary.    Jeszenszky then drew a parallel between Communism and  Nazism,  saying that both are barbarous ideas which should be condemned  together. But he could not continue because of jeering and  stamping from some of the audience.    Before Jeszenszky's remarks, Director of the New York  Rosenthal Institute Randolph L. Braham had delivered a lecture.    "Keeping silent about this genocide makes us complicit in  it," said Braham. "This political attitude aimed at falsifying  history -- one seen in Western Europe after the war and in the  post- communist countries today -- is particularly dangerous,"  he added.    Braham thought right-wing movements reviving in the region  with anti-Semitism central to their political ideology had just  this goal. He hoped these "political charlatans" could be  squeezed out of public life by resolving underlying economic  problems.</p>

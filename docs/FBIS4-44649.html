			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Ceramics Benefit from CAD/CAM [computer aided </F> design and manufacture]"]    [Text] The "Fabception" principle [a portmanteau neologism  combining "fabrication" and "design"] is meant for manufacturers  interested in developing parts made of ceramics or ceramic  composites.    The Center for Technical and Technological Research and  Innovation (CRITT) is introducing to the market, with the help  of the Vierzon-based "Z3T" company, a new concept--the  "Fabception" principle--based on computerization of the entire  fabrication process for parts made of reputedly unstable  materials such as ceramics and ceramic composites. According to  Z3T officials, Fabception can reduce from 40 days down to 5 the  time elapsing between design and fabrication of parts, including  all phases of product development, to wit:        -  product definition and design, with the help of CAD  systems such as Euclid and Catia;    -  analysis of part feasibility  via prototyping with the help of automated mechanisms, as well  as simulations for the analysis of contraction, deformation, and  density;    -  simulation of the production process and on-screen  analysis of tooling (i.e. mold) practicability;    -  preparation of  the mold or model by means of CNC machining with  three-dimensional control;    -  experimental fabrication to validate  simulation results;    -  serial production and optimization of the  manufacturing process.        Beyond the fact that Fabception covers all stages of the  process, it integrates all the software (robots and equipment)  into a single, continuous process. This implies a single,  integrated communications system; a single, consolidated  database; technological know-how; and a new methodological  approach. In addition to saving time and resources, it permits  simplification of various processes.</p>

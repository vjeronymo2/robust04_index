			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Companies restrict business travel COMPANIES ARE encour-aging employees to travel by road and rail rather than air in response to the recession, according to a report published yesterday. The amount spent on rail travel rose by two thirds to Pounds 2bn last year compared with 1989. Spending on air travel fell 21 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn over the same period, according to the report by American Express on travel and entertainment. The fall in spending on air travel did not necessarily reflect a fall in passenger numbers. 'People are also being encouraged to change to lower-class seats,' said Mr Jim Jamison, vice-president of travel management services at American Express. The report also noted a fall of 14 per cent in spending on hotels. That was partly made up for by a rise in spending on fuel. The total amount spent on travel and entertainment fell from about Pounds 20bn in 1989 to more than Pounds 18bn last year. Some 37 per cent was incurred on overseas trips. The fall was partly a result of declining employment, said Mr Donald Osborne, the report's author. Those companies which have survived over the past two years saw spending rise 4 per cent. Retail prices rose 14.2 per cent over the same period. Business travel and entertainment accounted for 6.6 per cent of total business costs last year, and amounted to about Pounds 1,000 per employee. Four out of five businesses expected spending to increase parallel or faster than - revenues. The report also said the number of women business travellers had risen to 17 per cent of the total last year from 11 per cent in 1989. Many hotels were now concentrating on providing more convenient facilities for women travellers as numbers increased. In spite of the sums spent, almost half the 407 companies questioned did not have a written travel policy. A total of 44 per cent of companies said they had no arrangements for securing corporate discounts. Three quarters of companies had recently taken steps to control spending on travel and entertainment. But almost a third said they were not yet satisfied with their efforts to control this spending.

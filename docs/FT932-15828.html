			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Eastern promise vanishes in Austria - The stock market darling of yesteryear, Vienna has lost its lustre When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and Communism collapsed all over eastern Europe, the Vienna stock market became the darling of the international investment community, outperforming the world's major markets for more than a year. But now, as economic reform has stalled in many East European countries and the future of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is in doubt, Austrian stocks have lost their lustre. The main factor holding down the Vienna market, say analysts, is not the political turmoil in the East, but economic weakness at home. The country, which is highly dependent on the German economy, has recently slid into recession; company profits have tumbled and many industries have been hit by a string of bankruptcies. 'Unless the economic data begin to show that the downward trend has ended and that a recovery is setting in, I do not see much upward potential for the stock market,' says Walter Schuster, first vice-president for capital markets at Girocredit. But as long as Russia and eastern Europe are not hit by a long period of political instability, he adds, the ups and downs in Moscow will not have more than a fleeting impact on Vienna shares. Traders expect some jitters ahead of the April 25 referendum, which could keep prices down. When Mr Yeltzin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, his main rival, clashed in a dramatic power struggle last month, Vienna stocks went into a slide which erased most of the gains made since the year began. But politics has only reinforced an economic trend which was already pointing downward, says Mr Franz Amstler, a securities expert at Bank Austria. 'Yeltsin and Khasbulatov were the trigger, not the cause,' he adds. Most of the blue chip shares traded on the stock exchange are highly cyclical, and even the banks, which should benefit from lower interest rates, have suffered from the crisis in industry, because of their loan exposure and their huge equity portfolios. Bank Austria and Creditanstalt, the two largest banks, also own two of the largest industrial groups. Construction materials, paper and machinery stocks, some of the largest sectors on the stock exchange, have been hurt by the rise of the Austrian schilling, which is pegged to the German D-Mark, against many European currencies since last autumn, and a surge of cheap imports from eastern Europe. 'Industry is caught in a double whammy,' says Mr Schuster of Girocredit. 'It is losing market share abroad because of the exchange rate, and under pressure at home from imports.' Things looked much better just over a month ago. High interest rates, forced upon Austria and the rest of Europe by the German Bundesbank, were beginning to come down, which had helped the ATX index to climb about 20 per cent from 712.06 to a March 3 peak of 860.17. But a combination of a technical correction, negative economic and corporate news and political uncertainty cut the rally short. Yesterday the ATX closed at 779.25, down more than 50 per cent from its 1990 high. Some analysts say that prices might go through another upturn of 10 to 15 per cent in the summer, if short-term interest rates continue to fall. Long-term rates are already close to their historical lows, however, and are unlikely, say experts, to give the market any further support. As Vienna's average price-earnings ratio of 28 is quite high compared with other markets, further equity advances will depend on a recovery in the corporate sector, they add. A sustained recovery in neighbouring Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland would also help. A key weakness of the market remains its high volatility, which is exacerbated by its small size, low turnover and low liquidity. Daily turnover often surpassed ASch1bn in 1990, when Austria was hot among international investors, but it has fallen as low as Sch300m this year. 'Very few Austrians hold stocks, and foreign investors are deterred by the low trading volume,' says Mr Christoph Rohrmoser, an analyst for Erste Invest-Consult, the capital markets arm of the Erste bank. Weak insider-trading laws and a string of insider-trading scandals last year has also damaged the reputation of the Vienna market, but their effect might have been exaggerated. 'The foreigners investing in Austria are used to worse conditions than they find here,' Mr Rohrmoser concludes.</p>

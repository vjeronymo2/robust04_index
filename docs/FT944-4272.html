			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Banks step up sale of Orange County holdings A number of US investment banks yesterday stepped up their fire-sale of Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.7bn) worth of bonds they hold as security against loans made to Orange County, the affluent southern Californian local authority that filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday. The sales seemed set to provoke a legal battle between the county and Wall Street, and added to pressure on US bond and equity markets yesterday afternoon. Among the banks which yesterday said they had sold bonds was Morgan Stanley, which had held Dollars 1.6bn of bonds. Prudential Securities, which is said to have held more than Dollars 1bn, was also widely believed to have been a seller, although the bank would not confirm this. The sales are thought to have brought to about Dollars 7bn the amount of the county's bond holdings which have been sold in the past two days. The liquidation of Orange County's huge bond holding looks set to force the authority to absorb a large portion of the Dollars 1.5bn of losses it is estimated to have suffered in the bond markets this year. The county filed for bankruptcy to preserve its shrinking cash reserves and protect itself from a forced sale of bonds. It was believed to be preparing an emergency court action late yesterday to stem the sale of bonds. Lawyers for the authority have argued that the banks are prevented by its bankruptcy filing from selling securities. Ms Kathleen Brown, California's treasurer, said the state would not provide financial support to help the county. Faced with the need for cash to pay for public services, Orange County could be forced to liquidate more of its bond holdings. Financial markets were also unnerved by rumours that other funds may be concealing huge losses. San Diego County, also in California, said it had paper losses of Dollars 357m on a fund worth Dollars 3.3bn, largely because of derivative holdings. Meanwhile, Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating Orange County's investments, said that better disclosure might have brought the problems to light earlier.</p>

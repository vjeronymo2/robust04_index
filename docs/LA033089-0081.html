			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE TRIES TO SQUEEZE OUT ADULT STORE  </P> <P> Glendale officials took action this week to rid the city of its only sexually  oriented adult book and video store and to discourage potential peep-show  operators from locating in the city.  </P> <P> Frustrated by constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression, the City  Council on Tuesday proposed an ordinance with regulations so stringent that  they hope any adult entertainment business will be rendered unprofitable.  </P> <P> The action came just three weeks after the council adopted regulations that  appeared to condone adult-oriented businesses in Glendale's downtown  redevelopment zone.  </P> <P> A measure introduced Tuesday and expected to be adopted next week would  prohibit enclosed booths in any store that offers adult entertainment.  Officials said the booths, used by customers to view sexually explicit videos,  have contributed to incidents of lewd conduct among customers who frequent  adult shops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outright Ban Prohibited  </P> <P> The council has grappled for months over what to do about the Total News &amp;  Video store that has operated since May, 1986, at 6524 San Fernando Road in the  city's industrial zone.  </P> <P> An outright ban on adult-entertainment businesses is prohibited by court  interpretations of the First Amendment to the Constitution.  </P> <P> The council March 7 adopted a law confining such adult-entertainment businesses  to the downtown commercial district -- action that an attorney representing the  video store said "opened a can of worms" and would attract, rather than  discourage, adult-oriented businesses.  </P> <P> Attorney Roger J. Diamond, who contends that Glendale's effort to ban Total  News &amp; Video violates the operator's constitutional rights, said last month  that the law restricting peep-show operations to the commercial district makes  the city "ripe for the picking" by new adult-entertainment businesses.  </P> <P> But Mayor Carl Raggio said Tuesday that the proposed ordinance banning private  viewing booths "will discourage this type of business in this city" by making  such stores virtually unprofitable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Booths Are 'Lifeblood'  </P> <P> Glendale Police Lt. Michael Post, commander of the vice and narcotics division,  told the council that the proposed ordinance "would eliminate 90% to 100% of  the lewd conduct that has been taking place" at the adult entertainment store.  He said the booths "are the lifeblood of the business" and account for 70% of  the store's income.  </P> <P> Glendale City Atty. Frank R. Manzano said "numerous studies" have shown that  peep-show operations "have an increased incidence of lewd conduct." He said an  ordinance banning private viewing booths "is viable and enforceable and  represents a reasonable means of dealing with the well-documented problems that  this type of land-use activity generates."  </P> <P> Diamond, in an interview this week, said he sees no purpose in protesting the  council's latest action, but is considering a legal challenge.  </P> <P> The law, when adopted, would give Total News &amp; Video 90 days to get rid of  its private booths.  </P></p>

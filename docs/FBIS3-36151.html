Certification of  Counterintelligence Leadership Has Begun" -- place and date not  given]    [Text] At the end of January an organizational session of  the of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service's  Certification Commission took place, chaired by Security Council  Secretary O. Lobov. At the end of the session O. Lobov gave an  exclusive interview.    [Mikhaylov] What is the composition of the Certification  Commission?    [Lobov] It includes counterintelligence service director  Golushko and his first deputy Stepashin, as well as the  president's national security adviser and officials from the  presidential administration and the Security Council apparatus.  The commission has the right to invite other people and demand  any materials related to certification.    [Mikhaylov] What criteria will be used in certifying the  officer corps?    [Lobov] Careful vetting will be ensured, based on criteria  which are set on officers of this service, primarily  professional requirements. Also their ability to operate under  new conditions, their knowledge and experience. And naturally  their political views: to what extent a person wishing to work  in the new service supports the reform course.    The commission's task is to pursue an extremely objective  approach in this process.    [Mikhaylov] A certain lull around the counterintelligence  service arouses concern not only within this department itself  but also around it. Many are interested in knowing when the  certification will end and when the department will be able to  get down to real business.    [Lobov] I do not think that there should be any break  related to the commission's activity. Subject to certification  are approximately 200 to 250 top officials who are to be  approved under a presidential edict. This work is fairly  responsible. Therefore we believe that the commission must not  be rushed. The president signed his edict on 21 January and  gave us until 1 March. No one should get nervous. I would like  to say that even those who will be dismissed -- for age or  health reasons -- will have considerably greater privileges than  those that existed in the what is now known in the country's  history as the period of stagnation. There should not be much  anxiety that the commission has been set up to undertake any  radical turnabouts. It is to ensure a qualified selection of  cadres without the participation of those political structures  that were earlier involved in such work.    [Mikhaylov] Being head of the Security Council, what would  you like the Russian Counterintelligence Service to be?    [Lobov] I think that it should be a service protecting  Russia's new interests. It must uphold the reforms and  democratization. This service must support the president. For  the first time Russia has presidential rule. It was not born  easily. Even now it is confronted with tremendous difficulties,  but the counterintelligence service is called upon to defend  this new presidential rule.    Russia's economic interests are also becoming one of the top  priorities. Because it is not easy to understand the meaning of  the ruble zone or whether a union with Belarus is beneficial.  What about the interests of Russian-speakers in the neighboring  states or the former socialist countries? What should  interrelations and economic links be like today? This is very  complicated work. I would like the counterintelligence service  to meet the demands of our times.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia has become the sixth country to ratify the  Chemical Weapons Convention in a document lodged at the United  Nations headquarters in New York. Since the convention was  opened in January last year, 157 countries have signed. The  convention banning chemical weapons will come into force after  it is ratified by 65 countries. Australia's Foreign Minister  Gareth Evans said Australia's ratification ensured it would  continue to play a leading role in efforts to get a global ban  on chemical weapons. Senator Evans said it was vital that other  countries that had signed the treaty more quickly to meet the  requirements for ratification. [sentence as heard]</p>

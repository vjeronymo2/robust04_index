			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (1): Lines that point to cellular growth - It seems set to become a mass consumer market. But could the bubble burst? Or are the forecasts too pessimistic?  Andrew Adonis looks at the evidence Mobile communications embraces everything from the simple tone pager to advanced radio data transfer systems. But the dynamic force in the sector is the cellular telephone, entering its second decade of commercial service in the developed world. The issue is no longer whether the cellular phone will take off, but how fast it will build a mass consumer market, and whether it is set eventually to replace the traditional fixed wire. The Nordic countries already boast about 10 mobile phones per 100 people. Every other household in Stockholm has some form of mobile communicator, and the number of new mobile phone connections outstrips new fixed-line connections across Scandinavia. The same will soon be true of most developed countries. The UK reached the cross-over point at the turn of the year: industry estimates for June are of about 115,000 net new cellular connections, against about 100,000 new fixed-line connections. Between 1986 and 1993 the number of worldwide cellular phone subscribers increased to 32m, with annual growth of between 45 and 50 per cent. Projections vary wildly, but on current trends between 150m and 200m cellular subscribers is a plausible projection for 2000. To put those figures in perspective, some 650m telecommunications lines are in service today. Unsurprisingly, the cellular industry has become a gold rush, with nothing but booms and profits apparently on the horizon, and a torrent of entrepreneurs and companies - many of them with no previous telecoms experience - muscling in to make their fortune. Witness the extraordinary sums that operators are prepared to pay for licences: the Hungarian government last year netted Dollars 100m from the auction of two GSM licences, and far larger sums are changing hands in richer economies. It would be rash, however, to suppose that operators will be able to continue opening their networks and then waiting for the cash to pour in. As the mass consumer market dawns, margins will fall, competition will hot up and serious misjudgments are bound to be made. There is already evidence of overheating in some markets: as operators dash for growth and cut-price handsets flood highstreets, rates of 'churn' - subscribers leaving the networks - rise and fraud becomes a problem. Some operators are privately fearful that the cellular bubble will burst in developed markets, followed by a period of slower growth similar to that experienced in the early 1990s recession. Yet just as convincing an argument can be made for supposing that current growth projections are pessimistic. For instance, they could be dramatically upset by the most intriguing departure in the industry - the development of 'fixed cellular' systems for the local loop. Fixed cellular is in its early infancy, but as reliability improves and costs fall it has clear potential. In the developed world fixed cellular offers a means for competitors to former monopoly PTTs to bypass the PTT local network without having to dig up the streets or erect pylons. It is also attractive to developing countries ambitious to promote rapid line growth and not immediately concerned about residential broadband 'superhighway' services. 'For us, fixed cellular is one of the most significant things happening in the industry,' says Mr Nagarajan Vittal, chairman of India's telecommunications commission. India has barely eight telephone lines per 1,000 people: the government's target is to double India's number of lines - from 8m to 16m, compared with 30m in the UK today - over the next four years. Mr Vittal believes fixed cellular 'could have a crucial role to play,' pointing to Mexico and Indonesia which have recently licensed operators. The integration of fixed and mobile services might have a similarly far-reaching impact in the developed world. 'People want to call people, not places, says Mr Torbjorn Nilsson, strategic planning director at Ericsson radio systems, the Swedish supplier. 'Fixed network operators will introduce mobility to their networks by means of personal numbers based on 'intelligent networking' solutions.' The world of mass personal numbers may be some way off, but the telecoms equipment market is already beginning to feature PABX software which enables calls to be directed to mobile numbers. Network operators are increasingly anxious to make their services complement the fixed line, even to compete with it. In the UK, one of the two new cellular operators to have launched in the past year is offering free local calls in the evenings (Mercury One-2-One), while the other (Orange) will give subscribers who want one a conventional fixed-line local number for their cellular handset, allowing them to pay the difference in incoming call tariffs. Fixed/mobile business alignments are also taking shape. AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn merger with McCaw Communications, the largest US cellular operator, was cleared last month. It is likely to be only the first of many such link-ups, and has already helped to precipitate several proposed mergers between regional cellular operators in the US. Three forces are driving growth: New and competing networks. Across much of the developing world networks have only recently been opened, or are still to be launched. Much of the world thus remains virgin territory for the cellular operators. In the developed world, with its established networks, digital technology and the introduction of competition between operators are providing the cellular industry with a fresh wind. The US entrenched competition from the outset, and it will become fiercer still with the auction of licences for Personal Communications Systems next year. Elsewhere, state-owned PTTs were licensed as monopoly cellular operators in the mid-1980s. Typically, they treated their cellular divisions as cash cows, raking in large monopoly profits from growing business demand while making little or no pretence at marketing the service. That is all changing. Second network operators are being launched across Europe and the Asia-Pacific. Under strong pressure from the European Commission over the past two years, most EU states have licensed more than one operator to provide a digital service on the pan-European digital GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) standard. The UK has gone further still, licensing an additional two digital operators at a higher frequency, providing so-called PCN (Personal Communications Network) services. Other major EU states are following suit with PCN. Analysts disagree on the importance of competition to subscriber growth, but beyond Scandinavia it is hard to deny a relationship. The US, which had competition from the start, has about six subscribers per 100 people. The UK, with its four competing operators, now has about 2.7m cellular subscribers - nearly five subscribers per 100 people. Germany, which was a Deutsche Telekom monopoly until the launch of a GSM network by the Mannessman consortium two years ago, has nearly trebled its number of subscribers over the past year but still has fewer than three subscribers per 100. Japan, which languishes at the foot of the league for large developed countries with barely two cellular subscribers per 100 people, only this year liberalised its handset market, having previously required subscribers to rent handsets at inflated prices. Reducing costs. Prices of all the telecoms components of cellular networks - base stations, handsets, and interconnection charges for the use of public fixed-wire networks - are falling fast. This is a function of technological advance (base stations have shrunk from hut-size to street cabinets in a few years), computerised manufacture (it now takes a small fraction of the labour required even two years to assemble a handset), the enhanced capacity of digital systems, and lower prices for use of the fixed networks. All of these trends will continue, aided partly by technical advance, partly by greater competition, and partly by regulation, although supply shortages - particularly in digital handsets - may slow the pace. Cultural changes. As the penetration of cellular phones rises, they come to be seen as essential by an ever larger social group, further reinforcing growth. A recent UK survey by Ms Joyce Wood, a visiting fellow at Sussex University, shows that the image of mobile phone users as 'swanky businessmen' no longer tells the whole story. Nor is the cellular telephone the whole story of mobile communications. Paging, mobile data, and mobile satellite are all notable markets, covered in this survey. But in size and glamour they are no competition for cellular telephony.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: UK Active Value buys 10% of City Site UK Active Value, the invest-ment group behind the restructuring of Greycoat, the property group, has taken a significant stake in a second UK property company by buying 10 per cent of City Site Estates. The purchase coincided with Scottish Provident's sale of its 14.5 per cent stake in the Glasgow-based property investment and development company, whose shares closed 10p up at 80p. UK Active Value is advised by Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, the South African corporate financiers who emerged as victors in the battle to save Greycoat from the receivers. They control 19 per cent of Greycoat, which owns London landmarks such as Embankment Place and Buckingham Place, but was hit by rising interest rates and falling property values, putting it in breach of gearing covenants. City Site was similarly troubled, recording Pounds 18m losses in 1992, but it survived without any greater hardship than having to stall on preference share dividends because of insufficient distributable reserves. Mr Treger said: 'It is very highly geared, but it is solvent, profitable and it doesn't have any problems with its banking covenants.' Scottish Provident has maintained its holding in City Site's 10 per cent convertible preference shares, but has sold its remaining City Site shares.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: KEEPSAKES MUST BE KEPT SAFELY  </P> <P> Among the keepsakes of genealogists are photographs of ancestors and paper  certificates, documents and newspaper clippings. However, if they are  improperly stored, they will not last long enough to be a treasure of  generations to come.  </P> <P> Attics and basements are the worst places to store keepsakes. Valuable photos  should be kept where temperature, humidity and light levels are low. Color  prints are best stored below 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 50% humidity, and in the  dark. Avoid using plastic storage containers that may contain polyvinyl  chloride.  </P> <P> Acid-neutral boxes and envelopes are available. If you use envelopes and  sleeves to hold your photos and slides, be sure they are made of acid-neutral  paper, or polyester, archival polyethylene, or triacetate plastic film.  </P> <P> Use photo albums with acid-neutral pages and avoid waxed pages. Adhesive tape,  white glue, rubber cement, paper clips and mothballs or crystals can damage  your photos. To label photos on the backside before storing or displaying --  and all your photographs should be identified with names, dates and places --  use a soft No. 1 pencil and press lightly.  </P> <P> Copy old photos first, then store the negatives in a dark place.  Black-and-white negatives will last a long time if well cared for. However,  color slides may last only 10 to 50 years, depending on care.  </P> <P> Use acid-free materials when mounting newspaper clippings and other paper  items. Pastes made from flour and water, wheat or rice are less acidic and less  damaging than most other pastes. However, they are subject to mildew and  household pest damage, and may bubble or ripple the item. Linen tape can be  used for mounting. Find an art supply store for these supplies. Before using  anything on a valuable item, test each product for any initial staining or  damage.  </P> <P> Photocopies of clippings can be mounted in scrapbooks, but the originals should  be placed in a dark storage container.  </P> <P> The American Assn. for State and Local History (AASLH), 708 Berry Road,  Nashville, Tenn. 37204, publishes books and technical leaflets on the  collection, care and preservation of many items.  </P> <P> If you want to know specifically what your antiques, collectibles or keepsakes  are worth and to document their value, you will need the services of a personal  property appraiser. Appraisers of antique and collectible keepsakes should be  specialists. Spend as much time finding a qualified appraiser as you would  looking for a professional in any field.  </P> <P> Once you have obtained an appraisal, it should be dated, signed by the  appraiser, along with the purpose of the appraisal and the qualities and  disinterest of the appraiser noted. Keep the appraisal in your safety deposit  box.  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Differences narrowed in cocoa pact negotiations COCOA PRODUCERS and consumers have begun to narrow their differences in United Nations-sponsored talks in Geneva on a new international price stabilisation accord. Both sides have made new offers on the price range to be defended by the accord and the amount of cocoa that could be withheld from the market to keep the price within the specified range. However, the gap between them remains large. With only four days to go until the end of the two-week third round of talks on Friday, a fourth round looks probable. This has been tentatively scheduled for next February in Geneva. Early last week cocoa producers lowered their price demand from a mid-price of SDR1,820 a tonne (Pounds 1,640) to one of SDR1,625 a tonne, with a floor of SDR1,300 and a ceiling of SDR1,950. On Friday consumers raised their proposed mid-price from SDR1,000 to SDR1,050, within a range of SDR840-1,260 a tonne. March cocoa futures closed in London yesterday at Pounds 745, equivalent to SDR824, a tonne. Consumers, led by the European Community, have also increased slightly, from 300,000 to 330,000 tonnes, the amount of cocoa they are prepared to see withheld from the market under the proposed scheme for short-term price stabilisation. Producers have come down from 600,000 to 500,000 tonnes but Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister of the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer, suggested last week that 450,000 tonnes would be acceptable to producers.</p>

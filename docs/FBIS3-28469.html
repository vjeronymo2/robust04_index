While representatives from the various companies worked on  the details of the projects involved, officials from the two  governments sat down to finalise details of an investment  guarantee agreement (IGA), which may be signed in the next few  days. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and  President Fidel Ramos witnessed the signing ceremonies at the  Malacanang Palace, the latter's official residence, here this  afternoon.    Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here this afternoon for a four-day  visit, the first by a Malaysian prime minister since the two  countries established diplomatic ties in 1964, hailed the  signing of the agreements as "the start of a new phase in our  relations." "I think we have made very good progress," he told a  joint news conference after the signings. Asked if more  investments from Malaysia could be expected, he replied: "Yes."    The nine MOUs could lead to deals worth billions of ringgit.  Apart from injecting much-needed capital into the growing  Philippine economy, which rose by 2.3 percent last year compared  with one per cent in 1992, the deals are also in line with  Malaysia's policy to boost reverse investment. The MOUs, signed  behind closed doors, are for a hotel project on Samal Island in  Mindanao; partial acquisition of the Associated Bank; highway  and mass transit systems construction and the implementation of  a RM [Malaysian ringgit] 50-million waterwork project; water  treatment for Clark Base; gaming houses; production of  refrigerators, the construction of Metro Manila waterworks  sewerage system; and a U.S. $72-million power plant.    The nine MOUs were signed between Johan Holdings Bhd.  [Limited]/George Kent and Metropolitan Cebu Water District;  Johan Holdings Bhd./George Kent and Bases Conversion Development  Authority Berjaya Topgroup (HK) Ltd. and Team Asia Corp Inc.;  Berjaya/Wy Sdn. Bhd. [Private Limited] and Fun Characters Inc.;  Ekran Bhd. and the Philippine Department of Tourism/Philippine  Tourism Authority; Ekran Bhd. and Associated Bank; Renong  Bhd./Mara and Public Estates Authority; and Datuk Eugene Campos  and Louis Cosan.    The signing of the MOUs reflects the determination of both  countries to step up investment and bilateral trade after ties  had been held back for so long by the Philippine Government's  claim over Sabah. Malaysia's investment in the Philippines has  been unpredictable. On an uptrend during the 1980s, investments  dipped after 1989 and in 1992, no new capital from Malaysia  flowed into the Philippines.    Last year some 193 million pesos (RM16.3 million) in  Malaysian investments went into power generation plants, poultry  breeding, and electronic manufacturing projects in the republic.    MBf Asia Capital Corp. and MCA Power Corp., together with a  third Canadian partner, entered into a deal for a U.S. $2  billion (RM5.5 billion) power plant irrigation and flood control  system. Hong Leong Engineering and Sarte Teodore and Associates  clinched a deal on the manufacturing of computer software in the  Philippines for export.    Al-Bakara Malaysia also took a slice of the pie in a deal  with a group, led by Mindanao's Mastura family to rehabilitate  the state- owned Amanah Bank, now privatised.</p>

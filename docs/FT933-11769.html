			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Industry prospects mixed despite muted inflation WEAKENING European export markets threaten the recovery in manufacturing, even though sterling's devaluation has yet to have an impact on pushing up costs. That was the message from the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly report of manufacturing trends, which paints a mixed picture of prospects for the sector. While inflationary pressures remain muted, the good export growth of the first half of the year looks unlikely to be repeated in the second half due to the deepening recession in continental Europe. The CBI reports that the last four months have seen a modest rise in unit costs for UK manufacturing companies, but this has not translated into higher prices in either the domestic or export sector. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, said: 'Cost pressures are remarkably subdued, given that there has always been concern that sterling's depreciation would feed through into higher costs.' The survey covered 1,346 manufacturing companies and was conducted between June 25 and July 14. Seventeen per cent of businesses said they had cut export prices over the past four months, compared with 10 per cent saying they had raised them, giving a negative balance of 7 percentage points. This balance implies a squeeze in profits during a period when a positive balance of 9 percentage points of companies reported a rise in unit costs rather than a fall. A balance of just 5 percentage points of companies said they were optimistic about export prospects, compared with a balance of 21 points in April. A balance of 7 points said they had increased export orders in the past four months, a less bullish result than in April when the corresponding balance was 10 points. A more positive finding was that a balance of 8 points reported a rise in overall orders in the past four months. This was the biggest rise since April 1990, at around the start of the recession, and is a clear sign of recovery. Investment intentions remain weak, with fewer companies planning to spend more on plant and machinery over the next year than the number expecting to cut back. The negative balance of 3 percentage points represents only a modest improvement in the outlook for investment since the April survey, when the balance was minus 8 points. In spite of the less promising outlook for exports, business confidence increased for the third quarterly survey in a row, although by a smaller amount than in April.</p>

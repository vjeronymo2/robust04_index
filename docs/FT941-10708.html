			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Logic that led to ICI's disposal - BASF steps in to take over chemical group's non-core polypropylene operations Polypropylene, a material made in large quantities by Imperial Chemical Industries until yesterday, is a hard plastic used for car bumpers, kitchenware, packaging and a range of other products. However, having sales of almost Pounds 2bn a year and customers in many industries has not prevented a chronic fall in prices in recent years which has triggered a series of mergers and takeovers. Polypropylene is part of petrochemicals. In common with related materials such as polyethylene and polystyrene, production and prices rose strongly during the 1980s. But the 1990s saw demand fall and overcapacity exposed. The average annual price of polypropylene, for example, has fallen every year for the past five years, according to industry consultancy Trichem. The consequences have been strenuous attempts across petrochemicals to cut output voluntarily. So far this has met with little success, although there have been a handful of plant closures such as that announced last month by BP Chemicals of its ethylene plant at Baglan Bay in Wales. Manufacturers of polypropylene have been able to use mergers to cut costs because the sector is particularly fragmented. There are no less than 17 companies operating in Europe that have market shares of more than 2.5 per cent. Only two companies have more than 10 per cent of capacity. Some of the industry's biggest producers have therefore grasped the opportunity to merge their businesses. Three such deals are either complete or awaiting only regulatory approval before completion: The plastics businesses of Royal Dutch/Shell and Himont, part of Montedison, the industrial arm of the collapsed Ferruzzi empire. Neste of Finland and Statoil of Norway, a merger which will create a group called Borealis with annual sales of about DM4bn (Pounds 1.5bn). About 13 per cent comes from polypropylene manufacture. ICI's sale to BASF, which will make the latter the second biggest producer in Europe. In the new-look European polypropylene industry, these three dominate with more than half of total capacity. BASF moves from seventh to second biggest company, pushing German rival Hoechst into fourth place. BASF also points out that polypropylene sales are growing more quickly than those of other plastics. And prices may soon recover too: although last year saw polypropylene prices on average lower than in 1992, some individual months saw price increases imposed by manufacturers sticking. One result was that the business it is buying from ICI halved its losses last year to about Pounds 10m compared with the previous year. For ICI, the picture appears to be more mixed. It was only the eighth biggest polypropylene producer in Europe. The business did not fit with its strategy of concentrating on a handful of core businesses in which it is a world leader and a disposal was logical. However, the sale of polypropylene was intended to be just one half of a deal which would further this strategy by strengthening the core business of acrylics. The deal was originally constructed as a swap for BASF's acrylics operation. That part of the plan collapsed in November when the two sides could not agree on a value of the business, leaving ICI frustrated in its ambitions to tighten its grip on the world acrylics manufacturing industry.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WESTERN EUROPEAN PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN POLYPROPYLENE Pre-consolidation capacity Basis end-1994 (estimated)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                          Tonnes           %                                     000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Himont (Italy)                     1033        18.3 Shell (Neth/UK)                     625        11.1 Hoechst (Germany)                   548         9.7 Neste (Finland)                     410         7.3 Appryl (*)                          350         6.2 OMV (Austria)                       330         5.9 BASF (Germany)                      310         5.5 ICI (UK)                            300         5.3 DSM (Neth)                          280         5.0 Others                             1456        25.7 Total                              5640       100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Post-consolidation capacity Basis end-1994 (estimated)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Himont/Shell                       1658        29.4 BASF/ICI                            610        10.8 Neste/Statoil (Borealis)            590        10.5 Hoechst                             548         9.7 Appryl                              350         6.2 OMV                                 330         5.9 DSM                                 280         5.0 Others                             1276        22.5 Total                              5640       100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * BP/Elf/Atochem joint venture  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Trichem Consultants  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Cuban authorities confirmed  today their interest in continuing the efforts to normalize  relations with Cuban emigrants despite the difficulties prompted  by the hostile U.S. policies toward the country.    Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the Communist Party  Politburo,  confirmed this decision during his speech to close The Nation  and the Emigrants conference, which lasted three days and was  attended by the over 200 guests living in 29 countries.    I want to emphasize our determination not to turn back on  the  path we have taken and to continue working in the future with a  common and constant effort to build this two-way road in  relations between Cuba and its emigrants, despite the Cuban-U.S.  disagreement, Balaguer stressed.    During a nine-minute speech, Balaguer stressed that despite  political, ideological, or any other sort of differences among  participants in the conference, Cuba's independence and  sovereignty constituted the most important points of agreement.    Balaguer added that this attitude conveys the patriotism  felt  by a large number of Cuban emigrants, many of whom also demanded  that the 30-year U.S. embargo against Cuba be lifted.    Balaguer pointed out that discussion topics such as the  elimination of the U.S. blockade, the preservation of our  undeniable social conquests, and not returning to the horrors of  a past of exploitation and submission for Cuba have been widely  agreed by participants, which demonstrates the sincere  patriotism that prevails among emigrants.    In addition, Balaguer indicated that the maturity and  culture  of Cubans on the island is the fundamental starting point that  today enables us to advance our goal of normalizing relations  between Cuba and the emigrants.    Balaguer asserted that "we must not forget the wound that  has  not yet completely healed or the abnormal circumstances that  still threaten the security of the fatherland."    Balaguer only excluded from the rapprochement process  supporters of the island's annexation to the United States,  terrorists, political demagogues, and those referred to as false  patriots.    He maintained that they -- those who insist on the goal of  destroying the revolution and thus endangering the existence  itself of the nation, its sovereignty, and that Cuban nature we  have mentioned so often -- do not have any room in these noble  intentions, which do not target anyone in particular.    At the end of Balaguer's speech, several participants  chanted  in the plenary hall of the Conventions Palace. Down the halls  they shouted the slogan, Cuba yes, blockade no.    Today's session was marked by the special participation of  Vice President Carlos Lage, who talked about the state of the  economy and its outlook.    Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso said Lage told Cubans  living abroad about the possibility of participating in the  opening to foreign capital initiated in Cuba last year but said  the application of this policy would be discussed in future  meetings.    In yesterday's session, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  announced six government measures, many of them old aspirations  of the participants in the meeting with the purpose of  facilitating the emigrants' links to their nation and cultural  exchanges.</p>

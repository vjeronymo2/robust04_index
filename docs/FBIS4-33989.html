			<p>Issue   <F P=102>   PY1306222694 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish  2001 GMT 10 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY1306222694 </F> <F P=104>  Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["Special item" by Jose Maria Monzon] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Jun (NA) -- The Fourth  Ibero-American Summit that will be held next week in the  historical Colombian city of Cartagena de las Indias threatens  to be an improvised forum to debate the Haitian situation. What  causes even more concern is the foreboding of another political  altercation between Argentina and the rest of Latin America.    The participation of President Carlos Menem and Cuban leader  Fidel Castro also presupposes the possibility of a "quarrel"  parallel to the summit, or at least leaves the door open for a  verbal skirmish like at the summit in Salvador, Bahia [Brazil].    Seeking to gain the attention of the participating chiefs of  state, Menem has sent a letter in which he proposes that they  work on a project that contemplates respect for the cultural and  ethical values of the region. It is doubtful this hazy proposal  will divert attention from a topic that has top priority for the  continent: The need to restore deposed Haitian President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, that country's first democratically  elected president, to the presidency.    Latin American governments know sooner or later they could  face a situation similar to the one in December 1989 when the  United States unilaterally invaded Panama on the pretext of  extraditing General Manuel Noriega.    The constant failure of the United States -- of Washington  in  the first place, but the failure also has a hemispheric tendency  -- to resolve the situation that began in Haiti in 1991, could  prompt the unleashing of this new crisis. The foreboding is  based on the fact that Bill Clinton personally announced the  possibility of a U.S. military invasion followed by a new  multinational experiment in how to create a democracy.    Latin American government fear centers on the fact that  unilateral U.S. action would weaken the Inter-American  consultation system represented first by the OAS and second by  the Rio Group. The wounds opened in the region by actions in  Panama and Grenada in the 1980's have yet to heal.    From what is known at the present time of the U.S. strategy,  it can be surmised that an eventual invasion of Haiti will be  the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but a second  stage will require the participation of the rest of the Americas.    It is here where Argentina differs from the other countries  of the region because no other Latin American government seems  to be convinced of the benefits of an armed expedition that  seems to be more related to placating the internal criticism  that Clinton has to suffer than to benefiting suffering Haitians.    Those responsible for Menem's foreign policy stressed that  they have stated as a condition that at least one other Latin  American country should give its guarantee and cooperate, but  these concepts only seem to be of a formal nature because Buenos  Aires -- this is already known -- is the only capital that has  not objected to any decision by Washington during the past 3  years.    If a consensual solution is not arrived at regarding the way  democracy is to be restored in Haiti, it is quite probable that  the United States and Latin America will find themselves on  opposite sides of the street. If this happens, the position of  the Argentine Government is already known -- beginning with its  obsession for unrestricted alignment.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading WILD rumours and technical position-taking combined to ensure an exciting day in the futures with one of the busiest sessions of late, writes Christopher Price. Trading started quietly enough with the June contract opening slightly firmer at 2,844 and being bought up gently to 2,850 in the first half-hour of trading. Then, in a mid-morning lull, a very heavy bout of selling began. This dominated the day's trading in the cash market and sent June sharply lower. The instigator of the selling, which was spread across the whole market, was rumoured to be Mr George Soros, the US trader who controls the influential Quantum Fund. It was said that the billionaire dealer was selling futures to pay for his large part-purchase of a gold manufacturer. Other rumours abounded and with them a variety of other names. Also, many traders have continued bearish on the short-term outlook for the FT-SE 100, believing the recovery story to be overdone and the market to have run ahead of itself. Whatever the reasons, June continued its slide to reach its low of 2,776 shortly before 2pm. At this time, June was running at a 15-point discount to the cash market. A modest rally took June forward to close at 2,792, a slight discount to its fair value premium of around 6. Volume was a hefty 19,529 lots. Options trade was also active.</p>

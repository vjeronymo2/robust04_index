			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row looming over plan to increase Euro-seats THE government is to bring forward a bill urgently in the new year to increase the number of British Euro-constituencies in time for the 1994 election to the European parliament. The legislation will come at a particularly sensitive time, since it will have to be discussed while the Maastricht bill is still before the Commons. It will also raise the question who will carry out the review, since the parliamentary boundary commissioners are busy working on the review of the boundaries for general election constituencies. As part of the deal agreed at Edinburgh, in which Germany is to get an extra 18 MEPs to take account of unification, the UK, along with France and Italy, will have six new seats to add to the existing 81 Euro-constituencies. In order for the new arrangements to take effect for the June 1994 elections the bill will have to be through parliament in time for the review to take place, with enough time for the parties to select their candidates. Officials are still working on proposals to go to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, but one prospect is that - as when the Euro-seats were set up - the process of holding inquiries will be compressed. In the arrangements for the 1979 elections the boundary commissioners published proposals locally and there was one month available for people to make comments before final reports were presented to parliament. If such a course was followed the whole exercise would take only about six months. Even before that stage, there is the prospect of a political row as ministers allocate the extra seats between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. At present 66 of the British MEPs represent English seats, eight represent Scotland, four Wales and three Northern Ireland. Alongside the political difficulties of redistributing the seats is a practical one. The boundary commission's existing work on Westminster constituencies means that officials are having to consider the alternative of co-opting former commissioners.</p>

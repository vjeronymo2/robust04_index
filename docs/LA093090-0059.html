			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I don't understand all this negativity about Roseanne Barr and her show.  </P> <P> She's a genuine original. Critics and rivals seem to want to cut the ground out  from under anyone more successful than they are. Roseanne's show is warm,  funny, dumb and full of real human values . . . just like real life . . .  that's why we relate to it. Why don't the critics go after "Golden Girls,"  "Night Court" and other prime-timers that are rife with off-color, sexually  implicit offensive material that nobody seems to object to except ordinary  people like us?  </P> <P> Pat Roberts, Lone Pine  </P></p>

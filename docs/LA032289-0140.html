			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VIDEOTAPED ARREST CHARGE DROPPED  </P> <P> A Long Beach judge this morning dismissed a charge of resisting arrest against  Don Jackson, the activist who was arrested by a Long Beach police officer while  conducting a videotaped "sting" that he said exposed police racism and  brutality.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Gary Hahn threw out the misdemeanor charge against Jackson, 30,  at the request of Long Beach Deputy City Prosecutor John Fentis, who asked for  dismissal "in the interests of justice." The case was dismissed just as it was  about to go to trial.  </P> <P> Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey, who arrested Jackson on Jan. 1, admitted  before a state Senate oversight committee earlier this month that there were  errors in his written police report on the incident.  </P> <P> Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police  Department, had called the case against him "a farce."  </P></p>

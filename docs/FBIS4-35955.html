			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 4 Jun (MENA) -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, who has  been recently appointed deputy prime minister and foreign  minister in south Yemen, has stated that what must be done now  is to stop the war in Yemen and open the door for capable and  desirable Arab mediation, as represented by President Husni  Mubarak and United Arab Emirates' President Shaykh Zayid  Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan.    In an exclusive interview with MENA deputy chief editor  Jalal  Salim, al-Asnaj said that the ongoing war in Yemen has left  approximately 80,000 people dead, wounded, or homeless. He  pointed out that the real loser in this war is the Yemeni people  before their leaders, since the war has seriously harmed the  people's interests and institutions. He added that the  advocates of war must return to reason and heed the appeals of  their Arab brothers and the calls of the international community  to start negotiations among the Yemeni parties concerned.    Asked if there were flaws when the Yemen unity was declared  four years ago that have led to the current situation, al-Asnaj  said: Naturally, there was a major flaw in the composition of  the Yemeni unity because it preceded the preparations for the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as if it were tailored to suit Iraq's  plan for expansion in the region. He noted that major  components of the unity, which enjoys the support of the Yemeni  people throughout the country, were lacking. He added: Two  armies remained in Yemen, one in the north and another in the  south. Two financial institutions, two diplomatic  representations, two departments for security and general  intelligence existed before and remained after the unity. In  addition, the riyal remained the currency in the north and the  dinar the currency in the south after the unity.    Al-Asnaj noted that the existing contradictions between the  north and the south, in terms of the makeup of each society, had  also been overlooked. The north, he added, is a society of  tribes, the military, and the leadership, while in the south  there are developed administrative institutions where  experienced and qualified people find the opportunities they  deserve on an equal footing, unlike the north, where  opportunities go to the privileged and the loyal only.    Explaining the contradictions on which the Yemeni unity was  based, al-Asnaj said that four years after this unity was  declared, differences deepened and the views of the Yemeni  Socialist Party and its representatives in the south and  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his representatives in the  north were not harmonious. He added that a third party, the  Yemeni Reform Grouping, entered the composition of the bilateral  alliance which had concluded the unity agreement after general  elections were held in Yemen 14 months ago.    He noted that the ruling alliance became tripartite with the  entry of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, which is a political  organization comprising the Hashid Tribe and the (?politicized)  Islamic Movement in Yemen and has links with Sudan. This, he  said, prompted further (?contradictions) within the authority  structure which made the Yemeni Socialist Party feel that its  role in achieving unity had been ignored and that its equality  with the northern side had diminished to a great extent.    Al-Asnaj explained that this situation had a direct effect  on  the ordinary citizens in the southern governorates when  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih decided that his men should run  the southern governorates' affairs beginning with the post of  governor and ending with the posts of customs directors.    He said the Yemeni citizen in the south suffered  complications in handling his daily affairs, in addition to the  increase in cost of living and the spreading unemployment. In  light of these negative developments, he said, the unity became  a source of misery for the southern citizen and a source of  prosperity for the minority in the north. He went on to say  that this explains part of the problems that exist today and  which led to this war that we witness with pain.    Replying to a question on the Yemeni unity's fate and future  in light of the current circumstances, he said "the government  in the south" is eager to assert its belief in and concern for  its right to reformulate the Yemeni unity in a manner that will  erase the memory of the "pools of blood" that have been shed  under the slogan of a false legitimacy and under undesired  protection because the unity existed only on paper.    He accused Sanaa of unilaterally abrogating the Pledge and  Accord Document recently and said: This gives the Yemeni public  a new example of misbehavior.    He noted that anyone who declares war on his people and  rejects the mediation of brothers and the international  community, represented by the Security Council, loses all bases  of constitutional legitimacy and every sense of struggle for the  sake of the Yemeni people's unity because unity does not come  about over the people's skulls.    He said that the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" will be an  experiment and a beginning toward removing the peoples'  bitterness and grudges that have led to a grinding war caused by  Sanaa, which was enthusiastic about it.    Concluding the interview, al-Asnaj answered a question on  his  expectations about the recognition of the recently proclaimed  government in south Yemen. He said there are Arab and  international indications in this regard that might be announced  soon.</p>

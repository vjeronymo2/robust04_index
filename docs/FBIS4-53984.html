			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On 18 May the people and National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] closely cooperated in sweeping away  the communist Vietnamese puppet administration, both military  and civilian, from below Ta Hen up to Bavel town and succeeded  in liberating Bavel town for the third time. After a day of  fighting, the results were as follows:    1. We crushed the communist Vietnamese puppet invading  forces, killing 26 puppet soldiers and destroyed 24 AK's, five  B-40's, three 60-mm mortars, two 12.7-mm machineguns, 20  military barracks, one ammo and arms depot, and three military  trucks.    2. We seized 12 AK's, six B-40's, one RPD, one RPK, one  SKS, 250 backsacks, 280 sets of military uniforms, and 150  military mosquito nets.    3. We liberated nine villages -- namely, Ta Hen, Kdol,  Pongro, Chheam, Thnong, Kon Khla, Thmei, Krasang, and Chamka  Veang -- and Bavel town. [passage omitted]</p>

Paul Mazursky, also left  off the Oscar ballot, was the critics' second choice as best director for  "Enemies, a Love Story." The second choice of the critics for best picture was  "Drugstore Cowboy." Neither "Do the Right Thing" nor "Drugstore Cowboy" made  the final five with the Oscar voters. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jacques Amalric editorial from the "Ideas and Reactions" </F> column: "Bosnia: the Unjust War"]    [Excerpts] Like Warren Christopher, his secretary of  state, President Clinton has not been moved by the arguments  used by Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe  to ensure that the United States is involved, at least  diplomatically, in the Bosnian crisis. You just have to reread  his State of the Union message to realize this: The White House  chief spoke for 55 minutes but he only devoted eight minutes to  external questions, and only a few seconds to the former  Yugoslavia.    This refusal to intervene diplomatically should receive  spectacular confirmation in the next few days when the U.S.  Administration publishes new presidential directives relating to  the participation of U.S. troops in UN operations. These  directives will, in fact, have the effect of making it virtually  impossible for there to be any U.S. involvement in a UN  intervention aimed at restoring rather than maintaining peace  (which is the case in Bosnia) [passage omitted]    This is a far cry from Bill Clinton's election promise to  place a military rapid deployment force at the United Nations'  disposal. This is the exact opposite. The new presidential  directive will in fact simply be a list of pretexts for refusing  any participation in UN operations deemed not in keeping with  American national interest. In the opposite case, as formerly in  the Gulf War, it can be expected that the initiative for the  operation will not be taken by the United Nations but by  Washington, with the United Nations then only serving as a  screen.    The announcement of this new policy will be welcomed by  American public opinion and by Congress: The pictures of GI  bodies being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu are still  present in everybody's memory and highlight this illusion of a  war without innocent victims, in which only the "bad guys" die,  which ensured the media success of the confrontation with Saddam  Husayn. But how can anybody forget that George Bush had  launched his country into the Somali operation largely to make  his voters forget the terrible pictures coming out of the former  Yugoslavia? Why should Bill Clinton be spared a dilemma which  is as old as America? Although the the rejection of old  European wrongdoings, which founded the creation of the United  States, carries within it a large dose of isolationism, the  puritanism and messianism which go with it carry within them the  seed of interventionism.    The U.S. President has so far managed to reconcile the two  tendencies: Officially, at least, it is by moralism and a sense  of justice that he justifies his refusal to get his hands dirty  in Bosnia and give his backing in principle to a plan to  partition this former Yugoslav Republic. The victims, he says  referring to the Muslims, have the right to defend themselves.  The conflict in Bosnia, he also hints, does not threaten any  American interest. In so doing, he is gambling on a  continuation of the war, from which justice would emerge.  Unfortunately, there is a strong chance that he will lose his  bet: Of course, the outcome of the fighting is at present  favorable to the Muslims. But major victories will inevitably  provoke a Serbian counteroffensive, which is already being  planned, and the official entry of the Croatian Army into  Bosnia. The 12,000 Blue Helmets deployed in Bosnia will merely  prevent the war going round in circles, and their withdrawal  will be inevitable. The internationalization of the conflict  will then be even closer because it will become infinitely more  difficult to curb Slav and Muslim solidarities: Russia is much  more active in its diplomatic defense of the Serbian positions,  whereas China will place an increasingly high price on its right  of veto within the Security Council, and many Muslim countries  will consider the support (not only moral, according to some  Western intelligence services) given by the Americans to the  Bosnian Muslims as the go-ahead for increased intervention.</p>

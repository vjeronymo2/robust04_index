			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefan Kornelius: "Draft for Final Communique of </F> Summit Meeting: NATO Offers East Europe Cautious Rapprochement,  While at the Same Time Strengthening the Alliance in West  Europe"]    [Text] Bonn, 9 January -- The NATO heads of government and  the foreign ministers will take cautious steps to establish  closer relations with the East European states. At the same  time, they want to strengthen the West European pillar of the  alliance. In a final communique of the conference, the draft of  which is available to SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the delegations will  agree on the following formula: "We expect and would welcome an  expansion of NATO toward the democratic states east of us in an  evolutionary process that would take into consideration the  security-political development in Europe." In a first step, the  alliance will offer the East European states political and  military cooperation under the formula Partnership for Peace.    The heads of state and government and the foreign ministers  of the 16 NATO states will meet in Brussels for a two-day  meeting today. According to the agenda, the declaration  Partnership for Peace is to be adopted on the first day, and a  final communique on the second. Both documents have largely  been completed after weeks of negotiations. Some particularly  controversial issues -- the financing of Partnership for Peace,  for example -- are still unsettled.    The Partnership for Peace declaration states that NATO will  remain open for other states "that are in a position to promote  the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to  the security of the North Atlantic territory." First of all,  however, the Partnership program will be adopted to allow the  development of a new "security relationship." "Active  participation in the Partnership for Peace program will play a  significant role in the evolutionary process of NATO expansion,"  the declaration reads.    The states of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and  other CSCE countries have been invited to participate. NATO  bodies will decide on the election of the partners. NATO  promises that consultation will be held with every participant  in the program if its "territorial integrity, political  independence, or security are in peril." It is still unclear  whether the individual partners in the program can ask NATO for  consultations or whether the alliance has to take the first  step. The communique stipulates that the East European partners  themselves will decide to what extent they want to reveal their  defense budgets, to what extent they subject their defense  ministries to democratic control, and whether they want to  participate in joint exercises and plannings. NATO wants to  carry out joint exercises for peacekeeping missions with all  partners in the program as early as this year.    Under the headline "European Security and Defense Identity,"  the final declaration stresses the need for a close link between  NATO and the Western European Union [WEU], the defense  organization of the European Union. The individual NATO bodies  are requested to draft new political and military structures  with which NATO can react in a more flexible manner to crises.  NATO wants to strengthen the WEU as its European pillar. The  military command and task forces of the WEU should be organized  in a module system. They should be "separable" but not develop  separate structures.    The name of the task force is the Combined Joint Task Force.  It will consist of army, air force, and naval units of several  member states of the WEU and other nations. It is conceivable  to also integrate troops from East European states -- for  peacekeeping measures of the CSCE, for example.    Concerning the chapter "Proliferation of Weapons of Mass  Destruction," the negotiators failed to adopt the far-reaching  demands of the United States. A working group is to be  established that will draft a consistent NATO policy and improve  the existing measures against the proliferation of the weapons.  It is not clear yet, for example, in what way NATO should  become active in preventing proliferation and whether -- this  would be the most far-reaching scenario -- it may carry out  punitive expeditions to destroy these weapons.    When preparing for the meeting, a dispute apparently erupted  as to whether the alliance will comment on the renewal of the  Nonproliferation Treaty on nuclear weapons. The treaty will  expire in 1995. The draft of the final communique contains the  following sentence: "We are determined to achieve the unlimited  and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty at the 1995 conference." According to reports, some  delegations successfully insisted on eliminating the sentence  from the communique.</p>

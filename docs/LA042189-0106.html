			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT NORTHROP CEO;  </P> <P> KRESA CHOICE SURPRISES FEW, PLEASES MANY  </P> <P> Kent Kresa, the man who will be giving orders as Northrop Corp.'s new chief  executive, is said to have risen through the ranks because he has excelled at  building jet products, a talent that should serve him well as the company's  emphasis shifts to the factory floor.  </P> <P> Thomas V. Jones, outgoing chief executive at Northrop, said Kresa has been  tapped for the firm's top spot partly because he has the experience and  engineering know-how to ensure that the company develops quality fighter planes  and other equipment for the Pentagon and other customers.  </P> <P> "He's the right guy by attitude," Jones said, "and now that he's been through  management, he knows how to get the people who can do the (production) job  right."  </P> <P> Kresa, 51, Northrop president and chief operating officer since 1987, will  succeed Jones sometime late this year. Jones will continue to serve as chairman  of the company. The selection of Kresa is not surprising, say industry  analysts, because Northrop is moving from a period of heavy research and  development into a heavy production period.  </P> <P> With projects such as the B-2 stealth bomber on line, Northrop is expected to  get 70% to 80% of its sales from production of actual jet equipment over the  next three to four years. Currently, research and development accounts for  about 60% of the company's revenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Known as Creative  </P> <P> "His considerable understanding of technology . . . may be one reason they  (Northrop) moved now and selected him," said Paul H. Nisbet, aerospace analyst  at Prudential-Bache Securities. "The B-2 bomber is ready to move into  full-scale production, and he (Kresa) has concentrated on production. He's more  internally focused on production than Tom Jones."  </P> <P> Nisbet said Kresa, who joined Northrop as a vice president and manager of the  Northrop Research and Technology Center in 1975, is also known as a creative  manager -- one good at getting departments to research and develop prototypes.  Kresa's skills as a production manager and development specialist "put him on a  fast track," Nisbet said.  </P> <P> Michael Beltramo, a management consultant in the aerospace industry, also said  it has been clear for some time that Kresa was being groomed for high places at  Northrop.  </P> <P> "What I've heard is that he's a stickler for performance but also that he's a  reasonable guy," Beltramo said.  </P> <P> Describing his priorities at a Thursday press conference, Kresa sounded the  same theme.  </P> <P> "My principal priorities are performance, performance, performance," he said.  "The Air Force is depending on us and we have to deliver. . . . I see Northrop  as a company with a tremendous responsibility because of the confidence our  customers have in us. We have to continue to earn that confidence."  </P> <P> Kresa, who was also corporate vice president and general manager of Northrop's  Ventura division -- which develops and produces unmanned aerial targets and  remote-piloted vehicles -- cited his varied experience as a factor in his  success.  </P> <P> Responding to questions about the company's legal problems -- the government on  April 11 filed criminal charges against the company's Precision Products  division and two current employees -- Kresa said they don't reflect any  fundamental problems at the company.  </P> <P> "If there are problems, we investigate and fix them -- and fix them right  away," he said. "This is an ethical company, and we believe we are doing things  right."  </P></p>

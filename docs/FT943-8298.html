			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Support trickles back for Clinton crime bill President Bill Clinton's crime bill could be heading back to the floor of the House of Representatives for another vote tomorrow, as a trickle of waverers started to move over to the president's side. Since the bill was blocked last week on a 225-210 procedural vote, Mr Clinton has hammered away at the Republicans who provided most of the opposition, while at the same time offering concessions to persuade some members to change their votes. A successful vote on the crime bill would restore some momentum to the president's stalled legislative programme. He is still making grindingly slow progress in the House on his principal objective, healthcare reform. But this at last began to move forward in the Senate on Tuesday, when the first amendment to the Democratic leadership's bill, to speed up the provision of prenatal care, passed by a vote of 55-42. Mr Clinton needs only eight House members to change their votes in order to bring the crime bill back to the floor. Some black members now say they are willing to switch in exchange for Mr Clinton's promise to work on the uneven application of the death penalty to black and white defendants. And some Republicans who favour gun control but voted against the bill last week are now ready to vote for it, provided some face-saving changes can be negotiated to give them a justification for switching. White House officials said four points were not negotiable: funding for 100,000 new police officers, a ban on assault guns, the 'three strikes and out' rule of life imprisonment for a third violent crime, and significant funding for crime prevention programmes. Despite a readiness to make compromises, senior administration officials continued to attack the Republicans. 'The issue, very simply, is whether or not enough members of Congress are going to have the courage to vote against the National Rifle Association, which has put on a full court press to try to defeat this ban on assault weapons,' Vice President Al Gore said yesterday. In political terms, the argument has turned into a game of chicken. Neither Republicans nor Democrats are absolutely sure which side will pay the greater price with voters in the November congressional elections if anti-crime legislation, which is generally popular, fails to pass. Immediate polls show Mr Clinton's stock falling in the wake of last week's defeat on the bill. Many political analysts believe the Democrats will suffer most because they will be seen as incapable of getting anything done, despite controlling the White House and both houses of Congress. But in some districts Republicans are catching flak from mayors, police chiefs and constituents for blocking the bill.</p>

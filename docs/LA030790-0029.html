			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING REPORT: OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> LAKE CASTAIC IS THE PLACE FOR THE BEST LARGEMOUTH  </P> <P> To say largemouth bass have been active at Lake Castaic would be an  understatement. So many sizable fish have been caught this past week at the Los  Angeles County reservoir that a spokeswoman called the week "one of the best  ever."  </P> <P> Ed Puente of Saugus, fishing with a crawfish on the upper lake, caught a 17  1/4-pound bass.  </P> <P> Terry Nagel of Sepulveda used a plastic worm on the lower lake to land a  16-pound 15-ounce largemouth.  </P> <P> LAKE MEAD -- Lower Basin producing some stripers between two and four pounds at  45-60 feet. Anchovies best bet.  </P> <P> BULLHEAD CITY -- Trout fair on river. Berkley Power Bait best bet. Crappie most  active at Topock Marsh, biting on minnows. Striped bass in lake scattered and  deep. Anchovies best bet.  </P> <P> SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina becoming increasingly active as water warms,  biting on artificials and live shad. North Shore jetty, Niland and Red Hill  most productive areas. Croaker bite fair from Salt Creek to Bombay Beach.  </P> <P> LAKE CACHUMA -- Two recent plants of trout. Food chain rich, trout full and  reluctant to bite. Largemouth bass fair, mainly in deep-water areas along rocky  shorelines.  </P> <P> LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass picking up, biting at about 10 feet. Arrow  Island and front side of main island producing most fish. Crawfish and  nightcrawlers good for bigger fish; brown and green plastic worms producing  more but smaller fish. Mike Frankland, Blossom Valley, 14 3/4-pound bass. Don  Dusing, Canyon Country, 12 1/4-pound bass. Trout active at northeast side.  Trollers doing best, using three-four colors and needlefish lure.  </P> <P> PYRAMID LAKE -- Catfish providing most action, biting mainly at dam and  channel. Sydney and Parchelle Moragne, Skokie, Ill., 10 1/2- and 3 1/2-pound  catfish, caught at dam. Robert Barton, Arcata, 10- and 9 1/2-pound catfish,  caught on anchovies in channel. Striped bass slow. Largemouth bass most active  at Brazo's Cove and island.  </P> <P> LAKE PIRU -- Trout planted recently, biting. Trollers using five-eight colors  and bikini needlefish. Power Bait and Velveeta cheese working in Felicia Cove.  Largemouth bass moving into shallow water to spawn. Rocky ledges and points of  coves best bet. Catfish fair in deep water at dam.  </P> <P> LAKE CASTAIC -- Largemouth bass active in both lakes. Ed Puente, Saugus, 17  1/4-pound bass, caught in upper lake on crawfish.

Yellow Power Bait and inflated  nightcrawlers at swim beach and east shore producing most fish.  </P> <P> PERRIS LAKE -- Spotted bass most active at lots 11 &amp; 12. Dave Neal,  Riverside, six-pound spotted bass. Trout stocked Monday, fish biting at lots 11  &amp; 12 and launch ramp.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To avoid any potential confusion, it should be noted that facilities operating under interim status would not lose this status if they do not follow the procedures the Agency is proposing in part 124 or 270. However, the permitting agency may choose to pursue an enforcement action, not connected to the termination of interim status provisions, including a requirement that the application be resubmitted or the notice be republished, if a facility fails to comply with the requirements. Similarly, for a new facility, the permitting agency's recourse would be to require that the application be resubmitted or the notice republished under the correct procedures, rather than permit denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Overview of proposed requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA first proposes that a permit applicant must give notice and hold at least one informal public meeting before submitting a RCRA permit application to EPA or the State. EPA believes this requirement will address the public concern that public involvement occurs too late in the RCRA permit process. One purpose of the meeting is to inform the affected community of the facility's proposed operations and its intent to apply for a RCRA permit in the near future. Another important purpose of the meeting is for the applicant to solicit and receive public input. EPA believes that dialogue between the applicant and the public, before the permitting process is initiated with the permitting authority, will allow the public to raise important community issues early in the process, and will promote discussion between the public and the persons seeking the permit. In this way, the public will have direct input to facility owners or operators; at the same time, facility owners or operators can gain an understanding of public expectations and attempt to resolve public issues well in advance of the draft permit. For example, facility owners or operators could address public concerns through the permit application itself, by changing the proposed design or operation of the facility, or through subsequent public interactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice and meeting also will assist in the generation of a mailing list of interested citizens. This list is a currently required mechanism used in the distribution of notices and information concerning the facility at points throughout the permit process. The permitting authority is responsible for developing a representative mailing list for public notices under 40 CFR 124.10 (see also preamble Section A.2: Current Public Participation Requirements in the RCRA Permit Process). Section 124.10 specifies the timing and content of such mailing lists. The pre-application meeting will assist the permitting authority in identifying people or organizations to include on the list so that it is complete and represents everyone who demonstrates an interest in the facility and the permit process. The permitting authority may develop the mailing list, in part, from the pre-application meeting attendance list. It has been EPA's experience that mailing lists often are not fully developed until the permitting authority issues the draft permit for public comment. Since EPA seeks to increase public participation earlier in the process, generation of a mailing list should precede such activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, EPA is proposing that the permitting authority provide public notice upon receiving a permit application. Under this provision, the permitting authority would notify the public of proposed facility operations at a much earlier stage than 40 CFR part 124 currently requires. Existing &sect;124.10 requires the permitting authority to provide public notice of a facility's intention to obtain a RCRA permit, but only after the permitting authority has received and reviewed the application and proposes to grant or deny the permit. Due to the volume and complexity of information contained in a permit application, this process may take several years to complete from the time a permit application is initially submitted. (See Figure 1.) For some facilities, the public has expressed a concern that critical decisions about the facility already have been made by the time the permitting authority proposes the draft permit decision. A requirement for a notice at the permit application stage would allow members of the public to review a permit application at the same time as the permitting agency and inform the agency of any concerns or comments they may have.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to involving the public earlier in the RCRA permitting process, the proposed provisions will also allow the public to get an overview of the RCRA application and permitting process, and the parts played by the permitting authority and the facility owner and operator in that process. Under the proposed rule, the permit applicant conducts the pre-application meeting since it is the applicant who initiates the permit process by submitting a permit application. The permitting authority issues the notice when it receives the permit application from the facility since, at that time, EPA or the State will use its authority to begin review of the permit application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1 below summarizes the applicability of the pre-application and notice of application provisions in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,s60,r30,r30 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  1._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Proposed Requirements for the Pre-Application Meeting and the Notice of Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Facility stage in permit process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Facility pre-application meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Agency notice of application <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> New Facility  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Yes  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Yes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interim Status  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Yes  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Yes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permit Renewal  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> No  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Yes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permit Modification  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> No  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> No. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Post-Closure Permit  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> No  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> No. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Third, the Agency is proposing a provision that will allow the Director the discretion to require the facility to establish an information repository. An information repository is a central collection of documents, which could include reports, summaries of data, studies, plans, etc., that the regulatory agency considers in evaluating the permit. The collection would be set up by the applicant in a convenient and accessible location. An information repository, similar to those required under Superfund and proposed under the RCRA Subpart S corrective action regulations of 40 CFR part 264 (see 55 FR 30798, July 27, 1990), would allow the interested public greater access to information, such as the permit application, and other material relevant to the permit decision process. To maintain flexibility in the permit process, and in recognition that information repositories may not be necessary for all facilities, the Director will use his or her discretion, based primarily on the level of public interest, in requiring a facility to establish an information repository. In situations where public interest is high, a locally established repository may benefit a community by providing convenient and timely access to important information about a local facility. If EPA or an authorized State decides to require a facility to establish a repository, it should be noted that only one repository is needed to fulfill the intent of today's proposed requirement, whether the permitting process for that facility is EPA-lead, State-lead, or joint federal-state.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

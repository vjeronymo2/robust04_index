			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Wheat futures were higher at midsession in Chicago supported by a mix of speculative buying in the wake of bullish USDA crop reports on Friday and Monday. The bullish reports include USDA ending stocks estimate, greater-than-expected USDA wheat export inspections, and less-than-expected winter wheat plantings. On the LME copper, lead and zinc prices rallied in the afternoon on market talk that Peru is to close some of the facilities at its La Oroya lead/zinc/copper plant due to high energy costs. Traders said zinc was more vulnerable than some other metals to talk of supply disruptions as it had recently absorbed news that two European smelter closures in the first half of 1992 will take 200,000 tonnes of capacity off the market. The news lifted three-month copper away from a test of the recent 3 1/2 -year low of Dollars 2,110 a tonne. But dealers believe that with charts and fundamentals bearish, this level could be tested again soon. Gold pulled back from a dip into the Dollars 350-a-troy-ounce area on the bullion market. Dealers said the market was in a position to make more progress on the upside and possibly later this week challenge last Thursday's highs between Dollars 358 and Dollars 360.

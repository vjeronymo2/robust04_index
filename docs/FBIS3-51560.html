Molirena President Alfredo Ramirez indicated that after  several hours of deliberations the party's political committee  decided to select Carles as the presidential candidate because  he represented the best option.    Ramirez stated that, unfortunately, conversations with the  PA  had not progressed. For several months now Molirena has been  stating its intention to participate in the May 1994 elections  with its own candidate. At the same time, Ramirez pointed out  that Molirena also seeks to occupy the first vice presidency of  any ticket that supports Carles' candidacy. In order to  accomplish this, it has designated a commission to prepare a  list of nominees from which Carles can chose the person most  suited to occupy the position of first vice president.    A Molirena source reported that possible first vice  president  nominees include former Labor Minister Jorge Ruben Rosas, former  Housing Minister Guillermo Quijano, and National Assembly  President Arturo Vallarino. According to the same source, Carles  could opt for Guillermo Quijano as first vice president and  Tomas Herrera, member [and president] of the Civic Renewal Party  as second vice president.    As of today, Ruben Dario Carles' candidacy will be supported  by three parties: National Renewal, Civic Renewal, and Molirena.    Meanwhile, First Vice President Guillermo Ford indicated  that  he will continue to carry out his duties as a member of  President Endara's cabinet. At the same time he accepted the  Molirena political committee's decision and reiterated that he  plans to continue being a member of said party. Ford said that  he will continue serving democracy until 1 September 1994 when  the new government is expected to be inaugurated. The vice  president stipulated that together with President Endara he  expects to guarantee clean and fair elections as an aftermath of  the administration elected in 1989.    On the other hand, it was disclosed that those cabinet  ministers who are Molirena members have no plans to resign their  current positions and indicated that they will step down if it  is specifically requested by President Endara.    Molirena is expected to hold its national convention today  at  the ATLAPA Convention Center and to ratify the decision made by  the party's political committee. The party is expected to hold  internal elections on 30 January to select candidates for  legislators, corregimiento representatives, mayors, and council  representatives.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Sell-offs fail to boost habit of share ownership THE government's privat-isation campaign has failed to encourage wider share ownership among Britons. A survey for ProShare, a body that promotes share ownership, found that only 200,000 privatisation buyers also bought other quoted stocks. The survey also found a decline in the total number of shareholders in Britain. 'By our reckoning, shareholding peaked at around 11m after the electricity companies' float in 1990,' Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, ProShare's chief executive, said. Today the figure is about 9.26m. Of those, 5.7m shareholders (62 per cent of the total) - nicknamed 'Sids' after the slogan used in the British Gas campaign - own shares only in privatised stocks. About 960,000 people (10 per cent of the total) own shares solely through employee schemes. ProShare found two other significant groups of shareholders. There are 1.6m 'traditional shareholders' - those who own non-privatised shares and who, if they hold privatised shares, bought them only after other holdings. In addition, there are about 800,000 people who were given shares in the Abbey National flotation who do not own any other shares. Mr Stuart Valentine, director of research at ProShare, said: 'Privatisations were made easy but buying shares on the secondary market appears to be complex. 'People still believe that privatisations are in some way different from owning other shares. 'Privatisations were seen as a one-way bet but other shares do not attract special privileges or discounts. The wider stock market is seen by many as a gamble, and a gamble which they might well lose.' 'Shares are not yet seen as a part of saving. Owning shares is not something that a respectable married man does in public,' Mr Valentine said. In the survey, which was conducted by Mori, 9,171 adults were interviewed, 1,973 of them identified as shareholders.</p>

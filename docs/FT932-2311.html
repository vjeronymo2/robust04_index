			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Serbs to vote on new mini-state MR Milorad Visic, mayor of the devastated town of Vukovar, sees the weekend referendum in the self-styled state of Serbian Krajina, in Croatia, as a crucial step in carving out a Serbian state. An overwhelming majority of voters is expected to cast ballots in favour of the union of Serb-held parts of Croatia with Serb-held parts of Bosnia. Boasting that he is a nationalist, Mr Visic says the referendum will help to cement a Serbian state for Serbs and not for other ethnic groups. Encouraged by the inability of the international community to stop the ethnic division of Bosnia, Mr Visic believes his mini-state will benefit from what he calls the new-found realism in the west. 'Let the west make Vukovar the capital of the new Serbian state,' he says, calling the referendum the most important event since the 'liberation' of Vukovar. 'Other nationalities are not equal to Serbs in this state. The Croats can have their own state but not on our territory,' he says of his 'republic', which covers nearly one-third of Croatia. The 33-year-old mayor of the once picturesque Baroque town set on the banks of the River Danube is not alone in his opinions. He seems to express sentiments shared by most of the inhabitants of the burned-out town in eastern Croatia. Colourful referendum posters remind voters: 'One state, one wish, one nation.' Mr Visic says the week-end poll will be a key step in institutionalising the union of some 2m Serbs outside Serbia. He criticises Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for wanting to unite all Serbs in a state in which other ethnic groups have equal rights. Asked if he envisages a union with neighbouring Serbia, Mr Visic says: 'This will come later. Serbia will unite with us once it solves the problem of Kosovo,' in reference to the mostly Albanian province in southern Serbia. 'They must either give it away or beat the Albanians the way we did the Croats,' he laughs. He believes the poll will stop Mr Milosevic from making deals with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 'He does not have the right to play with our fate or trade our land,' Mr Visic says, amid speculation that the leaders of Serbia and Croatia plan to swap territory in exchange for peace.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Tobacco wars claim a victim in the food sector: The death of RJR's move to cut debt in a 'smoke-free' zone The curse of Philip Morris is proving powerful and enduring. On April 2, the big tobacco and consumer products company decided to slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes, its top-selling brand. That immediately caused mayhem in the lucrative tobacco industry, where rivals - notably RJR Nabisco - scrambled to match the Marlboro move. A price war began. But the repercussions of Philip Morris's action have extended beyond the tobacco industry, hitting RJR in another business segment regarded as 'smoke-free'. It has led indirectly to the 11th-hour withdrawal of RJR Nabisco's plan to raise Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) by issuing shares pegged to the performance of its food division. The slashing of the price of a brand as well known as Marlboro underlined the vulnerability of brands in general in a recession. It also highlighted the extent to which less profitable 'own label' products were gaining sales. The same worries migrated to food stocks which suffered too. The Dow-Jones US food sector index, for example, has dropped by about 10 per cent since the beginning of March. This 'derating' of food stocks has cost RJR Nabisco more than Dollars 1.5bn, the very sum it was hoping to raise by selling 93m food-linked shares. The shares (to be known as RN-Nabisco stock) would have represented about a quarter of the food company's equity, with the parent company holding the remaining 75 per cent. RJR Nabisco, whose food brands include Oreo cookies and Planters peanuts, had indicated a price range for the offering of Dollars 17-Dollars 19 a share. At Dollars 18, it would have been selling the new shares at about 14 times prospective 1993 earnings, roughly in line with other big food companies. But, after an extensive marketing campaign, the company's bankers admitted that they could not round up enough takers at this price and, on Wednesday morning, RJR decided not to lower it. Those involved in the issue suggest that there was reluctance on the part of the large growth-oriented mutual funds, who would have been the key to the issue's success. 'They want to be underweight in this sector,' commented one banker. Whether food sector weakness is the whole story behind the RJR decision is a moot point. For a start, the Nabisco food business is more heavily biased towards the highly competitive US market than some rivals' activities. This is because RJR sold many international food interests to reduce the Dollars 30bn debt taken on in the record-breaking leveraged takeover of the company in 1989. Although it has been rebuilding overseas operations, these remain modest: Nabisco Food America had sales of Dollars 5.94bn and operating profits of Dollars 682m in 1992, for example, while at Nabisco International, the figures were Dollars 766m and Dollars 87m. A more fundamental worry was whether the new shares would have counted as a food sector stock anyway. This was not going to be a full demerger of RJR's food division. Although the RN-Nabisco shares were supposed to reflect the earnings progress of the food manufacturing assets, there was to be no legal separation of this business from RJR's tobacco division - with all the litigation and ethical investment baggage that this entails. In the words of one analyst: 'This was not a pure food company and, therefore, it shouldn't have traded at an equivalent multiple.' Whatever the reasons, there are three losers. The first is RJR, which is denied Dollars 1.5bn. The cash would have reduced borrowings from the current Dollars 14bn, cutting interest payments. Offsetting this benefit, however, was the potential dividend bill for the RN-Nabisco shares, which was expected to absorb almost Dollars 200m annually. That will now be saved. This largely explains Wall Street's phlegmatic response to the cancelled issue. RJR shares edged higher on Wednesday and were holding at Dollars 5 1/2 yesterday, with some analysts relieved the company had not pursued the RN-Nabisco sale at a lower price. The big rating agencies also affirmed the group's 'investment grade' debt standings, although Standard &amp; Poor's qualified this by saying the rating outlook was 'negative' due to cigarette wars. Fitch, for example, calculates RJR's annual cash flow is just over Dollars 4bn. Almost Dollars 3bn is needed to fund interest payments, dividends, taxes, capital spending and working capital. 'This leaves a considerable cash cushion of almost Dollars 1.2bn for debt reduction, acquisitions, or other corporate purposes. This cushion is sufficient to see RJR through the current price war in the tobacco industry without damage to its existing credit ratings,' said its analysts. RJR's debt maturities are reckoned to average about Dollars 200m over the next few years - not a problematic amount. And there may be scope for refinancing RJR's most expensive debt - something which the company has been doing continually since the takeover. But with the shadow cast by the cigarette price wars, no one denies RJR will have its work cut out to get its fast-sinking share price moving upwards again. This is particularly bad news for Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out specialists who led the Dollars 25bn takeover of RJR. The KKR-run buy-out fund owns more than half RJR's ordinary shares and has seen their value halve over the past 18 months. Finally, the aborted sale will leave many Wall Street investment houses millions of dollars poorer. According to Securities Data, total underwriting fees on initial public offerings this year have averaged about 7.4 per cent of the issue proceeds. Their consolation is that IPOs are running at heady levels, and the record-breaking Dollars 2.1bn flotation of Allstate Insurance earlier this month went smoothly.</p>

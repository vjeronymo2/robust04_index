			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rec speculation Bid speculation enlivened the regional electricity companies (recs) sector as rumours that a takeover offer for Northern Electricity is imminent did the rounds. The stock climbed 23 to 910p on 3.1m turnover. The new speculation centred on international trading group Jardine Matheson, with the talk suggesting it would be a way for the group to move funds out of Hong Kong and into the UK. However, a bid from Scottish Power or Hanson, both mentioned last week as possible predators, was not ruled out by some observers. Further buying of the stock was encouraged by a clutch of broker recommendations. NatWest Securities advised clients to buy Northern but warned: 'There is a possibility of corporate activity in the sector and Northern looks as likely a target as any. However, with the (sale of the National) Grid details not yet known, we believe the timing is wrong.' Smith New Court recommended the recs as a whole, and Mr Kevin Lapwood at the brokerage said: 'On fundamentals these stocks are cheap.' Scottish Power hardened 1 1/2 to 331 1/2 p. Interest rate concern appeared to spread rapidly across the building materials sector, making deep inroads into a number of shares and leading to heavy volumes. Tarmac traded 12m shares, including a single deal of 4.7m, Caradon saw 3.3m turnover, while plumbing specialist Spring Ram, boosted by the sale of a block of family trust shares, soared to 30m trades. Rugby was the stock most troubled by the industry's fears for an interest rate led slide in demand, tumbling more than 5 per cent, with the shares down 6 at 105p in 2.7m turnover. Blue Circle fell 6 to 274p on 2m traded, RMC retreated 21 to 969p and Tarmac ended a penny adrift at 113 1/2 p. Caradon finished 2 lower at 228p. Behind the Spring Ram volume was a big deal by BZW, which sold 15m shares, or 3.3 per cent of the group's equity, on behalf of the family trust of Mr Bill Rooney, former Spring Ram chairman. Favourable press comment and a general feeling that the recent concerns over Christmas trading had been overdone boosted several of the leading retail stocks. Marks &amp; Spencer rose 5 1/2 to 375p, but renewed doubts about the trading picture at Kingfisher saw the shares relinquish an early lead of 10 to end just 2 up at 422p. Bid excitement in the merchant banking sector faded slightly yesterday as profit-taking saw all the major candidates retreat. SG Warburg, under the scrutiny of Morgan Stanley, slipped 9 to 784p, while its 75 per cent-owned fund management arm Mercury Asset Management dropped 32 to 718p. Oil majors Shell and BP were firm ahead of BP's showpiece annual presentation today and talk that one leading US broker had been recommending the stock. Dealers cited CJ Lawrence, but veteran analyst Mr Charles Maxwell said that with crude prices still under pressure it was premature to expect a rally. Paper group David S. Smith surprised the market with figures well above forecasts but the shares barely moved. It appeared that an earlier sell recommendation from one house had led to a line of 1.6m shares being placed and not finding a home. Consequently, interims of Pounds 40.4m, against Pounds 13.7m last time, and a very upbeat trading statement saw the shares firm only a penny to 499p. Nevertheless, analysts were upgrading forecasts, with a confident James Capel boosting its prediction by Pounds 23m to Pounds 95m, believed to be the top end of the range. Elsewhere in the sector, James Capel turned seller on Arjo Wiggins Appleton, cutting by Pounds 20m its figures for 1995 and 1996 to Pounds 260m and Pounds 310m respectively. The house made the move to reflect the squeeze on margins in the US. Arjo slipped 4 1/2 to 246 1/2 p. Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham moved ahead strongly as some of the company's supporters stressed their enthusiasm following a positive global conference on Monday. Smith New Court reiterated its positive stance and edged up some of its long term forecasts, analyst Mr Paul Woodhouse arguing that if the stock were to return to an acceptable rating, then it had a 20 per cent upside from current levels. The 'A' shares appreciated 11 to 434 1/2 p, with combined turnover in the 'A' stock and Units hitting 11.6m. Chemicals group BOC fell 9 to 707p in reaction to a sell recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing. Meanwhile, BTP held steady at 285p, with Hoare Govett presenting it as a buying opportunity. Vague bid speculation was heard elsewhere in the recs. Talk that Southern Electricity, which reported bumper interim figures, may be thinking of a takeover offer for a water company in a neighbouring area checked a further advance in its shares. They closed 6 up at 756p. In addition, Seeboard and South West Electricity were mentioned as possible targets. The former jumped 21 to 421p, while the latter climbed 31 to 788p. Transport group NFC moved ahead strongly in 5m volume on the announcement that a board member was a big, personal buyer of the shares. Sir Christopher Bland, who takes up the post of chairman next month, has purchased 500,000 shares at 146 1/2 p. The news pushed NFC up 6 to 153p. Diversified industrial groups BTR and Hanson were again two of the most active Footsie stocks, with a combined 19.4m shares traded as talk of switching out of Hanson persisted. Hanson closed fractionally lower at 227 1/2 p after 10m turnover, while BTR shed 1 1/2 to 277p.</p>

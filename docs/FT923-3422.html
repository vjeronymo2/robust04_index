			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Top pay not matched by performance Sir, With respect to your recent feature on directors' pay ('Salary restraint hits top earners', September 2) and Mr Vernon-Harcourt's letter (September 7), the real issue of concern for shareholders and public policymakers is not the precise percentage increases received by top directors but whether they are justified by the performance of their companies. Our recent study based on a sample of about 300 FT-SE 500 companies between 1982 and 1991 points to the fact that, even in the severe recession currently hitting the UK economy, pay of top directors has consistently risen by substantially more than the rate of inflation. More importantly, any link between growth in top pay and corporate performance - measured by shareholder returns or earnings per share - was absent after 1988. The concern regarding directors' pay awards expressed by the media, academic commentators and workers' organisations appears to be entirely justified. At the very least this suggests that the mechanisms by which top directors receive their pay awards need to be reappraised/reformed in a substantial manner.

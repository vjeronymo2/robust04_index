			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 3 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  will not renew its import quota on aluminium from Russia,  Ukraine, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, which expired on February  28, a spokesman for the European Commission said here Thursday  [3 March].    He said the quota limit amounting to 180,000 tonnes a year  imposed last August was no longer necessary following an accord  by six major producers in Ottawa this week to cut output by  about two million tonnes a year.    The six are Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway,  Russia and the United States. Annual world over-production of  the metal is estimated at between 1.5 million and two million  tonnes.    Under the accord, Russia, which had been largely blamed for  causing a glut on the market, agreed to cut aluminium output by  500,000 tonnes a year in 1994 and 1995.    The spokesman said the EU quotas, mainly on Russia, had been  imposed last August as a "temporary, necessary and urgent  measure" to pressure the Russians into negotiating the  production cut agreement.    He said the EU was "cautiously optimistic" that the  "memorandum of understanding," accepted in Ottawa but negotiated  in Brussels in January, was starting to bite.    It included a commitment by the signatories to help  restructure the highly-polluting Russian aluminium industry.    A meeting to re-assess the state of the aluminium market is  scheduled here for April 21.</p>

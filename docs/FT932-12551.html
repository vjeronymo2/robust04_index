			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Exports lead way as optimism soars in CBI survey EXPORTS ARE leading the UK out of recession, but a disappointing decline in intentions to invest in new plant and machinery could threaten the strength of recovery. That was the message from the Confederation of British Industry yesterday as it released the results of its quarterly industrial trends survey. It reported that the last four months have seen a significant increase in demand for exports and that manufacturers expect the next few months to bring the strongest growth in orders and output for four years. Business optimism registered its biggest rise for 10 years. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said: 'We are beginning to move out of recession, with exports leading the way.' He cautioned, however, that with many of the UK's principal export markets in Europe falling into recession, progress could be slow. There was also concern about investment intentions. The survey, which covered 1,295 companies between March 26 and April 14, found that more enterprises plan to cut expenditure on plant and machinery than to increase it. The highlights of the survey include: Business optimism: The increase in business optimism was the second consecutive rise and the sharpest since April 1983. Forty three per cent of firms are more optimistic about the general business situation compared with only 12 per cent saying they expect things to get worse. Orders: The difference between those companies expecting overall demand to rise over the next four months (31 per cent) and those expecting it to fall (11 per cent) was the highest balance since 1989. This compares with positive balances of 13 in January and 7 in April 1992. Export orders are expected to rise broadly in line with home demand, with a positive balance of 18 of companies expecting an improvement, the same as in January when the last survey was carried out. Optimism about exports in January was reflected in a rise in export orders over the past four months, the first increase since early 1990. Domestic demand did not live up to expectations and fell slightly. Prices: The squeeze on profit margins has eased slightly since the beginning of the year as more firms have raised both domestic and export prices than cut them. Output: This flattened over the past four months, following sharp falls in the 12 preceding surveys. It is now expected to rise over the next four months. Jobs: The rate of job losses over the next four months is expected to be the slowest for three years. But only 12 per cent of companies expect an increase in employment, with 35 per cent expecting a fall. This is nonetheless better than the negative balances of 35 percentage points in January and 31 a year ago. Stocks: The rate of destocking was reported to be at its lowest since July 1990. Further destocking is expected over the next four months. Investment: The 24 per cent of companies expecting to spend more on plant and machinery in the next year are outnumbered by the 32 per cent planning to spend less. The negative balance of 8 compares with negative balances of 7 in the last survey and 10 in April last year. The CBI said uncertainty about demand prospects and an inadequate net return were the biggest constraints on investment. Training and innovation spending continues to rise. Unit costs: These have risen more slowly than was anticipated in the last survey. They are expected to increase even more slowly in the next four months. Capacity: Sixty three per cent of companies now say they are working below capacity. This was the lowest figure since January 1991. CBI Industrial Trends Survey, April 1993.

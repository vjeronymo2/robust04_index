The detectors are  comprised of 50 GaAs quantum wells and Al[.sub]0.28[/]  Ga[.sub]0.72[/] As barriers. The detectors were fabricated by  etching a 320-m-diameter mesa. We have achieved a detector  responsivity R[.sub]_n_[/] = 9.7 x 10[.sup]5[/] V/W and a  high-detectivity at peak wavelength in excess of 1 x  10[.sup]11[/] cm-(Hz)[.sup]1/2[/]/W at 9.2 m; device  dark current is lower than 0.1 A at an operating temperature  of T = 77K.</p>

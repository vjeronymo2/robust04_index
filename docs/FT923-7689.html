			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: End in sight of the paint pot battle HOSTILE BIDS are supposed to contain a fair amount of sabre-rattling, but last week Kalon's bid for Manders (Holdings) produced what might be better described as penknife-waving. Earlier in the bid process the rival paint makers had skirmished fitfully, if not always fruitfully, over management achievements, relative corporate performances, competition claims and other meaty industrial issues. Day 39 was delayed, came and went, as did the interim results of both sides. Suddenly a financial molehill, revealed in a circular written by Mr Tim Steer for James Capel, has expanded into a mountain of hot air and did/didn't/did/didn'ts. The crux was an Pounds 800,000 provision made by Manders 'relating to Windeck', the own-label paint business bought for Pounds 5.66m in December. Kalon - which had received some local and political stick for saying it would close the factory - fired off a list of four questions about the provision and whether and when Manders had intended to close Windeck's Bingley factory. Shareholders' minds will focus on the fundamentals this coming week as Friday's final closing date approaches.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lack of a quorum on Tuesday prevented the Committee  on Budgets, Taxation, Banks and Finance of the State Duma, the  lower house of the Russian parliament, to take any decision on  the draft national budget for this year.    The Duma on April 15 approved the main points in the draft,  prepared by the government, though suggesting a few amendments  to it. The government, around the end of the month, responded  with a document over 40 pages long, which has already been  considered by some of the lower house committees.    On Tuesday it became known that the Duma Committees on  Economic Policy and on Relations with the Commonwealth of  Independent States had proposed that the draft budget be turned  down. The Defense Committee, for its part, suggested raising  the military expenditure from 37 to 55 trillion rubles.    The Committee on Budgets, Taxation, Banks and Finance is  also  critical of the draft. Committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov said  at Tuesday's meeting that the government had "effectively  ignored" many of the recommendations made by Duma members.  Thus, the house had said the document ignores social and  economic forecasts for 1994 and fails to meet some of the  country's social and economic priorities as formulated in  President Boris Yeltsin's message to parliament. The Duma also  said the draft, if passed, would impose heavier taxes on  manufacturers and provide for unreasonable expenditure for the  officialdom.    The committee, of whose 43 members only 19 came to Tuesday's  meeting, decided to go back to the matter on May 12.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Gunmen kill West Bank rabbi Islamic gunmen yesterday killed a rabbi and wounded an Israeli policeman near Hebron on the occupied West Bank. Hamas, the main opponent of the peace deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, claimed responsibility in a statement issued in the Gaza Strip. The 35-year-old rabbi, Ami Ulami, was driving north towards the settlement of Otniel, when gunmen raked his car with automatic fire. The car overturned, but it was not immediately clear whether he died from the shooting or the crash. The policeman, a passenger in the vehicle, suffered gunshot wounds and was recovering in a Jerusalem hospital last night. Settler leaders claimed authorities had done nothing to bolster security in the area since two Israelis were killed in a guerrilla attack earlier this year about 1km from the site of yesterday's incident. Mr Roni Shechner, head of the local settlements council, said: 'There are dangerous killers in this area, but the army is thinning its forces, instead of reinforcing them.' Earlier yesterday the Chief of Staff, Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, warned the cabinet that Israel could expect an increase in Palestinian attacks. The prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, is standing by his policy of 'fighting terror as if there were no peace negotiations, while negotiating as if there were no terror'. The attacks are, however, forcing him to move slowly and cautiously. Six months after Israeli troops pulled out of most of Gaza and Jericho, he has still to set a date for evacuating the rest of the West Bank, or for granting the Palestinians safe passage by road between Gaza and Jericho. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman who is considering the possibility of setting up a consultative council in the absence of elections, is challenging Hamas to accept a share of the responsibility that goes with influencing Palestinian autonomy.</p>

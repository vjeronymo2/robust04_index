			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Accord fixes agenda for global forum - Geneva talks IT IS a matter of conjecture whether yesterday's breakthrough in trade talks between the world's leading industrial powers had the force of an historic 'preliminary agreement' - as Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, would have it - or was no more than a 'report that sets out the terms for future negotiations and objectives' - as coy French ministers insisted. What is less debatable is that it has enabled trade negotiations to resume next Monday in Geneva for the first time since December. There, issues can be addressed by all 111 signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, rather than the 15 industrial countries represented by the European Community, Japan, Canada and the US. Equally clear is that an array of difficult disagreements on trade liberalisation remain to be resolved before any champagne corks can be popped to celebrate a Uruguay Round accord. In short, deep-seated differences remain over liberalisation of farm trade, trade in textiles, and the opening of markets in Japan and South Korea to rice imports. The long-simmering row over trade in steel products will also be hard to resolve. The text of yesterday's Uruguay Round report to the G7 from negotiators in Tokyo stepped discreetly around a failure to reach agreement on trade in services. Officials noted merely that they would 'continue to work toward satisfactory solutions' to outstanding differences on reform of trade in financial, maritime and audio-visual services - areas that have eluded agreement for the past two years. Disputes over proposals to strengthen Gatt rules - most prominently over settlement of trade disputes, the use of subsidies, protection against dumping, and government procurement - have also been left unattended until negotiations resume in Geneva. Most contentious of all is a dispute over whether Gatt's powers should be increased by transforming it into a multilateral trading organisation. In Tokyo yesterday Mr Hugo Paeman, the EC's senior trade negotiator, was clear that difficult issues remain. 'The most difficult will be to sell (today's agreement) to the other countries,' he said, adding that some newly industrialised countries might object to parts of the accord. The Quad deal would be meaningless without a multilateral Gatt accord embracing all 111 signatories, he said. 'Everything is part of one single undertaking.' He was, nevertheless, optimistic about prospects. 'Now that this has been done, it's 80 per cent certain that we can end the Uruguay Round by the end of the year.' The task facing Mr Peter Sutherland, now in his eighth day as director-general of Gatt, is daunting as negotiators prepare to try for the fourth time in four years to steer the Round to a successful conclusion. For Mr Sutherland, a key sentence in yesterday's Quad report sets his agenda for the months ahead. 'Subject to appropriate contributions by other major producers and exporters and satisfactory resolution of specific non-tariff measure issues, we want to build upon existing market access offers contained in our draft schedules of concessions through a comprehensive and integrated approach, recognising the desire of some participants to move further in various areas such as wood, paper and pulp, and scientific equipment,' the report says. A priority will be to gather together representatives from all contracting parties to the Gatt next Monday. The next step will be to prepare an agenda that takes negotiators to a full agreement by a December 15 deadline - when President Bill Clinton's 'fast track' authority expires. It is possible Mr Sutherland will demand the unthinkable: that negotiators abandon long-planned summer breaks during August to ensure progress in the negotiations. If he balks on this, he has just two weeks now, and then 15 weeks from early September, to resolve outstanding differences. Mr Sutherland was yesterday relieved by the breakthrough. Late last week he had warned that failure in Tokyo would effectively destroy hopes of completing the Round by the end of the year. 'This was the signal that was needed to relaunch the multilateral process in Geneva,' he said. He called on negotiators in Tokyo to return on Monday to Geneva 'to inform trading partners. . . on the details of the agreement they have reached, with a view to building a multilaterally agreed package acceptable to all.'</p>

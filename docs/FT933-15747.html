			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: AMD lifts profits and sales in second quarter ADVANCED Micro Devices reported a rise in sales and earnings for the second quarter and said it had introduced its version of the Intel 486 microprocessor widely used in personal computers. Net income was Dollars 64.4m, before payment of preferred stock dividends, an increase of 55 per cent over last year's second quarter when net earnings were Dollars 41.4m. Sales advanced to Dollars 409.1m, up from Dollars 350.2m in the same period last year. After the preferred dividend, net income per common share was 65 cents, up from 43 cents. AMD was lifted during the year by sales of its clones of Intel microprocessors. However, the company said that during the second quarter sales of its other products grew by nearly 14 per cent over the previous quarter. Sales of flash memory chips, used in portable computers as an alternative to disk drives for data storage, increased by almost 60 per cent, the company added. This more than offset a decline in sales of AMD's 386 microprocessors, said Mr Richard Previte, president and chief operating officer. 'Our 386 microprocessor business reflected the market shift toward 486-based personal computers,' he added. 'Revenues from 386 microprocessors declined in a softer market with lower average selling prices.' AMD began shipping 486 microprocessors during the second quarter, and said it expected sharply increased sales in the current quarter. 'The Am486 family will be a significant contributor to revenues in the current quarter,' Mr Previte said. AMD announced its first 486 microprocessors incorporating in-house developed microcode. Microcode is internal software that controls the functions of a microprocessor. Previously, AMD has offered 486 microprocessors using Intel microcode. The company is engaged in a legal battle with Intel over its rights to the Intel technology. AMD charges that Intel has tried to prevent competition in the microprocessor market. 'With today's announcement, AMD has achieved a milestone that assures the continuation of free-market economics in the IBM-compatible personal computer marketplace,' said Mr WJ Sanders III, chairman and chief executive. For the first six months of 1993, AMD reported net income of Dollars 125.8m before the preferred stock dividend, or Dollars 1.28 per common share after the dividend. Revenues were Dollars 816.5m. In the same period of 1992, it recorded net income of Dollars 126.3m or Dollars 1.33 per common share after the dividend. Sales amounted to Dollars 757.6m.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Damage in quake may far exceed Dollars 7bn high The US insurance industry warned yesterday property damage from the Los Angeles earthquake could far exceed the record Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.70bn) from the 1989 San Francisco earthquake. 'The area affected is larger, more expensive homes were damaged and a larger number of businesses were hurt,' said Ms Rhonda Ruch of A M Best. 'While we have no numbers available yet, we feel the total property damage will far exceed Dollars 7bn and insured losses will be greater than Dollars 1bn, which is about the amount of damage caused by the San Francisco earthquake,' she said. However, Lloyd's of London underwriters yesterday played down the likely impact on their business. Lloyd's said the 'final total of insured losses to be eventually borne by the market will not have a major impact.' One underwriter who specialises in catastrophe reinsurance for US companies said: 'I am very relaxed about it.' The majority of Lloyd's underwriters tend to specialise in high-level catastrophe covers. These policies would be triggered only if an insured loss were big enough to lead US insurance companies to claim on their own reinsurance. 'It really needs to be a loss of Dollars 5bn or more for it to have an impact in London,' said one underwriter. Insured losses are expected to be limited partly because of the limited take-up of earthquake cover by Los Angeles residents. In turn reinsurers are optimistic their share of the loss will be minimal, partly because some big US insurers have tended to buy less reinsurance protection in recent years. Since hurricanes Hugo and Andrew in 1989 and 1992, London underwriters restricted the scope of coverage offered - excluding power lines, for example, from their policies. In contrast to the generally relaxed attitude at Lloyd's, one underwriter sounded a note of caution, recalling that Hurricane Andrew, where losses were originally estimated at Dollars 3bn, eventually cost insurance markets more than Dollars 16bn.</p>

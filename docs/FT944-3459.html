			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lex expands in Europe with FFr40m buy Lex Service, the motor retailer, is making its first foray into continental Europe with the acquisition of a large minority in PGA Motors, France's largest car dealer group. It has paid FFr40m (Pounds 4.75m) cash for a 26.7 per cent holding and a convertible bond, which will increase its stake to 34 per cent on conversion. Earlier this year PGA acquired the Diace dealer group. Following the rationalisation of the business, it is expected that it will be operating about 28 dealerships by the end of the year, selling more than 31,000 new and used cars a year with a turnover of more than FFr2.6bn. It operates dealer groups mainly in the areas between Bordeaux, Nantes and Tours, and between Avignon, Toulouse and Perpignan and holds franchises for Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, Opel, BMW and Mercedes-Benz as well as Peugeot and Citroen. PGA was founded in 1978 by Mr Pierre Guenant, the present chief executive, who remains the majority shareholder. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman of Lex Service, said yesterday that car retailing in France was now 'undergoing the sort of change that occurred in the UK some years ago with the formation of large, prof-essionally managed groups'. Continental European car markets, including France and Germany, are much more fragmented than the UK. Most dealerships are privately-owned and large public groups, such as Lex, are virtually unknown.</p>

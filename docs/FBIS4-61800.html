			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardas Jarmalavicius: "Another `State Coup </F> Scenario' or Echoes of Moscow in Vilnius"]    [Text] Seimas [parliament] deputies yesterday found a  "state coup scenario" in their office mail boxes, which was  allegedly discovered on the eve of 1994 in Vilnius, near one of  the "villas in Turniskes." Copies of the scenario were  distributed at the request of A. Kuncinas, deputy chairman of  the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] faction.    This "scenario" and the "version No. 1," which caused a  scandal in Moscow a month ago but which proved to be a  journalists' forgery, are like two peas in a pod.    According to the authors of this "document," the  implementation of the "coup" requires the incitement of society  through a variety of methods, including the staging of strikes  and the organization of referendums. This would allow for the  ousting of Lithuania's current government and the legalization  of a new one.    One of the LDDP faction leaders, who wanted to remain  anonymous, told a RESPUBLIKA reporter that he had had copies of  "those documents" as early as six months ago. However, he  failed to "leak" them to the public (the newspaper has some  information that those "documents" were circulated to other  editorial offices four months ago, but no one wanted to publish  them). The aforementioned LDDP leader says that he cannot find  any arguments to refute that the "scenario" was written by the  LDDP itself. The LDDP activist, who fears publicity, claims  that he knows that this "plan" emerged immediately after the  right-wing political forces lost the Seimas elections.    According to RESPUBLIKA information, the "coup scenario"  will  promptly prove useful for new actions scheduled by the LDDP.  First of all, the latter intends to torpedo the referendum  organized by the Homeland Union concerning the adoption of the  law "On Illegal Privatization, Devalued Deposits and Stocks, and  Law Enforcement Violations." The LDDP does not fear the law but  the possibility of including a question about early Seimas  elections on the referendum ballot at the very last moment. The  LDDP can apply to the Constitutional Court with a request to  examine whether the referendum law, which was adopted in the  times of the Lithuanian SSR, does not violate the Constitution.</p>

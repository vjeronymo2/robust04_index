			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: UK wins Kuwait naval deal A joint venture between Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey, the UK construction groups, has been awarded a Pounds 20m contract to carry out the first phase of restoring Kuwait's war damaged naval base, writes Andrew Taylor. The total cost of repairing the base has been estimated at Pounds 200m. British companies are thought to be in a strong position to win the vast bulk of the work following a UK-Kuwaiti defence agreement signed earlier this year. KADCOL, a consortium of UK companies including Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey, has been negotiating with Kuwaiti authorities over restoration of the base.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia offers shares in big oil producer ONE OF Russia's largest oil companies is to be partially sold off in one of the largest privatisations to date in the Russian energy sector, it emerged yesterday. Yuganskneftegaz, an oil production company, which manages fields in Western Siberia and claims to be one of the largest oil companies in the world, will sell about 12 per cent of its shares in auctions, scheduled to start on October 25. In keeping with Russia's privatisation schemes, the shares will be not be sold for cash, but privatisation vouchers. Since foreigners are legally permitted to deal in these vouchers, however, the sale marks one of the first opportunities for foreign investors to buy shares in a Russian oil company in a privatisation drive that started when another Russian oil company, Komineft, was partially privatised three months ago. But although the privatisation is seen as a step towards badly needed reform of Russia's energy sector, western oil groups yesterday expressed doubts that there would be many foreign buyers yet. 'I think it's premature to be talking about buying shares in a Russian oil company at the moment. Most Western (oil) companies here are trying to do joint deals,' commented one western oil executive in Moscow. Like most of Russia's troubled oil sector, Yuganskneftegaz has seen its output fall dramatically in the past two years, by 60 per cent to some 31.6m tonnes, according to Mr Pavel Fyodorov, deputy director. However, the company signed a joint venture deal three weeks ago with Amoco, the American oil company, to develop the Priobskoye oil field, which contains up to 5bn barrels of recoverable oil, according to executives at Amoco's headquarters in Houston. The limited quantity of shares on offer reflects, however, the lingering political opposition in Russia to the privatisation of large enterprises, particularly in key sectors such as oil. The Russian government plans to retain about one-third of the shares in the company, while the rest of the shares will be sold to workers, managers and local residents.</p>

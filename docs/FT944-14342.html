			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Managers 'are more confident on sales' Sales and marketing managers have become more confident in the past three months, the Chartered Institute of Marketing says today. One in five of those surveyed by the institute expects to beat their sales targets this year, compared with one in 10 of those surveyed in July. A further 47 per cent expect to match their sales targets. However, the managers' planned rate of sales growth this year is only 6.4 per cent, down from 7.1 per cent in the previous year. Service-sector companies are expecting faster sales growth than manufacturing companies. The survey shows little sign of inflationary pressures in the economy. Managers are expecting to increase prices by 1.7 per cent this year. The institute says the survey points to an economy that remains buoyant with subdued inflation, but with slower growth in the second half of the year than in the first. The Centre of Economic and Business Research interviewed 310 managers on behalf of the institute between September 27 and October 5. Meanwhile, the economics department of Barclays Bank says the pace of manufacturing growth is slowing. The bank expects manufacturing output to grow at 4 per cent in 1995, with the strongest growth coming from the electronics sector. Oxford Economic Forecasting predicts that the UK economy will grow at 3.4 per cent in 1995, faster than the OECD average of 3 per cent, but slower than the world growth rate of 4 per cent. Inflation is expected to rise to 3.2 per cent in 1995. The OECD average is 2.7 per cent.</p>

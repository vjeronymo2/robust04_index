			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLISEUM OVERHAUL BACKED;  </P> <P> BID TO KEEP RAIDERS ON DAVIS' DESK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Coliseum Commission voted 8 to 0 today to support the concept  of demolishing and reconstructing the Coliseum as a means of either keeping the  Raiders football team or attracting a new professional team.  </P> <P> The only commission member who is opposed to the idea, Los Angeles County  Supervisor Pete Schabarum, left the meeting before the vote for another  engagement. The decision cleared the way for the stadium's private managers,  Spectacor Management Group and MCA, Inc., to proceed with negotiations with  Raiders owner Al Davis in hopes of reaching an agreement to keep the team in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The motion offered by commission member Matthew Grossman stipulated that  reconstructing the Coliseum and keeping professional football would "be  achieved without expense to the public or any liability or commitment of public  funds on the part of the commission."  </P> <P> The motion also said the commission supports "the concept of privatizing the  management and operation of the Coliseum," an apparent commitment to approving  a long-term lease of the facility to the private partners.  </P> <P> Despite the reference to attracting a new team if the Raiders leave Los  Angeles, it is unlikely the project could secure financing without a  professional team already here.  </P> <P> Following the vote, Irving Azoff, a spokesman for the private management team,  said Spectacor and MCA, joined by the Pritzker hotel interests, already have a  firm offer on Davis' desk and Azoff said he hopes for its quick acceptance.  </P> <P> Davis' office said the owner was out of town and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> In past statements, Davis has said he wants a more "intimate" stadium to play  football in than the present 92,000-seat Coliseum. He has been pursuing that  goal in negotiations the last two years in Irwindale, Oakland and Sacramento as  well as Los Angeles. Just last Friday, he was in Sacramento meeting with those  who have proposed building a stadium there, and this Friday, he is due in  Oakland to meet with promoters there.  </P> <P> The latest Los Angeles offer from the private firms would entail demolishing  the Coliseum except for its eastern peristyle end and building a $140-million  facility with about 70,000 seats, including 200 luxury boxes and several  thousand club seats. In addition, the Raiders would be paid sums estimated at  today's meeting at up to $40 million cash at the outset, as well as $56 million  in cash guaranteed for later.  </P> <P> The commission vote, coming after brief debate, is only one in a series of  steps necessary to bring such a deal into being.  </P> <P> If Davis approves, the commission would have to approve the exact details, new  leases of the Coliseum grounds would have to be negotiated, historic  preservation and environmental requirements met, and financing secured. Also,  the joint powers agreement under which the Coliseum is run by a tripartite body  composed of representatives of the city, county and state may have to be  revised.  </P> <P> Looking toward dealing with all these details, commissioner president Richard  Riordan appointed a committee composed of himself, Schabarum and Grossman, to  talk matters over with the private managers.  </P></p>

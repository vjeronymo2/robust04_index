			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPER CHALLENGE OF MOTOCROSS;  </P> <P> STANTON WINS, PUTS ICING ON CAKE  </P> <P> New Supercross champion Jeff Stanton closed the stadium motocross season  Saturday night by winning the Coors Super Challenge of Motocross before 40,173  fans at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> It took Stanton eight laps to catch George Holland, but once he got the lead,  there was no stopping the Honda rider from Sherwood, Mich. Two Kawasaki riders,  Jeff Ward of Mission Viejo and Ron Lechien of El Cajon, finished second and  third, respectively, as Holland faded to fourth.  </P> <P> In prerace ceremonies, Stanton received a check for $50,000 for winning the  Supercross championship and also received the traditional No. 1 plates from  1988 champion Rick Johnson of El Cajon. Johnson, who won the first five stadium  races this year, was injured during practice last March and has not ridden  since.  </P> <P> The victory was Stanton's fourth of the 15-race season.  </P> <P> Holland, Stanton's Honda teammate from Kerman, Calif., came off the starting  line in front, much as he did in his heat, but in neither race could he hold  on. Ward caught and beat him in the heat, and Stanton caught him after several  laps over a Coliseum track that included two side-by-side runs up and through  the peristyle arches.  </P> <P> "I thought all along I could catch Holland because I ride with him in practice  and I knew he wasn't in as good a shape as he needed to be to go 20 laps on  such a long track," Stanton said. "The track was very fast, but very long for a  Supercross and it was very tiring.  </P> <P> "I was more concerned that Ward might be coming on, but after about 15 laps I  felt pretty secure. I only wish Ricky Johnson could have been riding all along.  We'd have put on quite a show, I think.  </P> <P> "I got a lot of confidence when I beat him straight up before he got hurt and I  think that helped me all season long."  </P> <P> Stanton also leads the 250cc national outdoor series with two races remaining.  He will then set his sights on the 500cc outdoor season, during which Johnson  expects to be ready to defend his championship. Stanton, who has virtually  clinched the 250cc title, would become the first rider to sweep all three  American Motorcyclist Assn. divisions if he were to win the 500. "I think the  500 is my best series because it favors a bigger rider and I'm bigger than  most," the 6-foot 180-pound Stanton said.  </P> <P> Guy Cooper of Stillwater, Okla., who was in second place in Camel Supercross  standings going into Saturday's race, did not ride after suffering a broken  collarbone during practice late Friday.  </P> <P> Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country earned $10,000 for winning the 125cc Camel  Shootout between the top riders of the East and West coasts after a 15-lap duel  with Damon Bradshaw of Charlotte, N.C.  </P></p>

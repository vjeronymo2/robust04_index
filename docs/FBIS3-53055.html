			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Palestinian ambassador in Amman, al-Tayyib  'Abd-al-Rahim, was asked by our correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab  for his reaction to the re-forming of the Royal Commission for  Jerusalem Affairs and the signing of the Jordanian-Palestinian  agreement.    [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Rahim] For us, the agreement is  a major accomplishment that would serve to consolidate our  national and pan-Arab identities. The agreement virtually  strengthens us with a shield, and that is brotherly Jordan. It  will help us build an infrastructure for our coming national  entity.    [Dhiyab] Yesterday, the Royal Commission for Jerusalem  Affairs was reactivated and renamed, assuming an Arab and  Islamic dimension, as well as the local one.    ['Abd-al-Rahim] We want to see the Jerusalem Committee firm  up the Arab presence in Jerusalem and counter attempts to  suppress that presence so that, when the final stage of a  settlement comes, we will be talking about real and identifiable  Arab features that have withstood Israel's attempts to erase the  Arab civilization in Jerusalem. The joint Jordanian-Palestinian  committees are to meet in the near future and build on the  economic agreement.    [Dhiyab] Mr. Ambassador: Have you had any reaction from  inside the occupied territory?    ['Abd-al-Rahim] Absolutely. Our people in the occupied  territory are quite happy with this agreement. As you know, our  people there are linked to our brother Jordanian people with  close bonds. Whatever pleases the Jordanian people will please  them there. I can't see a separation of the two peoples. Our  people in the occupied land are just as happy with the agreement  as our brother Jordanians. I had congratulations from large  sections of our people -- organizations, trade unions, and other  institutions -- calling for a further reinforcement of this  distinguished relationship, sponsored by His Majesty King Husayn  and brother Yasir 'Arafat.

The article says scientific accuracy and revolutionary  nature  of the chuche-based idea of socialism finds a graphic expression  in the ideology and theories on the essence of socialist society  expounded by it.    It further says:    Our party's chuche-based idea of socialism is the first in  history to give a clear exposition of the essence of socialist  society with the popular masses in the centre.    The essence of socialist society expounded by the  chuche-based idea of socialism is, above all, that socialism is  a society under which the popular masses are the masters of  everything.    It is the socialist society under which all the people have  valuable socio-political integrity and live a worthy life,  enjoying genuine political freedom and rights to the full.    This is a fundamental characteristic of the socialist  society  different from the exploiter society.    As the chuche-based idea of socialism expounds that the  socialist society is the society under which the popular masses  are the masters of everything, the popular nature of the  socialist society has become clear. The ideology and theory are  a weapon that deals a telling blow at the imperialists who are  engaged in malicious slander against socialism under the cloak  of bourgeois democracy.    The chuche-based idea of socialism also makes clear that  socialism is a society under which everything serves the popular  masses.    All the policies of the working-class party and state in the  socialist society proceed from what they should do to provide  the people with better life, and they are entirely subordinated  to this purpose.    The essence of the socialist society expounded by the  chuche-  based idea of socialism is also that socialism is a society that  is steadily developed by the united efforts of the popular  masses.    The basic characteristic of the socialist society different  from the exploiter society is that it is a society under which  the entire people are firmly united on the basis of a single  ideology and is developed by the united strength of the popular  masses.    The socialist society has socio-political conditions to  unite  all the people on the basis of a single ideology for they have  common purpose and interests.    As it definitely achieves the unity and cohesion of the  entire people, the socialist society gives a strong impetus to  the development of society.    This has vividly been proved by the proud reality of our-  style socialism that is making a long drive, surmounting all the  ordeals of history with the might of singlehearted unity.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il developed to perfection  from a new angle the socialist idea of chuche and gave a clear  exposition of the essence of the socialist society. This is a  noteworthy event of great significance in the accomplishment of  the Korean people's and world revolutionary people's cause of  independence, the cause of socialism, stresses the article.</p>

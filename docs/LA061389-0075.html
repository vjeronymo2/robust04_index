			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> With the American Stock Exchange index hitting an all-time high and the NASDAQ  index flirting with an all-time high, San Diego stocks continued to forge  ahead, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San  Diego Securities.  </P> <P> Ten San Diego stocks reported 1989 highs for the week, Katz said.  </P> <P> Maxwell Laboratories logged the largest upward move, gaining $3.25 to a new  high of $17, matching the $17-a-share merger bid announced last week by JAYCOR,  a privately held defense contractor. Maxwell's board rejected that offer, but  "it would appear that Maxwell Laboratories will be forced to consider other --  and maybe better -- offers as the stock now comes into play," Katz said.  </P> <P> Shareholders of Maxwell have vocally expressed disapproval of management at  past shareholder meetings and probably would be amenable to a buyout at a  higher price, Katz said.  </P> <P> Monitor Technologies recorded a new high of $8.125, gaining $1.375 for the  week. The increase was probably driven by the Bush Administration's clean-air  policy, which could eventually help Monitor's core air-monitoring business,  Katz said.  </P> <P> Beeba's Creations set a new high of $15.125 on a report of a favorable upcoming  earnings report.  </P> <P> Lower interest rates helped Great American First Savings Bank to a new high of  $14.375 and Home Federal to a new high of $41.75.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc., which reported a 43% increase in fourth-quarter earnings and  annual earnings of $.94 cents per share versus $.72 during the previous fiscal  year, reached a new high of $21.50.  </P> <P> Other new highs were recorded by Mycogen at $8.25, Burnham Pacific Properties  at $19.375, and General Microelectronics $5.25. Fisher Scientific Group reached  a new high of $20.75 after Henley Group, which owns 80% of Fisher's shares, bid  $20.50 for remaining shares. The market seems to be indicating that the offer  is inadequate, Katz said.  </P> <P> First National Corp. gained $.50 for the week and announced that it was in  discussions to acquire Torrey Pines Bank.  </P> <P> Molecular Biosystems, one of the rare profitable biotechnology companies,  reported good earnings for the year of $.24, versus $.11., and gained $.25 for  the week.  </P></p>

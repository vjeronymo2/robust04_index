			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / The poor make their presence felt: Damian Fraser examines the political and economic repercussions of Mexico's peasant uprising The seizure by peasant guerrillas of half a dozen Mexican towns in the southern state of Chiapas on New Year's day has shaken the government of President Carlos Salinas more than any other event in its five-year rule. Since January 1 President Salinas has had to reshuffle his cabinet, fire a state governor, bow to demands for potentially far-reaching political reforms, and shift the focus of economic policy from conquering inflation to boosting growth - all as a result of the revolt. The Institutional Revolutionary party's (PRI) 65-year grip on power looks less secure now than at any point since Mr Salinas took office in December 1988. Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate to succeed Mr Salinas, faces an opposition rejuvenated by the rebellion, and possible division in his own party. Elections are scheduled for August 21 and Mr Salinas cannot stand for a second term under Mexico's constitution. That a group of a few thousand poorly equipped guerrillas could wreak so much political damage is a testimony to previous discontent with government policy. The rebels, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army, have elicited widespread sympathy with their calls for democratic change, better treatment of the minority Indian population, and criticisms of pro-market economic reforms. 'The Zapatistas are only saying what many Mexicans want,' says Sergio Aguayo, a political science professor at the Colegio de Mexico, a leading research institute. 'That is why they have had such a strong impact.' According to a poll in the magazine Este Pais, 61 per cent of Mexicans sympathise with the Zapatistas. The army put down the Zapatista insurrection within a few days, but the government, pushed on the defensive, felt compelled to drop its military offensive and offer an amnesty and a ceasefire. Yesterday, the Zapatistas released Mr Absalon Castellanos, former governor of Chiapas, who had been held captive since the New Year. This clears the way for talks between the rebels and Mr Manuel Camacho, the government peace-broker in the region. A government official said talks were likely to start this week-end. The government is likely to offer the rebels land and more money for schools, roads and utilities, and to replace some local politicians with those acceptable to the Zapatistas. It is unclear whether such concessions will persuade the rebels, who are still armed, to rejoin civil society, but they may undercut their popular support. The government's conciliatory approach has helped restore the confidence of foreign and domestic investors in the economy, which had taken a knock after the optimism generated by approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement last November. The stock market has risen about 7 per cent this year, and short-term interest rates fell to a record low of 9.15 per cent yesterday. But even if a rapprochement is reached with the Zapatistas, the ramifications of rebellion are almost certain to remain the central issue of this year's presidential election. The uprising has shifted the political debate to the extreme poverty in which about a fifth of the country lives, and to the authoritarian rule of the PRI in many parts of the country. Such issues are the main campaign themes of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution. He has successfully distanced himself from the violent methods of the Zapatistas, but appears to be capitalising on the dissent highlighted by the rebels. Opinion polls indicate his approval rating has risen to about 20 per cent. Mr Cardenas's rise has put Mr Colosio, the hand-picked successor to Mr Salinas, on the defensive. Mr Colosio has the hard task of convincing Mexicans that the uprising does not discredit the policies his party has been following for the past decade, in particular tight government spending and the imposition of high real interest rates that have lowered inflation but squeezed growth. In an effort to boost Mr Colosio's campaign and appease public opinion, President Salinas decided last month that the government would accelerate planned spending this year, and shift budget priorities to anti-poverty programmes. Last week Mr Salinas announced a Dollars 107m subsidy to coffee producers who are angry at low international prices. If Mr Colosio succeeds Mr Salinas, as is still likely despite the appointment of his rival, Mr Camacho, as peacemaker in Chiapas, aides say he will concentrate on eradicating poverty and reducing differences in income within the country; devolve federal responsibilities to the states; and give more powers to the Congress and judiciary, thus reducing the president's influence. Mr Colosio was drawing up such a programme last year after he was nominated, but the prospect of a subtle change in policy with President Salinas has risen since the uprising. Mr Colosio has been influenced by the downturn. Government figures are expected to show that the economy grew by under 1 per cent last year, less than the increase in population. Unemployment has risen in cities, and rural areas such as Chiapas have seen a sharp drop in the prices of agricultural products. Low growth has meant that many Mexicans have yet to benefit significantly from economic initiatives that brought inflation down from 157 per cent annually in 1987 to an annual 8 per cent last year, and privatised hundreds of state-owned businesses. While average wages have risen modestly in the Salinas presidency, they are still lower in real terms than at the beginning of the 1980s. Over the past decade the large gap between the rich and poor has widened. The richest 20 per cent of the population received 54.2 per cent of national income in 1992, against 48.4 per cent in 1984. The income of the poorest 20 per cent fell from 5 per cent in 1984 to 4.3 per cent of national income in 1992. However, both the present government and aides to Mr Colosio insist that broad commitment to pro-market measures such as deregulation, privatisation and economic stability will continue. Mr Santiago Onate, an adviser to Mr Colosio, says: 'Mr Colosio believes in the continuity of what worked under President Salinas.' The government's freedom of economic manoeuvre is partly constrained by membership of Nafta, which Mexico joined on January 1. The accord removes tariff and non-tariff barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico over 15 years and thus puts pressure on the Mexican government to follow pro-business policies that encourage companies to compete. So while the government has little room to act in the economic arena, it has decided to react to public pressure for political change. There are widespread calls, encapsulated by the Zapatistas, for the overhaul of an electoral system that favours the PRI over the opposition. The PRI decides who will sit on the electoral tribunals which rule on the legitimacy of elections. It also outspends the opposition through its privileged access to state and private sector resources, and enjoys favourable coverage on the country's two private television networks. Backed by all the main opposition parties, the government plans to allow the opposition to veto members of the electoral tribunals, require the private television companies to give equal time to the opposition, and reduce statutory limits on campaign spending per party from Dollars 215m to Dollars 42m for the whole election, as well as to outlaw the use of state funds in campaigns. These changes followed the replacement of Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, the hardline interior minister, with Mr Jorge Carpizo, the respected former attorney-general in January. Mr Carpizo, who assumes overall responsibility for the management of the elections, said when appointed that he was not a member of the PRI, and staked his reputation on ensuring the political reform agreement holds firm. Mr Camacho says electoral reform is a prerequisite for solving the conflict in Chiapas, since it meets rebel demands for greater democracy. Still, the details have to be negotiated, and Mr Carpizo's commitment notwithstanding, talks between the political parties could yet break down. Mr Cardenas's party warns that, if political reforms are not undertaken and this August's election is not free, then much of the country may be convulsed by upheaval. 'If the government doesn't keep to the reforms, things will get much worse,' says Mr Ricardo Pascoe, a close aide to Mr Cardenas. 'We will go back on the warpath.'</p>

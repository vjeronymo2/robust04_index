			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The high cost of bouncing cheques THE number of bouncing cheques has risen sharply and high-fashion stores are particularly vulnerable, according to a company that guarantees cheques for about 37,000 retailers. The risk of default is nearly twice as high with business cheques as with personal cheques, Birmingham-based Transax says. Transax reported yesterday that for every 10,000 cheques covering sums above the normal bank card guarantee limit of Pounds 50 which passed through the retail and banking system last year, 67 personal cheques and 114 business cheques bounced. Compared with 1990, defaults last year rose 17 per cent for personal cheques and 9.5 per cent for business cheques. The disparity arises because business cheque defaults were much higher in 1990 than personal cheque defaults, so the risk in handling personal cheques rose more quickly last year than that for business cheques. Retailers using the Transax service telephone for authority to accept cheques covering amounts above the bank guarantee limit. Transax then checks the details against its own database - it has no access to bank files. Once it gives an authorisation, Transax is bound to see that the retailer is paid in full and it takes responsibility for recovering the sum written on a bounced cheque. The average value of its guarantee is Pounds 120 for personal cheques and Pounds 160 for business cheques. Of more than 5m cheques covered by a Transax guarantee last year, twice as many bouncing personal cheques were presented in menswear shops as in cycle shops. In the business sector, the number of bouncing cheques taken by the motor and building trades rose by 19 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. Bouncing cheques are more likely to come from those with personal accounts at building societies than at clearing banks, the analysis showed.</p>

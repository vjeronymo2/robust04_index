			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] In a bold move to break the stranglehold the  overburdened transport system has on the economy, China is  planning a radical shift in pricing policies designed to  encourage efficiency. Beijing hopes that, by selectively  lifting price controls in the transport sector, it will open the  way for more foreign investment in the cash-starved sector.    According to China analysts, the ministries of railways and  communications are pushing to have a market-based pricing system  for some types of transport. But when, and to what extent, the  changes will take place, depends on the state of the economy and  the level of inflation.    Enterprises operating general transport facilities such as  ports, airports and highways, would be given complete autonomy  to set prices on the basis of supply and demand. At present,  enterprises running ports, highways and airports enjoy a degree  of flexibility in setting prices, but railways do not.    But deregulation in areas run as monopolies, such as the  railways, would be partial and gradual. In these cases, the  state would continue to fix general price levels but enterprises  would be given some leeway to set fares. However, price  deregulation is inflationary and, at a time of double-digit  inflation, would tend to be politically unpalatable.    The proposed pricing shift is part of a package designed to  revitalise the ramshackle transport sector. The package also  would involve deeper reforms to improve management of transport,  establish an effective fund-raising and investment system, and a  clearer separation of roles between local and state governments  in transport projects.    A multi-pronged approach to improve management would  include:    -- Greater delegation of the control of ports and airports.    -- Strengthening the experiment to set up railway  conglomerates.    -- Singling out a few enterprises to try out the  shareholding  system.    -- Encouraging conglomerates to expand into other related  industries.    Hong Kong analysts applauded the measures, adding that the  rigid pricing policy dictated by the state had long discouraged  foreign investors. Vincent Chan, an economist with Peregrine  Investments Holdings, said: "The biggest problem facing China's  transport sector is the shortage of funds, and we're talking  about investments in the region of hundreds of millions of US  dollars.    "And, when the state controls the prices, it means that they  are set way below the cost of operation, which means it is  unattractive to any foreign investor." A Peregrine survey  released last week shows that China needs to invest as much as  US$111 billion in the transport sector to improve its railways,  highways, airports and ports.    One analyst said that under existing circumstances, the only  way to interest foreign investors would be to guarantee a rate  of return. "But even a guaranteed rate of return may not be  attractive enough. Look at the case of the power industry.  Although China guarantees a rate of return of about 15 per  cent, foreign investors feel the rate is not high enough to  compensate for the risk they are taking," he said.    Indeed, experience bears out the view that the tighter the  price controls, the smaller the size of foreign investment. In  railway construction, foreign capital accounts for only five per  cent or $2.3 billion of China's projected in vestment because of  the rigid pricing structure. "Under the current price  structure, foreign direct investment is limited, given the lack  of market forces to determine prices," says the Peregrine survey.    As a result, the major source of funding for railway  investment comes mainly from the Railway Construction Fund,  launched in 1991. "If they actually press ahead with price  reforms, I can see more foreign investors taking equity  participation in several major national projects," said Mr Chan.    Although domestic financing is still the key source of  funding for the construction of highways, foreign capital is  playing a larger role, because road tolls are not as tightly  controlled as railway fares and tolls vary from area to area.    Fund-raising for port development is easier than it is for  railways and highways, again because of the flexibility given to  enterprises to set charges. Several Hong Kong companies have  gone into port development in a big way. Hutchison Whampoa has  taken equity in ports in Shanghai, Yantian and Shanghai, Wharf  Holdings in Wuhan, Swire Pacific and Peninsula &amp; Oriental in  Shekou.</p>

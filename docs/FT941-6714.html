			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Korean mobile licence for Posco Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) yesterday was selected to lead a consortium to operate South Korea's second mobile telephone network. But the decision is unlikely to end the controversy marring the project since it was announced four years ago. Posco competed against Kolon, a textile group, for the lucrative licence, which was awarded by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the country's main business organisation, on behalf of the government. Posco's leadership of the consortium is likely to raise questions about the government's commitment to privatise the telecommunications industry since the steelmaker's largest shareholder is the state. The FKI explained that Posco had offered better technology and had stronger capital resources than Kolon. It is one of the world's most profitable steel companies. Posco will take a 15 per cent stake in the consortium, followed by Kolon with 14 per cent. Half of the consortium's shareholding will be distributed among hundreds of domestic companies. Mannesmann of Germany and Pactel of the US had backed Posco, while British Telecom and Nynex of the US had supported Kolon. Foreign companies have been promised a 20 per cent stake in the venture but they must submit new bids, with those willing to transfer the most advanced technology being favoured. Three or four foreign telecommunications operators are expected to be selected by the FKI after consultations with Posco. Other bidders may include Vodafone of the UK, Hutchison Telecom of Hong Kong, and GTE of the US. Foreign companies bidding for a share in the consortium have privately complained that the FKI selection has been governed by backroom dealing among the domestic participants. 'This could emerge as a major trade issue,' said one US official in Seoul.</p>

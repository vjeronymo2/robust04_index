			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BIOTECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> O.C. FIRMS CAN CUT COSTS OF PROVIDING MEDICAL INSURANCE  </P> <P> Some Orange County companies that have moved their manufacturing to the South  and Southeast in search of cheaper labor may be missing an opportunity to cut  their medical insurance costs as well, one local consultant says.  </P> <P> Rob Linn, an associate with William M. Mercer, a medical benefits consulting  company in Orange, said his firm found that a client, Calsonic International  Inc. in Irvine, was spending more than necessary to provide medical care for  employees at its Shelbyville, Tenn., manufacturing plant.  </P> <P> Linn said Mercer discovered that the 1,500 Calsonic employees who make air  conditioners for automobiles in that rural Tennessee community were spending  slightly more time in hospitals than their counterparts in Orange County.  </P> <P> A more startling discovery, he said, came from a study that showed that  Shelbyville residents use hospitals only half as often as Orange County  residents. The reason, Linn reasons, is that doctors in rural communities are  more judicious and cost-conscious than their urban counterparts.  </P> <P> Calsonic recently signed a contract with a Nashville firm, HealthChoice, which  in January will review the cost-effectiveness of the medical care provided to  Calsonic's Tennessee workers and their dependents.  </P> <P> By hiring an outside company familiar with local medical practices to monitor  health care costs, Linn estimates that Calsonic could save between $200,000 and  $300,000 a year.  </P></p>

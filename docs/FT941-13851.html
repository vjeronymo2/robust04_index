			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Yeltsin faces last-ditch plea on reform: Fyodorov resignation rejected as western aid is threatened Mr Boris Fyodorov, the outgoing Russian finance minister, is expected today to make a last-ditch plea to President Boris Yeltsin not to abandon the course of reform he launched two years ago. The meeting with the president was suggested by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, after he unexpectedly rejected Mr Fyodorov's resignation. Ahead of the talks, Mr Fyodorov had not, however, changed his intention to quit unless at least some of his conditions for staying were met. International alarm over the government's intention to use 'non-monetary methods' to fight inflation was confirmed at the weekend by the new government's first spending decisions. Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister for agriculture who is close to the pro-Communist Agrarian party, announced that the new cabinet planned to spend up to Rbs14 trillion on agricultural subsidies in 1994. 'This is fully within the scope of our state budget,' said Mr Zaveriukha, omitting to mention that Russia as yet does not have a budget for 1994. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, said the Rbs14 trillion, which compares with a Rbs15 trillion budget deficit for the whole of 1993, represented an increase from 7 per cent to 10 per cent in spending on agricultural subsidies. They have proved ineffective so far. Mr Alexashenko also disclosed in an interview that the government had decided on Saturday to double the amount of money it would ask the central bank to print in the first quarter of 1994. The government had initially arranged to ask for Rbs7 trillion, but on Saturday settled for Rbs15 trillion. Mr Alexashenko said increased reliance on such inflationary forms of financing would push inflation up to between 35 and 37 per cent a month in June-July from a present monthly level of about 20 per cent. A US Treasury official accompanying Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, on a visit to Japan was quoted as saying in Tokyo last night that the International Monetary Fund seemed unlikely to release a Dollars 1.5bn loan to Russia because the reforms 'have gone off track'. Mr Fyodorov announced he was quitting after Mr Chernomyrdin rejected his demands for the removal of both Mr Zaveriukha and of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, who believes that tough monetary and fiscal policy are not what Russia needs. Mr Chernomyrdin, angered by Mr Fyodorov's announcement of conditions under which he would stay in government, said only on Friday that his departure was 'not a tragedy'. But on Saturday, possibly surprised by the international outcry over Mr Fyodorov's departure, Mr Chernomyrdin told the finance minister he would not accept the resignation and could not understand why he wanted to leave. Mr Fyodorov is said to have replied he could not understand why Mr Zaveriukha had been appointed deputy prime minister and not he. In another sign that he underestimated Mr Fyodorov's importance to international confidence, Mr Chernomyrdin is said to have telephoned Russia's representative at the IMF about the postponement of its next mission to Moscow, which he had counted on to unblock a Dollars 1.5bn loan. Prof Yevgeny Yasin, a senior adviser to Mr Chernomyrdin, said he had told the prime minister that he needed 'Fyodorov much more than he needed Zaveriukha . . . only a tough man like Fyodorov can resist the wave of pressure for more spending'.

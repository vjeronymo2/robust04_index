			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] On 25 April, Mexican President Carlos Salinas  created the Coordinating Board for the Nation's Public Security  [Coordinacion de Seguridad Publica de la Nacion] to improve  efficiency in the operations of institutions involved in  national public security, to carry out preventive actions, and  to pursue crimes.    Its coordinator will be Arsenio Farell Cubillas, who until  today was the secretary of labor and social welfare. The  coordinating board will be under the Presidency of the republic.  The board will coordinate national public security matters  determined by the executive, and it will establish coordination  mechanisms with the Attorney General's Office of the republic  and the Attorney General's Office of the Federal District to  increase their efficiency.    This coordinating board will propose the establishment of  efficient and timely channels of communication among the  Secretariats of Government, National Defense, and the Navy, as  well as the Federal District Department to safeguard public  security. This board will propose and reach coordination  agreements with the states' attorney general's offices for the  same purpose.    This decision by the chief executive, which was revealed  hours ago, states that the situation facing Mexico underscores  the need to coordinate the actions of the national public  security corps and the need to improve their prevention and  pursuance of crimes. It adds that society in general demands  that the government redouble actions against impunity and the  violation of public order, while respecting human rights. This  board will start operating tomorrow.    The National Security Cabinet met at the Los Pinos  Presidential Residence. The meeting was attended by the  secretaries of government and national defense, chief of the  Federal District Department, the republic's attorney general,  the district's attorney general, director general of the Center  for National Research and Security, and the chief of the  presidential office.    This information is contained in a bulletin issued on the  evening of 25 April. We think it is evident that the work done  by existing institutions is insufficient in view of the  magnitude of the challenge posed by the criminals. The  institution that was born today is a sort of super-attorney  general's office with the size demanded by society as a result  of the growing problems posed by crime and violence.    President Salinas thus reacted to a public demand, a demand  from society to fight vigorously against impunity, organized  crime, and the proliferation of weapons because everyone bears  pistols here. The presence of Arsenio Farell as coordinator is a  guarantee. He was born in Mexico City in 1921. He earned a  Bachelor and Doctorates Degree at the National University's Law  School. He is a litigant lawyer, professor, public official,  and author. Farell is qualified for this new post. He has what  one expects of a coordinator: firmness and vigor, respect for  the law, and respect for its enforcement. We expect him to  comply with and to ensure compliance with the law.</p>

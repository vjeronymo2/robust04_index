			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. An annual charge of 0.10% will be assessed against the assets of each Separate Account to reimburse MassMutual and MML Bay State for bearing the risks associated with providing certain enhanced death benefits under the Contracts. A death benefit is paid upon the death of either the Contract owner or the annuitant. If an owner and annuitant are the same, the death benefit paid will be the annuitant death benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Contract owner dies before the maturity date of the Contract, the beneficiary named in the Contract will receive the cash redemption value of the Contract. If the annuitant dies before the maturity date of the Contract, the beneficiary named in the Contract will receive the greater of two enhanced death benefits, depending on the Contract owner's state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the first alternative, if the annuitant dies before the maturity date, the beneficiary named in the Contract will receive the greater of: (a) The total of all purchase payments made to the Contract, less all partial redemptions, accumulated at 5% to the annuitant's 75th birthday and 0% thereafter, but not more than two time purchase payments less redemptions; or (b) the accumulated value of the Contract less any applicable administrative charge (and any sales charge, if the annuitant's age on the Contract date exceeds 75).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The death benefit described above may not be available in certain states for annuitants whose issue age is less than 76. In those instances, the death benefit during the first three years will be equal to the greater of: (a) The total of all purchase payments made to the Contract less all partial redemptions; or (b) the accumulated value of the Contract less any applicable administrative charge. During any subsequent three Contract year period, the death benefit will be the greater of: (a) The death benefit on the last day of the previous three Contract year period plus any purchase payments made less all partial redemptions since then; or (b) the accumulated value of the Contract less any applicable administrative charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. MassMutual and MML Bay State currently will permit a Contract owner to make up to 14 transfers among the divisions of the Separate Accounts (and the Fixed Account if available) each Contract year without charge during the accumulation period of the Contracts. Transfers in excess of 14 will result in the imposition of a $20 fee. MassMutual and MML Bay State reserve the right to change the number of transfers that may be made without charge. The Contracts provide, however, that the number of transfers that may be made without incurring a charge will be at least four per Contract year during the accumulation period. Amounts applied under a variable payment option during the payout period may be transferred once every 90 days. MassMutual and MML Bay State reserve the right to change transfer limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Premium taxes ranging up to 3.5% of purchase payments are imposed by certain municipalities and states. Under current practice, MassMutual and MML Bay State will deduct amounts owned for premium taxes from a Contract's accumulated value at annuitization, maturity, or full surrender. Both MassMutual and MML Bay State have reserved the right to deduct amounts owned for premium taxes from premium payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) taken together are intended to provide for the protection of the assets of investment companies that issue periodic payment plan certificates. Section 27(c)(2) of the Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate and any depositor or underwriter for such periodic payment plan certificate from selling such certificates unless all proceeds of payments on such certificates (other than any sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank acting as trustee or custodian, and held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions. Section 26(a) of the Act requires that such indenture or custodian agreement must provide, among other things that such bank shall not allow as an expense any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge and the enhanced death benefit charge from the assets of the Separate Accounts in connection with the issuance by MassMutual and MML Bay State of the Contracts to the funded by the Separate Accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the guaranteed mortality and expense risk charges of 1.25% are reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by MassMutual and MML Bay State under the Contract and are reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts issued by other insurance companies. This representation is based on MassMutal's and MML Bay State's analysis of publicly available information about such other contracts, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the manner in which charges are imposed, guarantees of charge levels or annuity rates, and the markets in which the Contracts will be offered. Applicants undertake to maintain at MassMutual's home office and MML Bay State's principal office and to make available to the Commission (or its staff) upon request, memoranda setting forth in detail the products analyzed, the methodology used, and the results of their respective comparative reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants acknowledge that the withdrawal charges under the Contracts may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. In such circumstances, the charges for mortality and expense risk may be a source of the profit that would be available to pay MassMutual's and/or MML Bay State's distribution expenses not reimbursed by applicable sales charges. MassMutual and MML Bay State have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing agreements benefit both the Separate Accounts and the Contract owners. The basis for this conclusion is set forth in memoranda that will be maintained by MassMutal and MML Bay State at their home office and principal office, respectively. These memoranda will be available to the Commission (or its staff) upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants represent that the Separate Accounts will invest only in management investment companies that undertake, in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants assert that the mortality risk charge of 0.10% for the enhanced death benefits offered is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by MassMutual and MML Bay State under the Contracts. In arriving at this determination, MassMutual and MML Bay State conducted a large number of trials at various issue ages to determine the expected cost of the enhanced death benefit. First, hypothetical asset returns were projected using generally accepted actuarial simulation methods. For each asset return pattern thus generated, hypothetical accumulated values were calculated by applying the projected asset returns to the initial value in a hypothetical account. Each accumulated value so calculated was then compared to the amount of the enhanced death benefit payable in the event of the hypothetical Contract owner's death during the year in question. By analyzing the results of several thousand such simulations, MassMutual and MML Bay State were able to determine actuarily the level cost of providing the enhanced death benefit. Based on this analysis, MassMutual and MML Bay State determined that a mortality risk charge of 0.10% was a reasonable charge for providing the enhanced death benefit. Memoranda is available to the Commission (or its staff) upon request setting forth in detail the methodology used in determining that the risk charge of 0.10% for the enhanced death benefit is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by MassMutual and MML Bay State under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit, for all of the reasons stated in the application, that their exemptive requests meet the standards set out in Section 6(c), are well precedented, and that an Order should, therefore, be granted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

This ought to make it clear there was no divisions in the  party which swept to victory in the 1989 election and took power  at independence the next year, SWAPO Secretary General Moses  Garoeb said.    He said SWAPO was confident of winning at least a two-thirds  majority in the 1995 elections, conceding that this was not good  for democracy. "Perhaps we will have to create our own  opposition."    The Namibian political opposition was weak, he said, but  this  was their own fault for "being puppets and traitors during the  liberation struggle".    SWAPO's Central Committee is to discuss its election  strategy  and the financial and political state of the party at its  congress on Saturday.</p>

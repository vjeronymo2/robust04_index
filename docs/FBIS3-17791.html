			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Soviet session is currently being held  behind closed doors. As our correspondent has learned, deputies  have focused their attention on the monetary-credit policy.  Probably, we will be able to tell you about the adopted  decisions, however, only approximately, because this issue,  according to the parliament speaker, is secret.    This day can be considered, to certain degree, momentous in  the work of the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet. Deputies  have finally scheduled the presidential elections -- this event  has been scheduled for 23 June 1994, for a regular working  weekday. However, it used to be a regular working day -- it  will be proclaimed a holiday, and we will have to make our  choice.    At today's session, deputies also discussed legislation on  the Belarusian Constitutional Court and adopted a resolution on  implementing it.</p>

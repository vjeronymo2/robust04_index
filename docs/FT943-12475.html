			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / US to take action on stock options US companies are almost certain to be forced to take the costs of stock options as a charge against profits within the next three years, under proposals being considered by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board. Companies will also be required by the end of this year to provide substantial additional details on their use of financial derivatives such as swaps and currency hedging instruments, under a separate accounting standard due out in October. The standard will require companies to disclose their accounting policies on derivatives, the quantitative effects of these instruments and what they hope to achieve by their use. Mr Dennis Beresford, chairman of the board, was confident a solution could be found to concerns about how to measure reliably the cost of options, the shares awarded to compensate senior executives. Options are widely seen as a form of remuneration which have a cost to shareholders. Mr Beresford's determination comes in spite of protest from companies, Congress and accountancy firms that the proposals will impair financial performance. Members of FASB are considering about 10 approaches to valuing options after their previous approach was attacked for allocating them too high a cost. However, Mr Beresford said the techniques developed were no less accurate than those used for other uncertain areas in accounting which are already charged as costs, such as provisions for bad debts or valuation of obsolescent stock. The revised FASB stock option proposals are unlikely to be circulated until the first quarter of next year and may still be delayed for further consultation. The original proposals allowed three years for additional disclosure before forcing companies to take the costs of the options as a charge. Mr Beresford said the revised plans might compress this intermediate period into two years, so that companies would still be required to show the cost of options in their profit and loss accounts for fiscal year-ends from 1997. Derivatives have come under increasing scrutiny over the past few months following a series of occasions involving their mismanagement. Bankers Trust, Page 19</p>

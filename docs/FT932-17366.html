			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / People: Smith leaves M&amp;S for Kingfisher Kingfisher, the UK retailing group, yesterday became the latest company to split the roles of chairman and chief executive, bringing in Alan Smith, head of store operations at Marks and Spencer, as right-hand man to Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy. The company says the rapid growth of its businesses - including its recent Pounds 1bn acquisition of Darty, France's leading electrical retailer - and the large volume of new project work that involved, meant that chairman and chief executive Sir Geoff was 'stretched on too many fronts'. Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director, says: 'I can't think of any other company with a Pounds 4bn turnover where the responsibilities are split between only three executive directors.' Smith - who, according to Whittaker, 'has the right personality for Kingfisher and a good strategic brain' - will run Kingfisher's day-to-day retail operations, while Sir Geoff will oversee strategy, the relationship with Darty, and the development of other international relationships. Smith, 52, joined Marks and Spencer in 1964, and moved to head office in 1966 where he held executive and board appointments in the food and textile divisions, and European operations. He became an M and S director in 1978. He was responsible for the Business Development Group set up in January 1987, which led to the purchase of Brooks Brothers and Kings Supermarkets in the US in 1988. He was responsible for North America and Far East operations from 1988 to 1990, and then for the food division until 1992. Whittaker refused to comment on rumours circulating yesterday that Smith's salary package would be more than Pounds 1m, saying only that he would receive 'a sensible salary reflecting market rates, together with an incentive bonus'.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Oilseed rape TODAY'S MEETING in Geneva of the governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could be a day of reckoning in the US's six-year dispute with the EC over the latter's restrictions on oilseed imports. Without a last-minute outbreak of common sense, the two sides seem poised for a tit-for-tat trade war. The sequence is expected to be simple: the US will demand that the EC accepts binding independent arbitration to settle the dispute. The EC will refuse, instead recommending further negotiation. The US will then unleash a threatened Dollars 1bn of sanctions against EC farm exports, prompting the EC to hit back. Negotiators must realise that this way madness lies. The dispute could disrupt a swathe of US-European trade in products ranging from aircraft to whisky, and hurt many other exporting nations. EC officials say the only move that can break this vicious circle is a settlement of the Uruguay round of world trade talks. This would be highly desirable. The solution lies largely with the US and EC: the mainly agricultural issues separating them are trivial compared with the potential gains for all from a settlement. On the other hand, success is far from assured. EC member states may be even less willing to push for a settlement than before the French referendum on Maastricht. And with President Bush trailing in the polls, he may be in no position to compromise further for an agreement that might not yield enough votes to make a difference. It would be reckless to rely on the Uruguay round to avert a trade war. More likely, an escalation of the oilseeds dispute will disrupt efforts to conclude the round. The immediate priority must be to prevent the issue from blowing up today. To this end, the EC needs to review its position. The Gatt has twice ruled that US complaints against the EC oilseed regime are justified. Bilateral negotiations aimed at setting EC compensation are deadlocked. The time has come for the Community to accept that independent binding arbitration is the only fair route to a settlement.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Holmes shares fall as sale collapses Holmes Protection, the financ-ially stretched New York security and alarm company quoted in London, has failed to secure the sale of its New Jersey businesses. The shares fell 1p to 1 1/2 p. Alert, the buyer, told Holmes it could not proceed with the purchase as it had not been able to secure the necessary financing. Holmes, which had extended the closing date for the deal by 90 days for Alert to find financing, hoped to realise Dollars 17.5m-Dollars 18.5m from the sale. The group had planned to use the proceeds to repay part of its Dollars 61m of debt, of which Dollars 24.6m was due in January and March. Last month the group's accounts were qualified by its auditors subject to the company's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>

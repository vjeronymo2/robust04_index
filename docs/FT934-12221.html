			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (7): A watershed for finance - Privatisation will bring with it big changes for banks and insurers WHEN Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, this summer announced the names of the 21 companies scheduled for privatisation by his government, some of France's most powerful financial groups appeared high on his list. The Balladur privatisation drive has important implications for the French financial sector. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the first of the government's share sales, has already been sold as eventually will Credit Lyonnais. The sales of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the powerful insurers, are expected next year followed by the GAN Group. These share sales will mark a watershed in the development of the French financial system by heralding significant changes in its traditionally close relationship with the state and by forcing the old state-controlled banks and insurers to carve out new roles as private sector companies. The precise nature of the state's relationship with these groups is shrouded in secrecy. In theory the government has no direct influence over the public sector banks and insurers in terms of their day-to-day management and strategy. But in practice it has exerted significant influence over both areas - directly and indirectly. The source of the government's direct influence is its power to hire and fire the chairmen of the companies it controls. A change of government usually triggers an elaborate game of musical chairs as the new administration replaces the old appointees with its own candidates. It is scarcely a coincidence that the chairman of almost all France's big banks and insurers started their careers as political advisers to prominent politicians or as civil servants in important ministries. Once in their new posts they can reshuffle the senior management of their companies, often by bringing in people from their old ministries. Some observers suspect that the presence of so many fonctionnaires, or civil servants, has instilled a bureaucratic culture in France's large financial groups. They claim banks and insurers have been left with top-heavy management structures, a reluctance to shed staff and a cautious approach to international expansion. Privatisation should bring the fonctionnaire era to an end. The chairmen will then be appointed, as with any other private sector company, by the shareholders, making future appointees more likely to be professional financiers than well-connected bureaucrats. Similarly privatisation should make the banks and insurers less vulnerable to indirect pressure from the state in areas such as interest rate policy and investment strategy. Anglo-Saxon sceptics tend to assume that the French government simply dictates interest rate policy to the state banks, BNP and Credit Lyonnais, by telling them whether and when they can change base rates. In practice the system is more subtle in that the political appointees at the top of the big banks are not only virtually guaranteed to be sympathetic to the government's aims, but know instinctively what it expects them to do. Conspiracy theorists cite as evidence of the state's influence events of earlier this year when the French banks incurred heavy losses by holding base rates at a time when the Bank of France raised its short term lending rates as part of the government's battle to defend the franc. They also claim it is instructive that BNP and Credit Lyonnais are usually the first to cut base rates, while any increases tend to be led by the privatised banks, Societe Generale or Credit du Nord (part of Paribas). The banks claim publicly that the government has no control, either direct or indirect, over base rates. Privately they admit that, since the privatisation of Societe Generale in the late 1980s, the system has been more flexible in that at least one of the Big Three retail banks is genuinely independent of the state. The sale of BNP and Credit Lyonnais, should erode the government's influence even further. Similarly the government should find it much more difficult to use the state banks and insurers as tools in its industrial policy by 'suggesting' that they take strategic stakes in other public sector companies. The government claims that such investment decisions are taken voluntarily. But the row a few years ago when BNP tried to avoid taking a stake in Air France suggests otherwise. However this ritual may well survive privatisation. The entire French corporate sector is riddled with cross-shareholdings and 'sweetheart' deals. Moreover the government has been at pains to ensure that it has some residual influence over the privatisation candidates by appointing its own candidates to lead them into the private sector. Rene Thomas, veteran chairman of BNP, has already been replaced by Michel Pebereau, who was involved with the privatisation of Credit Commercial de France (CCF). Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, is mooted as the next target. He is expected to move to the chairman's seat at Credit Nationale, paving the way for Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, to take over at Credit Lyonnais. But old habits die hard. A few years ago Marc Vienot, chairman of the thoroughly privatised Societe Generale, was searching for an heir apparent. His choice was not, as one might expect, an experienced banker from Societe Generale itself or one of its competitors, but Daniel Bouton, a career civil servant.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: GPA deal creates new source of funding THE first securitisation of aircraft leases by GPA, the Irish leasing company, yesterday has created a new source of funding for the ailing airline industry. The Dollars 521m issue, arranged by Citibank, is backed by 14 aircraft purchased by GPA and leased to airlines including British Midland Airways, Philippine Airlines and Spanair. 'It opens up a new investor base for the financing of aircraft in the 1990s, in an industry which is projecting significant financing needs', said Mr Andrew Pisker, a managing director of Lehman Brothers, joint lead manager of the transaction. According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, the funding costs of new aircraft over the next 20 years will amount to around Dollars 850bn. The airline industry has been particularly hard hit by economic recession. Many have been unprofitable and have seen their credit ratings dip dramatically. Banks have also been tightening their belts so their traditional source of financing through bank loans has dried up. Japanese investment in aircraft leases, fuelled by tax benefits, has also tailed off as tax advantages have disappeared. The GPA deal is made up of five tranches: two public offerings consisting of Dollars 208.4m fixed-rate bonds and Dollars 104.2m floating-rate notes; a Dollars 70.4m private placement; and two tranches of subordinated debt. The bonds have been rated AA by S&amp;P. The rating is based on the rental flow from the carriers, over Dollars 8m in security deposits, the security of the aircraft and an additional Dollars 78m loan from Citibank and Credit Lyonnais. The deal is expected to be imitated by airline companies, although the diversification of aircraft achieved in the GPA pool will be difficult for some to achieve. GPA, whose public offer of 85m shares closes on June 16, is expected to develop a programme for the securitisation of lease pools.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Lombana, president of the National </F> Vote-Counting Board, by Octavio Cogley at the ATLAPA Convention  Center Election Media Center in Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Cogley] In a few minutes, the National  Vote-Counting Board will be installed right here in La Huaca  Hall of the ATLAPA Convention Center. We are here with Mr.  Roberto Alfredo Lombana, with whom we will be speaking about  what is going to take place with the National Vote-Counting  Board. Mr. Roberto Alfredo Lombana, this afternoon, in just a  few minutes, the National Vote-Counting Board will be installed.  The representatives of each of the political parties are  already beginning to arrive. What will the board's main duty  be? Basically, what is the National Vote-Counting Board  responsible for?    [Lombana] Of course. The National Vote-Counting Board is an  autonomous body appointed by the Electoral Tribunal [TE] and  made up of representatives of the 15 political parties  participating in the election process. Our responsibility lies  in counting the 40 electoral districts covering the total number  of votes of the 5,310 voting tables located throughout the  country and to proclaim the president of the Republic.    [Cogley] With respect to the vote count, when precisely will  the process begin?    [Lombana] If the TE continues on schedule as it has been  operating thus far, we will be receiving the first circuit vote  tally sheets at 2300 [0400 GMT on 9 May]. At that time we will  also start receiving the other vote tally sheets. We expect  that in four or five days we will proclaim the election winner.    [Cogley] How does the National Vote-Counting Board assess  the  work done by the TE?    [Lombana] It has been quite positive. We have received  excellent support from the TE and they have helped us to  organize this event to such an extent that today, at 1400 this  afternoon, we will begin operations.    [Cogley] What can you say about the populations'  participation?    [Lombana] I believe that we are not only witnessing  admirable  participation by the presidential candidates, but also from the  population in general. The mood has been quite festive.    [Cogley] Thank you very much Mr. Roberto Lombana for your  statements to Telemetro Panama.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This dispute resolution system does not introduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional requirements into the survey process; rather, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reinforces instructions that already exist but which have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been applied inconsistently up to this point. Because we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are formalizing this element of the appeals process, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amending the appeals procedures at 42 CFR parts 431 and 498  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to eliminate the reconsideration process for SNFs and NFs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. Informal dispute resolution will duplicate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in every pertinent way, this element of the process since it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will provide the opportunity for providers to contest survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> findings informally just as reconsiderations currently are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to do. Accordingly, we have concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retaining the reconsideration process for SNFs and NFs would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create redundant procedures and are amending it so that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies only to other provider and supplier types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the comment to use dispute resolution as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means to measure surveyor consistency, accuracy, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision-making, section 1819(g)(2)(D) of the Act requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary and the States, and section 1919(g)(2)(D) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act requires that States, implement programs to measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results among surveyors. HCFA and the States will develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own mechanisms to satisfy this requirement and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to use the dispute resolution process as a means to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate surveyor performance in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not agree with some commenters' characterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dispute resolution as negotiation between providers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey agency, nor do we agree that a process should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established to notify residents and their families when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors require additional information in identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies. First, dispute resolution as required in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule does not contemplate bargaining between providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the survey agency; rather, it is a preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for providers to refute survey findings that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they believe are inaccurate and to present evidence to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support their belief. The purpose of this informal process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to clarify, if not eliminate, the issues that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise lead to needless litigation and to sharpen the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues for an administrative law judge or State hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official so that litigation, should it occur, may be less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome and costly. This may work in two ways. It may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convince the State or HCFA officials that erroneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies have been cited, or it may convince providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, because the State and HCFA have ample support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their conclusions, it would be unwise for providers to pursue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, States enter into an agreement with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary (HCFA), in accordance with section 1864 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, to act as HCFA's agent for the purpose, (among others),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of determining if a facility meets participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. After following the survey protocol, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes interviews with residents, and family members or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal representatives, surveyors may find that they do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have sufficient information to cite a deficiency. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we note that whenever nursing home residents or their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families believe that a deficient or otherwise inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice exists in the facility, regardless of whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey is in process, they should contact the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ombudsman, request a complaint investigation, or both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters believe that a dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism may impact on how surveyors recognize deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as how they assign scope and severity scale levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cited deficiencies. First, it is important that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters be absolutely clear that neither the enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheme presented in the proposed rule nor the modified model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this final rule was developed for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying deficiencies. Rather, the assessment factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed under ``Factors to be Considered in Selecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remedies'' of this preamble and codified at &sect;488.404 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule will be used (as the former scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale was to be used) to evaluate the seriousness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies already identified in order to determine what,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if any, enforcement action is appropriate. Second, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to public comment, this final rule has incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concept of substantial compliance. This concept, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is discussed in detail under ``Certification of Compliance''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this preamble, provides that not all deficiencies will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in enforcement action and should, therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate resistance or hesitation of surveyors to cite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies that they have identified for fear of provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disputes of lower-level assessment determinations. As we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have stated elsewhere in this preamble, the survey process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides several opportunities for deficient practices or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise inadequate performance on the part of the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be identified and sanctioned. Therefore, if the situation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described by the commenters should occur, there are adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory and regulatory mechanisms to respond to it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

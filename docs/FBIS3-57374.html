			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean </F> Supreme Council and Crimean presidential candidate, by  unidentified DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA correspondent by telephone  from the Crimea; date not given: "We Will Struggle...."    [Text]The Central Electoral Committee appointed the  second round of Crimean presidential elections for 30 January.  The leader of the Crimean Republican Party, Yuriy Meshkov, and  the chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council, Nikolay Bagrov,  will compete for the post. The difference in the number of  votes they received in the first round of elections was quite  significant. That is why the present speaker's chances of  victory are assessed as illusory. Besides, those candidates who  had quit the struggle called upon the voters to cast their votes  for separatist Meshkov. How does Nikolay Bagrov himself see the  situation? Our correspondent phoned him and asked him to answer  a few questions.    [Bagrov] I will take part in the second round -- this is not  so little. All of my opponents campaigned against Bagrov and  accused me of all the shortcomings of Ukraine's economic policy  and of all the difficulties. Of course, it is a serious  struggle. However, I am an optimist, and I think that I have a  real chance of winning. For this, it is necessary to struggle.  People have already started thinking....    [DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA] Yet, Nikolay Vasilyevich, you  probably counted upon greater support in the first round.    [Bagrov] I was honest with the people. Meshkov promised  them that Russia would take them into her open arms. He said  everywhere that once people vote for him, they will receive  prosperity and peace. The Crimea will become Russian. I am not  promising people a rose garden, because one will have to meet  the bills after the elections. I am openly saying at all  meetings that the secession of the Crimea from Ukraine is out of  the question. Meshkov's policy leads to an impasse.    Let us look at things realistically. There exist the  Helsinki Agreements on the inviolability of borders that emerged  after World War II. There exists an agreement between Ukraine  and Russia where the inviolability of the borders of the two  countries is recognized. Finally, a tripartite agreement was  signed in Moscow between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia  on the elimination of nuclear weapons; these aspects are also  reflected there. Ukraine received guarantees of European  countries in addition to those of the United States. It is  naive to assume that Russia will want to violate these  agreements.    I believe that we have not yet fully implemented, in the  interests of the Crimean people, the possibilities of the  autonomy offered to us by Ukraine's legislation in both economic  and political spheres.    [DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA] The election campaign in the Crimea  has been accompanied by a series of murders. The assassination  of your adviser Iskander Mamedov near his family's house is  simply appalling. What can you say about this?    [Bagrov] Iskander organized my election campaign. He was a  very good and decent person. I deeply mourn his death and  sympathize with his relatives and friends. A criminal case has  been initiated, and competent organs must answer who needed this.    I will say one thing: I want to live in the Crimea and do  everything in order that harmony and peace prevail on the  peninsula and that it becomes a bridge connecting Ukraine and  Russia, and not a new Karabakh.</p>

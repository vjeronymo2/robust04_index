			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Garagiola Returns: After five weeks off for elective surgery and recuperation,  Joe Garagiola is scheduled to return this morning to NBC's "Today" show and on  Tuesday report on the baseball playoffs.  </P> <P> Garagiola, 64, has declined to say what kind of surgery was performed. A former  "Today" co-anchor, he returned to the show last June on a three-day-a-week  basis as part of NBC's effort to revive the show's ratings. The once-dominant  program suffered a ratings slump after the replacement in January of Jane  Pauley by Deborah Norville. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

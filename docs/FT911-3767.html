			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Soviet Union collapse not in west's interest, warns Hurd THE DISINTEGRATION of the Soviet Union into separate states was contrary to the interests of the rest of Europe and the west as a whole, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said in London yesterday. Mr Hurd, who was addressing the British Atlantic Group of Young Politicians, conceded that the western European states could not have much influence on developments inside the Soviet Union. That was a matter for the Soviet people themselves. 'But what we can say is that it is not in the interests of Europe as a whole, or of the west, to see the Soviet Union disintegrate into a kaleidoscope of republics, some quite weak, some divided within their own boundaries, and leaving a possibility of continuing disorder and weakness . . .' What the west wanted to see was a Soviet Union which was dedicated to reform, and in which the links between the various republics were based on consent rather than on command and force. It wanted to help the Soviet Union to reform itself. Turning to the lessons that Europe should draw from the events of the past year and the Gulf war, in particular, Mr Hurd expressed strong support for greater foreign policy co-ordination within the EC. 'I can see in our dealings with the Soviet Union . . . over events in the Baltic states, that it really would be crazy if there were separate and contrasted British, French, German, Italian policies towards what is happening in the Soviet Union,' Mr Hurd said. However, he reiterated Britain's opposition to majority voting on foreign and security policy issues, which, Mr Hurd claimed, would have led to a less effective European reaction in the Gulf crisis. In the aftermath of the Gulf conflict, one particular problem which the Twelve should now be considering, in co-operation with the US, the Soviet Union and China, was the problem of arms exports and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In spite of calling for greater intra-European co-operation on security and defence policies, Mr Hurd stressed that Nato remained 'the main defence institution of western Europe and the Atlantic'. While Nato had to be reformed if it were to survive and remain relevant, to allow it to disappear would be 'to spit in the face of the lessons of history. It would be a great foolishness, the kind of foolishness we committed in the past and regretted.'</p>

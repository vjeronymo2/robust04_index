			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Under the Retirement  Insurance Law issued in April, Shanghai's 4.01 million workers  will enjoy an old-age pension as long as they have paid a  premium for a long enough period.    Each of them has a fixed account recording how much premium  he or she hands in, and each will keep the account for good, no  matter whether he or she switches jobs, loses a job or moves to  another locality.    The new system covers all staff in the city's  administrations  and enterprises, excluding foreign personnel in overseas-funded  companies and some workers whose pensions are specially arranged  by the government.    Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis with a population of 13  million, has over two million people above the age of 60.    Mayor Huang Ju said that Shanghai aims to set up a  scientific  and socialized retirement insurance system.    In accordance with the new regulations, individuals should  pay three per cent of their monthly salary as premium. The  proportion will increase with the pace of growing incomes.    And the amount of old-age pension will depend on the sum of  premiums paid by individuals and will be adjusted in line with  the cost of living index.    People who work for private businesses can also benefit from  the system.</p>

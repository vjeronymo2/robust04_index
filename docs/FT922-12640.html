			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: KKR and First Interstate in talks FIRST Interstate Bancorp, one of the largest banks on the west coast of the US, said it had talked recently to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), the leveraged buy-out specialists, about the possibility of discussions about co-operative transactions. Such transactions might involve First Interstate in acquiring thrifts or banking operations in its existing geographic territory, the statement said, and could lead to KKR making an additional investment in First Interstate's shares or other securities. The west coast bank stressed no deal was on the table. However, KKR holds a 9.69 per cent stake in First Interstate and the 'talks about talks' caused the New York-based firm, best known for its Dollars 25bn bid for RJR Nabisco, to make a new filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. KKR said that if talks started it might be unable to avail itself of the 'solely for the purpose of investment' exception to the anti-trust filing requirements. The firm added that it did not intend taking its voting stake in First Interstate beyond 10 per cent. The Los Angeles-based bank tumbled into the red last year, hit by the deterioration in the Californian economy and property market. The bank's statement comes only days after it was disclosed that Aetna, the large US insurer, has been talking to KKR about a possible buy-out of its reinsurance subsidiary, American Re. This underlined KKR's interest in the financial services sector, where - in conjunction with Fleet/Nordstar - it recently acquired the failed Bank of New England.</p>

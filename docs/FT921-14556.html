			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Hopes for housing rescue rent asunder: Why the government emergency plan has made little progress MANY homeowners with mortgage arrears saw the government's mortgage-rescue scheme as a welcome Christmas present. Yet, almost a month after the scheme was announced, there has been little progress in implementing it. Most lenders seem to have done little to ease up on repossessions. Lenders and housing associations have yet to agree terms for the mortgage-to-rent schemes at the centre of the plan. High-level negotiations on how to structure mortgage-to-rent schemes are under way between the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), the National Federation of Housing Associations (NFHA) and the Housing Corporation, which regulates associations receiving public money. But Mr Stuart Bernau, general manager at Nationwide Building Society, told a meeting of housing association executives on Monday that the number of detailed negotiations between individual lenders and associations was 'very small indeed'. Mr Stephen Duckworth, head of housing finance at the NFHA, told the meeting that there were many difficulties to be resolved if mortgage-to-rent schemes were to be agreed. They include: The interest rates that lenders will charge associations on loans to buy repossessed homes. The basis of valuations of such homes. Mortgage arrears. The associations want lenders to write off some or all of existing arrears to make it easier for their new tenants to meet rental payments. Costs incurred on legal advice, surveys and valuations, administration and chasing bad debts should be paid by lenders, the associations say. The lenders see associations piling up demands that are tantamount to a 'scroungers' charter'. Mr Bernau told Monday's meeting there would be no incentive for owners to keep up mortgage payments if default meant lower monthly outgoings in rent, their debts written off and their property upgraded. The associations' demands are opening bids in negotiations that have much further to go before what one executive described as a 'chasm' between the two sides is bridged. Some of the larger building societies, such as Nationwide and Woolwich, say that negotiations over terms are well advanced with individual associations. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, hopes to reach agreement on a mortgage-to-rent scheme by the end of the month. 'It is important to get a pilot scheme going to avoid a massive loss of credibility for the whole exercise.' Until workable mortgage-to-rent schemes are agreed, lenders will be unwilling to change their repossession policies. As a result, help for homeowners in arrears may be some time in coming.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Savile Row broadens horizons GENTLEMEN need no longer go to London's Savile Row to buy a Pounds 2,000 suit. Savile Row will go to them. Britain's top gentlemen's outfitters are travelling the world to find customers. Sales by Savile Row tailors on trips overseas account for about 70 per cent of turnover - two years ago they were less than half, according to the Federation of Merchant Tailors. The itinerants have been trying to shake off the fall in the number of international aircraft passengers after the Gulf war and the recession. 'I used to spend six weeks a year overseas.

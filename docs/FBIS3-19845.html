			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Dublin] </F>   [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds insisted today  that there was no switch in his government's policy of refusing  talks with the IRA until it ends its terror campaign.    Commenting for the first time on a row over the timetable  for  any negotations, generated by a magazine interview with his  deputy Dick Spring, Mr Reynolds declared: "The position has not  changed. We want a permanent cessation of violence before the  IRA or Sinn Fein can start talks as a forerunner to joining  round-the-table peace negotations."    Mr Spring, who is also the republic's foreign minister,  referred in his weekend interview to the likely response from  Dublin to a temporary IRA ceasefire.    Afterwards, he said such a move could be built upon to  encourage a permanent end to the violence but his initial  remarks prompted bitter criticism from Ulster Unionists.    In the Dail, the Dublin parliament, today, Mary Harney  leader  of the Progressive Democrat opposition party, asked Mr Reynolds  if he was aware of intelligence reports that IRA recruitment had  trebled recently.    Speaking only hours after his return from official visits to  the United States and the Bahamas, Mr Reynolds said he knew of  nothing to indicate that IRA recruitment was rising.    Mr Reynolds repeated his view that Gerry Adams, the  president  of Sinn Fein, was in favour of peace. "All the evidence and  information available to me suggests very clearly that Mr Adams  was preaching peace," he said, referring to Mr Adams' own recent  visit to New York.    But Mr Reynolds also said that the question of Mr Adams  getting a further U.S. entry visa was a ultimately a decision  for President Bill Clinton.    He said his own trip to the US, for a series of meetings  about the Downing Street Declaration with Mr Clinton and other  political leaders, had been "extremely successful."</p>

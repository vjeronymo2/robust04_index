			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Honda lifts stake in Indian moped maker HONDA Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, is raising its stake in Kinetic Honda Motor, its Indian moped joint venture, from 28.56 per cent to 50.92 per cent, to broaden its base there and enter neighbouring export markets. Other foreign companies which are increasing stakes in their Indian joint ventures following the government's recent economic liberalisation programme are: Gillette, the US shaving products company; Pepsi, the snack-food and soft-drink maker; Cadbury's, the UK confectioner; and Motorola, the US micro-chip company. All are raising their stakes to the newly-permitted maximum of 51 per cent to increase managerial control. The Indian government hopes this could lead to big increases in investment and the transfer of technology. Mr Arun Firodia, Kinetic Honda's managing director, said the venture would issue 4.5m shares at Rs10 each at a premium of Rs20, to facilitate the Japanese company's move. Honda's decision to increase its stake boosted Kinetic's flagging share price to Rs115 from Rs85 in the last week. Kinetic Honda, with sales rising 14 per cent to Rs2.76bn in its latest financial year, has weathered the worst recession to hit India's Rs20bn motorcycle and scooter industry.</p>

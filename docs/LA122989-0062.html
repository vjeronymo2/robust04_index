			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER SOUGHT IN $247,500 LOSS NABBED BY NAVY;  </P> <P> MANHUNT: TRIP TO A NORFOLK, VA., BAR WAS A MISTAKE FOR A MISSING LIEUTENANT WHO  IS SUSPECTED OF TAKING FUNDS FROM A SAN DIEGO-BASED SHIP.  </P> <P> After three months of sleuthing, Navy officials have caught an officer who  disappeared a month before $247,500 turned up missing from the San Diego-based  Tuscaloosa, a tank landing ship.  </P> <P> Lt. Bradley Scott Darr, 31, was arrested Wednesday night in Norfolk, Va., after  a Naval Investigative Services agent noticed him in a local bar on Christmas.  The agent left the bar, however, thinking that Darr looked familiar but not  remembering why.  </P> <P> In his office the following day, the agent scanned photographs of individuals  sought by the Navy and realized he had seen Darr.  </P> <P> Since Christmas, NIS agents have been searching Norfolk for Darr, a disbursing  officer who once handled payroll and purchasing and had access to $1.2 million  aboard ship. Wednesday night, 20 agents went to area nightclubs and found Darr,  a North Carolina native.  </P> <P> Darr said he had financial problems caused by gambling, according to NIS  spokesman Michael G. Bourke, who said agents believed Darr was in Norfolk  because his credit card had been used there in recent weeks.  </P> <P> "This was good sound investigative techniques and dogged persistence by the  Naval Investigative Services," said Rick Machin, deputy regional director for  the NIS mid-Atlantic region. "We put shoe leather to the street."  </P> <P> Agents also found more than $130,000 of the missing money, Machin said.  </P> <P> Darr is being held in Norfolk while authorities decide whether to hold a trial  in Virginia or San Diego. Darr will probably be charged with desertion and  theft of government funds, sources said. Desertion alone is punishable by up to  five years in prison.  </P> <P> Darr, who worked in Las Vegas casinos before enlisting three years ago, had  failed to report for duty when he was assigned to an naval air station in Italy  Aug. 23. One month later, he was declared a deserter. Then, after a routine  audit in September, officials realized that ship funds were also missing.  </P> <P> Aboard many ships, sailors are paid in cash because they spend long stretches  at sea and are rarely in a port long enough to establish a bank account.  </P> <P> The Tuscaloosa, which has a 340-member crew, can also house and transport 349  troops. Darr, a supply corps officer, could cash and write checks for those  aboard. Officials said a payroll officer could have written a single check for  $247,500, called ahead to the bank so that the cash was waiting for him, and  picked up the money later.  </P> <P> "As disbursing officer, he had the opportunity to make the books balance,"  Machin said.  </P> <P> For NIS agents, involved in the case since Sept. 25, finding Darr concludes  what has been a tough case -- trying to locate a man who could be anywhere in  the world.  </P> <P> "We were just talking about ol' Bradley and wondering what he was going to do  for Christmas," Bourke said. "Then just by fate, some guy sees him. It was a  lot of good investigative work. And sometimes in law enforcement, it's a lot of  luck."  </P></p>

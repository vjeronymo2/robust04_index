			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduard Urazayev: "Russians Are Leaving the </F> Republic; Frequently Under Threats of Armed Force"]    [Text] Now that the Russian population of the former union  republics is experiencing so many problems, the problems of the  Russians in the republics making up the Russian Federation are  escaping the notice of central councils. The situation in  Dagestan, however, has reached a critical point. This is  attested to by the nature of the discussion of 18 January in the  Republic of Dagestan Council of Ministers and by the resolutions  that were passed there. The discussion topic was listed on the  agenda as "Unregulated Migration Processes in the Republic of  Dagestan." Chief Ilyasov of the personnel administration, who  also heads a special commission on migration, reported that the  number of Russians leaving the republic is increasing and said  that around 4,000 Russians had moved permanently out of Dagestan  in 1993. According to the 1989 census there were around 166,000  Russians in the Republic of Dagestan (approximately 9.2 percent  of the republic population of 1.8 million, but in the middle of  1993 the figure was just over 7 percent).    In recent years the process has acquired the characteristics  of a virtual avalanche. As Ilyasov reported, a sociological  survey indicated that the main reasons for Russian emigration  were the socioeconomic instability, the rising crime rate, and  the inter-ethnic friction. The speaker also mentioned other  reasons: unemployment (4.9 percent at the end of 1993 in  comparison with the republic average of 0.9 percent) and the  failure of wages to keep up with the minimum subsistence level.  According to Ilyasov, however, the main reason is the exertion  of unlawful pressure on the Russian population. Representatives  of law enforcement agencies reported that three criminal groups  in Makhachkala had divided up the city's neighborhoods and were  engaging in explicit acts of terrorism.    There are reports of 102 families that were given 10 days to  leave Makhachkala. Their documents were taken away from them,  and the property owners among them were forced at gunpoint to  sign sale authorizations. The republic Ministry of Internal  Affairs received 21 official complaints, but 40 incidents were  actually recorded. Twenty of these reports were substantiated,  but only one case was turned over to the courts. Chairman  Ramazanov of the Standing Commission on Interethnic Relations of  the republic Supreme Council said that the roots of the problem  include the erroneous policy of resettling highlanders in the  flatlands, which began back in the 1950s.    In a final settlement, Chairman Mirzabekov of the republic  Council of Ministers reminded the gathering that the existence  of the "Russian problem" had been acknowledged by the republic  leadership, and this means that all government agencies should  be taking measures to deter Russian emigration. He said he had  set up a coordinating council for the Kizlyar zone, that the  possibility of special status for the zone was being considered,  and that funds were being allocated for the socioeconomic  development of these regions. He said it was outrageous that  government agencies were responding to the complaints of  forcibly evicted citizens by advising them to take the matter to  court. He reminded the gathering that no member of a native  ethnic group in Dagestan had complained of eviction from a  Russian city on ethnic grounds.    According to Chief Palamarchuk of the Kizlyar municipal  administration, the resolution of the problem will depend mainly  on the activities of law enforcement agencies. Some local  administrations are offering their services in the purchase and  sale of real estate, but the Russians have had a mixed reaction  to this.</p>

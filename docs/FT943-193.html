			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Employers seem to glorify youth when seeking staff Sir, In your 'Survey of business locations in Europe' (September 27) you published a thoughtful article by Eva Kaluzynska about how the ageing population of Europe and the 'baby bust' or decline in the birth rate meant that 'canny employers' should understand that their current emphasis on youth was soon going to start damaging them. However, recruitment advertisements on September 28 reveal the familiar picture. 'Ideally aged 27-35', 'mid 20s to early 30s', 'individuals aged 23-35'. Scant evidence that employers have received the message from the team leader of Eurostat's project on demography, quoted by Ms Kaluzynska, that 'this will stop'. This glorification of youth as the essential qualification becomes particularly offputting when it is applied to jobs managing other people's money. One pension fund apparently thinks that 10 years' experience is adequate to be the person in charge of a Pounds 2bn pension fund. I am glad to say that my pension fund is not with them. A private client stockbroker is looking for candidates 'likely to be aged 22-26', and with a 'minimum of two years' front office stockbroking experience', to discuss their investments with clients. I am likewise relieved that they are not my private client stockbrokers. Am I mad, or are they? Osman Streater, Savile Club, 69 Brook Street, London W1Y 2ER</p>

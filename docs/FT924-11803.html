			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Valmet trims deficit to FM213m as margins improve VALMET, the Finnish state-owned paper machinery and engineering group, has cut losses after financial items to FM213m (Dollars 44.60m) in the first eight months from FM529m in the same period last year. Sales grew by 22.3 per cent to FM5.03bn, reflecting the group's acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of Saab-Valmet in March and the purchase of 91 per cent of Tampella Papertech in May. Valmet noted that its operating margin was FM357m, compared with a negative FM187m a year ago, and cash-flow had also turned positive. However, financial expenses rose sharply to FM226m from FM56m, due to the group's expansion and high interest rates. The group expects to remain in the red for the full year, but the loss should be less than last year's FM616m deficit. Full-year sales are estimated at slightly more than FM9bn. Nobel Industries, the Swedish industrial group, made a profit (after financial items) of SKr248m (Dollars 43.57m) in the first eight months of the year, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. This was an improvement on the SKr193m profit made for the same period of 1991, although invoiced sales fell by 14 per cent to SKr14.03bn from SKr16.2bn. The company said that the international recession would have a negative influence on its activities but in spite of this it believed profits (after financial items) for 1992 would be better than the SKr460m it achieved last year. Nobel improved profits in the first eight months in its pulp and paper chemicals division (up from SKr56m to SKr73m), paints and adhesives (up from SKr118m to SKr144m) surface chemistry (up from SKr31m to SKr95m) and defence electronics (up from SKr34m to SKr45m).</p>

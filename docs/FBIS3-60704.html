Terming their visit as fruitful, they said the  discussions with Pakistani officials had provided them a greater  understanding and a better perception of the importance of  Pak-U.S. ties and of nurturing these relations in future. The  Senators also tried to explain that all endeavours of the United  States, including the Pressler Amendment, were basically mounted  to stop the spread of nuclear weapons as more countries joining  the present five nations nuclear club could endanger world peace.    Throughout the Press conference, the U.S. Senators harped on  the same tune although, at times, they did not agree with each  other's view. Senator Larry Pressler clearly took pride in his  amendment and did not deny singling out Pakistan for its  application. He said there were reports in the media during  mid-80s that an Islamic Bomb was being prepared and that the  technology might pass from one country to another. However,  Senator Brown dismissed this idea and said there is no such  thing as an Islamic Bomb and the United States had not focused  only on Pakistan but on every country wherever the threat of a  nuclear device existed. Both he and Senator Cochran made it  clear that they did not share Pressler's views on singling out  Pakistan under his amendment. Senator Cochran claimed that the  Amendment was not against any particular country as ``Pakistan  is on top of the countries we like.'' However, the most  significant statement made at the Press conference was by  Senator Larry Pressler when he said that both Pakistan and India  are ready for the inspection of their nuclear facilities. ``The  Pakistan Prime Minister told me exactly what the Indian Prime  Minister had said in this context,'' he said. This is the first  indication given at such a high diplomatic level by India that  it may open its facilities for international inspection. If  that is so, why does India refuse to sign the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) when Pakistan has several times  stated that it is prepared to sign it simultaneously with it? It  is strange Senator Larry Pressler did not put this question to  the Indian Prime Minister. Although Senator Cochran accepted  that ``very persuasive evidence has been given to us to show  that the implementation of the Pressler. Amendment was against  the interests of Pakistan and we will explore the options to do  an evenhanded application of the law,'' Senator Pressler still  refuses to support the move to bring changes in his amendment.  It is hoped the Clinton administration would not let him have  his way and make special efforts to have the new foreign  assistance bill adopted by the Congress.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 15 Apr (DPA) -- The  Mexican Government has said that today's predawn attack on a  military checkpoint in southern Chiapas does not jeopardize the  peace process in this strife-torn region that borders Guatemala.    A spokesman for the Mexican presidential palace told DPA  there does not seem to be any relation between the attack on the  checkpoint near Tuxtla Gutierrez and the armed conflict that  broke out in this state on 1 January. In this way, the  government dismissed reports that the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN), which took up arms on New Year's Day,  waged the attack.    Chiapas Attorney General Arturo Becerra said that so far  there are no indications the EZLN was involved in the attack on  the checkpoint located on the highway leading from Tuxtla  Gutierrez to Chicoasen, a town that is far removed from the  guerrilla's zone of operations.    Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno, in turn, stressed that  the truce between the insurgents and the Mexican Army, which has  been in effect since 12 January when the government ordered a  unilateral cease-fire of its offensive actions, "is alive."    The Defense Secretariat today said an Army sergeant died as  a  result of wounds sustained when "a small group of unidentified  civilians" opened fire on the military checkpoint. According to  the official report, the Army repelled the "armed assault" and  the assailants fled. It is believed that they are hidden in  caves in the mountains near the site of the skirmish. There is  no word on casualties among the attackers.    An hour afer the clash, which began at approximately 0530  (1130 GMT), several Armed Forces helicopter gunships were still  flying over the area and firing, according to reports from  residents. The area was reopened to traffic after it had been  sealed off for several hours.    The EZLN recently charged that the Army has been mobilizing  troops and warned that such deployments threaten the peace  process, which began on 21 February. The first phase of the  peace process ended on 2 March when the government announced its  responses to a 34-point list of demands submitted by the rebels.    In the wake of the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the  ruling  party's presidential candidate, the EZLN suspended its  consultations on the government's proposals -- consultations  that were being held within Indian villages located in the  EZLN's area of influence.</p>

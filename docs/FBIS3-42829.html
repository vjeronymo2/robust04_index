			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Stepan Khmara, head of the UKRP and a people's </F> deputy: "For a Strong, Independent State and a Righteous Regime"]    [Text] On 18 January a conference of the labor  collective at the Lvov Color Television Plant (RYASNE) nominated  Stepan Khmara, head of the UKRP [Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party], as a candidate for the office of people's  deputy from the Zaliznichnyy Election District No 261 in the  city of Lvov.    He states as his goal a strong, independent Ukrainian  state and a righteous regime.    Inability to bring order into the economy and the state, to  safeguard it in the society, and to guarantee the legal  protection of citizens and economic entities, mass corruption of  the state structures, the venality, impotence, and incapacity of  the highest state officials to protect and defend Ukraine's  national interests--all these factors have become the cause of  the all-encompassing crisis in our society. They also constitute  a threat to its destabilization as well as the principal  obstacle on the path of building an independent, united  Ukrainian state.    Catastrophe can be averted provided that we make a  fundamental change in the government. New persons must take over  the direction of our state--persons who will carry out a policy  based on new principles: The Ukrainian national idea must become  the optimal need for Ukraine, for its present-day and future  ideology as a state policy. The bearers of such a policy must be  patriots, fanatically devoted to Ukraine and its people. They  must be prepared to make self-sacrifices in the name of this  great and noble idea--for the good of our Fatherland. They must  be heroes who are capable of carrying out this noble mission.  And there are such high-caliber, professionally competent  Ukrainian patriots in Ukraine. It is only when such persons with  strong willpower take over the leadership of this state that we  will be able to count on a clean-up of the power structures from  the botched efforts of elements characterized by a lack of  talent, responsibility, or even decency. These people must be  replaced by persons with an innate sense of order, Ukrainian  patriotism, and professionalism. What is at issue here is the  speficific mechanism for solving the principal political  problem--the problem of govermental power.    In the situation which has evolved nowadays in Ukraine, it  must be noted that we should form a standard, competent  government--one which would be able to create the conditions for  overcoming the crisis and to guarantee the security of the  state; such a government would also clear away a path to a  suitable place for Ukraine in the world. But to do this merely  by the parliamentary path through elections has already become  impossible for the following reasons:    --the optimal time for elections has already been lost;    --at a time of such a profound economic and social crisis,  chaos, and anarchy it is difficult to hope for an objective  choice by our citizens;    --the criminalization of various branches and levels of the  government and the economy affords us grounds for asserting that  our state is being led by organized criminals--persons who would  certainly have a decisive influence on the preparation and  results of elections;    --an incorrect sequence in the elections would not help to  create better conditions for conducting them. It would be more  feasible to carry out elections and a reform of the  representative and executive organs of local power while  simultaneously conducting a referendum on the matter of  confidence or no confidence in the president;    --the usurpation of such important mass media as radio and  television by the president and his team--along with the  spreading of disinformation--has been instrumental in forming a  distorted public opinion. Masked anti-Ukrainian propaganda has  reached unsafe levels for the Ukrainian nation and state;    --an endeavor is being made to fill out Ukraine's political  spectrum with powerful, mafia-type groups camouflaged as  political parties. Such groups have very large finances at their  disposal, and they have real power;    --the ruinous activity of the president and the  government--directed at intensively plundering our national  resources by various domestic and foreign mafia-type groups--has  become so dangerous that it threatens Ukraine with the loss of  state sovereignty, and it requires that urgent measures be taken  for the purpose of removing the president and the government  from power and holding them responsible for crimes committed  against Ukraine.    Unless this is done in the very near future, events will  develop to Ukraine's disadvantage. Such events could take the  following variant courses:    --the dictatorship of the mafia-type groups could finally  come about under the guise of the presidential power structures;    --further aggravation of living conditions could provoke a  social outburst--one which could take the form of a spontaneous,  uncontrolled revolt with multi-variant, extremely negative  consequences.    Recent events have been nudging us toward changing the  government by the revolutionary path. If we fail to take  advantage of this moment, we will lose a great and very  propitious chance to give rebirth to the Ukrainian state. And we  are sure that such an opportunity will not be repeated, for the  Ukrainian nation has become too weakened, and its foes will do  everything in their power to make sure that this state will be  finished after this failure.    The complete surrender of our nuclear weapons in compliance  with the demands made by Russian and American imperialism  constitutes a capitulation and abandonment of our state  independence without any opposition or even objection. Without  its nuclear weapons Ukraine will lack that restraining factor  which is now our sole guarantee of national security. The  imperialist predators will not have to take a non-nuclear  Ukraine into consideration, and they will be able to act as they  please, without taking Ukraine's national interests into account  at all. At that time nothing will stop them any longer from  applying any measures they choose--including the skillful  introduction of internal instability--for the purpose of  dismembering Ukraine and forever assigning to it the status of a  colony without any rights.    Nor was the time for Ukraine's unilateral and complete  disarmament chosen merely by chance. It was a time when the  primary attention of political groups was keyed to the  elections, and--on the other hand--the people were brought to  the extremes of exhaustion by the artificially created,  intolerable social conditions. The criminal clique of the  anti-state, mafia-type nomenklatura resorted to a terrible state  crime in order to preserve its own social domination, relying on  the support of Russian and American imperialism--which acts in a  coordinated collusion against Ukraine. There can be nothing more  degrading for the Ukrainian nation that what Kravchuk did on 12  and 14 January.    Therefore, this culminating moment cannot be allowed to  pass.  Kravchuk and his henchmen must be removed from power and  punished. There are certainly legal grounds for this. In the  first place, he acted in contradiction to the decisions.    In the second place, the mood in the society is not on his  side.    In the third place, while Russia is still in a weakened  condition, it will not be able to mount sufficient opposition  should Ukraine not wish to kneel down before it.    In the fourth place, Ukraine's resistance to the imperialist  desires will evoke a renewal of anti-imperialist opposition in  other regions of the former USSR.    In the fifth place, attempts to blockade Ukraine will not  find support in the world as a whole.    As to nuclear weapons, Ukraine is capable of maintaining  them  in a safe technical condition, and--within a rather brief  interval of time and with a relatively modest expenditure of  money--to develop them and take them under complete control and  administer them by its own national means. Standing in the way  of this is the highest state-political leadership, which is  creating very great problems--and not only in the sphere of  nuclear weapons. It is consciously sabotaging the process of  creating a Ukrainian state.    The task of the national-patriotic forces is to direct the  revolutionary process into the channel necessary for Ukraine: to  replace the mafia-type, nomenklatura, anti-Ukrainian government  with a national-patriotic, decent, and decent one.    The revolution could take place in an instant if the central  government were to be replaced, or it could be done  gradually--by way of replacing the regional governments and thus  constricting the area controlled by the central, mafia-type  regime and increasing the pressure on it until the latter is  finally removed.    The central leadership of the UKRP is prepared to propose a  personnel makeup for a Committee of National Assistance (KNP),  which could subsequently form a complete government.    The UKRP is categorically opposed to the proposed candidacy  of Lanovoy for the post of head of government inasmuch as this  could bring about unjustifiable losses to Ukraine's national  interests.    On the overall state scale the UKRP advocates the  resignation  of the president and the government and their being held  responsible for committing crimes against Ukraine. It is also in  favor of eliminating the presidential power structures.    As to the situation in the Lvov region, the UKRP considers  that the principal cause of the crisis-type situation here is  the oblast leadership. Objective conditions in the Lvov region  are favorable for this area to become a model for all Ukraine in  the state-creating processes, but the oblast's talentless and  disorderly leaders are blocking this. Therefore, the UKRP must  initiate organizational and activist measures for the purpose of  removing from power--first of all--the following persons:  Shpitser, the mayor of Lvov; Davymukha, the president's  representative in this oblast; Horyn, the head of the Oblast  Council; and Kotyk, the oblast-level procurator.    The UKRP will actively participate in the election campaign,  but without restricting its struggle to existing conditions. On  the contrary, it intends to actively influence the formulation  of sociopolitical thought in the direction needed by Ukraine.    The UKRP will actively support not only candidates from its  own organization, but also others, assessing each one as to how  they measure up to the following criteria: a love of order,  Ukrainian patriotism, and professionalism--first of all,  political--and evidence of the quality of willpower.    The UKRP will vigorously oppose candidates from the  pro-communist and pro-imperialist organizations, as well as  puppets of the mafia-type groups.    As an organization of active, rather than paper-type,  Ukrainian nationalists, the UKRP will evaluate candidates--first  of all--by their deeds.</p>

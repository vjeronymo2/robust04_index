			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Photo-Me shares dip 20p on fall to Pounds 13.9m The market reacted critically to a fall in headline pre-tax profits at Photo-Me International, marking the shares of the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator down 20p to 235p. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 16.2m) in the year to April 30, though the group was keen to stress that operating profits rose, albeit modestly, from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 31.3m and that group profits were up at Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.4m), after depreciation of Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 16.2m). Below this the devaluation of sterling in the previous year contributed Pounds 4.15m to last time's figures, against a mere Pounds 93,000 this time. Further there were exceptional costs of Pounds 1.67m arising from the group's merger with KIS of France, which was agreed by PMI's shareholders in February. Although KIS was part of the group for only for two months, PMI has stated its accounts as if it had been on board not only for the year under review but also the previous 12 months. Mr Dan David, chairman, said that the merger with KIS, with which PMI had had a three-year relationship previously, had added 'a new technological dimension', specifically Argentic, which freezes video images into high quality still photographs. Mr David Miller, group managing director, added that a 15 per cent increase in revenue was expected from this new technology, derived from 10 per cent cheaper manufacturing costs, more customer choice and lower consumables. Group turnover declined to Pounds 172.4m (Pounds 175m), after the sale of two 'chunky, but distant' subsidiaries in Australia and New Zealand to local owners. Mr David said, though that they were still contributing to the group's profits. The group currently has more than 18,000 photo-booths sold and serviced in more than 100 countries, of which PMI has agents in about 70. Mr David expected the group to have some 19,700 in the current year, including 500 Imagemaker booths, which create larger photos. PMI was also 'cautiously excited' by the prospect of photographs on UK driving licences, which should be introduced during 1996. Earnings per share emerged at 10.26p (11.52p) but the final dividend is lifted to 3.3p (3.2p) for a total payment up 0.2p at 4.8p.</p>

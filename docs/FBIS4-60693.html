			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 May (MENA) -- AL-AHRAM Chief Editor  Ibrahim Nafi' has revealed that during a secret meeting some  time ago, Hasan al-Turabi's group and the executive group in  power in Sudan decided to strike at Egyptian-Sudanese relations  by adopting 14 anti-Egyptian measures.    In an article published in today's issue, Nafi' notes that  the recent Sudanese measures against Egyptian interests in  Khartoum are part of this strategy, which is directed against  Egypt and its historic ties with sisterly Sudan. He points out  that these measures include an attempt to undermine the Egyptian  presence in Sudan and to incite the Sudanese masses against  Egypt.    Nafi' explains that by taking over Egyptian property, the  government in Khartoum wanted to mask the failure of the Nairobi  talks to find a peaceful solution to the armed struggle in south  Sudan, an issue to which the Sudanese people, stricken by war  and poverty, pay much attention. He adds that by adopting  anti-Egyptian measures, the Khartoum government wants to focus  attention away from the rising acts of opposition inside Sudan,  the latest being violent demonstrations in western and central  Sudan recently. Nafi' adds that the ruling regime in Sudan  wants to cast doubts on the firmness of Egypt's position in  support of the unity of the Sudanese people and Sudan's  territorial integrity by claiming that Egypt cares about Sudan's  unity only because it cares about its interests in Sudan. He  asks: Where are these Egyptian interests in Sudan in which  nobody has any interest any longer, after suffering poverty and  seeing destruction and millions giving up hope of finding food  and shelter under this bad regime?    Nafi' points out that the regime in Sudan also wants to hide  Sudan's deteriorating economic conditions, which have become a  source of ridicule for Sudanese inside and outside Sudan. The  middle class, a prosperous class for which Sudan has been  famous, no longer exists in the country, where poverty has  become widespread and those who can afford to live are members  of the ruling clique or key figures in the al-Turabi [Islamic]  front who have become top businessmen. To give an example of  the bad conditions in Sudan, Nafi' notes that when it took  power, the al-Bashir regime said it had come to save the country  before a dollar could be traded for 20 Sudanese pounds. At the  time of the revolution, a dollar bought 12 Sudanese pounds. Now  a dollar buys 500 Sudanese pounds, he adds.    Thus, Nafi' notes, the Sudanese people have failed to catch  up with the rise in prices and are leading a bitter life. Some  even wonder how the Sudanese people can live under these tough  conditions. The AL-AHRAM chief editor says that the ruling  regime in Sudan is instigating trouble with Egypt to whip up  public sentiment and thereby camouflage the host of problems it  is having with other countries and international organizations.    Sudan, Ibrahim Nafi' points out, has been repeatedly  condemned by the United Nations for its human rights violations.  Eritrea filed a complaint against it with the United Nations  over its interference in its internal affairs, accusing it of  harboring subversive Eritrean elements. The U.S. Congress is  putting pressure on Clinton's administration to take firmer  action against Sudan because it has become a haven for terrorist  elements.    The ruling regime in Khartoum, with its recent measures  against Egypt, also hopes to divert attention from its role in  fomenting the current armed struggle in Yemen. Millionaire  Usamah Bin-Ladin, whose country [Saudi Arabia] has annulled his  citizenship, has set up a state within a state in Sudan.  Bin-Ladin ordered his followers in Pakistan and Afghanistan to  go to Yemen via Sudan and fight on the side of the northern  troops, Ibrahim Nafi' writes.    The Sudanese regime, with the measures it has taken, aims to  test Egypt's resolve before it proceeds to the issue of water.  But once it gets there it will no longer be gauging reactions.  It will be taking direct action that will provoke an equally  direct reaction, Nafi' declares.    The AL-AHRAM chief editor concludes his article by saying  that the Sudanese regime is swimming against the tide of  history. Eighty percent of the Sudanese people know that. They  also know that Sudan is passing through a gloomy phase.</p>

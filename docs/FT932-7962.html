			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Parties set to pay homage to Catalonia - Catalan nationalist leader Jordi Pujol could hold the balance of power after June 6 THE one political party that is wholly confident about Spain's June 6 general elections is Catalonia's nationalist grouping Convergencia i Unio, CiU. Its electoral slogan proclaims the poll date to be 'The Great Opportunity' and nobody disputes the relevance of the message. The ruling Socialist party, PSOE, and the centre-right Partido Popular opposition, PP, are worried. The two Madrid-based parties are evenly matched and they both know that neither of them is likely to form a governing majority. The prospect of a stand-off election and a hung parliament is tailor-made for CiU's ambition to consolidate its hold on the wealthy north-east corner of Spain. CiU has consistently won Catalonia's regional elections - its leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, has run the autonomous government, the Generalitat, since 1980  -and it is now also poised to outstrip the Socialists in Catalonia in a general election. Opinion polls indicate that CiU could gain up to three seats, to return 21 of the 47 members elected in Catalonia to the Madrid congress, that the PSOE's present 22 Catalan seats will be sharply reduced, possibly to as few as 15, and that the PP may double its Catalan representation to 10 seats. On present evidence neither the Socialists nor the centre-right opposition are likely to gain much more than 150 seats in the 350-member Congress and the CiU's 20-odd members will hold the balance of power in the new legislature. Mr Pujol can accordingly negotiate an alliance with the PSOE and return it to power for a fourth term, or he could ally with the PP and usher in a new government. Mr Pujol, who clearly relishes the prospect of a power-broker role, says CiU can be counted on to assure the governability of Spain. But he is keeping understandably quiet about which of the two main parties he is willing to back. The choice is not an easy one, for CiU is a middle-of-the- road party that seeks to be all things to all Catalans. It embraces diehard and lukewarm nationalists, big business, small shopkeepers and liberal-minded professionals. An alliance with the PSOE would anger Mr Pujol's middle-class supporters but one with the PP would upset Catalan nationalist sentiment. It is not, however, a choice that can be ducked. 'Since we have the responsibility of governing Catalonia, we are condemned to reaching an understanding with Madrid,' says Mr Joaquin Molins, a former member of Mr Pujol's Generalitat government who is now running for a CiU seat in Congress. Tipped for a cabinet post in the event of a coalition government, Mr Molins stresses that it is very much in Catalonia's self-interest for Spain to have a competent and stable government. Catalonia resembles northern Italy in its sophisticated development. However, unlike regional political movements there, such as the Lombard League, which have little time for the rest of Italy, CiU cannot dissociate itself from its Spanish framework. Catalonia is only geographically close to the core of Europe; its prosperity is to a large extent dependent on the purchasing power of the more backward areas of the domestic economy. La Gran Oportunitat, as CiU's electoral posters proclaim, is the challenge to infuse the Spanish administration, as junior partners in a coalition led either by the PSOE or the PP, with all the values and virtues of modernity, efficiency and commercial acumen that are attributed to the Catalans. The slogan echoes a call to 'Catalanise Spain' made 60 years ago by the financier Mr Francesc Cambo, the father of modern Catalan nationalism. But it is also an opportunity to increase the considerable self-rule powers that are already enjoyed by Barcelona's Generalitat. Mr Pujol will insist on the Generalitat's fiscal co-responsibility in Catalonia with the Madrid government as the price for CiU support in a national coalition government. Eventually Mr Pujol wants the Generalitat to raises its own taxes and then pay a lump sum to Madrid for the services rendered by the central administration. The Basque country and Navarre, its adjoining autonomous community, already have this prerogative. 'All we want is the same deal,' says Mr Molins. It is doubtful, given the electoral trends, whether either the PSOE or the PP will be in a position to reject such a deal after June 6. MR JORDI PUJOL is fast and fluent, although not always understandable, in English, French, German and Italian as well as Spanish, writes Tom Burns in Barcelona. As a public speaker he is at his most impressive speaking Catalan, the language he considers his birthright and that of Catalonia's 6m-odd inhabitants. Aged 63, Mr Pujol has been running the area that he resolutely calls a nacio since 1980 as chief minister of the Generalitat, the Barcelona-based autonomous government. As well as the most linguistically gifted of Spain's senior politicians, he is the longest serving in high elected office. Mr Pujol has been a passionate Catalan patriot since his student days, when he was tortured and imprisoned for singing Catalonia's national anthem at a Barcelona concert attended by the top brass of General Franco's dictatorship.</p>

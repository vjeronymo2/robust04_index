			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: GA tops Pounds 60m but balance sheet suffers A sharp decline in the value of its investments in equities and gilts has dented the balance sheet of General Accident, one of the largest UK composite insurers. The Perth-based company yesterday disclosed the extent of the damage when reporting a rise in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 41.3m) for the first three months of 1994. GA's solvency margin - the yardstick which compares shareholders' funds as a percentage of non-life premium income - had fallen to 55.4 per cent by May 6, compared with 65.5 per cent at the end of last year. Net asset value per ordinary share fell from 545p to 455p over the same period. However, Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive, described the operating result as the best 'ever achieved in an opening quarter'. The impact of severe winter weather in the US and Canada, which added an extra Pounds 27m in losses compared with last year, was offset by continued improvement in UK underwriting results, with a profit of Pounds 30.3m (Pounds 4.1m deficit) for the three months. 'The control of costs, more selective underwriting procedures and an increased emphasis on customer service,' were singled out as factors behind the improvement by Mr Robertson. Each of GA's UK underwriting lines was in surplus, with the exception of liability business. Underwriting losses in the US amounted to Dollars 57.8m (Pounds 39.5m) against Dollars 60.1m, while losses in Canada increased to CDollars 63.1m (Pounds 31m) compared with CDollars 22.4m. Parts of Canada have experienced one of the coldest winters in living memory. Overall general premium income increased to Pounds 1.07bn (Pounds 1.01bn). Life premiums rose to Pounds 216.6m (Pounds 207m). Investment income rose to Pounds 118.8m (Pounds 117.3m). Estate agency losses were marginally higher at Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 3.7m). Underwriting losses were Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 77.1m deficit). Life profits were Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.5m). Interest on loans amounted to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 5.7m).</p>

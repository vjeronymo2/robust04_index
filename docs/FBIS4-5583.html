			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The opposition launched  an offensive Friday against the government over the Uruguay  Round [UR] accord, which will open up Korea's farm market, as  the Morocco signing of the agreement fast approaches.    The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) set in motion a  "struggle committee," aimed at stopping parliament from  ratifying the Uruguay Round (UR) accord, at a ceremony attended  by Chairman Yi Ki-taek and 100 postholders and lawmakers.    Chairman Yi, who also steers the committee, said the party  must struggle for the national interest because dialogue has not  helped in redressing the problem.    The DP also agreed with the three splinter parties and the  pan- national movement to preserve agriculture, in a meeting  held Friday morning, to hold rallies against the UR agreement in  Seoul and other major cities over the weekend.    At the meeting DP Chairman Yi, United People's Party leader  Han Yong-su, New Korea Party representative Yi Chong-chan, New  Political Reform Party leader Pak Chan-chong and movement  representative Yi Chang-pok decided to demand that President Kim  Yong-sam apologize to the nation for government wrongdoings in  the course of negotiating the UR pact, while guaranteeing the  right of ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) lawmakers to  express their opinions on the trade accord.    According to the movement, all 112 opposition lawmakers had  pledged to vote against the UR pact and some DLP lawmakers  expressed their intention to follow suit as of Friday.    Prof. Chang Won-suk of Tankuk University, one of the  movement's leaders, said it will press the government to  renegotiate the accord. Although it is a multilateral pact, its  "unfair contents" should be renegotiated through bilateral  talks, he added.    Some 180 colleges and universities of Hanchongnyon (the  Federation of Korean College and University Student  Associations) began a two-day strike Friday to oppose the UR  agreement, while 20,000 students took to the streets of Seoul to  denounce the pact.    After the accord is signed at the Morocco meeting, the DP  will hold its own rallies to oppose parliamentary ratification  while launching a nationwide signature-collection campaign.    Concerned that the anti-UR struggle by opposition forces  could plunge the nation into a political crisis, the government  and the ruling DLP are busy taking countersteps.    DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong warned the DP would earn public  censure for a struggle that could lead to political unrest just  as the nation is starting to enjoy political and social  stability under the civilian government.    The DLP plans to obtain National Assembly approval of the UR  accord by the end of August and promote the need for the pact in  this era of internationalization and market opening.    The government will advance the announcement of a  wide-ranging rural investment plan from the target date of June  30 to assure farmers that the UR agreement is a good opportunity  to make agriculture truly viable.    A Chongwadae [presidential office] official said the  government would deal with all anti-UR pact rallies and  demonstrations strictly in accordance with the law.    To cope with rallies and demonstrations by activist students  in Seoul at the weekend, over 16,000 riot policemen have been  deployed to ensure that these events are carried out in a  peaceful manner.</p>

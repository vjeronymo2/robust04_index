			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Blasts from the past: Mr Papandreou has to take tough action to improve Greece's economy A glow of nostalgia for Greek voters helped propel Mr Andreas Papandreou, leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, back to power in this week's general election. Now he has to find a way of matching the increase in living standards that Greeks enjoyed when he was prime minister between 1981 and 1989. After running an election campaign in which he pledged to fight for full employment, lower inflation and a lasting 'social contract' between employees and companies on wage levels, Mr Papandreou has to square his ambitions with Greece's deteriorating economic circumstances  - particularly its escalating debt. Efforts by the outgoing conservative New Democracy party to implement far-reaching structural reforms - including the ending of price restrictions, liberalisation of labour laws and strengthening of competition policy - deepened Greece's recession in the short term. The official GDP growth forecast for this year remains 1 per cent. What buoyancy there is can be found in the black economy, which, by some estimates, accounts for 40 per cent of national income. Voters appear to have held Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, former Conservative prime minister, responsible for this state of affairs. His approval rating in the campaign never exceeded 25 per cent. The origins of Greece's current problems, however, lie mainly in Mr Papandreou's last term in office. The effects were hidden as Greece benefited from large grants from the European Community, worth about Dollars 2bn a year through most of the 1980s. But, while such inflows helped the agricultural sector and boosted consumer spending, confidence among investors in Greek industry fell off sharply. A principal cause was Mr Papandreou's decision in 1983 to nationalise Heracles General Cement, Europe's largest cement exporter, and one of Greece's biggest private-sector companies. The move appeared to lack rational explanation and was seen by many as a sop to the radicals in his socialist party. The result was to alarm investors. Direct investment from overseas in Greek manufacturing and service industries totalled no more than Dollars 2bn in the 1980s, against Dollars 6.5bn in similar-sized Portugal, according to OECD estimates. Although membership of the EC from 1981 offered opportunities for increasing trade, Greek manufacturing shrank during the decade, competitiveness fell and exports grew only modestly. The travails of manufacturers, however, did not dissuade the socialist government from extending the welfare state, by raising pensions and indexing public sector wages to inflation. In addition, the number of public servants increased in the 1980s by more than 40,000, or about 10 per cent. With spending exceeding economic growth, Greece's public sector borrowing requirement jumped from 5 per cent of GDP in 1980 to about 20 per cent in 1990. The consequences of his last term of office will fill Mr Papandreou's in-tray as he returns to government this week. The New Democracy party tried to increase tax revenues and to cut civil service numbers, but made little headway. The pressures on Mr Papandreou for such reforms are just as compelling - particularly if Greece is to come close to fulfilling the economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty. Progress on this front could also determine Greece's eligibility for future EC structural assistance. Though Mr Papandreou is an economist, the signs are he may not give the economy his full attention. His health is poor; a heart condition restricts his working hours. Mr Papandreou prefers foreign policy. He has also to hold together a party that is given to disputes between radical and moderate wings. His ability to indulge different factions is limited, however, as his party, Pasok, has endorsed the Maastricht treaty's ambition of European economic and monetary union, although its timescale for Greece to meet EC targets is longer than its Conservative predecessor's. The Conservative government managed to reduce the inflation rate from 20.4 per cent in 1990 to 12.8 per cent last month. By Draconian curbs on public spending - including threats to sack chief executives of state corporations who awarded wage increases above a pre-set level - it also cut general government borrowing to 13.4 per cent of GDP last year. But these achievements still leave Greece a long way off Maastricht targets. Accumulated debt, currently equal to about 120 per cent of GDP, is double the 60 per cent envisaged under convergence criteria. Debt raised on domestic financial markets has increased particularly rapidly to fund government spending. Interest payments on this debt will rise next year by almost 30 per cent to Dr3,000bn (Dollars 12.5bn), equivalent to 16 per cent of GDP. That means the government will have to raise an extra Dr300bn every month from sales of treasury bills. 'Greece has a huge amount of debt, more than many Latin American countries in the 1980s. It was able to go on borrowing because of being an EC member,' says Ms Miranda Xafa, economic adviser to Mr Mitsotakis. Additional pressure on Mr Papandreou comes from an expected shortfall in tax revenue this year of about Dr800bn, caused by the recession and over-optimistic forecasts in last December's budget. Moreover, he is committed to cancelling Greece's privatisation programme, so ruling out about Dr330bn in privatisation receipts this year. One alternative for Mr Papandreou would be to reduce debt charges by cutting interest rates, now at about 20 per cent on a one-year Treasury bill. But the risk would be large-scale outflows of capital as investors sought higher returns elsewhere. The socialist government may feel obliged to take radical steps that previous governments have shied away from: making big cuts in public spending, eliminating civil service jobs, and curbing tax evasion in the black economy. In the heady days following his election victory, Mr Papandreou has not given any details of his economic policy. The precedents only underline the difficulties before him. The Conservative government tried to boost efficiency at tax offices. But the finance ministry believes attempts to make life more difficult for tax evaders have been inhibited by corruption among tax officials. Trimming the public sector payroll proved virtually impossible, despite the Conservatives' promises to the EC that 60,000 jobs would be cut between 1991 and 1993. Mr Mitsotakis says that, over the period, one person was hired for every three who retired from the civil service. But his claims are not supported by the government's economic advisers and it is far from clear whether the 60,000 target is even close to being achieved. Yet the rewards for returning Greece's economy back towards steady growth, with public spending under control, would be substantial. The EC is set to provide up to Ecu20bn for infrastructure projects over the next six years. If competitiveness can be improved, there is also scope for increasing earnings from overseas and trade; the conflict in former Yugoslavia has not blocked Greek access to markets elsewhere in the Balkans and in southern Russia and Ukraine. But though there is no formal link, political decisions on allocating EC funds may be affected by perceptions among member states about whether Greece is committed to economic reform. Mr Papandreou may also find it more difficult to convince investors that good times lie ahead than the voters who elected him on Sunday.</p>

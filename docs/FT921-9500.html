			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Emirate to go ahead with Dollars 1.8bn power plant THE KUWAITI government is going ahead with plans to build a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 990m) power plant - the largest construction project since the Gulf war ended a year ago. Mitsubishi of Japan, the lead contractor on the project, is likely to supply boilers and turbines worth about Dollars 1bn. The company has been in delicate negotiations with the Kuwaiti government over the cost of the deal, which is expected to be finalised within the next few months. Mitsubishi originally won the contract in 1989 but the project was put on hold because of the Iraqi invasion the following year. The Kuwaiti government has since been trying to hold Mitsubishi to prices agreed under the 1989 contract. Mr Ahmed al-Adsany, minister for electricity and water, said yesterday the government had already committed a substantial amount to the project, including a KD54m (Pounds 101m) advance payment to Mitsubishi and smaller sums to sub-contractors. Agreement had been reached with a group of Turkish companies to build the plant's foundations, roads and other installations, Mr al-Adsany said. Kuwait's power stations were severely damaged during the Iraqi occupation. The government has decided against repairing one of its five plants, which was virtually destroyed. Repairs to the other four have so far restored less than one-third of Kuwait's pre-war capacity of 7,200MW, but this is enough to meet current low levels of demand.</p>

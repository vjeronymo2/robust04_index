			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The Lloyd's Name Sara Gibb: Group Secretary to the Gooda Walker Action Group; a widow with one daughter at university. Wanted: Tax reform: 'It is ridiculous that someone earning Pounds 40,000 pays 40 per cent after Pounds 22,000, the same way as someone earning Pounds 400,000.' Said yesterday: 'I would have preferred to see some real reform in income tax - the marginal tax rate raised, say, to 50 per cent or 60 per cent for people earning more than Pounds 60,000 a year. I am very disappointed they did not rescind the VAT on fuel. To give these rebates just confirms they should not have imposed the tax in the first place.'</p>

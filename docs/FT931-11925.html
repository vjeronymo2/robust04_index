			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / ICI to offer 14.5% rise for flexible working agreement IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' 20,000 manual workers look set to receive pay rises of at least 14.5 per cent during their current 12-month wage round ending in June. This compares with private-sector increases averaging just over 3 per cent. The government is seeking to impose a 1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector. ICI insists that the increases being negotiated at local level are self-financing and the price is worth paying because it involves sweeping changes in working practices. So far 3,000 workers at the company's sites at Grangemouth, Huddersfield and Yalding in Kent have received 6 per cent wage increases as a result of workplace reforms that involve greater worker flexibility and 'multi-skilling'. They will receive two further rises of 4 per cent each on the first and second anniversaries of the deals. Shift and other allowances as well as call-out payments are also being increased by 6 per cent under the local deals. As a result, the annual salaries of ICI manual workers will now range from between Pounds 10,734 and Pounds 16,011. The company said it expected the rest of its manual workforce to agree workplace changes at local level over the next few months. All will receive the same pay increases as a result. The 6 per cent rises are in addition to 5.1 per cent which ICI manual workers received last June through the company's normal annual pay negotiations and 3.5 per cent awarded in the following month from the company's employee profit scheme. ICI says the local pay deals derive from a 1991 agreement signed with the five unions recognised by the company, which radically reformed work organisation across the company's 13 plants. It has taken more than 18 months of intensive local negotiation for the workplace changes to be agreed. The ICI deal looks much more generous to the workforce than similar agreements reached more recently in industry. Last year's Japanese-style working practices package accepted by the Rover Group, for example, awarded no extra pay but improved job security and introduced common conditions for all workers.</p>

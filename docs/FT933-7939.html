			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index closed at a record high after a late afternoon squeeze in the futures drove the market sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo. A good performance in the gilts sector late in the session brought strong demand for the contract. Sentiment was boosted by a buoyant performance by drug stocks around the same time, all of which pushed the contract to a high of 3,038 just before 4pm. Light profit-taking in the last few minutes before the close left September at 3,031, just ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 7 points, on volume of 7,516. The early part of the session was marked by mixed trading. The contract opened at 3,019 and had fallen to 3,006 by 10am on sporadic selling. The publication of a better than expected MMC investigation into British Gas helped to halt the earlier decline. It was followed by sideways trading for the next few hours before the late demand not only sent September ahead but pulled the underlying cash market higher. Traded options were also busy and saw total volume of 33,816 lots, against Monday's total of 23,573 contracts. Some 10,781 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. The stock options were particularly active and Vodafone Group led the league table with a total of 3,881 contracts, followed by Lasmo with 2,949 trades.</p>

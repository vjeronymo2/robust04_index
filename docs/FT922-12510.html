			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Fed fears for US recovery as industrial growth slows THE pace of US industrial growth slowed last month with output rising only 0.2 per cent, compared with a 0.5 per cent gain in February, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. The figure was in line with analysts' forecasts and followed other recent evidence of a sluggish economy including a fall in retail sales and flat employment last month. The Fed said production declined at an annual rate of 4.1 per cent in the first quarter relative to the final quarter of last year, mainly because of a sharp fall in output in January. This was the second successive quarter of industrial contraction. On an annual comparison, however, industrial production was up 2.1 per cent in March, reflecting a recovery in output last summer. Most forecasters continue to project a mild economic recovery this year with growth of gross domestic product accelerating to an annual rate of 2-3 per cent, compared with 0.4 per cent at the end of last year. The Federal Reserve, however, remains anxious about the pace of recovery. Last week it surprised financial markets by signalling a quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates to 3.75 per cent, the first reduction since December. Many analysts anticipate a further modest easing of monetary policy if the economy fails to gather momentum. Industrial production is expected to advance sluggishly in coming months. This reflects relatively strong growth of demand in the first quarter as a whole and a projected rebuilding of corporate inventories after liquidation of stocks in recent months. Figures released yesterday showed that the ratio of business inventories to sales continued to fall in February, reflecting stronger than expected demand. Most industrial sectors were sluggish in March. Manufacturing output edged up 0.1 per cent but capacity utilisation at factories fell 0.1 per cent to 77 per cent. Output of construction supplies fell 0.2 per cent. Output of non-durable consumer goods rose 0.4 per cent, but this mainly reflected a sharp 2.1 per cent rise in the output of utilities, a reaction after declines due to unseasonably warm weather in January and February. The strongest sector was durable consumer goods, which rose 0.5 per cent despite a decline in car production.</p>

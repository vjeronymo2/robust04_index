			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE ORIGINALITY  </P> <P> It's tiring to hear it over and over again, but even more irritating having to  read it in a newspaper. I'm speaking of J. Gregory Keene's Jan. 14 letter on  the recent acquisition of Columbia by Sony in which he writes ". . . the  Japanese have created nothing original."  </P> <P> Either he is ignorant of or conveniently overlooks original efforts of  directors such as Akira Kurosawa and multitalent legends such as  actor/playwright/novelist Mishima in his rush to spew forth jingoistic bigotry.  </P> <P> It is fortunate, perhaps, that the United States is blessed with the more  enlightened views of George Lukas, Paul Schrader and Francis Ford Coppola, who  have all claimed inspiration from these Japanese originals. It gives the rest  of us hope that Mr. Keene's parroting of the same old generalization about  other cultures remain only in the provincial minds of a handful of bitter,  unoriginal thinkers.  </P> <P> PAUL SCARZO  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

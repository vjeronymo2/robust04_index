			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "To Refute, But Not To Retreat"] </F>   [Text] Russia has two current politicians who are being  discussed throughout the world. Even President B. Yeltsin, who  is still defined as a democrat and whose accomplishments are  constantly trumpeted to the world, as though remains in a  shadow. Two names are mentioned most often -- Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and Andrey Kozyrev. One can find many common  issues in their recent statements: The Russian empire and its  eternal interests, the misfortunes and offenses of the  Russian-speaking population, blatant visions of the future, and  plans to turn neighboring countries into the subordinates of the  authoritarian Russia.    On Wednesday [19 January], a two-day meeting ended in Moscow  where Russian envoys to the CIS and Baltic states had discussed  foreign policy in the "near abroad countries" together with  officials from the Russian Foreign Ministry and other  institutions. Having not even reached the middle, the meeting  became odious and was commented throughout the world, while the  reaction of the Baltic states was harsh and angry, which is a  rare case. The response of our foreign minister was  unbelievably fast, although previously he had required several  days for such a move. His reply notes those statements in the  speeches of the Russian foreign minister which are unacceptable  to Lithuania. A. Kozyrev demonstrates imperial fists quite  often, and it would be naive to expect that all this is done  without B. Yeltsin's knowledge. Everyone remembers A. Kozyrev's  speech in Stockholm which astonished the world and was revoked  later (did the minister joke?!). On Tuesday, he declared that  the Russian Army cannot be withdrawn from the CIS states  altogether, because enemy forces may penetrate into them.    All three Baltic states assessed the speech of the Russian  foreign minister negatively. A. Kozyrev hurried to explain very  efficiently that journalists of the official news agency who  presented a twisted report to the public were to blame for  everything. Such an act is as traditional as is demagogy in  politics. Our politicians are equally fond of spreading various  "sensational" statements abroad, and later accusing the local  press for misinterpreting everything.    It would be too great an historical honor for A. Kozyrev to  call him the new Machiavelli of diplomacy. This minister is an  actor in the theater of politics, who in a real theater is given  only one role -- to ask loudly on cue: "What would you like?"  The new Russian parliament, where thus far fighting goes on  only in the canteen, is likely to dictate the new rules of the  game even now. The foreign minister also wants to retain his  position. The president wants to find if not a way then at  least a path between the right and left "hurrah patriots."    A. Kozyrev's refutations, which Moscow television broadcast  so lavishly, may have hardly convinced anyone. We have heard  too many promises. However, we have learned that the Russian  Army would invade Latvia's territory within 15 minutes in case  of necessity. Which part of A. Kozyrev's speech denies this  Russian principle? There is always the word in the beginning.  However, it would be good if it did not become the deed. The  statements and assessments of our politicians are often similar  to magicians' incantations that have to be translated into the  Lithuanian language. During his visit to Lithuania, Estonian  Prime Minister M. Laar put it straight that the external threat  forced the Baltic states to unite. Lithuanian and Polish  politicians noted at their meeting in Warsaw that there was a  shadow of Russia's threat over both countries. It seems that  the establishment of facts is a professional prerogative of  historians. However, politicians have no foundation: The  security concept is nowhere to be seen, and no one knows what  the defense doctrine is like.... The negotiating delegation  [with Russia] was disbanded, and its experts were deemed not  politicians. The opposition engages in a passionate exposure of  the idleness and lack of competence in the ruling force. The  latter intimidates us with plotted coups and later explains that  participants of the press conference misunderstood it. Seimas  [parliament] deputies seem to have forgotten completely for what  they have been elected, because the state's security and its  positive development is not a priority to politicians who work  at home. The most important issues for them are their own  chairs and Seimas' internal problems while explaining political  colors rather than the present and future of politics.    It is absolutely clear that A. Kozyrev's refutations do not  mean changes in Russian policies. Russia will "defend" its  tribesmen, particularly in the Baltic states, and penetrate  toward "its interests," while we will dissipate incantations  alone. The Estonian legislature proposed that the president and  the government express their harsh protest to Russia. We  decided to take advantage of a historical precedent. When  Russia was trying to defeat the Tartars in the battle of  Kulikov, there were two warriors in the beginning -- Russians  and Tartars. We allowed two ministers -- A. Kozyrev and P.  Gylys -- to fight each other. Will the nations remember them  600 years later as well?    There is no evidence that the Russian foreign minister was  encouraged by the U.S. President who had promised to support his  country. However, was it not Bill Clinton who "induced" the  events in Estonia's Russian-speaking part, when talk about  citizenship and pensions emerged again. Was it not he who made  the head of the delegation for negotiations with Estonia "sick"  when the agreement on the deadline for the Russian Army  withdrawal had already been drafted? It is yet unclear what  unexpected events this might suggest to Lithuania. It would be  good not to miss them while trying to clarify the situation.</p>

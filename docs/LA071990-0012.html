			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEIR BEST SHOT  </P> <P> Outbreaks of measles across the country this year have brought much-needed  attention to the inadequacies of our nation's immunization efforts. I think  most people would be surprised to learn that more than one-quarter of American  preschoolers are not fully immunized against preventable diseases.  </P> <P> It is frightening, too, that in 1989 there was a more than 400% increase in the  number of measles cases.  </P> <P> Inadequate funding, public awareness and access to health care are compounding  the problem. In many states, funds for public clinics do not meet the needs.  Too many parents also are not aware of the necessity for early and regular  immunizations.  </P> <P> As a pediatrician and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, I believe  that immunizations are the single-most, cost-effective procedure to protect  against potentially life-threatening diseases. Efforts must be intensified to  increase the availability of immunization services and to ensure that all  children are vaccinated at the recommended ages -- especially preschool-age  children.It is shameful that a country as rich as ours does so poor a job  immunizing its children.  </P> <P> STEPHEN C. KOFFLER, MD  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Fyodorov attacks Russia's Dollars 1.5bn deal with IMF Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former Russian deputy prime minister in charge of finance, today launches an attack on the agreement reached last week by the International Monetary Fund to provide a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) loan to Russia. Mr Fyodorov, who resigned in January in protest at what he called 'the end of reform', writes in today's Financial Times that Russian policies will change 'in the wrong direction' once the loan is provided. 'Western taxpayers have a right to know to what end their money is being spent when they have problems of their own back home,' he says. 'The Dollars 1.5bn is immaterial to Russia given the scale of its problems and would be eaten up in a matter of minutes.' Mr Fyodorov, now a leading deputy in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said Russian and western experts who claim that Russia is 'special', and that therefore reforms must be introduced slowly, should try to live in Russia on a Russian salary for two years. He says that, before any money is paid, the budget should be passed through parliament and the government's record on low inflation established. 'There is no valid reason to hurry before being reasonably sure that this government's new virtue is real.' Mr Fyodorov's scepticism was supported by Mr Mikhail Sarafanov, director of the National Market Research Institute of the Ministry of Trade, a leading pro-free-trade think-tank. He suggests that the IMF loan was at least 75 per cent political and that there is no possibility the government can stay within the bounds of the budget. The loan, the second tranche of the Dollars 3bn 'systemic transformation facility', intended to aid the restructuring of the Russian economy, will be recommended by Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, if the government presents a list of laws and decrees to the parliament. The government must aim to increase budget income, while retaining expenditure at the present level. Mr Camdessus, who expected IMF approval by the end of April or the beginning of May, placed great store on the relationship of trust he developed in his five-day Moscow visit with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister. Mr Chernomyrdin's ministers, however, are already rebelling. Mr Alexander Shokhin, promoted last week to be deputy minister for the economy, said on Friday that a continued squeeze on credits would cripple the economy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, REPUBLIKA -- Taiwanese investors, who are  said to be leaving Indonesia due to various problems, are in  fact increasing their investment here. As of mid-May 1994,  Taiwan even surprisingly replaced Hong Kong, which had long been  ranked second in the list of foreign investors in Indonesia  since 1967.    As of mid-May 1994, Taiwanese investment in Indonesia  totaled  U.S. $8.68 billion, while Hong Kong's amounted to U.S. $7.17  billion. Up to last April, Taiwan ranked third with U.S. $5.25  billion worth of investment in 277 projects, while Hong Kong  ranked second with U.S. $5.98 billion worth of investment in 270  projects. Taiwan was ranked ninth five years ago.    Haji Ir. [academic title] Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of  state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment  Coordinating Board, told reporters following a coordinating  meeting on industrial and trade affairs on Saturday that the  situation proved that the rumors about Taiwanese investors  leaving the country were not true.    According to him, Japan remained in the top slot with U.S.  $17.37 billion worth of investment, representing about 23.2  percent of the total foreign investment from 1967 to 15 May  1994. Taiwan and Hong Kong ranked second and third  respectively. The United States ranked fourth with U.S. $6.99  billion worth of investment, Great Britain fifth with U.S. $6.95  billion, the Netherlands sixth with U.S. $6.06 billion,  Singapore seventh with U.S. $5.92 billion, South Korea eighth  with U.S. $3.76 billion, Australia ninth with U.S. $1.99  billion, and Germany tenth with U.S. $1.96 billion.    The Investment Coordinating Board approved 314 projects with  domestic investment totaling 22.75 trillion rupiah from January  to mid-May 1994, while only 156 projects with domestic  investment totaling 8.8 trillion rupiah were approved during the  same period in 1993. There was a 257.3-percent increase in  terms of the value.    The Investment Coordinating Board approved 131 foreign  investment projects worth U.S. $5.02 billion from January to  mid-May 1994, while only 85 foreign investment projects worth  U.S. $3.33 billion were approved during the same period in 1993.  There was a 150.6- percent increase in terms of the value.  Sanyoto was optimistic that the investment target during the  Sixth Five-year Development Plan will be met in view of the huge  increase in the amount of investment.    Although a new investment policy is yet to be issued to  replace Government Regulation No. 50/1993, there has been a  tendency toward more investment.    He hoped that the new policy will spur further investment.  Sanyoto pledged that a new regulation to replace Government  Regulation No. 50/1993 will be issued soon.    He said that the government will approve several large  projects in the next two months. "The interested investors have  already put forward the large projects, and we are considering  our approval," he said.    The large projects are power plants and oil refineries to be  built by Hong Kong and Arab investors respectively. "I am  optimistic that there will be more foreign investment projects  in 1994 than in 1993," he said.    Sanyoto admitted that the realization rates of foreign and  domestic investment projects remain low. The realization rate  of foreign investment projects is just 50.8 percent, while that  of domestic investment projects even is much lower.    During the coordinating meeting on industrial and trade  affairs that took place in Jakarta on Saturday, the coordinating  minister for industrial and trade affairs asked the minister of  state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment  Coordinating Board to monitor more accurately obstacles facing  investors that led to the very low realization rates. "This  should be studied to raise the realization rates," Sanyoto  quoted Hartarto as saying.</p>

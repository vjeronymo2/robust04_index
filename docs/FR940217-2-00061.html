			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _The extent to which the project gives special emphasis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the issues identified in the Special Concerns section of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The likelihood of success of the applicant's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies for promoting coordination and collaboration between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate centers providing different resource capacities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for funding will be accepted from States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredited schools of medicine. Applications which involve more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than a single State will also be accepted. In developing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed project, applicants must seek the participation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of local or regional trauma centers and other interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities within the State, such as local government and health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical organizations in the private sector. If the applicant is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a school of medicine, the application must be endorsed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State. The State's endorsement must acknowledge that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant has consulted with the State and that the State has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assured that the applicant will work with the State on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any State (or medical school within that State) may apply for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category or subcategory of grant, subject to the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations based on equitable geographic distribution of EMSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, differences in purpose among EMSC grant categories, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variation among States in EMSC program progress:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For Category (1) Planning Grants, States (or medical schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within those States) that have received prior EMSC implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants may not apply for planning grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For Category (2)(A) Implementation Grants, applications from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States (and medical schools within those States) that have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously received EMSC program funds, or that have received only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partial support under this program as part of a regional alliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will receive preference for funding in this subcategory. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means that approved applications from States (and medical schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within those States) with no or very limited prior EMSC program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support will be funded ahead of approved applications from outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For Category (2)(B) System Enhancement Grants, States (and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical schools within States) that have previously received EMSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds may apply for a system enhancement grant, as long as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not also be receiving implementation funds during the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of the systems enhancement grant. States that have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously received EMSC funds are advised to apply first for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation category funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For Category (3) Targeted Issues Grants, eligibility is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by receipt of other EMSC funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For Category (4) Resource Capacity Cooperative Agreements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility is not affected by receipt of other EMSC funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will not be considered for both Category (1) State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning Grants and Category (2)(A) Implementation Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously from the same State. Funding of an application for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a planning grant or for either subcategory of State Systems Grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bars a State from future competitions for that category or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory. Although funding of a Category (3) Targeted Issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grant does not preclude a State (or medical school) from applying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for other categories of EMSC funding, applicants should taken care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to avoid overlap in proposed project activities and associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal support for the separate categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Allowable Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MCHB may support reasonable and necessary costs of EMSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Demonstration Grant projects within the scope of approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects. Allowable costs may include salaries, equipment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies, travel, contracts, consultants, and others, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirect costs as negotiated and certified. The MCHB adheres to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative standards reflected in the Code of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations, 45 CFR part 92 and 45 CFR part 74.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He told TASS over the phone on Sunday these rumours were  heavily aggravating the already tense situation in the North  Caucasian republic, while petty political intrigues by various  groups and groupings claiming to be Chechen opposition hampered  the movement towards achieving national accord in society.    41-year-old Mamodayev is one of Dudayev's major political  opponents, who was accused by the Chechen prosecutor's office of  "high treason and attempted violent overthrow of the existing  regime."    But Mamodayev flatly rejects use of force in settling  political issues. "To avoid self-extermination of the Chechen  people, all its representatives, both those in power and those  in opposition, should immediately agree to the only possible way  of saving the republic: To step down simultaneously and call new  democratic elections," the opposition leader proposed. The  accord thus achieved might lay the foundation for building  Chechnya's relations with Russia, he believes.</p>

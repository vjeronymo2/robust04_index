			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Novi Sad, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- Industrial  production in Vojvodina increased by 39.8 percent in March  compared to February this year. A further increase is expected  in April, given that loans have been granted to revive  production, Todor Balos, member of the Vojvodina Economic  Chamber Board told TANJUG today. He said that industrial  production in the first three months of this year was at a  slightly lower level than in the same period last year, but the  March results, which were better than in February, as well as  the expected further increase in production, indicated that we  are on the path of reviving production in line with the  country's stabilization program.

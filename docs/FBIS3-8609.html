He was accompanied by Janusz  Bryczkowski, chairman of the Polish National Front.    "I am laying flowers on the soil where for centuries  Germans,  Poles, and Russians fought battles. Grunwald was a joint  Polish-Russian victory," Zhirinovskiy said, pointing out that  Smolensk battalions took part in the battle.    When asked by journalists to whom the former East Prussia  should belong, Zhirinovksiy said that "the borders were  determined 50 years ago as a result of blood shed by Polish and  Russian soldiers, and these territories belong to Poland."    Zhirinovskiy said that there is enough room "along the  Baltic  for everyone--the Germans, the Poles, and the Russians."    This morning, before his departure for Olsztyn province,  Zhirinovskiy took a walk in Warsaw's Lazienki Park and the  Castle Square. Together with Janusz Bryczkowski, he laid  flowers in front of the Warsaw Uprising monument.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Pit deaths blamed on lack of knowledge The Bilsthorpe colliery tragedy of August last year occurred because British Coal misunderstood or underestimated the effects of previous workings on the rock strata, a public inquiry has found. Three miners died at the Nottinghamshire mine after a fall of sandstone underground. The accident prompted a probe by the Health and Safety Executive, which then set up a public inquiry. The inquiry concentrated on the use of rock-bolting to hold up the roof. It called the general use of rock-bolting 'well-established and proven' but questioned the sole use of rock bolts at Bilsthorpe because the roadway where the accident took place ran alongside an old tunnel. There had been limited experience with bolting under those conditions. It called for the unions to co-operate with mining companies and the Health and Safety Executive in a National Committee on the Safety of Mines.</p>

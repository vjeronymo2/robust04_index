			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The Week Ahead: Diary Dates RESULTS DUE THE main interest in GEC's interims, due on Wednesday, will be not so much in the profits as the dividend. Last year's interim payment was held. But the final was raised by 5 per cent, despite unchanged earnings per share for the year. This time, profits are expected to be only modestly up, in the range Pounds 350-360m (Pounds 346m). But GEC is still accumulating cash at a ferocious rate. At the start of the year, net cash - including GEC's share in joint ventures - stood at Pounds 1.4bn. It is expected to reach Pounds 1.6bn by the year end. Lord Weinstock can certainly afford an increase. The question this can be ahead of earnings. Given encouraging news from Germany on the future of the European Fighter project, there is perhaps scope for generosity. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to have suffered its first-ever year on year fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its full-year results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen to around Pounds 1.24bn (Pounds 1.31bn). The fall is less than it might have been - Pounds 100m of exceptionals will be taken above the line in accordance with the new accounting rules. Allied-Lyons is expected to report first-half profits tomorrow of Pounds 280m (Pounds 276m), restated after adjustments. Most of the gain will come from spirits and wine, helped by cost-savings from restructuring of distribution in North America and resilient performances in Spain and Japan. Brewing and pub retailing has been under pressure from the UK recession and the disruption caused by the government's beer orders. Forecasts of full-year results from Bass on Wednesday range from Pounds 515m to Pounds 538m - between 20 per cent and 25 per cent up on last year's Pounds 430m. The figures will be affected by the levels of exceptional restructuring charges and property disposals. Trading profits are expected to be flat. Well-publicised trading difficulties for Grand Metropolitan's North American foods business will be reflected in a decline in full-year profits on Thursday from Pounds 950m to about Pounds 920m. IDV, the group's spirits division, is expected to record another solid advance in trading profits but lower earnings are forecast from the retailing sector, where an improvement in Burger King is unlikely to compensate for pressure on pubs. Trafalgar House, the construction, engineering and property group, reporting full-year results on Tuesday, is expected to announce that Pounds 90m of profits were wiped out by a big tax charge and Pounds 50m of writedowns on housing and commercial property. Last year's Pounds 122.4m pre-tax profits were reclassified after Pounds 102.7m of development properties were deducted, following an investigation by the Financial Reporting Review Panel.

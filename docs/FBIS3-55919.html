			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fourth article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F> Armed National Defense? (4)"]    [Excerpts] In the summer of 1992, the German military  offered four ships to Lithuania's national defense for half  price. Shortly thereafter, on 30 October, a commission of  Lithuanian experts arrived in Peenemunde at the invitation of  the German Defense Ministry to examine those ships and report  back with their conclusions to Commander E. Nazelskis, first  deputy national defense minister. The experts found those three  missile ships, as well as one torpedo detector, well preserved  and in a good technical state. Germany was ready to transfer  spare parts and equipment for the ships to our state. True, the  Germans warned our fellow countrymen that they would do this  only after the vessels' partial demilitarization, that is, after  removing all outwardly visible armaments. Lithuania had to  cover these expenses from its own pocket by paying 30,000 German  marks [DM] for each ship, or slightly less if they sent a group  of eight or 10 people for assistance. However, to acquire all  of those ships, as experts J. Alsauskas and V. Mockus indicated,  the Lithuanian Government had to send a document to its German  counterpart whereby the transfer of those ships would be gratis  and our government officials would pledge to use them only for  coastal defense and not sell or transfer them to a third party.  The Germans proposed that we take delivery of all the ships by  the end of 1992. Back on 19 November, [former] Defense Minister  A. Butkevicius sent a letter to Lithuanian leaders stating that  the Lithuanian Government must assign DM90,000 for dismantling  the three missile ships. Sending a letter to German Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe, former Prime Minister A. Abisala agreed  with the terms of the transfer and asked the German Defense  Ministry to act as a mediator in conducting the ships'  demilitarization at a German shipyard. According to unconfirmed  information received from officials, the government transferred  DM90,000 to the National Defense Ministry [KAM]. However,  neither last year, as the Germans had wished, nor as of this  very day have the ships donated by the German Defense Ministry  reached the coast of Lithuania, while military specialists in  neighboring Latvia took delivery of six ships donated by Germany.    Why did the leaders of Lithuania's national defense refuse  the ships donated to them for half price? Why did they at the  same time pay 417 million rubles in cash to V. Laurinavicius,  president of the "Selma" association in Kaunas, for two ships  received from the Russian Baltic Fleet? Some sources maintain  that it was more important to the former KAM and government  leaders to "launder" millions from the state's pocket to  "Selma," because the Baltic Fleet command did not want the  German ships to reach Lithuania. The interests of "Selma,"  headed by a three-time convicted person, and its supporters were  more significant to the KAM leaders for some reason. [passage  omitted]    When the ships were sailed from Kaliningrad to the wharf in  Klaipeda, V. Mockus, a senior officer of the Naval Department at  the Armed Forces Staff, noted in his official report to the  chief of staff that the Baltic Fleet frigates bought through  "Selma" had arrived without any spare parts. Nor were there any  secret technical documentation, inventory, fuel, lubricants,  facilities for emergency rescue, missiles on one frigate, and so  on. According to the preliminary agreement with the Baltic  Fleet command, all this was to be nowhere else but on the ships  sold to the Lithuanian National Defense Ministry. In the  opinion of Senior Officer V. Mockus, it is practically  impossible to use the ships without all these facilities and  armaments. The pumps had disappeared from the ships back in  Liepaja, and the water removal equipment had been taken away by  the Russians. As the specialists have noted, some vital valves  and fire faucets are rusted, they do not turn and are hopelessly  outdated. Hundreds of such flaws have been found on the  purchased ships.    The KAM leadership of that time was repeatedly informed  about  all this disorder. They also knew what items had failed to  reach Lithuania under the purchase agreement with the Russian  Baltic Fleet.    After RESPUBLIKA had published the first facts about the  former KAM deals with the Kaunas association "Selma," the  ministry began an official investigation. As Minister L.  Linkevicius has told journalists, it should help establish the  guilty parties and assess their actions. The new minister may  not know, however, that some direct offenders in this criminal  story -- former leaders of the ministry and its departments --  are acting behind the minister's back. They are forging  documents and intimidating those ministry employees who refuse  to claim that RESPUBLIKA is wrong. Undoubtedly, they will  continue to prove that Minister A. Butkevicius, his deputy E.  Nazelskis, his adviser I. Stankovicius, and C. Jezerskas are  linked with the bosses of the Kaunas Mafia only by "business"  relations. Prime Minister A. Slezevicius blessed the trip of  all these officials abroad, where they will study and undergo  training. After RESPUBLIKA had asked the prime minister whether  such an approval of their studies abroad did not represent a  "bonus," the premier replied: "Studying is a poor bonus."  Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas holds a different opinion  about the departure of these officers. He claims that they  themselves should be interested in establishing the truth and  untangling these complicated relations, rather than escaping to  the West at this crucial moment.    Yesterday afternoon, former Minister A. Butkevicius, who is  back on leave from London, found my colleague R. Grineviciute  and answered several questions. Mr. A. Butkevicius claimed that  the Baltic Fleet leaders themselves had proposed "Selma" as a  partner to them. The ex-minister maintained that he had not  known anything about the former conviction of the firm's  president, V. Laurinavicius, and had not been interested in his  past. He said that the German ships had turned out to be not  quite suitable because they did not have the necessary loading  capacity, and so on.    As is becoming clear today, the association "Selma" was  exempt from taxes. Such a decision was adopted by the  government headed by A. Abisala, who comes from Kaunas.  Although A. Paulauskas had protested about such a government  move, the decision was revoked neither by B. Lubys nor A.  Slezevicius.    Another thing is also surprising in this story. No one has  actually unraveled it. Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas has  agreed that a large group of investigators should work on this  case, because the public must know the truth. However, as soon  as a RESPUBLIKA reporter became curious about who had relieved  "Selma" from taxes and whether the Prosecutor General's Office  had issued a protest, R. Bimbiriene, deputy chief prosecutor of  the Civilian Cases and General Authority Department, stated that  she would not speak because she guarded state secrets carefully.  It does not matter that the Prosecutor General himself did not  see a big secret in the question of which of the former prime  ministers had made illegal decisions. If it is convenient to  them, officials may ignore the opinions and instructions of  their chiefs. R. Bimbiriene has allegedly noticed that  RESPUBLIKA is stepping up pressure on her. Well, this is how  things are sometimes....</p>

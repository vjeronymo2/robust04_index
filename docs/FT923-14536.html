			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Advisers' fees in Maxwell probe may be curtailed THE SCALE of fees paid by Maxwell pension funds to professional advisers has persuaded ministers that the unit led by Sir John Cuckney should be given a role in co-ordinating the efforts of the various Maxwell pension funds in recovering assets, in order to curtail their expenditure on fees to professional advisers. The unit's remit of helping to identify and remove areas of potential overlap was spelt out by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, in a meeting yesterday with Mr Frank Field and Mr Richard Page, co-chairmen of the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners. Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, has highlighted the fact that the Maxwell pensioners have paid Pounds 5m in fees - twice the amount set aside in the government's emergency arrangements to ensure that no fund has to stop making payments. He has called for the government to pay the fees itself. The MPs came away from the meeting reassured that the government would not cease the 'drip-feed' once the Pounds 2.5m runs out. Miss Ann Widdecombe, the junior social security minister, told MPs in a written answer that so far just under Pounds 300,000 had been paid to trustees of the Maxwell Communication Works Pension Scheme and of the Headington Pension Plan. Ms Majorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on the City, expressed anger that the trust fund for Maxwell pensioners has still not been set up four weeks after it was announced. In a separate written answer, Miss Widdecombe said the trust deed would be prepared once the terms of the trust had been agreed. There was pressure yesterday for ministers to consult the director of public prosecutions and the Serious Fraud Office on guidelines to avoid 'unnecessary humiliation' of potential defendants in high-profile cases. Concern follows last month's arrests of Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WILD ONES;  </P> <P> COACHELLA VALLEY'S LIVING DESERT SERVES AS OASIS OF PRESERVATION FOR MANY  SPECIES  </P> <P> In proposing desert nature reserves, we should think of small ones as well as  large ones. Small reserves to protect a particular landmark or other natural  feature can be very satisfying. But large ones are most to be sought, for  desert connotes vastness, great sweeps of land untouched by the often grimy  hand of man, who is given to taking over the land and cluttering it with his  "developments" of roads, subdivisions, etc.  </P> <P>  -- E. Jaeger, "The California Deserts," 1933  </P> <P> On your last visit to Palm Springs or Palm Desert, did you see more shops than  succulents, more condos than cacti? Are you looking for an escape from Fairway  Living and Rodeo Drive East?  </P> <P> Try the Living Desert, an oasis within the oasis. Here's your chance to see  Palm Springs wildlife, not to be confused with the Palm Springs wild life  that's enjoyed by the thousands of college students who party hearty during  spring break.  </P> <P> Situated in Coachella Valley's Palm Desert, just around the corner from golf  courses and neatly manicured subdivisions, the 1,200-acre Living Desert reserve  provides visitors with a superb introduction to desert plant life, land forms  and wildlife. It's a combination botanical garden hiking area and an accredited  zoo. The nonprofit facility is dedicated to conservation, education and  research.  </P> <P> The reserve's botanical gardens represent major desert regions, including  California's Mojave, Arizona's Sonoran and Mexico's Chihuahua. Among the  assortment of about 1,000 species of plants found here are smoke trees and  saguaros, palo verde and palms, brittle bush and barrel cactus. The reserve  maintains a well-stocked nursery, where visitors may purchase many native  plants.  </P> <P> Wildlife-watchers will enjoy observing animals rarely glimpsed in the wild.  Among the species housed here are coyotes in their burrows and bighorn sheep  perched on the rocky peaks of their enclosure. The walk-through aviary allows  up-close views of a number of desert birds, and a pond includes water-loving  species, including turtles, tortoises and the rare desert pupfish.  </P> <P> Other exotic species here are the endangered slender-horn gazelle and the  Arabian oryx, often referred to as "the unicorn of the desert."  </P> <P> The Living Desert is currently abuzz with the news that a breeding pair of  zebras was recently acquired and will soon be housed at the facility. Plans are  in the works for a 26,000-square-foot exhibit called Eagle Canyon, which will  spotlight threatened and endangered species, including the magnificent golden  Eagle. Officials expect it to be completed by 1992.  </P> <P> The reserve's animal adoptions program allows individuals or groups, such as  school classrooms, to donate funds for the care and feeding of species ranging  from beetles to bighorns. Stumped by what to get Uncle Harry for his next  birthday? Why not a year's care of a kit fox or screech owl?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Educational Programs  </P> <P> Children especially delight in the educational programs offered in the  Discovery Room, where they participate in a variety of hands-on activities.  Each year, the slide shows, guided tours, lectures and presentations provide a  comprehensive introduction to desert wonders to more than 10,000  schoolchildren.  </P> <P> But it's the grounds of the reserve and the trails that lead away from the  buildings that best capture the heart of the Living Desert. Here the reserve  becomes what the great desert naturalist Edmund Jaeger envisioned when he wrote  of the necessity for preserving representative sections of the California  desert.  </P> <P> Six miles of self-guided trails lead past about 60 interpretive stops. A  brittle bush-dotted flood plain and a desert wash with its moisture-loving  vegetation of smoke trees, desert willows and palo verde are among the desert  ecosystems that can be explored.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used by Indians  </P> <P> Many of the plants on display were of great use to the original inhabitants of  the Coachella Valley, the Cahuilla Indians.  </P> <P> The first part of the walk through the Living Desert uses a nature trail named  for Jaeger. Leaving the developed desert behind, a path heads up an alluvial  fan, past sand dunes and onto a plain that true desert rats call a bajada. Here  you'll find a quail guzzler, which stores rainwater to aid California's state  bird during the hot summer months. Trails also lead up toward the south slope  of Eisenhower Mountain, the 1,952-foot bald peak named for the former president  who was a part-time Palm Springs resident.  </P> <P> On the south slope of Ike's peak is a picnic area and a plaque describing the  region's date industry. The slope of Eisenhower Mountain, or any quiet place in  the reserve, is a good spot to contemplate the Coachella Valley, the future of  California's arid lands, the necessity of preserving our dry and empty places.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calendar of Events  </P> <P> In addition to its exhibits and educational programs, the Living Desert  maintains a full calendar of events, including art exhibits and field trips.  Newly reopened after its annual summer closure, the Living Desert promises  visitors a full day of activities focused on the intriguing world of the  desert.  </P> <P> Special activities are also planned. On Oct. 21, there will be the 10th annual  Concert on the Green, a fund-raising program featuring the Nelson Riddle  Orchestra, conducted by Chris Riddle. On Thanksgiving weekend, a special  program titled "Masters in Glass" will feature glass-blowing demonstrations and  the sale of fine glassware.  </P> <P> The Living Desert is at 47000 Portola Ave., Palm Desert 92260; phone (619)  346-5694. The reserve is open daily, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission for adults,  $5; children 6-15, $2; 5 and under, free. Seniors 62 and older pay $4.50.  </P> <P> Directions: From Highway 111 in Palm Desert, turn south on Portola Avenue and  drive 1 1/2 miles south to the park.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The United  Nations Security Council tonight called for "immediate  consultations" between the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on  necessary measures for discharging nuclear fuel rods.    In a statement by the president of the Security Council, the  Council "strongly urges" the DPRK only to proceed with the  discharge operations at its 5-megawatt reactor in a manner which  preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements as  required by the IAEA.    In a letter dated May 27 to the U.N. secretary-general, the  IAEA said if the discharge operation at the 5-megawatt reactor  continues at the same rate, the IAEA's opportunity to select,  segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements in  accordance with IAEA standards will be lost within days.    The Security Council said it is "gravely concerned" by the  IAEA's assessment.    The Security Council also asked the IAEA director-general to  maintain IAEA inspectors in the DPRK to monitor activities at  the 5-megawatt reactor.    During the Security Council consultation before the adoption  of the president's statement, China's Permanent Representative  to the U.N. Li Zhaoxing urged the IAEA and DPRK to make further  consultations on the technical measures for monitoring the  discharge of nuclear fuel rods and reach agreement as early as  possible so as to ensure the continuation of nuclear safeguard  monitoring.    Li reiterated China's view that the final way to solve this  nuclear issue is by dialogues and negotiations between the  related parties through channels that have been established, and  all efforts by the international community should contribute to  this goal.</p>

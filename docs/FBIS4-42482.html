			<p>BFN     [Text] The steering committee of the Qualification  Commission, set up after the failure of the European Ariane  rocket in January, has given the go-ahead to the resumption of  flights and confirmed the launch of an Ariane rocket on  Saturday, 4 June. After a four-month interruption, the 64th  Ariane is scheduled for launch this Saturday at 0402 (0902 Paris  time [0702 GMT]) from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou. It  will carry three satellites: Intelsat- 702, the second of the  Intelsat-VII series of the international communications  satellite organization Intelsat, and two scientific  microsatellites of the British Defense Ministry, the STRV-1A and  STRV-1B. As a result of the 24 January Ariane failure, which  was caused by a problem in the turbopump which has now been  solved, two telecommunications satellites were lost: Turksat-1A  and Eutelsat-II-F5.</p>

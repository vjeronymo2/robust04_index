			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Queen's decision on Smith talks THE QUEEN wants to meet Mr John Smith, leader of the opposition, on a more regular basis, Buckingham Palace said last night. 'In recent years there has been more contact with the leader of the opposition,' a palace official said. 'The intention now is to make those meetings regular, although not part of any formal policy or pattern.' The prime minister traditionally has private talks with the Queen at the palace on Tuesdays.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 11 (XINHUA) -- A procurator today  asked the court to severely punish, according to law, the three  men accused of the murder of 32 people in the March 31 Qiandao  Lake tragedy.    Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun are accused of robbery and  murder in the boat-fire tragedy which claimed the lives of 24  Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, in  east China's Zhejiang Province.    On the second day of their trial before the Hangzhou City  Intermediate Court today, the procurator from the Hangzhou City  People's Procuratorate repeated that the three accused jointly  committed a crime "very serious and harmful" to society.    In their own defence, the three accused men all confessed  their guilt, but expressed repentance for committing such a  heinous crime.    Wu Lihong said: "I committed the crime for the sake of  money. Now, all I can do is to say sorry to the victims and  their families."    The accused men's three defence lawyers did not raise  objections to the facts or nature of the crimes committed, but  expressed the hope that the court would punish the defendants  leniently because they had all three confessed their guilt and  had shown repentance.    The intermediate court announced that it would pronounce its  judgment on the case tomorrow morning.</p>

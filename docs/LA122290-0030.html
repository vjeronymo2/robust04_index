			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TEST OF TIME  </P> <P> Re David J. Fox's article on the mixed reaction to "Godfather III" at its first  industry screening (Dec. 14):  </P> <P> I for one can't wait to see the film.  </P> <P> I'm sure not everyone remembers this, but the reactions to three of the  greatest films of the 1960s -- "Bonnie and Clyde," "2001" and "The Wild Bunch"  -- were decidedly mixed. People either hated them or loved them; there was no  middle ground. But with the passage of time all three are now considered  classics.  </P> <P> STEVE BARR  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

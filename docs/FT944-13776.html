			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Sprint in deal with US cable companies The race to create alliances in US telecommunications quickened yesterday with the announcement of a partnership between Sprint, the third largest US long-distance phone company, and three leading US cable companies. The partnership will aim to provide local, long-distance and mobile telephony, and multi-media entertainment and information services. 'We will revolutionise what comes in over your telephone, your cable TV and your computer,' said Mr William Esrey, Sprint chairman. Sprint is to link with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable company, Comcast, the fourth largest, and Cox Cable Communications, the sixth largest. The partners, which claim their cable networks run past one third of US homes, said they would seek to affiliate with other cable companies in areas where they were not represented. All phone services would go under the Sprint brand name. The new venture will bid for personal communication service licences in the government auction this December. The auction, which it is thought may raise more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn), has prompted other bidding alliances such as that announced last week by the regional telephone companies Bell Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch. The Sprint partners refused to give details on the scale of the investment. Mr James Kennedy, chairman of Cox, said the investment was not a lot of money given the venture's scope. Sprint will own 40 per cent of the venture, TCI 30 per cent and the other two 15 per cent each. The alliance is also a response to the recent merger of AT&amp;T and McCaw, respectively the biggest long-distance and mobile phone companies in the US. Unlike that merger, it has to overcome the rules against cable companies competing in local phone services. Mr Brian Roberts, Comcast president, said: 'The timing (of the venture) depends on how well our government acts to put the essential rules in place.' Legislation to allow cable and local phone companies to compete in each others' markets collapsed last month in Congress. Mr Esrey said: 'We feel optimistic that we will get national legislation this year, or if not, the year after.' Lex, Page 24</p>

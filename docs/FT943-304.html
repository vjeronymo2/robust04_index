			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Nato pledges tougher use of air power in Bosnia Nato defence ministers pledged yesterday to make more effective use of alliance airpower in the skies over Bosnia. But they also agreed, at the insistence of Nato's European members, that the UN must retain its veto over any hardening of tactics by the Atlantic alliance. An informal meeting of Nato defence ministers, attended for the first time since 1966 by France, heard calls from Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, for much tougher action against Bosnian Serbs. He told his colleagues Nato's political credibility had been damaged by the fact that five aircraft were apparently needed to destroy one tank near Sarajevo last week. In a spirited exchange, the European allies agreed there was room for some stiffening of Nato's stance but insisted that British and French generals on the ground should retain the last word. Diplomats said France showed slightly more sympathy than Britain for the US position that an immediate toughening of tactics was necessary. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the use of airpower so far had been more symbolic than substantial and said Nato could 'go a bit further'. He called for a more vigorous response to 'unacceptable behaviour' such as firing on UN aid convoys or relief flights. Mr Leotard said he was sure Bosnian Serb behaviour in recent weeks reflected a systematic strategy to reimpose their grip on Sarajevo, rather than unrelated incidents. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence minister, said it was still an open question whether recent violence amounted to a conscious strategy. While Britain and France both stressed the need to consult UN commanders on the ground, diplomats said, Mr Rifkind put more emphasis on this than his French colleague. Supporters of the Bosnian government have been complaining that Nato's air raids so far have been little more than pinpricks. Senior officials in Russia's arms exporting enterprise have criticised the US for 'discrediting' Russian weapons in international arms markets and forecast a continuing rise in arms sales, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. At the same time, a foreign office official told the news agency Interfax there was 'no reason to break military relations with Iran'. The comments came after Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton disagreed on arms sales to Iran.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Asian bank offering priced to ensure smooth launch The recent volatility in financial markets prompted the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to give up a few basis points to ensure a smooth launch for its first global bond offering yesterday. Although the Dollars 750m, 10-year issue was priced to yield 18 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 18 to 20 basis points, this was slightly above some market expectations of a yield spread of 16 basis points. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly, according to joint lead manager Salomon Brothers. Other banks involved in the deal said the strongest bid for the bonds was from Asia. Mr Peter Balon, the ADB's senior treasury officer, said the offering was oversubscribed and that the pricing reflected his desire to see some performance in the bonds. The liquidity and the current coupon, as well as the narrow bid-offer spread, also offered investors an alternative to US Treasuries, he said. Yesterday's offering, which accounts for one-quarter of the ADB's Dollars 2.8bn borrowing programme for fiscal 1994, marks a shift in the bank's funding strategy. Mr Balon said the ADB planned to make at least one global bond offering a year and he noted that yesterday's deal showed that global bond offerings could be done successfully for Dollars 750m. The market has so far regarded Dollars 1bn as the minimum size for a successful global bond offering. Mr Balon said the ADB's next large bond issue would be denominated in yen but that it also planned some Eurobond transactions and issues in the local Asian markets, including an offering in Taiwanese dollars. The two other notable deals of the day were from corporate issuers. TransAtlantic Holdings, the life assurance and property group which reported its 1993 results yesterday, raised Pounds 250m through an offering of 15-year convertible bonds. An official at lead manager UBS said although the conversion premium on the bonds of 12 per cent was below average, the coupon of 5 1/2 per cent was the lowest to date on conventional Eurosterling convertible bonds. He added that the recent rise in UK government bond yields might prompt more companies to tap the convertible bond market before long. Eridania Beghin-Say, the sugar subsidiary of Ferruzzi Finanziaria of Italy, launched a FFr1.5bn issue of eight-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which were priced to yield 72 basis points over the interpolated yield curve for French government bonds, appealed to investors, mainly French institutions, who were familiar with the name and who were aware of the problems facing the issuer's parent. Elsewhere, Nafinsa of Mexico became the first Latin American borrower to tap the dragon bond market. Its Dollars 250m offering of five-year floating-rate notes had a discounted margin of 102.7 basis points over Libor. Ispat, a Mexican steel company, is due to raise Dollars 175m through an offering of seven-year Eurobonds today, via CS First Boston.</p>

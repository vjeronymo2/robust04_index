			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARBARA BUSH ON ELEANOR ROOSEVELT  </P> <P> In an article on Barbara Bush (Part I, Jan. 15), Times staff writer Betty  Cuniberti (who seems to be completely bowled over by Barb) quotes our new First  Lady as saying, "I grew up in a household that detested her" (Eleanor  Roosevelt). She then went on to discuss literacy, homelessness, working  mothers, etc. These were all causes Mrs. Roosevelt took a personal, active  interest in, went out and saw for herself what conditions were in those  difficult days, and tried to use her influence to help. The abuse that was  heaped upon her by the likes of Mrs. Bush's family and other privileged society  folk has no comparison in modern history.  </P> <P> Eleanor Roosevelt still stands as a shining light for so many people. She  worked unceasingly and did not depend on high-priced ad men to chronicle her  good deeds. May we all take a lesson from her selflessness and modesty! All the  "thousand points of light" of this immorally expensive inaugural are but faint  beams from mean-spirited, greedy men and women in comparison to Eleanor  Roosevelt.  </P> <P> HELENA M. BRAWLEY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

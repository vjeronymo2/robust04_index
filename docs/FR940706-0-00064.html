			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA is amending &sect;393.102(b) to require that the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies used to secure an article against movement in any direction be at least 1/2 the weight of the article secured. Steel strapping, chain, synthetic webbing, wire rope, and cordage used must meet certain manufacturing or performance standards which are incorporated by reference. The incorporation of these standards is intended to specify minimum requirements for tiedowns and not to restrict the use of tiedowns which exceed the criteria contained therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 393.7, which was proposed in its entirety in the NPRM, was created by the final rule entitled ``Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Warning Devices for Stopped Vehicles'' (RIN 2125&hyph;AD17; FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;19), which is published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The FHWA is amending &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language of incorporation required by 1 CFR 51 and to provide information on the availability of the incorporated documents. After a review of the responses to the September 17, 1993, NPRM and a determination that the incorporation by reference was necessary for the final rule, the FHWA submitted the documents listed in &sect;393.102(b)(1) to (b)(5) to the Director of the Federal Register for approval in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 51.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule does not require tiedowns to be marked or labeled. However, manufacturers of tiedowns and associated equipment are encouraged to provide motor carriers and enforcement officials with a means to easily determine the working load limits of their products. For those cases in which the tiedown manufacturing standards (incorporated by reference into the final rule) include guidelines for marking and labeling, adherence to those guidelines is encouraged, but is not mandated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 393.102(b) is amended to include a table of working load limits for common types and sizes of tiedown devices. The working load limits listed in the table are to be used when the tiedown material is not marked by the manufacturer with the working load limit. Tiedown materials marked by the manufacturer with working load limits which differ from the table, shall be considered to have a working load limit equal to the value for which they are marked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the working load limits for cordage, the table lists values for manila, polypropylene, polyester, and nylon cordage. For those cases in which the a synthetic rope does not have a manufacturers' marking or label to enable motor carriers and enforcement officials to distinguish between polypropylene, polyester fiber ropes, polyester/polypropylene composite rope, or nylon rope, the working load limits of polypropylene fiber rope shall be used. Since polypropylene fiber rope generally has a lower working load limit than polyester and nylon ropes, this provision is important to ensure safety. The agency notes that the working load limits for nylon rope are based on the specific design factors in the nylon rope specifications, NRS&hyph;1 and C1. These design factors are between 9 and 12 for three- and eight-strand standard construction nylon rope and between 7 and 11 for double braided nylon rope. As a result, the working load limits shown in &sect;393.102 for certain sizes of nylon rope are lower than that for polypropylene fiber rope. Considering the Cordage Institute's recommendation for a design factor of 6 for polypropylene fiber rope and polyester rope, the FHWA believes that the use of polypropylene fiber rope working load limits is appropriate in those cases in which the rope cannot be identified as nylon. The table of working load limits does not include information on polyester/polypropylene composite rope because the working load limit values are generally very close, if not identical, to those of polypropylene fiber rope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of steel strapping, wire rope, and cordage, the final rule includes a procedure for calculating the working load limits. The published industry standards for these materials use breaking strengths, nominal strengths, and working load limit ranges respectively. To ensure consistency in calculating the working load limits and an appropriate safety margin in determining the number of tiedown devices required, these procedures must be used when the working load limit is not provided by the manufacturer or when the manufacturer provides working load limit ranges for cargo securement applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

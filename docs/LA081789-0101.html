			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> DUARTE RETURNS AID FUNDS  </P> <P> El Salvador's former president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, has returned $113,200 to  the nation's treasury that the Finance Ministry contends was money intended to  aid victims of a 1986 earthquake, according to a top-ranking member of the  Christian Democratic Party, of which Duarte was a member. "Indeed, the former  president deposited that sum in the nation's treasury, through his attorney  Pablo Mauricio Alvergue," said Eduardo Colindres. The government-run daily  newspaper El Diario de Hoy confirmed the repayment. On July 7, the Finance  Ministry filed a legal demand against Duarte, saying he embezzled the money.  </P></p>

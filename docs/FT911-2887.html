			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: A plastic Bard is of sounder note Sir, Although The Prince of Wales may regret the decision of the Bank of England to remove Shakespeare from its Pounds 20 notes, he may have overlooked the noble Bard's well-established presence on our plastic money: our cheque guarantee cards. Fifty-three UK building societies issue these cards and the Bard appears on all 40m of these pieces of plastic. In 1990 Bard Cards were used to guarantee over 3m purchases every day of the year. Every retail assistant will know him well] Richard Tyson-Davies, head of public affairs, Association for Payment Clearing Services, Mercury House, Triton Court, 14 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1BR</p>

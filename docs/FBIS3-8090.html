			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Podgorica, 4 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president  of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), denied in today's POBJEDA  that the downed planes had taken off from RSK territory.    "It is out of the question that our planes from Udbine were  flying over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Srpska  republic. Our own airspace is sufficient for us, and we have no  need for any Air Force activities over those areas."    "We do not want to interfere in the fighting between our  brothers from the Srpska republic and the Muslims, knowing that  our brothers have enough strength and knowledge to resist the  Muslims, who, particularly in recent days, have abused all  cease-fires for new armed actions against the Serbs," Martic  said.    He said that the misinformation about the RSK military  activities over the former Bosnia-Herzegovina had originated  from BORBA.</p>

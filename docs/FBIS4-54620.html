			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] According to Arkan  [commander of the Serbian Volunteer Guard], there is no room in  Kosova either for those who deserted the Yugoslav Army. Arkan  hailed "The construction of the refugee camps on the border  between Albania and Kosova," adding that his party will soon  start an initiative related to the restitution of 7,300 hectares  of fertile land which according to Arkan is in the hands of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    Some days ago, the BUJKU newspaper wrote that paramilitary  troops of Arkan and his spokesman Borsiwav Televic [name as  received] stayed in Dragash in the border zone with Albania  where they provoked some citizens.    A report from the Information Centre of Kosova said that  Serbian military forces and paramilitary troops have been  concentrated on the border zone of Kosova with Albania.    A report of the Information Centre of the Democratic League  [of Kosova -- LDK] branch in Gjakova on April 30 said that tanks  of the Serbian Army directed to Albania and Gjakova have been  planted in the vicinity of the border with Albania, in the  village Zhup of Gjakova.</p>

Mayor Li said that the city was still facing some problems  despite the good results achieved last year. The outstanding  problem was the grim public order situation with an increase in  serious criminal cases. The management level over the city was  not commensurate with the economic development there and this  resulted in frequent big accidents. There were arduous tasks to  be done in ensuring safety in the workplace and in protecting  workers' legal interests and rights. The high inflation rate  had affected the residents' lives and the industrial structure  was not reasonable and needed to be adjusted while the pace of  the transferring of government functions, macro-control and  administration were not able to meet the demands of development  of a market economy. All these problems, he added, would be  solved this year.</p>

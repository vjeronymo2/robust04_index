			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Citicorp to make new loans to Brazil CITICORP, Brazil's largest foreign bank creditor, will make substantial new loans to Brazil under the debt restructuring package now before international banks. Under the accord, agreed late last year, banks can choose between six options, most of which involve exchanging old loans for concessional bonds, but one of which allowed banks to make new loans of Dollars 100 for every Dollars 550 of existing exposure. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, said that the bank would convert some of its exposure into concessional bonds, but that 'the largest single commitment would be to new money'. US regulators had no objection to Citibank taking this position. Citibank has so far profited from a policy of lending new money where possible in so-called Brady debt restructurings, and has opted to do so in Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay and the Philippines. The secondary market prices of the debt have risen considerably in most cases since the agreements went into effect. However, the Brazilian package is regarded as more uncertain than most of the preceding debt agreements, in part because as yet there is no agreement between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund, and most banks are not seen as likely to provide new funds.</p>

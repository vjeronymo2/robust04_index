			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: A Cave full of treasures The Cave is Steve Reich and Beryl Korot's ambitious, technologically dazzling, theatre piece: three hours of music, video images and computer graphics which gnaw away at our received definitions of what theatre, opera or music theatre ought to be. It received its first performance a month ago in Vienna, moved on to Berlin and then for the first week of the Holland Festival to Amsterdam, where it was presented in the wonderfully flexible space of the Goederenbeurszaal in the old stock exchange building. In August it moves to London for a season at the Royal Festival Hall. The Cave is an exploration of Reich and Korot's Jewish heritage, or more precisely the way in which part of that heritage, the story of Abraham and Sarah and their sons Isaac and Ishmael, is retained and shared in the memories of present-day Israelis, Palestinians and New Yorkers. The basis of each of the three acts is a set of video interviews with prominent citizens in West and East Jerusalem, and in New York; the images and the speech provide the starting point for both Reich's music and Korot's visual collages, as details of both are taken up and used as the jumping-off points for detailed development. Both sets of processes are fascinatingly worked out, and neatly complementary; as the talking heads are projected on to one or more of the five video screens that dominate the 'set' for The Cave, decorative details from the images may be shown alongside them or computer-generated texts reeled off in parallel in French, German, English or Arabic. Meanwhile the performers - four singers and the 13 instrumentalists of the Steve Reich Ensemble (conducted by Paul Hillier) - take up words, phrases, speech rhythms or pitch collections from the video voices and weave around them commentary and accompaniment. The music produced is characteristic of recent Reich: Different Trains, the string quartet he wrote for the Kronos Quartet and which also used archive interviews, is the most obvious point of reference. The score is muscular, intricately worked, carefully judged. Each of the first two acts kicks off from the respective Jewish and Islamic responses to a set of questions that begins with 'Who is Abraham?' and 'Who is Sarah?'. 'Abraham for me is my ancestor' offers the first interviewee; 'Ibrahim was neither Jew nor Christian, but a Muslim' asserts a Palestinian in the second act. Both sets of responses are underpinned by the sound of the string quartet, though when in both codas the focus changes and the screens offer a travelogue showing Jerusalem and Hebron today, keyboards begin to colour the sound world. The third act is altogether tighter and more colourful as the American responses set up all kinds of allusions - 'Abraham Lincoln High School, high on the hill midst sand and sea, that's as far's I trace Abraham', admits Richard Serra. The whole ensemble is brought in, and the musical climax is reached with a retelling of the story of Abraham and Isaac, when the music darkens and becomes overtly expressive. The ending is abrupt, matter of fact. Reich and Korot have invented a richly woven tapestry, novel in its presentation, delicately balanced in the issues it raises. There are no overt political messages, but the historical undertow is inevitable in the first two acts - 'The Cave' of the title is the place in which Abraham and the patriarchs are reputed to be buried; it is now the site of a mosque. And the sense of the US as hermetically sealed, cut off from that bundle of racial and religious issues half way across the world, is tellingly conveyed in the third. The third act, indeed, just over half an hour long, is a bracing and thrilling creation, fast-paced and full of wonderful visual and musical invention. The first two acts, though, are too long, especially the opening one, which takes 65 minutes to lay down the biblical background, and set up the compositional techniques. With insufficient contrast of approach between Acts 1 and 2, only (only]) the change of religious emphasis, the cumulative musical impression is too diffuse; the audience has cottoned on to the use of the video images and the computer keyboards rapping out text. Yet so much about the concept of The Cave is thoughtful and fresh that one almost forgives its longueurs. Reich has sought out a genuinely new synthesis of sound and image. By the third act he and Korot are making it work, and that final half an hour more than justifies his faith and the audience's patience. Performances of The Cave at the Royal Festival Hall, London run from August 18 to 23.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ROCK CLIMBING NEW YORK INDOOR SPORT  </P> <P> The handful of rock climbers who insist on pursuing their obscure sport amid  the skyscrapers of Manhattan have decided to do something about the acute  shortage of cliffs: They've built an indoor climbing wall.  </P> <P> Clambering across a plywood crag may lack the visceral thrills of scaling a  300-foot cliff in Upstate New York or a soaring spire in the Rockies. But the  fake wall that opened last month offers climbers a chance to practice most of  the basic rock moves.  </P> <P> And more important, it's close to home.  </P> <P> "It's great," said Pierre Vaz, one of about 60 climbers who turned out for  opening festivities. "This is a perfect time for it to open, because it's  starting to get nippy outside."  </P> <P> The wall, in a little-used city recreation center on West 59th Street not far  from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, occupies one end of an old  paddle-ball court.  </P> <P> Sheets of three-quarter-inch plywood are bolted to the 20-foot-high wall in  replicas of the shapes climbers seek in nature: an overhanging cliff face; a  narrow chimney; knife-edged arete, or buttress; a two-foot roof jutting out  horizontally.  </P> <P> Bolted to the wall are knobby holds cast of sand and plastic resin in a variety  of shapes, from easily grasped "buckets" to pockets just big enough to grasp  with one finger, to narrow, sloping edges that offer minimum purchase for  fingertips or toes.  </P> <P> Protected by safety ropes, climbers puzzle out routes to the top, or move  delicately from one side of the wall to the other in that vertical ballet  mountaineers call traversing.  </P> <P> Installing the wall was more a political feat than a technical one.  </P> <P> About 18 months ago, climbers who keep their skills sharp by working out on  boulders in Central Park found the rangers seemed to be making a special effort  to chase them away. Normally a disorganized lot, they formed a loose alliance  called the City Climbers Club of New York to lobby park officials to call off  the troops.  </P> <P> Organizer Ralph Erenzo says he was pleasantly surprised to find city officials  receptive to the new club's overtures.  </P> <P> They quickly agreed to call off the rangers if the climbers would agree to  avoid a few well-traveled spots.  </P> <P> Then, when the climbers mentioned they were worried about twisting their ankles  on rocks sticking out of the ground at the base of their favorite 20-foot  cliff, "Rat Rock," the city sent in a backhoe to clear the ground and laid in a  layer of shock-absorbing wood chips.  </P> <P> "The club gave us credibility," said Erenzo, 38, who has a business designing  and building exhibits for trade shows. "It showed them we weren't a bunch of  yahoos."  </P> <P> It turned out that Erenzo's contact in the park hierarchy was eager to  encourage off-beat sports. William Castro, the Parks &amp; Recreation  Department's assistant commissioner for recreation, already had helped organize  Frisbee championships, skateboard contests and BMX bicycle exhibitions.  </P> <P> And Castro had dabbled with climbing in an Outward Bound-style  confidence-building program the city offers for teen-agers.  </P> <P> "There's a thrill from it that I don't think you get in many organized sports  -- you're challenging yourself and seeing what you're made of," Castro said.  "It's a real test of the individual."  </P> <P> When Erenzo started talking about artificial walls, the city's biggest worry  was the risk of someone's falling and filing a lawsuit.  </P> <P> In several months of lobbying, Erenzo showed Castro that artificial climbing  walls are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated in Europe, and are  slowly coming to this country. The best known is at Snowbird, Utah, where a  huge fiberglass scarp was the site of the International Sport Climbing  Championships in August.  </P> <P> Erenzo, who has been climbing for a decade and helped judge the Snowbird  contest, worked to persuade city officials that his sport is safe if pursued  responsibly. The climbers demonstrated how they hang a rope from the top of a  practice cliff, so a partner can catch a climber who slips from the rock within  a foot or two.  </P> <P> After a slide show by leading French wall designer Jean Marc Blanche, Castro  decided to give the idea a try, and offered the sky-lit paddle-ball court in  the under-used recreation center.  </P> <P> Everyone involved realizes the wall isn't accident-proof, but they've developed  a system to lessen the legal risk.  </P></p>

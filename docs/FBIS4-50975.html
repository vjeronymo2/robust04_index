			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tan Hongkai: "Government To Imprison Copyright </F> Buccaneers"]    [Text] The government plans to jail copyright pirates,  Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said yesterday in Beijing.    "Criminal sanctions must be imposed on those who commit  intellectual property right offences to safeguard the integrity  of ideas and the dignity of law," he told the International  Symposium on Intellectual Property Protection.    Currently only civil procedures are available for copyright  infringements. Criminal sanctions are reserved for trademark  violators.    Chinese lawmakers are also pushing through legislation on  border controls where intellectual property rights are violated,  according to Xiao.    "Customs will play a bigger role in intellectual property  protection through prohibiting import and export of the relevant  commodities," he said.    The government moves will guarantee implementation of the  National Commitments outlined by the Paris Convention on  Protection of Industrial Intellectual Property and the Berne  Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Xiao  said.    Patent protection has been extended to cover chemicals,  medicines, food, beverages and condiments in China. And company  logos now enjoy the protection previously offered trademarks.    Lawmakers are still debating how best to legislate for  biological patents. But the government has promised to write  flora and fauna into the law within two or three years,  according to Ma Lianyuan, vice director of the State Patent  Office.    The moves are an important step in China's efforts to  internationalize its patent system. Ma said.    Liu Jiyang, chief secretary of the China Intellectual  Property Society, revealed that the National People's Congress  was considering legislating against compact disc piracy and  trademark counterfeiting.    Calling the country's trademark protection "comprehensive  and  effective," Li Bida, Vice Director of the Trademark Bureau under  the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), urged  foreign trademark owners to learn more about Chinese laws to  avoid wasting time.    Ignorance of the law can unnecessarily prolong the suffering  of foreigners, when they find their trademarks have been abused  and they want help from the Chinese authorities, he said.    Foreign trademark owners should go to SAIC authorized  departments to file their complaints, he said.    He also advised foreigners to pay more attention to the  "roots" of trademark infringements.    "Although some offences take place in China, they do not  necessarily originate here," he pointed out. "Trademark owners  should track down the culprits by following the clues to find  out those behind the scenes."    Many cases of foreign trademark infringement are actually  committed by foreigners, he asserted.    "Protection of registered trademarks is an international  problem it demands common action by the world as a whole," he  said. "Mutual reproach is of no benefit."    The two-day international symposium attracted 130 experts,  lawyers and business people from China Australia, Britain,  France, Germany Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the  United States, as well as from Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Money Markets: German repo tight GERMANY was the focus of European money market operations yesterday. The Bundesbank kept its interbank lending on a tight leash and reinforced the widespread belief that it will not cut key interest rates at today's council meeting, writes Peter John. The main elements of the German repo that exercise the minds of economists are whether the 14-day rate is fixed or variable, what level it is set at and how much is allocated. All three factors disappointed rate cut apologists yesterday. The central bank allocated DM66.3bn at a fixed rate of 6.7 per cent over two weeks and DM14.8bn and at a variable rate no lower than 6.71 per cent over 35 days. The 6.7 per cent level has remained the same for the past five weekly repos and and economists estimated that the Bundesbank drained around DM1.7bn from the system while the banks were looking for an injection of some DM5bn to relieve the tight monetary conditions of recent days. The unwillingness to meet bank demands ensured that call money remained between 6.8 per cent and 6.95 per cent. In spite of conciliatory comments on interest rates from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the new head of the Bundesbank, most analysts remained convinced that an imminent reduction in the discount rate, which sets the floor for German lending, was unlikely. In the UK, short sterling barely moved with the contract for December closing unchanged at 94.34 on turnover of just over 10,000 lots, a volume described by one dealer as 'pitiful'. However, the spread between the December and March contract has widened to 20 basis points underlining the enduring faith in lower interest rates. Bank of England operations proceeded effortlessly in spite of a much larger than average liquidity shortage. The forecast shortage of Pounds 1.85bn was principally absorbed when the central bank bought Pounds 1.7bn of bills from the market at a rate of 5 29/32 per cent bills repayable in equal amounts on October 25, 26 and 27. The Bank also announced a one-week special roll-over rate at 5 5/8 per cent and set a roll-over rate of 5 7/8 per cent for the duration which is being extended to November 3 from October 6. The facility was introduced last September to reduce pressure in the money market after sterling's exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p>

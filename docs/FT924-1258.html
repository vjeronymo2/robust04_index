			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Delta cuts its dividend to 5 cents a share DELTA Air Lines, one of the three largest US carriers, is cutting its quarterly dividend from 30 cents a share to just 5 cents, in an attempt to ride out difficult conditions in the industry and the problematic integration of transatlantic assets it acquired from the now-defunct Pan Am. Delta also announced another big cost-cutting package, involving a Dollars 600m reduction in spending on facilities and ground equipment over the next three years, deferrals of another Dollars 400m of aircraft orders over the same period, and salary reductions aimed at saving around Dollars 180m a year. Earlier this year, Delta announced that it was slashing about Dollars 5bn from its capital spending up until 2001, and implementing a 'profit improvement plan' designed to prune Dollars 375m from operating costs in the current financial year. The airline has shed around 5,000 jobs over the past 12 months. The company, which has virtually doubled in size during the past five years and has become a significant international airline via the Pan Am deal in late-1991, said it was trying to avoid lay-offs among permanent employees. Atlanta-based Delta has long been famed for its paternalistic approach to employee relations. The carrier has talked enthusiastically about the 'Delta family' and prided itself on a no-redundancy policy. Mr Ron Allen, chairman, acknowledged that the salary reductions, which involve a 5 per cent pay cut for all non-contract staff, was the first company-wide pay reduction in the airline's history. Delta gave no details of the aircraft order deferrals, but it has 162 aircraft on firm order and 259 on option. Most of these are Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft, and a spokesman said that orders for nine Airbus Industrie A-310 aircraft, due in 1993, were expected to go ahead.</p>

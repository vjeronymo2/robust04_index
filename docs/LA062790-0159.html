			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROUGHED UP BY POLICE, SOCCER FANS SAY  </P> <P> Less than 24 hours after the worst incident involving English fans and Italian  police during the World Cup, many of the 246 people sent home were claiming  they were treated cruelly.  </P> <P> One English fan, Bub Foreman, 27, said after arriving at Gatwick Airport on an  airliner chartered by the Italian government to bring the expelled fans back to  London that, "Three-quarters of the people on the plane were innocent and had  nothing to do with any fighting.  </P> <P> "I was just sitting in a bar when the trouble started and police piled in. They  arrested anyone who spoke English, whether they had anything to do with the  trouble or not. The police pushed us around and were very aggressive for no  reason."  </P> <P> The fans arrived late Tuesday night and were rushed onto a train to London  without incident. A few had strong words about the way they were dealt with by  the police in Rimini, where fighting between several hundred English and  Italian fans led to rioting Monday night.  </P> <P> "The people who started the fighting just disappeared before the police arrived  and they rushed in and arrested anybody who was standing there," said Darren  Gambia, another fan expelled from Italy.  </P> <P> Added another fan, Michael Vincent, "When we were arrested we were held in a  garage and treated very roughly. . . . We were punched and kicked by the police  for no reason. I have never known anything like it and will never go back to  Italy again.  </P> <P> "Even on the plane (to Gatwick) they treated us like animals. We got one glass  of water and were told to keep looking ahead and not to turn around to talk to  anybody. Otherwise, you would get a smack across the head."  </P> <P> Many of the fans came out of the airport terminal hiding their faces with  shirts, soccer programs and even deportation papers as journalists and TV  camera crews approached.  </P> <P> Andy Taylor, who said he was among a group of English supporters who remained  in a bar until 3 a.m. Tuesday after hearing that mobs of Italian supporters  were on the streets looking for England fans, said Italian police grabbed  English fans as they emerged from the bar.  </P> <P> "The police came out of two cars with baseball bats and started knocking us  around," he said. "It was quite frightening."  </P> <P> The clashes were the worst involving English fans, who have a bad reputation  for violence, since the World Cup in Italy began June 8. Riot police were  called in to break up the violence. Shop windows were smashed and parked cars  damaged.  </P> <P> Some fans said England supporters in hotels where the British flag was on  display were singled out for attack by Italians.  </P></p>

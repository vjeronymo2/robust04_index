			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Technology: Home grown talent Teleworking is often viewed as a cottage industry carried out by women in the middle of the Oxfordshire countryside or the Scottish highlands. But working from home, using a PC linked by a phone line to the company head office, is now practised by more than one in eight firms, according to a survey carried out by the National Computing Centre (NCC) and the Which Computer? Show.* The main benefit of teleworking is increased productivity, say business converts to the scheme. Nearly three quarters of companies employing teleworkers cited it as one of the big benefits. But increased productivity is often overlooked by companies that have not taken the plunge. Only 43 per cent of those not employing teleworkers foresaw this advantage. Reduced costs also ranked high on the list of benefits according to companies using teleworking. Surprisingly, says Bill Murray, head of the communications and security division of NCC Consultancy, few companies that practised teleworking found that there were hidden costs involved. The other big advantage of teleworking is that it enables companies to retain skilled staff - particularly in jobs related to the IT sector. The most enthusiastic converts to teleworking among the 500 members of the NCC which responded to the survey were companies in the IT field. However, the most popular teleworking jobs were in sales, as well as those involving IT. Companies in the south of England as well as those employing more than 1,000 staff also took to teleworking most enthusiastically. The biggest disadvantage was the loss of face-to-face contact with staff. The kind of people to benefit most from teleworking, says Murray, would be 'evolutionary, pro-active types'. *Teleworking in the UK, available from the NCC, Oxford Road, Manchester, M1 7ED.</p>

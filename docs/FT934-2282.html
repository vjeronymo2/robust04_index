			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Pakistan sets arms deadline Pakistan yesterday set a deadline for resolution of a dispute over US arms sales and said it would go shopping elsewhere if the matter remains unresolved beyond next April. Mr Assef Ahmad Ali, foreign minister, told three visiting US senators Pakistan would look to other countries if the US arms sales, suspended three years ago, are not restored. Islamabad has already paid over more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) to buy items including 71 F-16 fighter aircraft. 'No country can allow its security to be compromised,' Mr Ali said after meeting the delegation including Senator Larry Pressler, who sponsored the amendment requiring the US president to verify Islamabad was not capable of producing nuclear weapons before economic and military aid could could be given. Last month, the White House sent a draft law to congress which would the president greater freedom to back aid to any recipient country, if that would promote US interests. Pakistan sees that as a breakthrough in having aid restored.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Brazilian Speculator Charged: Speculator Naji Nahas, who sparked a crisis in  Brazil's stock exchanges when he stopped payment on checks to brokers, has been  charged with fraud and crimes against the economy, police said. The scandal  forced authorities to close Brazil's stock and options markets June 12.  Brokerage houses lost up to $500 million when Nahas stopped payment on his  checks, and five of them had to be closed by the Central Bank because of  losses. If convicted, Nahas could be sentenced to two to 10 years for  manipulating exchange markets and up to five years for letting $29 million in  checks bounce. Nahas says he was an innocent victim of maneuvers by market  players.  </P></p>

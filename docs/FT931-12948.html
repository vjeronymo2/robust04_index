			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / People: Kane and de Sausmarez on the move The musical chairs in the unit trust industry continue as Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), which lost its top unit trust man Tony Fraher to Singer &amp; Friedlander in November, has lured Graham Kane from Touche Remnant as managing director of both Morgan Grenfell Unit Trust Managers and Morgan Grenfell Investment Funds. Kane (right), who had previously been managing director of Touche Remnant's unit trust operation, had been offered the job of heading the combined unit trust division following Henderson Administration's purchase of TR from Societe Generale, but handed in his resignation before taking up the appointment. He says he is 'more excited' by Morgan - partly because of the bank's overall investment performance track record; partly because the unit trust side is only five years old and hence offers greater scope in product development. Keith Percy, chief executive of MGAM, says he hopes that 36-year-old Kane will build up the authorised unit trust side, which currently manages around Pounds 400m, to Pounds 1bn within five years, partly by acquisition in an industry that is expected to see considerable consolidation of funds and fund management groups. He will also be expanding the range of funds marketed out of the Republic of Ireland, which currently amount to around Pounds 500m of retail and institutional monies. Fraher and the team of eight marketing and administration staff that went with him from Morgan has set up a Dublin-based company, also to market so-called UCITS funds across European borders. Kane says that, given his experience with Societe Generale, he had satisfied himself that Fraher's departure was not linked to friction with Morgan's parent Deutsche Bank. Henderson, which shortly after the acquisition announced it would be making almost half the staff of TR redundant, has promoted James de Sausmarez into the position of managing director of a new company charged with the marketing and business development of the investment trusts of the two entities. De Sausmarez had previously been managing director of Touche Remnant Investment Trust Management. At the same time, Alan Gadd, a director of Henderson Unit Trust Management, becomes marketing director of the retail division which includes unit and investment trusts as well as private client business.</p>

			<p>920606 FT  06 JUN 92 / Letter: Novel ideas are long dead tactics Sir, I refer to Michael Dixon's article in which he gives details of various new 'guerrilla tactics' to get beyond the secretary (Jobs: 'How to get round the secretarial barrier', June 3). I am a 'gate-keeper' about whom he writes. I can inform him that his novel ideas were around at the invention of typewriter ribbons and died long before the advent of electronic mail.

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Aquino moves to end shortage of electricity PRESIDENT Corazon Aquino yesterday ordered government agencies to cut red tape and speed approvals for new power plants to ease the nation's grave electricity crisis which has been severely disrupting economic development plans, AP reports from Manila. Last week, power cuts as long as 12-15 hours a day plagued Manila, a capital of 8m people. Mrs Aquino has asked the Central Bank and Department of Environment and Natural Resources to speed up financial and environmental approvals for power stations as her six-year term draws to a close.</p>

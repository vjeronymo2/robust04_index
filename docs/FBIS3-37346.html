			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jurmala, Latvia, Feb 15, BNS -- The issue on the  rent or compensation Russia would pay Latvia for operating the  military radar in Skrunda "is in the stage of discussion," chief  Latvian negotiator Martins Virsis told reporters.    Virsis evaded from saying concretely whether Latvia will  accept the Russian-proposed rent of 2 million U.S. dollars per  year.    Russian chief negotiator Sergey Zotov told reporters today  that Russia would be forced to extend the deadline of troop  withdrawal if Latvia wanted more than 2 million dollars a year  for the radar's operation.    On the one hand, Virsis said, Latvia was aware of Russia's  economic problems but, on the other hand, the sum could also be  regarded as too small.    In addition, Russia initially wanted to keep 900-member  personnel in the station. During the negotiations, Russia  agreed to cut the number of military personnel by a third if the  civil staff is respectively increased.    Commenting on the dismantling of a newly-built installation  in the territory of the Skrunda compound, Virsis said Russia "in  principle agreed to pull it down but said it had no money to  accomplish the task."    Russia wouldn't mind if Latvia helped it dismantle the  installation, Virsis said.    Virsis abstained from predicting on the outcome of the  talks.    As reported, Russia proposed Latvia to complete troop  withdrawal by the end of August if Latvia allowed it keep the  Skrunda radar for four years and dismantle it in 18 months.    The Latvian cabinet is expected to accept the proposal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rocco Buttiglione, Italian Popular Party, </F> PPI member, by Stefano De Martis in Rome; date not given: "We  Will Join Forces With Berlusconi, But at the Next Election" --  first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Dear Mr. Berlusconi, at present we cannot but go  into opposition. But let us meet at the next election to beat  the Left together. From the Center. Signed: Rocco  Buttiglione. In his third-floor office in Palazzo Cenci  Bolognetti on Piazza del Gesu, the point of departure for the  faxes addressed to the nascent "peoples' clubs," the philosopher  deputy, who is running for the leadership of the PPI, has just  had a visit from Giuseppe Gargani from the Irpinia area, which  begs the first question.    [De Martis] What did you and De Mita have to say to one  another at your recent meeting?    [Buttiglione] It is my wont to be discreet.    [De Martis] Very well, but why did you want to meet him?    [Buttiglione] Why should I not talk to De Mita? Because he  has been involved in scandals? Not that I am aware of. Because  he represents the old DC [Christian Democratic Party]? Yes,  there is truth in that, but is the whole of the old DC to be  consigned to the scrapheap? Or might there be a thread of  historical continuity that can be picked up again in the  transition to the PPI? I am sure there is, which is why I talk  to De Mita, and other people too. The party is going through a  very grave crisis. Its position and identity need to be  fundamentally rethought in political and cultural terms. De  Mita is a man who thinks. Unfortunately, we do not have many  people who try to think politics out.    [De Martis] There is something paradoxical about it: You are  talking to an "adversary" of yours, while your "ally,"  Formigoni, is distancing himself and running for the  secretaryship on his own account. What is it that you disagree  on?    [Buttiglione] As far as I am concerned, I can highlight a  number of things that are close to my heart. I see the PPI as a  boat running toward the rocks with its tiller nailed fast. Some  of its officers claim that the rocks are merely an optical  illusion and that the boat can get through unscathed. Others  seek salvation by diving overboard or breaking off pieces of the  boat to build rafts. What I want to do is get the nails out of  the tiller. Of course, failing in this attempt would entail the  risk of going down with the boat. It is a risk that I intend to  run. The second thing is that the PPI makes sense if it manages  to adopt policies with which a lot of Catholics, potentially all  of them, and a lot of non-Catholics can identify. Great  cultural unity must be matched by great forbearance. It must  unite, not divide. The problems will not be solved by imagining  that someone will get rid of someone else.    [De Martis] Buttiglione the unifier.    [Buttiglione] I have always worked toward unity. We of the  PPI are at the Center. However, we cannot fail to bear in mind  that part of our electorate has moved toward the Right. It has  done so, not choosing a preexisting structure, but building up a  new one: Forza Italia. We do not intend to run after them, but  nor do we want to push them further toward the Right. What we  must do is foster their return to the Center, acknowledging  their positive tendencies and criticizing, but not demonizing,  the negative ones. I should like to emphasize, however, that we  are not merely postponing an agreement that will be inevitable  at a later stage. If Forza Italia will not move to the Center,  the deal will be off, both now and in the future.    [De Martis] In view of the current balance of power, is it  not presumptuous to assume that the PPI can pull Berlusconi's  movement over to the Center? The force of gravity is  proportional to mass..    [Buttiglione] Yes, but in politics, mass is not a constant  value. First and foremost, a distinction must be drawn between  electoral mass and parliamentary representation. The PPI and  the Pact have only a few dozen deputies, but between them they  collected 6 million votes: 2 million less than Forza Italia and  more than National Alliance. A perverse electoral system and  systematic propaganda persuaded the undecided moderate voters  that a vote for the PPI would be wasted. This is the reason for  our lack of success in the single-member constituencies. But if  the PPI were to enter into a potentially successful coalition at  the next election, our chances would be much greater, whereas  those of the AN [National Alliance] would be greatly reduced.  It would not be possible at the present time, which is why we  shall remain in the opposition. But at the next election, a  revitalized party that has at last put the bribery scandals well  behind it and has a clear program stands a good chance of  entering into an alliance with Forza Italia in a prominent, or  at least not subordinate, position.    [De Martis] You call for a united effort within the PPI,  but then you are organizing your "peoples' clubs." Is there not  a risk that they might become a parallel party?    [Buttiglione] When the party has vitality, there is no risk  because the clubs will support the PPI and work to recruit the  people they meet. When the party is sclerotic, there will be,  de facto, a single structure, so the problem will not arise.  Let us say that the federation to which the clubs belong is  very similar to how I would like the PPI to be organized: a  lightweight, fast- moving structure firmly rooted in society.    [De Martis] The deadline for recruitment to the PPI has been  set back to the end of the month. Will the conference scheduled  for July take place or not?    [Buttiglione] A lot of people think that the party cannot  wait until then, and they are proposing an interim solution to  establish a program and settle the leadership issue; this would  mean that the conference could be postponed until the fall and  adequate preparation could be made for it. There is truth in  this argument, provided it is not a means of prolonging a  situation that is taking the party to its death. I should not  like to think that this is what some people may be setting out  to do, so that they can subsequently use the PPI acronym to  legitimize the umpteenth quick-change act staged by the PCI  [former Italian Communist Party]: Now that it has turned into  the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], it wants to acquire  credentials as a new democratic party.    [De Martis] Nevertheless, you will find yourselves with the  PDS on the opposition benches against Berlusconi.    [Buttiglione] Our opposition will be different, because our  strategy will be different. The Left is setting out to beat the  moderate alignment at the next general election. We set out to  split up the present majority so as to form another, predominant  majority that can defeat the Left at the polls from the Center,  not from the Right.    [De Martis] And what about [AN leader] Fini?    [Buttiglione] Fini rightly saw that the myth of antifascist  unity had come to an end. But antifascism, as the national form  of antitotalitarianism, is more in vogue than ever. This is the  hurdle that he has to clear if he wants to build up a Gaullist  Right capable of becoming the right wing of the Center.</p>

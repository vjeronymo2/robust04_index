			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 13 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur dropped nine points in a month to 44 percent in  a popularity poll to be published here on Thursday [14 April].    In the poll by the BVA institute for the weekly PARIS-MATCH,  socialist President Francois Mitterrand shed a point, but at 46  percent was two points ahead of his conservative prime minister.    It was the third time in recent polls that Mitterrand has  been more popular than Balladur. A CSA institute poll for the  Catholic weekly LA VIE at the end of March gave 45 percent to  the president and 40 percent to the prime minister. Figures in a  Gallup poll at the beginning of April for the weekly EXPRESS  were 48 and 42 percent.    The poll also said there was a five-point increase to 68  percent in the numbers dissatisfied with the way France is being  governed, compared with 25 percent satisfied, a six-point fall.    On the left, Olympique Marseille chairman Bernard Tapie, who  faces embezzlement and bribery charges, was up six points to 33  percent, ahead of opposition Socialist Party leader Michel  Rocard, who gained a point to 27 percent.</p>

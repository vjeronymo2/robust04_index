Hasty calls to the foreign ministry which keeps a stock of the things for its diplomats' use. These proving insufficent in number however, a harrassed official was forced to sound out the Moscow Light Opera Theatre, whose performances regularly feature actors kitted out as waiters. Its collection proved numerically suitable - only problem being that the apparel is cut for svelte actors, not for the ample girths and spreading derrieres of some of the top political class.</p>

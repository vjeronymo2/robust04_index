			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (7): Ending the nightmare - Investing in the country BANKING IN Greece is not an easy business. One of the main hiccups is communications. The telephone network, starved of investment for the last two decades, is overloaded and outdated. Banks in the state sector are chronically overstaffed. Labour problems are a common occurrence. For the customer, even the simplest transaction can take a great deal of time as tellers wrestle with telephones that don't work and piles of paperwork. Mr Panagis Vourloumis is the managing director of Alpha Finance, 'the closest thing to a merchant bank in Greece', as he puts it. 'Our communications technology is years out of date. People cannot get in touch with us so we lose business,' Mr Vourloumis says. He feels that if there is not substantial investment and reform in the banking sector soon, Greece risks being left behind not only by the more advanced countries in the European Community but also by Spain and Portugal which are already putting into place new banking systems. He believes that Greece has expertise in many areas and could develop a proper financial services industry. 'At the moment financial services are only an appendage of the banks. But they could develop independently, for instance if offering banking expertise and services to countries like Bulgaria and Romania - places where Greek banks, more than the more developed institutions in Germany or the UK, have a knowledge and feel for the way business is done.' Alpha Finance has been approached by various east European countries but, Mr Vourloumis says, it already has more than enough business in the home market. 'Even with our communications problems, we can compete with the foreign banks.' Set up two years ago, Alpha Finance belongs to a group of financial services companies founded by Credit Bank, Greece's largest private bank, which include stockbroking, leasing, insurance and financial information services. Credit Bank is the largest shareholder. Samuel Montagu also has a small stake, with the rest of the institution's equity held by employees - an innovation in the Greek banking sector. In the past two years, with a dramatic rise in business on the Athens Stock Exchange, Alpha Finance has been closely involved in helping several companies go public. Together with Credit Bank, it launched two mutual funds, a diversified equity and a fixed income fund, the first of its kind in Greece. The two funds manage more than Dr20bn (Dollars 110m) in assets. Alpha Finance is also involved in the government's privatisation process, carrying out valuations and acting as financial adviser on the sale of several companies. 'Privatisation is a revolution in Greece. If it's successful, and for the future of the country it has to be, then the whole economic outlook will change,' Mr Vourloumis says. He points out that as the recession bites deeper, 'some foreign institutions have come to pick the crumbs from the Greek table - something we welcome because it broadens the market.' But Mr Vourloumis and other bankers accept that Greece is still viewed as a bureaucratic nightmare for some foreign institutions. While profit repatriation is permitted, bureaucratic stipulations result in tortuous hold-ups. A combination of labour problems and telecommunications difficulties has held up progress on automated banking. Cheques are almost as rare as a free taxi in the Athens rush hour. The black economy encourages cash transactions. It is not uncommon to see customers carrying briefcases bulging with drachma in and out of banks. 'Setting up Alpha Finance was an expression of our faith in the future,' says Mr Vourloumis. 'I am an optimist - things are going to change.'</p>

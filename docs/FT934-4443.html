			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Baring stable launches emerging Europe trust Baring Investment Management is attempting to raise between Dollars 40m and Dollars 120m (Pounds 80.5m) for a new investment trust which will invest in southern and eastern Europe. The Baring Emerging Europe Trust will concentrate on Greece, Portugal and Turkey in the Mediterranean region and on Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in eastern Europe. The managers argue that political changes, low labour costs, the potential for faster economic, and therefore corporate earnings, growth make emerging Europe an attractive investment opportunity. Warburg Securities is arranging the offer which will consist of ordinary shares with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Shareholders will have the right to wind up the trust after 10 years.</p>

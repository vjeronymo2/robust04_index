			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords fight bill to reform unions MINISTERS were warned yesterday of changes they will be pressed to make to the latest bill on trade union reform, as the legislation began its passage through the House of Lords. The most vehement opposition to the bill, which includes the provision to abolish wages councils, came from Labour and Liberal Democrat peers led by Baroness Turner of Camden for Labour. Some elements of it were also criticised by Tories. Employers' groups expressing serious reservations about the measure - cited by peers on both sides of the House as the measure was given a second reading - included the Confederation of British Industry, the Industrial Society, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers' Federation. The two provisions about which employers are particularly unhappy are the greater freedom for individuals to join the union of their choice, and the proposed changes to the 'check-off' arrangements, though which union dues are deducted automatically from employees' pay. The bill would mean that an employee would have to indicate continuing approval of the arrangement every three years. Lord Prior, a former Tory cabinet minister and chairman of GEC, the electronics and telecommunications group, emphasised the importance to foreign companies investing in the UK of the ability to negotiate single-union deals. 'That is the nub of the problem with the bill,' he said. Lord Murray of Epping Forest, a former general secretary of the TUC, warned Viscount Ullswater, the junior employment minister, that the bill made rods for employers' backs. Baroness Young, another former minister, welcomed much of the bill, but said the government should think again about the provisions on maternity leave. Reflecting the views of the Equal Opportunities Commission, she said that the provision allowing women 14 weeks might well not be long enough, and that it might be to the benefit of employers as well as their staff to increase it to 18 weeks.</p>

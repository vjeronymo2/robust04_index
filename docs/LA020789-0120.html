			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAGUAY RULER DENIES LINKS TO DRUG TRAFFIC  </P> <P> Gen. Andres Rodriguez, Paraguay's new military ruler, vowed Monday to crack  down on drug trafficking and swore that he has never been involved in drug  dealing. He dismissed allegations to the contrary as the work of enemies out to  eliminate him.  </P> <P> Relaxed and smiling, Rodriguez answered questions from groups of reporters for  more than two hours. Meetings with the press were a rarity during the 34  1/2-year regime of former President Alfredo Stroessner, who flew into exile  Sunday after being deposed in Rodriguez's coup two days earlier.  </P> <P> Rodriguez repeated his commitment to respect human rights and bring democracy  to Paraguay, but at the same time he indicated that political change would be  neither sudden nor profound. For example, he said that Stroessner had not been  a dictator and that past elections had not been fraudulent.  </P> <P> He also said that if he was asked, he would accept the nomination of the ruling  Colorado Party in the May 1 election to fill the remainder of Stroessner's term  until 1993.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anticipated Questions  </P> <P> Rodriguez, commander of the 1st Army Corps, who had been Stroessner's  second-in-command, clearly anticipated a grilling on reports published in the  United States that he has been linked to shipments of drugs through Paraguay.  </P> <P> He said in a prepared statement that he considers drug-trafficking "one of the  worst scourges that flay humanity" and that his government will ensure that  "the laws are more severe and energetic to suppress it."  </P> <P> Responding to questions, he said: "I detest drugs. I swear as a (Roman)  Catholic and as the head of a family, I swear on my sons, that I am not  involved in drug trafficking."  </P> <P> Rodriguez said that he would cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration and all other international agencies in the fight against  narcotics.  </P> <P> Former U.S. Ambassador Clyde D. Taylor Jr. has charged that senior Paraguayan  officials were involved in drugs, but he did not accuse anyone by name. That  earned him scorn from the pro-Stroessner news media.  </P> <P> There have been unverified reports in the American press that Rodriguez has  played a major role in the smuggling of drug shipments through Paraguay. The  U.S. government has often complained about drug smuggling through that country,  and although U.S. officials have not publicly linked Rodriguez to the drug  trade, they are known to believe that he is deeply involved.  </P> <P> In his news conference, Rodriguez, a multimillionaire with several business  interests including money-changing and imports, said he has been to the United  States many times, including official visits to the Pentagon, and "they never  even said anything to me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Shining Opportunity'  </P> <P> "I happily thank you for giving me this shining opportunity to say to you that  never in my life have I had any friendship or connection with any person with  respect to drug trafficking," he said. "I know that there was an elimination  campaign against me. I don't know by which opposition party. . . . It would be  someone with bad intentions interested in eliminating me."  </P> <P> Rodriguez said that the number of dead and wounded in the six hours or so of  fighting that ended Friday with Stroessner's ouster did not exceed 50. Foreign  diplomats had estimated the death toll at about 300.  </P> <P> The Paraguayan political opposition had reacted jubilantly to Stroessner's  downfall and to Rodriguez's initial public statements in defense of civil  rights and the need for full democracy, which everyone outside the ruling  Colorado Party agrees has never existed in Paraguay.  </P> <P> But there was immediate criticism of Rodriguez's announcement at the final  meeting with reporters Monday that elections for president and Congress will be  held May 1. This will be less than 90 days after the coup. The short campaign  period gives a huge advantage to the Colorado Party, which has a vast  nationwide organization and demands the support of public workers, civic groups  and organized labor. The opposition will have to start from scratch.  </P> <P> Rafael Saguier, a member of the still-banned Authentic Liberal Radical Party,  considered to be the primary opposition force, said: "Gen. Rodriguez knows that  this short period is insufficient. This is a trick played on the opposition. He  knows that we have not been able to organize for nearly 35 years and that all  public servants and all army members must be Colorado Party members.  </P> <P> "And he defends past national elections as fair. This has the makings of  another dictatorship. Rodriguez wants to be another Stroessner. They are going  to change what they have to change to keep things the same."  </P> <P> Rodriguez said that all four opposition parties, presently outlawed, could  compete in the elections and that only Communist parties were prohibited.  Paraguay has no active Communist Party. "Ex-President Stroessner was not a  dictator," he said. "He was freely elected in elections that had outside  observers."  </P> <P> Asked why he had overthrown Stroessner if the latter was not a dictator, the  64-year-old general replied, "In recent times, President Stroessner was not  producing good results for the party that had placed its trust in him."  </P> <P> Despite an expression of support for free news media by the new leader,  Rodriguez's government censored from outgoing foreign television news reports  any references to the death toll in the coup or to a possible Paraguayan role  in drug dealing. There was no attempt to censor radio reports or newspaper or  news agency articles sent abroad.  </P></p>

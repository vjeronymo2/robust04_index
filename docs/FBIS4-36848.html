			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, </F> member of the Council of Guardians and acting Friday prayers  leader, in Tehran on 10 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The esteemed leader has  recently issued orders that financial corruption in the  administrative organization should be dealt with. It is a clear  command. He has issued orders to one powerful organization  about discovery and information, and has given orders to a  powerful judicial organization about judgement and legal  investigation. God willing, I hope those two organizations act  strongly, as the leader wishes.    That is one of our fundamental problems. It is one of the  deep-rooted evil deeds which I am talking about, this financial  corruption in the administrative organization. It has crippled,  really crippled, many areas. Once it is dealt with we hope that  that corruption is eradicated. [passage omitted]    And let me offer my thanks here for the matter of price  tagging which they have carried out. It is a very good thing  that has been done. But several points must be considered. One  is that it should be pursued. It should not be mere words and  then disappear; it should not be for one or two months but for  always. The officials carrying out the policy as well as the  judiciary system should take the matter seriously. That is most  necessary.    Another is that they should not busy themselves with trivial  issues. If, for instance, a barrowman sells potatoes at 5 rials  more expensive than the rate, they should not harass him, just  like the former chamber of trades, and just deal with those poor  street vendors. They should trap the big overchargers and bring  them to book. Dealing with trivial matters dissipates the  forces. [passage omitted]</p>

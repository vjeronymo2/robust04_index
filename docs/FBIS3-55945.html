This ruling was made today by the court of the  Supreme Court Military Board, which is in charge of the case of  the State Committee for the State of Emergency [SCSE].    Lukyanov's lawyer, Genrikh Padva, applied for the criminal  proceedings against his client and Vasiliy Starodubtsev to be  discontinued pending the adoption of the law on the status of  deputies.    In the court's opinion, the adoption of the law will not  free  the defendants from criminal liability. Nor does the Russian  Constitution, adopted at the 12 December referendum, free the  SCSE trial defendants from liability, the court believes.    INTERFAX reports that the trial is to be resumed at 0900 on  13 January.</p>

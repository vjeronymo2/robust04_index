			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Counsel decision takes heat off White House President Bill Clinton's request for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate his involvement with the Whitewater property venture and the bankrupt Madison Guaranty savings and loan entity appeared yesterday to have drawn some of the sting from the controversy, at least temporarily. Some of Mr Clinton's Republican foes kept up their attack: Senator Robert Dole, who only a few days ago was urging Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, to appoint a special counsel, turned around and complained that her decision to do so, at the White House's request, showed her lack of independence. Mr Dole had promised 'no second-guessing' on his part if Ms Reno were to appoint a special counsel. Late on Wednesday, though, he changed tack by pressing for a Congressional select committee to investigate Whitewater - a suggestion seen as having virtually no chance of approval from the Democratic majority, so long as Ms Reno's choice of counsel is regarded as acceptable. Mr Clinton has tersely brushed off questions about Whitewater, which have distracted attention from his summit meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin this week in Moscow. Ms Reno declined to comment on the scope of the investigation, saying that to do so could compromise the independence of the counsel she is to name. Among the questions that have been raised, however, are those concerning possible influence by Mr Clinton over thesupervision of Madison, whose bankruptcy cost the government over Dollars 50m for the reimbursement of federally insured deposits, and the possible channelling of money from Madison to Whitewater or to Mr Clinton's campaign funds.</p>

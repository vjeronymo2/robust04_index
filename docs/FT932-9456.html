			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed performances after rate cuts THE reduction in German money market rates, which sparked a fresh round of interest rate cuts on the continent, was also taken to indicate that the Bundesbank will ease the Lombard and discount rates soon, writes Our Markets Staff. The cut did not surprise strategists, who had been expecting an acceleration in the process by the middle of the year. Mr Andrew Bell, of BZW in London, noted that there had been signals from the Bundesbank that it was to step up the pace of cuts and said that the next few months would see a continuation of the process. 'Rate cuts are a necessary damage limitation exercise owing to the state of the economy in continental Europe, not a bonus,' he said. He now forecasts German interest rates of 4.5 per cent by next spring. However, this should be accompanied by a spate of sharply reduced company earnings forecasts over the next quarter, a further indication that 1994 is unlikely to provide the hoped for 'bounce' in growth. PARIS paid little attention to the base rate cut, turning instead to a raft of mixed first quarter sales figures. The 1 per cent rise on the day in the CAC-40 index, which gained 18.15 to 1,872.67, was also assisted by strong activity in the futures market. Turnover was some FFr2.9bn. Alcatel fell FFr9 to FFr618 in turnover of FFr450m on speculation that it might be looking to increase its stake in Framatome. News that Chargeurs was to cut its workforce sent the shares down FFr60 to FFr1,015. FRANKFURT saw an upswing in futures and short covering in the cash market as the morning's repo rate cut put more pressure on the bears. Volume eased from DM6.6bn to DM6.5bn as the DAX index closed 13.31 higher at 1,629.46. Sector and individual share price performance was mixed. Volkswagen fell another DM3 to DM317.50; but MAN recovered DM8.40 to DM274 as analysts said that this company had come to its crisis, whereas others were seeing their recessionary troubles deepen. The big three chemicals all rose, Bayer putting on DM4.70 to DM261.30 on a FDA recommendation of a drug produced by its US unit, Miles Inc, for treatment of children with HIV. Mr Horst Greven of Merck Finck in Munich said that the sector gains reflected a yield orientation among equity investors. MADRID's general index fell 0.36 to 241.85 but the session was enlivened by the first day of trading in Argentaria, the newly privatised bank, which closed at Pta4,230 against an intraday peak of Pta4,375 and an offer price of Pta3,800. Mr Pedro Echeguren of NatWest Securities said that the price action compared with initial analysts' forecasts of Pta4,100 and subsequent upgrades to Pta4,200 or Pta4,300 after the success of the flotation. He added that a weaker opening for the stock in New York explained the decline from the day's high. MILAN adopted a positive trend after falls earlier in the week with renewed buying by funds and small investors. The Comit index rose 2.47 to 534.09, with options expiry having only a limited influence. This resilience in the absence of a rates cut surprised some analysts who believe that the Bank of Italy is awaiting progress on supplementary budget before it moves. Fondiaria gave up some of Tuesday's 4.7 per cent rise in further response to the sale of its stake in AMB: the shares fell L429 to L31,153. ZURICH edged lower after profit-taking in recently firm blue chips and a weaker dollar weighed on late business. The SMI index fell 0.7 to 2,191.9. Nestle bearers added SFr10 to SFr1,120 although a 6 per cent rise in first quarter sales was less than some expectations. Motor Columbus added SFr50 or 8.5 per cent to SFr635 in further response to the energy and communications group's forecast on Tuesday of a big improvement in 1993 results. AMSTERDAM was supported by the cut in domestic rates with the CBS Tendency index gaining 0.4 to 109.1. Aegon, which reported a rise in first quarter profits, improved 90 cents to Fl 85.10. Polygram moved up Fl 1.30 to Fl 48.90 after a brokers upgrade. STOCKHOLM saw record turnover of SKr2bn, encouraged partly by Ericsson's positive first quarter results, the B shares advancing SKr19 to SKr310. The Affarsvarlden general index gained 19.4 to 1081.7. DUBLIN remained strong, the ISEQ overall index rising 20.38, or 1.3 per cent to 1,543.31. Mr Adrian O'Carroll of Dillon Read commented that the Bank of Ireland's 5 per cent gain preceded today's results. VIENNA advanced, taking its lead from Frankfurt and news that bankers had valued the 20 per cent of OMV that is to be privatised at well above its market price. The ATX index gained 8.05 to 777.18. ISTANBUL returned to record levels with the 75-share index up 140.43 or 1.8 per cent at 7,952.71 on strong demand, particularly in cement issues.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 12                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1143.76      1145.09      1146.11      1146.89 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1211.96      1213.86      1213.70      1214.26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.27      1147.16      1147.20      1148.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.48      1214.45      1214.76      1215.04  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 11    May 10     May 7     May 6     May 5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1140.44   1142.74   1142.41   1152.03   1153.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1206.03   1203.54   1200.34   1205.10   1206.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1148.93; 200 - 1216.55 Low/day: 100 - 1143.60  200 - 1211.96.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] The new coffee price has been set from today. The  agreement to set the domestic price was reached in the pre-dawn  hours today following 15 hours of heated arguments. In the end  the price [carga] went from 105,000 pesos to 120,000 pesos [unit  not given].    Tired after fighting for so many hours, negotiators emerged  at 0330 with the news. The price of coffee went from 105,000  pesos to 120,000 pesos, effective today. Of this amount,  103,000 pesos will be paid in cash and 17,000 in coffee savings  bonds. It was a 14.28 percent readjustment.    [Begin Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes recording] The  government decided to give in and accepted this large increase  -- more than a 30 percent increase since August 1993. In real  terms, this is a gigantic increase since August. [end recording]    Even though the government, led by President Gaviria, made  an  all-out effort, the coffee growers replied with resignation.    [Begin Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Federation of  Coffee Growers, recording] This was the best price obtainable in  the present circumstances. We sincerely believe this is a very  good price when you take into account the current international  market. [end recording]    Everything seems to indicate that this will be the last  adjustment this administration will make. In October, when a  new increase is expected, the coffee growers will possibly have  to speak on different terms.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Growing concern over investor lawsuits US companies are increasingly reluctant to release forward-looking information to analysts and investors about their earnings and performance because they fear shareholders might sue them if the projections prove wrong, according to a survey by the American Stock Exchange. The growing number of shareholder suits is becoming such a problem in the US that the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering ways to bolster the 'safe harbour' provision of securities law. The provision protects companies from fraud claims unless the information they release is 'without a reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in good faith'. In recent years, however, the safe harbour provision has not been working effectively, with a growing number of shareholders filing lawsuits alleging they have been deliberately misled by information from companies. Mr Dick Syron, chairman of the ASE, said that many of these shareholder lawsuits had little, if any, merit. 'This is another case of excessive litigation being counter-productive. Investors are suffering because less, not more, financial information is available to determine the value of a company's stock.' The ASE said that more than 75 per cent of the 218 companies which responded to its survey had been forced to curtail the amount of information they provided to investors because of the mounting number of 'frivolous' lawsuits, and 17 per cent said they had been sued in the past five years on issues relating to disclosures. A majority of the respondents who were sued said they chose to settle out of court rather than fight the suit. The problem of shareholder lawsuits does not relate to official announcements such as quarterly earnings, dividend payments or securities transactions, but to informal disclosures such as meetings with analysts and institutional investors, press releases, press conferences and executives' speeches. The SEC is keen to encourage a constant flow of this type of information so that investors can make sound judgments about their investments.</p>

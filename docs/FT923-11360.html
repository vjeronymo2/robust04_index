			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Working hours blow in Japan JAPANESE government moves to shorten working hours suffered a setback yesterday when a court ruled that an employer abolishing Saturday shifts could load at least some of the lost hours on to the rest of the week. A call for working hours to be reduced was made earlier this year by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister. His proclaimed aim was to turn Japan into a 'lifestyle superpower' - although the issue also addressed US and European criticism that long hours for labour in Japan represented a competitive advantage which helped fuel its growing trade surplus. His appeal was echoed in the private sector by Sony's Mr Akio Morita and apparently taken seriously by organisations such as the Nikkeiren employers' federation. However, Mr Hiroshi Yamamoto, presiding judge at the Akita district court in northern Japan, though acknowledging that the aim of a five-day week was to cut total hours worked, gave conditional approval yesterday to longer weekday working. He was dismissing a suit brought by 30 employees of the local Ugo Bank who were claiming compensation from their employer. Along with the rest of the Japanese financial sector, in 1989 Ugo had introduced a five-day week for the 1,000 staff at its 71 branches, trimming the annual official length of time worked by each to 1,849 hours from 1,891. In so doing, though, the bank had lengthened each weekday by at least 10 minutes, and by as much as an hour - to make a nine-hour day finishing at 5.50pm - on busy days in the banking calendar. No extra pay was forthcoming. The ruling set only informal precedent but was widely seen as a test case and was given front-page prominence in Japanese evening newspapers. The judge said the cut of 42 hours a year was enough to permit an extension of weekday working as a transitional measure. Ugo, when asked last night asked what plans it had to reduce hours further, said merely that 'for the industry as a whole, this is a subject for study." The government's target is for a reduction in the working year to 1,800 hours by the end of the 1996 fiscal year. According to official statistics, Japanese workers put in an average 2,006 hours last year. Figures such as this are viewed in the west as a substantial underestimate, taking no account of obligatory overtime. So-called service overtime, which goes unrecorded, as well as unpaid, is endemic in the banking sector, where annual hours have been put unofficially at 2,600.</p>

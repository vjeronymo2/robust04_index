Legislator Erich Gutjahr was quoted by the  Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper Friday as saying "Jews are plundering us again"  and that something must be done about it. Winfried Krauss, spokesman for the  National Party of Germany, said the party "distances itself" from Gutjahr's  reported statements.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Australian GDP grows by 0.6% Australia's gross domestic product grew by a modest 0.6 per cent in the three months ending June, confirming that the country's recovery from recession would be a long slow haul, writes Emilia Tagaza from Canberra. The rise was the largest since the recovery began a year ago and brought the 1990-91 annual growth rate to 1.6 per cent. Following the release of the national account figures yesterday, the currency regained some of its lost ground. But analysts said the markets would remain edgy until the exact size of the projected budget deficit is known next week. It is expected to be around ADollars 14bn (Pounds 5.4bn). The June quarter growth was driven by consumer spending, which rose by 0.9 per cent, and exports which rose by 6.9 per cent. The most encouraging result was a 3.7 per cent increase in business investment, which was the first rise in over a year and could indicate that private business is finally regaining confidence in the country's future.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The methodology for determining the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance targets reflects projected growth in air travel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the respective FIP control area. As a result, new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrants simply would be required to achieve the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental performance targets upon initiation of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both new entrants and expanding airlines are automatically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodated by the control strategy as long as growth beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predicted levels does not occur. In event that activity grows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faster than originally forecast, EPA will revise the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targets, as discussed in greater detail later in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency believes that the proposed program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporates features which provide flexibility for new entrants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or existing airlines to begin and expand environmentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible aircraft operations in the basin. Nonetheless, all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines will face significant economic and technical challenges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a result of this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Pounds per PEU Scheme. The FIP strategy for commercial aircraft operations will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> center on a schedule of declining emission performance targets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., pounds per PEU) for the combined emissions from all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial airports in each control area. Separate targets will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be established for HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. These emission targets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will yield benefits consistent with the percentage reduction from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 inventory for stationary sources. Ultimately, the emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from commercial aviation in the South Coast and Ventura areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be reducted by 20&hyph;45 percent and 30&hyph;45 percent from 1990 VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission levels, respectively, by 2005. The goal for VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions in the Sacramento area is 20&hyph;45 percent by 2005. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already discussed, there is currently no stationary source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions cap for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Sacramento.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This control strategy fundamentally relies on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of an emissions baseline as a reference point for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining future year emission limits during the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. The Agency proposes to use currently available emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory data for aircraft and aircraft-related activities to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the requisite emissions inventory for the baseline year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1990. Once established, the seasonal emission limits for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year can be calculated from the baseline inventory established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the annual uniform schedule of percentage reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The choice of 1990 as the baseline year is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act's requirement for modeling reasonable further progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (RFP) and attainment of the ambient standards. However, aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity in 1990 may not be representative of typical operations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the aviation industry experienced significant change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during this period. Several air carriers, notably Eastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airlines, ceased operations or stopped serving airports in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast and Sacramento areas. Others such as Southwest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Airlines had only a minimal presence in these areas during that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, but greatly expanded operations in subsequent years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Desert Shield/Desert Storm military action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused an increase in jet fuel prices and a rapid decline in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial passenger traffic. For these reasons it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirable to use a two-year average, perhaps 1989&hyph;1990, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing a baseline inventory in preference to using 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data alone; this could lessen the effect of unusual circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a single year's inventory. EPA requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirability of using a two-year average for establishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline inventory. Any such multi-year average, however, may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an adjustment to the emission performance targets in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to assure consistency with the stationary source cap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and EPA's demonstration of attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, EPA could utilize baseline reports from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial airlines to establish this inventory. Given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of this baseline inventory in setting realistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission limits and environmental performance targets, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry baseline reports could provide information more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative of airline operations in the control area than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generic default data currently being used EPA for some portions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

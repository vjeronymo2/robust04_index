			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to defining the circumstances under which a specialist enhancement may be applied, the current proposal also serves to replace, in certain situations, the two-for-one provision with a percentage distribution. Those situations are where there are orders for more than five contracts and where only one or two controlled accounts are on parity with the specialist, such that: Where there is one controlled account on parity with the specialist, the specialist would receive 60% and the controlled account would receive 40% of the contracts; and where there are two controlled accounts on parity, each controlled account would receive 30% and the specialist would receive 40% of the contracts. In qualified situations where there are three or more controlled accounts on parity with the specialist, the existing two-for-one split would continue to apply such that the specialist would be counted as two crowd participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that in situations where there are less than three controlled accounts on parity with the specialist, the two-for-one split becomes overly burdensome for those controlled accounts. For example, applying a two-for-one split of a 100 lot buy order in a trading crowd consisting of one ROT and the specialist, would result in the specialist selling 66 contracts and the ROT selling 34 contracts. Pursuant to the split proposed herein, the specialist would sell 60 contracts and the ROT would sell 40 contracts in the above example. Where there are two ROTs and the specialist on parity, the current split would entitle the specialist to sell 50 contracts and each ROT would sell 25 contracts. The proposed split would entitle the specialist to sell 40 contracts, while each ROT would sell 30 contracts. These results demonstrate that while the specialist would continue to receive an ``enhanced'' split, such split would be reduced in small crowds where the impact on ROTs is more pronounced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the existing provisions of the two-for-one split in Rule 1014(g)(i) and the new unit/new option split currently in Commentary .17 are proposed to be codified into Advice B&hyph;6; additionally, the proposed changes regarding small trading crowds and firm orders are also proposed to be codified into Advice B&hyph;6. The purpose of adding these provisions into Section C of Advice B&hyph;6 is to include all significant parity/priority provisions in the Exchange's Floor Procedure Advice Handbook for ease of reference on the trading floor. Similarly, the proposed renumbering of Rule 1014(g), including moving Commentary .17 to paragraph (g)(iii) and renumbering paragraphs (i) and (ii), is intended to improve the organization of this Rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the foregoing rule change proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest by reducing the enhanced split where there are less than three controlled accounts, in addition to the specialist, on parity, which should, in the Exchange's opinion, promote liquidity by encouraging ROT participation in small trading crowds where an enhanced split applies. In addition, clarifying the role of firm orders in applying the enhanced split should also promote just and equitable principles of trade by expressly delineating firm participation in such parity situations. Lastly, codifying these provisions into Advice B&hyph;6 and renumbering Rule 1014(g) is intended to simplify the organization of the Exchange's parity/priority provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

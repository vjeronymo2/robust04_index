			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARBOUR (50), MYERS (45) SET SCHOOL SCORING RECORDS  </P> <P> John Harbour, the Camarillo High basketball coach, believes that his 6-foot-2  1/2 son, David, needs to grow a little to attract basketball scholarship offers  from big-time Division I schools.  </P> <P> "He's pretty serious about playing basketball in college," the elder Harbour  said. "But he might need that extra inch."  </P> <P> Yet even if David, a junior guard, doesn't grow another millimeter, he might  have found the best way to grab the attention of college recruiters -- by  posting some very big numbers.  </P> <P> In a first-round game of the Bosco Tech tournament Tuesday, Harbour scored a  school-record 50 points to lead Camarillo to a 78-56 win over Garfield at Bosco  Tech in Rosemead.  </P> <P> In another game involving a Marmonte League team, Royal forward Russell Myers  scored a school-record 45 points to lead the Highlanders to a 90-68 victory  over Buena at Royal. Myers, a 6-6 forward, is recovering from mononucleosis.  </P> <P> Myers, who missed five games before returning in last Saturday's 65-46 victory  over Notre Dame, broke the school scoring record of 40 set by Andy Jercha in  1981. Myers came off the bench against both Notre Dame and Buena.  </P> <P> "If I was feeling tired, I was supposed to let (Coach Joe Malkinson) know,"  Myers said in reference to the Buena game. "But I didn't feel that bad, so I  played almost the whole game."  </P> <P> Myers made 13 of 17 free throws, a pair of three-pointers and 13 two-point  field goals against Buena.  </P> <P> In Camarillo's victory, Harbour scored 36 of his team's 45 points in the first  half, made 16 of 28 shots from the field and 14 of 16 free throws. Harbour  broke the Camarillo single-game mark of 42 set in 1985-86 by Mitch Parrott and  came within a basket of tying the Ventura County record of 52, held by Don  MacLean of Simi Valley and Jeff Oliver of Buena.  </P> <P> A factor in Harbour's extensive playing time was the loss of fellow starters  Rick Schnell and Scott Foster.  </P> <P> Schnell, a returning starter who was averaging 16.6 points a game this season,  underwent emergency appendectomy surgery Tuesday and will be out from two to  four weeks, Harbour said. Schnell was an all-tournament selection last week as  Camarillo won the Page (Ariz.) tournament championship.  </P> <P> Foster, a three-year starter at center, was diagnosed Monday as having  mononucleosis and will be out from two to six weeks.

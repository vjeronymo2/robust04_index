			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWER EXCERPTS: 'I'M A SINGLE MAN; I DO DATE WOMEN'  </P> <P> Here are excerpts from Secretary of Defense-designate John Tower's appearance  Sunday on the ABC-TV show "This Week With David Brinkley." Tower, a former  senator from Texas, was questioned by Sam Donaldson, George Will and Cokie  Roberts.  </P> <P>  DONALDSON: . . . You heard Sen. (Sam) Nunn this morning suggest that if the  White House continues to leak, as he sees it . . . portions of that FBI report,  the (Senate Armed Services) committee ought to resume its hearings and call  people, put them under subpoena and oath, and take their testimony. Would you  agree to that?  </P> <P> TOWER: I'm not going to try to advise the committee on what to do, and the  committee will arrive at its own decision on that. I am no longer a member of  the committee, and I have found that I'm not . . . don't have a great deal of  influence over what the committee does. But I am hopeful that we can reduce the  level of the rhetoric somewhat . . . de-escalate it.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Would that be a fair thing to do?  </P> <P> TOWER: Well, I think that, in fairness to the White House, they are reacting to  about three months of solid allegations being poured into the public media; and  therefore the White House, I think, felt it necessary to refer to the more  favorable aspects of the report in an effort to shoot down these allegations.  As you know, in this business, the answer rarely catches up with the charge.  You can be charged with something on a three-column headline above the fold in  the paper, and the next day the rebuttal for it or the disproof of it is back  on the 23rd page somewhere. And I think that that's what the White House was  responding to. The White House was put on the defensive by all of the  allegations that came through across the media, and I think that should be  understood.  </P> <P> . . . I know one thing, and that is that the committee didn't tell me nor did  the White House tell me . . . they're very meticulous about this . . . what the  allegations were. And I learned about them by seeing them on television and  reading them in the newspaper, and that was my first hint . . . that these  allegations were out there.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: . . . as you know, many of the allegations have to do with, to put  it rather inelegantly, the charge that you're a common, or uncommon, drunk . .  . you admitted that, in the '70s, you had a drinking problem. But the  allegations are that it has persisted. Now, what can you tell us to reassure on  that point?  </P> <P> TOWER: I would deny that allegation. And what I would like to do, in response  to that, is to read a portion of a letter that was issued by a doctor who took  care of me after I was operated on for a colon polyp, in which a very thorough  examination was made. And I will not read the entire letter, although the  entire letter I think is very revealing.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: It will be made part of the record?  </P> <P> TOWER: Yes, it will be made part of the record. I would like to read the . . .  last paragraph. It says: "In summary, Sen. Tower had normal liver function  tests, with pre-op evaluation, had a normal liver at the time of surgery, and  exhibited no evidence of alcohol withdrawal post-operatively. On the contrary,  he was at work continuously, almost from the time he left the recovery room.  Based on these facts, it can be stated with relative certainty that Sen. Tower  shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism."  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Who is that doctor?  </P> <P> TOWER: "It is my professional view that there is little basis for statements  made concerning the possible impairment by alcohol of his ability to perform  his duty as secretary of defense." It was made by Dr. Warren Lichliter of  Baylor Hospital.  </P> <P> . . . Now, what I want to do is to try to remove the obstacles to my  confirmation. I've already gone a step further than I'm required to on  recusals, more than the law requires me to do. And I'd like to take another  step, which I hope will remove what appears to be the principal obstacle and  the principal concern expressed by Sen. Nunn and other senators, and I would  like to read this pledge, if you want to call it that. Noting the principal  concern of Sen. Nunn and other members of the Senate, relative to my  confirmation as secretary of defense, namely the extent to which I may engage  in excessive use of beverage alcohol, let me state that I have never been an  alcoholic nor dependent on alcohol.  </P> <P> However, to allay any fears or doubts on this matter, I hereby swear and  undertake that, if confirmed, during the course of my tenure as secretary of  defense, I will not consume beverage alcohol of any type or form, including  wine, beer or spirits of any kind.  </P> <P> WILL: Was there a point prior to this pledge, which is a quite decisive one,  was there any point at which you did, you could point to and say: 'There, I  changed.'  </P> <P> TOWER: Yes. Twelve years, I gave up spirits. I used to be a pretty good Scotch  drinker. And I gave up, I haven't tasted Scotch in 12 years. After that I had  only wine. Had perhaps an occasional martini, occasionally a little vodka with  smoked salmon or caviar or something like that. But that was just occasionally.  I really essentially have been a wine drinker. And now, my only consumption is  wine at meals. I don't drink wine even unless I'm eating.  </P> <P> WILL: Now, Sen. Nunn says that it would be unfortunate to reopen these hearings  and put people under oath. Do you, I know you don't want to give the committee  advice, but do you think it would be unfortunate to you? That is, what do you  have to lose at this point, the committee having already . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: I don't think it would be . . .  </P> <P> WILL: . . . voted against you.  </P> <P> TOWER: . . . because I've probably, my reputation and character have been  damaged as much as they can be by the allegations that have already been  floated. So, I have high confidence that, if it were a balanced presentation,  that is to say, if both favorable and unfavorable witnesses were subpoenaed,  that I have high confidence I would come out on top. I think around 400 people  were interviewed in the FBI inquiry. I have been more thoroughly investigated  and more thoroughly scrutinized than any public figure.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Senator . . . by making that pledge today, it seems to me you're  admitting you have a drinking problem.  </P> <P> TOWER: I anticipated that question, Sam, because, in vetting this with some of  my friends, they said that's the spin that would be put on it . . . . No, I  said in the statement that I am not an alcoholic nor have I ever been dependent  on alcohol.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Then why would you make a pledge when you say there's no reason to?  </P> <P> TOWER: Why not? Well, why not make it? It's a small thing to do to allay doubts  and fears. I didn't have to recuse myself on matters of suspension and  disbarment involving former clients of mine. But I did so anyway. I took that  extra step. This is an extra step that is really not terribly significant as  far as I'm concerned. As far as my own personal . . . .  </P> <P> DONALDSON: I must say, senator . . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: It is not an admission. I just . . . .  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Where does it end?  </P> <P> TOWER: Wait a minute. I just read the letter from my doctor who . . . and there  is no proof that I have a chronic problem. And, so, I think that this . . .  nobody has ever accused me of being dishonest and not being a man of my word .  . . and I will live in a goldfish bowl, so there will be plenty of enforcers  out there.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: . . . Now, when allegations are raised that you're a womanizer,  should you take a pledge not to go out with women?  </P> <P> TOWER: I'm a single man. I do date women.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Well, exactly. I'm asking you . . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: I've been a single man for 3 1/2 . . . .  </P> <P> DONALDSON: When you start down this road . . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: What is your definition of 'womanizing,' Sam?  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Well, it's not mine. The accusations . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: Well . . . .  </P> <P> DONALDSON: . . . are made against you and may have no basis in fact.  </P> <P> TOWER: But womanize is a broad term. What is your definition of the term?  </P> <P> DONALDSON: I don't know. I simply . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: Well, all right.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: . . . say to you that if you take . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: Cokie, do you have a definition of the term?  </P> <P> ROBERTS: Well, I think most women have a . . . know it when they see it,  senator. But . . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: Uh-huh. But, you still can't define it.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Sen. Tower, Sen. Nunn said today that he asked whether you would  consent to having doctors inspect you along with your own personal physicians,  to having people who are trained in alcoholism in the medical profession, and  you said: "No." You wouldn't do it.  </P> <P> TOWER: Wait a minute. All I remember of a conversation with Sen. Nunn was after  he viewed my medical report, I guess about a month ago. I suggested that he  could name any doctors that he wanted to interrogate my doctors. Now, that's as  far as it went. And he said he might do that. I did not object to such . . .  but I don't really think that's . . . that would be saying that my doctors are  not men of professional integrity. And there could be another supporting  statement from two other doctors that attended me.  </P> <P> DONALDSON: Well, would you . . . .  </P> <P> TOWER: And, too, wait a minute, friend. Let me add something else, that the FBI  went through my medical records back from 1975 and came up with the same thing,  that there's no evidence. Now, I don't know what an examination by an  independent doctor would tell you other than what's already been said by my  existing medical records. Would it be a psychiatric examination or something  like that? No, I'm not going to submit to that, and why should I? No other  Cabinet nominee has ever been required to do that. Members of the Senate or of  the House are not required to do that. I think that you take my doctors' word  on the basis of their professional competence. And they can be interviewed by  other doctors of the committee's own choosing.  </P></p>

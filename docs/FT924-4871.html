			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / The Kuwait Investment Office: KIO in Spain - where did the billions go? / Over six years the Kuwait Investment Office invested up to Dollars 4bn in building an industrial conglomerate in Spain. It says it has seen no return on the money and large sums are missing. Peter Bruce investigates an affair that has caused a storm over how Kuwait manages its oil wealth THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), the external treasury of the Kuwaiti government, has long had a reputation as one of the world's most powerful, conservative and secretive investing institutions. But in recent months it has found itself at the centre of a growing storm concerning the management of its multi-billion-dollar investments in Spain. The affair has brought the KIO's investment empire in Spain to the brink of collapse. It has provoked a bitter row between the current KIO management and some of Spain's leading banks and businessmen, and has stirred unprecedented criticism of the office's activities in Kuwait itself. It may be about to erupt in litigation, which threatens to throw an unwelcome spotlight on the way Kuwait and its rulers manage their oil wealth and could further damage the KIO's reputation in the financial world. The KIO says that although it has invested up to Dollars 4bn in Spain since 1986, it has seen no return. It also says it now finds itself owing around Dollars 3bn to creditors in Spain, and Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, has told it that its Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, which last year lost Dollars 440m, has a negative net worth of more than Dollars 500m. Billions of dollars, the KIO claims, are missing. 'It is very clear that there has been a major misappropriation of funds in Spain,' says Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, the new chief executive of Grupo Torras. Much remains unclear, amid the welter of charge and counter-charge, about exactly what has gone wrong for the KIO in Spain. Former KIO managers who directed the investment drive into Spain and their Spanish business partners, with whom the new KIO management is now at loggerheads, have a simple explanation. They insist their initial investments were highly profitable, and that the office's Spanish empire only fell into loss as a result of the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the sharp slowdown of Spain's economy. By contrast, their successors who took over last spring, accuse them of having violated the office's conservative investment guidelines by building up a portfolio overloaded with industrial assets that required the KIO to take an unfamiliar direct managerial role. Certainly, the office's investment strategy in Spain differed dramatically from the approach with which it has been traditionally associated - namely, that of a discreet investor in blue-chip international companies such as Daimler-Benz, Metallgesellschaft and Midland Bank. According to the KIO and Grupo Torras records, the KIO spent Dollars 3.4bn over the past six years to build up an industrial conglomerate, Grupo Torras, according to KIO and Torras records. By the time the new KIO management came in last May, Torras employed more than 30,000 people and controlled Spain's largest chemical group, Ercros; its largest paper producer, Torras-Papel; its biggest foods group, Ebro; and its third largest property developer, Prima. The KIO's Spanish adventure was run out of the office's London headquarters by a small circle of senior KIO managers: Sheikh Fahad Mohammed al-Sabah, chairman for more than 20 years and a cousin of the Emir of Kuwait; Fouad Jaffar, general manager; and the KIO's two most senior British managers, Trevor Ball and Bruce Dawson. The story starts in the early 1980s, when the KIO - as investor of the oil revenues accumulated in Kuwait's Reserve for Future Generations, a sort of national pension fund - was trying to diversify from traditional northern European and US markets. In 1983, KIO staff suggested that the office look at Spain, which was set for strong economic growth as European Community entry approached. A year later Dawson was introduced to a small Catalan packaging producer, Inpacsa, that was in need of fresh capital. Inpacsa's biggest creditor was Banco Garriga Nogues, an affiliate of one of Spain's main commercial banks, Banesto. Dawson met the head of Garriga Nogues, an ambitious Catalan named Javier de la Rosa, and decided to spend Dollars 30m on buying control of the packaging company, insisting that De la Rosa stay on the board. That was in November 1984. Before doing the deal, the KIO had run a check on the young banker. It found a sharp financial brain, a family scandal - his father had fled the country after being accused of defrauding the Barcelona authorities in a land development - and a looming disaster at Banco Garriga Nogues. During Spain's banking crisis in the early 1980s, Banesto had passed a number of its riskier loans on to Garriga Nogues. In addition De La Rosa had promoted a costly agricultural development that had turned sour. Garriga Nogues collapsed in 1986 with bad debts of Dollars 800m. 'We knew De la Rosa was in trouble,' says a former KIO manager, 'and we obviously had a maverick on our hands. He was always slightly paranoid, but very likeable.' By 1985 De la Rosa had left Garriga Nogues and begun a private investment career in Barcelona with his own company, Quail Espana. While on holiday on the Costa Brava he met Fahad al-Rashid, chief executive of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) - the body that in theory controls the KIO. The two hit it off and De la Rosa began dealing shares in Spain for the KIA. In 1985 De la Rosa also met Jorge Nunez, managing director of another troubled Catalan paper company, Torras Hostench. Torras, a publicly quoted company, had suspended payments to its creditors under Spanish insolvency proceedings, but nevertheless had cash reserves of Dollars 204m. De la Rosa persuaded Dawson to take a look at the company. With the approval of the KIA, the KIO took control of a 40 per cent stake in Torras. With its cash reserve, Torras then bought Inpacsa, generating a 100 per cent profit for the KIO. The Kuwaitis had 'arrived' in Spain. In March 1987 Sheikh Fahad became chairman of Torras. Fouad Jaffar, Bruce Dawson and De la Rosa became deputy chairmen, and Nunez remained chief executive. The KIO's investments in Spain became a torrent. Within two years the office had built up the biggest industrial group in the country not owned by the government or by a bank. Just a year ago, Peat Marwick, the KIO's auditors, valued these and other KIO-controlled assets at between Dollars 2.9bn and Dollars 4.4bn. This sort of aggressive investment spree was a new departure for the KIO, and not everybody in the Kuwaiti government or in the office itself was happy about it. Some criticism focused on the role of Kuwait's ebullient and energetic oil minister, Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, a cousin of the Emir and first cousin of the KIO chairman who exerted a strong influence over the KIO. The KIO bosses did not agree. Worries about the Spanish adventure, says one former KIO manager were 'stupid'. 'We were a risk-taking organisation and we were making hundreds of millions of dollars with De la Rosa.' The question is: where did the profits go? Until now, that has been the central mystery to all but those most closely involved in the affair. The FT, however, has uncovered the answer: the government's Future Generation account was only partially involved in the creation of the KIO's Spanish industrial group. In other words, the small group running the operation from London was investing from external accounts which the office managed on behalf of Kuwaiti corporate and private clients. In part the use of external accounts was a matter of convenience for the KIO. Had it entered Spain declaring itself a sovereign investor on behalf of the Future Generation Reserve, it might have been subject to close supervision by the Spanish government. But the external accounts also served as a vehicle by which the KIO's clients could take profits they made on share dealing in Spain offshore and avoid tax. This diversion was to become one source of the conflict between the KIO's new and former managers. The external accounts were run by Trevor Ball, who reported on them directly to Sheikh Fahad. They invested through a number of specially established offshore companies, mostly registered in Switzerland. Peat Marwick, the KIO's auditors, identified some of these investment vehicles last year: GSM Securities Management, Montrex and BPS. It appears that it was these accounts, not the Future Generations account, that took the bulk of the profits generated by the KIO in Spain. An internal KIO memo, dated May 14 1990, shows how. It says the Future Generations account had made, until then, just Dollars 24m on share dealing in Spain while 'managed funds', the external accounts, had made Dollars 231m. That is probably an understatement, as the memo's author was a junior and not privy to all the secrets of the external funds Trevor Ball was managing. On whose behalf were the external accounts being run? According to several well-placed sources, some very important investors indeed. One of the accounts, known inside the KIO headquarters as number 11-A, is said to have contained the private investments of a senior Kuwaiti politician. It would not be surprising. Ex-KIO employees are convinced the office would routinely invest on behalf of ministers or of the ruling family. 'There was always al-Sabah money when there were good investments on the go,' says one. The new KIO management does not deny it was running external accounts in addition to the Future Generation account; it says simply that the office's constitution allows it to invest any funds the government tells it to. The external accounts played a crucial role in the construction of Grupo Torras. They were used to build big stakes in target companies whose stock (like most of the Spanish market) was thought to be ripe for big gains. In all this the key player was De la Rosa, who was given a highly lucrative contract that put him in management control of Torras. At the time, only a few people understood exactly what was going on. They may not even have included Grupo Torras itself, which last year asked auditors Peat Marwick to map out how the KIO had operated. It reported in October 1991, as follows: The office would follow advice from De la Rosa and buy into a stock in the name of the external accounts. Then, as the share price rose on rumours of the KIO's purchase, it would sell the stock on to Torras at a profit. Torras, which had in July 1987 launched a Dollars 550m rights issue, would pay for it with this money or bank loans, thus leaving debt onshore while profits were taken by the external accounts in tax havens. In one example, Peat Marwick found that in the second quarter of 1987 GSM Securities Management bought 119,498 shares of the sugar refiner, Ebro, on the markets for Dollars 9.8m and a few weeks later sold them to Torras for Dollars 19m. By one informed reckoning, the KIO's various accounts took Dollars 1.5bn of profits out of Spain. The benefits to the holders of the external accounts were obvious; the advantages to Torras, which was in effect being force-fed shares, less so - at least with hindsight. The hope all along was that Torras would grow into a thriving industrial empire on the back of Spain's economic boom, and be able to repay its borrowings later by selling off assets to hungry local and foreign investors. Sadly, this was not how events were to turn out. By the end of 1989 the office began to show signs of fatigue. It was also coming under great pressure from Kuwait to improve its reporting to the KIO executive committee, presided over by the KIA, which had become nervous about the publicity the Spanish investments were attracting. Investors were also becoming disenchanted with Torras. It had become an almost impossibly unwieldy conglomerate, with an insatiable appetite for rights issues. Its stock price languished accordingly. All this spelt problems for the Kuwaitis, who had become anxious to speed up the sale of some Torras assets in order to repay group borrowings. The KIO's solution, decided on by its executive committee in December 1989, was to take Torras private. 'This should be considered as a first step,' the minutes of the meeting say, 'towards reducing our investments in Spain through the sale of some of Torras's assets with a guaranteed profit.' The delisting took place at the end of that month, but it did not go smoothly. Torras offered its shareholders a mixture of cash and shares in its Prima property group. Unfortunately, these shares - like many in the group - were seriously overvalued. Beta Capital, the KIO's brokers, had earlier warned that the price of the Prima shares would somehow have to be 'guaranteed' if the operation was to work. Thus, a massive price support operation was set in motion to absorb Prima shares after Torras had been taken private. Soon after the Torras 'privatisation', about 40 per cent of Prima suddenly appeared in the hands of companies controlled by people and institutions close to the KIO - Fouad Jaffar and Gerald Hines, a US property developer who did a lot of business with the Office, took about 14 per cent between them. The KIO's advice was that this share support operation was perfectly legal under Spanish law. It was not the only such operation. In 1989 De la Rosa had registered a stake of about 18 per cent in Torras, and, later, one of about the same amount in Ercros, under his own name. The support operations were vital to Torras because its stock and that of its affiliates was being used as collateral to attract bank loans. But if the delisting of Torras was supposed to be the start of a slow withdrawal from Spain - paying off accumulated bank debt with profits from disposals - the strategy went badly wrong. First, criticism of the KIO's activities back home in Kuwait had reached such a pitch that Fouad Jaffar was forced - in March 1990 - to resign as general manager, leaving Sheikh Fahad in day-to-day control. Then came Iraq. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 was a catastrophe for the KIO as well as for the emirate itself. Suddenly, the Kuwaitis needed cash, and this would have to be generated through the sale of many of the KIO's bluest-chip assets. More specifically, the Iraqi annexation was also a serious blow to the KIO in Spain. It stopped the Torras disposal strategy and diverted the office's attention from Spain. Torras began to disintegrate. Following the invasion no investor would touch a KIO company. With the value of their collateral thus threatened, the Torras group's creditor banks began to call in their loans. For the first time, Torras was forced to ask for a direct cash injection from the KIO - of Dollars 400m. A few months later it was to ask for a further Dollars 1.3bn. 'Had it not,' says a Torras memo at the time, 'Torras would obviously have had to declare bankruptcy.' To make matters worse, the KIO is alleged to have sought to use Torras - one of the few substantial companies in the world in which it exercised complete management control - as a source of funds for the emirate's war effort. Former KIO managers claim that up to Dollars 500m was channelled from Torras to the exiled Kuwaiti government - although the new KIO management says this money has not been accounted for and that it regards it as missing. 'Torras was the only way the Kuwaitis could get at their money early in the crisis,' says a former KIO manager. 'It's incredible that the new management should expose one of the best covert operations of the war.' The KIO had become the government-in-exile's only source of funds and it was being run, effectively, by Sheikh Ali Khalifa, by then finance minister, and Sheikh Fahad. Together with Trevor Ball and Bruce Dawson, these two men directed the financing of the war, discreetly selling stock around the world to pay huge amounts being demanded by the US and its allies. The liberation of Kuwait brought great changes to the emirate, mostly centred on diminishing the power of the Emir. One of those changes was a new cabinet and one of the biggest heads to roll was that of Ali Khalifa. His replacement as finance minister, Nasser Abdullah al-Rowdan, quickly set about counting what Kuwait had left. The Reserve for Future Generations, worth Dollars 75bn before the war, had been cut in half. The most obvious haemorrhage was in Spain, and the new finance minister began to lobby for Sheikh Fahad's removal as chairman of the KIO. That was achieved last February, when he was replaced by Ali-Rashid al-Bader, chairman of the troubled Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East. The KIO had changed too. Trevor Ball died in 1991. Fahad al-Sabah is pensioned off and lives in London, as does Fouad Jaffar. Bruce Dawson has retired. In May, al-Bader appointed a close friend, Mahmoud al-Nouri, to run Torras and De la Rosa resigned. From that moment on, al-Bader and al-Nouri have turned the heat up on the old team at the KIO and Torras. They ordered Torras's auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to rework the Torras 1991 accounts, valuing assets at market value and not at cost, which turned a tiny profit last year into a Dollars 440m loss. Both men are clearly convinced that money was misappropriated in Spain, though they say they do not yet fully understand how. The KIO's lawyers, Stephenson Harwood, and Peat Marwick have just completed a long investigation into the Spanish investments and the Kuwaiti government is considering whether to bring legal action against De la Rosa, Jaffar and Sheikh Fahad. 'Our findings point to what appear to be significant irregularities,' says Kenneth Bonavia, Stephenson Harwood's partner in Spain. The current KIO management's complaints of irregularities in its Spanish investments are twofold: first, that the office has never seen profits from Spain; and second, that the large direct transfers from the KIO to Spain after the Iraqi invasion of August 1990 have disappeared. From the FT's inquiries it seems that the first complaint is at best disingenuous: the KIO's own documents show that it recorded profits from Spain being transferred to external accounts offshore, and this was later confirmed in Peat Marwick's report. The second charge is more contentious. Former KIO managers, defending themselves against accusations of impropriety, say monies transferred from the KIO to Torras were swallowed up by the group's losses, resulting from its debt burden, from increasingly difficult trading conditions in Spain, from the problems created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and from the operation to support Torras shares. The current KIO management is contesting the legality of some of the share support operations, although it has repaid a portion of the bank loans which financed them. Any legal action could embarrass powerful figures in Kuwait and expose the fact that the office was investing in Spain on behalf of Kuwaiti third parties. Indeed, as allegations have rained on De la Rosa, he has begun to threaten retaliation. In a statement last week his spokesman said that he had remained silent so as not to 'damage the KIO by obliging it to open its books' in court. If the new KIO bosses have found a mess in Spain, an increasing number of bankers and analysts in Madrid feel their hunt for someone to blame has compounded the problem. Ercros, the chemical company, has collapsed and is in receivership after the new KIO management refused to support it. The Prima property group seems likely to go the same way unless a buyer can be found. Creditors have been told they will not get their money. Last Tuesday, Grupo Torras defaulted on international bank loans of Dollars 400m; they have to be repaid by the KIO, which guaranteed them. Since June, when al-Nouri took control of Torras and began, through public relations advisers, denouncing his predecessors, the value of its portfolio has plummeted. Stock in Ebro, the food group, for example, worth more than Pta2,000 in mid-May, is now worth just Pta965. It becomes a vicious circle. The more the new KIO managers complain there is money missing, the more that the value of their assets falls. 'The KIO is using its Spanish investments to resolve its internal problems,' said Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman of Saffa, the Italian industrial group which owns 6 per cent of Prima. 'It is completely irresponsible. The new managers are at war with the old managers while the (Spanish) companies are being ruined.' Al-Bader, now the KIO president, is anxious to return the office to its old role as a discreet, low-risk trader. But in his rush to extricate his organisation from Spain, he may be further harming Kuwait's reputation with the international financial community. Last week's defaults, for example, were a direct result of the new KIO management's reluctance to restore its Spanish companies to health. Since the Gulf war, Kuwait has become a big borrower, and bankers will be sensitive to the way the KIO treats Torras's remaining Spanish debt. The KIO is in a bind. If it is to recover any of the money it has pumped into Spain, it will have to produce a recovery in the fortunes of Grupo Torras, and that - given the hostility of Spanish banks - will inevitably mean providing it with yet more funds in the short term. If it concentrates exclusively on its quest for retribution against those it believes have betrayed it, it risks losing everything.</p>

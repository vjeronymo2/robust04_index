			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel sags DEPRESSED markets for pulp, paper and wood products brought an 87 per cent drop in MacMillan Bloedel's first-quarter earnings and the company sees little hope of improvement later in the year, writes Robert Gibbens. Net profit was CDollars 3.8m (USDollars 3.27m), compared with CDollars 30m or 26 cents a common share in the first quarter of 1990 when the recession was biting into forest products companies' earnings. Sales were CDollars 678m, against CDollars 781m. After preferred dividends, there were no earnings attributable to the common shares in the latest quarter. Newsprint markets were weak and a price increase posted on January 1 failed to hold.</p>

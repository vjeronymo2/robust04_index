			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee gains fail to take hold Coffee prices surged ahead in early trading taking the market close to the high point reached two months ago after frost damaged the Brazilian crop. But the market lost all of its earlier gains in late trading. The November futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange hit Dollars 4,060 a tonne in the first 10 minutes of trading, to slip back again until the opening of the New York market when it increased its price again. But a wave of selling sent the contract back to Dollars 3,925 a tonne at the market's close - Dollars 28 a tonne lower than on Tuesday. Traders pushed prices higher in the expectation that Brazil will halt its weekly auctions of government coffee stocks. The Brazilian government was expected to confirm last night that the auctions would be stopped as they have failed to dampen domestic coffee prices and curb inflation. The government had planned to sell 7.7m bags of coffee this year - it has already sold 2.7m bags. While sales have stabilised local prices, they have failed to push them down and Brasilia is now expected to review other ways of reducing domestic prices. The stopping of the auctions will be bullish for international coffee prices, according to Lawrence Eagles, softs analyst at GNI, the London brokers. 'Consumers will not have the opportunity of rebuilding stock levels ahead of the expected shortfall in the 1995-1996 crop,' he said. The tightness in supplies will continue to support market prices. But a bout of profit-taking by the investment funds pushed the prices down at the close of the London market yesterday. 'The supply-demand equation continues to be bullish, but the market read too much into it too quickly and moved ahead too fast,' said Mr Robert MacArthur, vice president of tropical trading at Merrill Lynch in New York.</p>

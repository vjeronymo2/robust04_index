			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading With only one full trading day before expiry of futures and options contracts linked to the FT-SE 100 Index, dealers were furiously rolling out positions yesterday, writes Peter John. The situation was intensified by some economic data which pushed the Footsie futures contract for December higher at the outset. December opened at 3,259 and powered up to 3,293 as dealers with short positions tried to roll out their holdings to the contract which expires in March. Those adjustments ensured that the contract traded at a premium of around 7 points above cash, compared with an estimated fair value of zero. It also pushed the March contract to a premium of between 22 and 25 above December, when most houses estimate that it should be at a premium of around 14. Open interest, the number of existing short and long contracts, remained high, although derivatives dealers calculated that there would only be some 25,000 contracts left open by the start of dealing today. Of these, it is expected that between 12,000 and 14,000 will be allowed to expire while the rest will be rolled forward. By the official close, the December contract was at 3,285, a premium of 8 to cash, with 17,292 lots dealt. Some 10,000 of those represented rolling forward to March, which was pushed up to 3,308. In after-hours' dealing, December moved forward to retest the day's high, suggesting that there will be more upward pressure on the markets today. Total traded options volume was uninspiring at 31,079 lots, with Lucas Industries the most active stock option (2,532 lots) as bid speculation returned.</p>

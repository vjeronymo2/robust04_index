			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOE SAYS NELSON SHOULD COACH U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM  </P> <P> Nuggets Coach Doug Moe says Golden State's Don Nelson should be named coach of  the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team without delay.  </P> <P> Moe also said during an interview on Sunday that he thinks it is a mistake to  allow NBA players to compete in the Olympics.  </P> <P> He said Nelson, who went on record last week as saying he wanted the Olympic  coaching job, is suited for the job and should get it.  </P> <P> "I'd give it to him right now and get it over with," said Moe, "because it's a  headache. I'm sure there's a lot of pride and a great honor, but I wouldn't  want to do it. They should just give it to someone who wants it."  </P> <P> Moe earlier had thought he might want the job.  </P> <P> "The more I've thought about it, the more I think Nellie should have the job  right now."  </P> <P> Discussing use of NBA players in the Olympics, Moe shrugged off the argument  that European countries have been allowed to use professional players in the  Olympics.  </P> <P> "What a joke," he said. "Our college system is more professional than their pro  leagues. They're more professional than college? Why? Because they pay their  players? A lot of the college players are getting paid anyway."  </P> <P> "I just feel the pros shouldn't be in it," said Moe. "The system is pretty good  now. Why mess it up?"  </P></p>

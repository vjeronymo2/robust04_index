			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Martin Retail to join market with Pounds 100m tag Martin Retail Group is coming to the market in the autumn via an institutional placing and open offer which is expected to value the neighbourhood newsagent chain at about Pounds 100m. Although the flotation will not raise any money for the group itself, MRG is expected to use its quote and the debt-free balance sheet to expand on the high street and in the convenience store sector. At least 60 per cent of the shares are expected to be placed with institutions. The flotation will mark the end of a difficult period for the group, which has been owned by a consortium of banks for more than two years. 'We will have a more normal share ownership structure which will allow us to take the group forward,' said Mr Rob Leak, managing director. After a brief period under the ownership of Guinness, MRG was sold in 1987 for what has since been acknowledged as an excessive price to an Australian consortium which included News International and Panfida. When Panfida collapsed in 1992, the banks took over Martins. Since then, they have left the management, led by Mr Leak, to expand the product range - into spheres such as off-licences and post offices - and roll out a computer system which eliminates the need for regional managers. MRG will come to the market with 766 branches, including the RS McColl chain in Scotland, and has capacity in its warehouse to take on a further 600. The group intends to expand through acquisition, but will focus on developing its convenience store concept and high street presence. MRG has ambitions to take on high street giants WH Smith and John Menzies. By the first full year of flotation, it is expected to add 100 sites. Since 1992, MRG has raised profits before tax and interest from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 11m. Last year it generated estimated net cash of Pounds 5m, after Pounds 10m in capital expenditure. Analysts estimate profits will rise by at least 10 per cent in the current year. Most expect investors to be drawn to MRG's growth potential rather than its dividend prospects. MRG's sponsors are Kleinwort Benson, and advisers are Barclays de Zoete Wedd.</p>

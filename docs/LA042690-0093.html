			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> All About Eva: Ralphs Grocery Co. was sued by an Eva Gabor, but not the Eva  Gabor, causing the kind of confusion that could only be found this close to  Hollywood. TV news reports Wednesday morning claimed that actress Eva Gabor was  the plaintiff.  </P> <P> Carl Buchberg, the attorney for Gabor the retiree, not Gabor the actress, said  Wednesday his client has a few things in common with the star of "Green Acres,"  but they definitely are not one and the same. The two Gabors spell their names  the same way, are about the same age and both were born in Hungary. Gabor, the  retiree, claims she slipped and fell while shopping at a Ralphs market in Los  Angeles on March 15. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

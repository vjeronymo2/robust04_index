			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Halfway loss at Cockerill A SHARP drop in the demand for steel and its price forced Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steelmaker, into loss in the first half of 1993. The company announced a net loss of BFr3bn (Dollars 85m) for the first six months of the year, compared with a profit of BFr1.3bn in the equivalent period. It suffered a reduction in activity in the principal markets - automotive, construction and distribution - of up to 20 per cent. Prices had firmed following the 'catastrophic fall' in the first quarter of 1993, but the group could not count on an increase in volume in the months to come. As a result, Cockerill warned it was likely to record a similar loss in the second half of the year. Turnover dropped from BFr90.3bn to BFr76.3bn and cashflow from BFr7bn to BFr1.7bn. However, the group pointed out that group net debt was still only BFr5.9bn, compared with BFr4.7bn at the end of December.</p>

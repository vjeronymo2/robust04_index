			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Recovery hopes dealt double blow: Inflation rate rises by more than forecast and manufacturing output declines HOPES of sustained, non-inflationary recovery in Britain were dealt a double blow yesterday with news of a fall in manufacturing output over the summer and a higher-than-expected rise in retail prices last month. Manufacturing output fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in August, confounding City expectations of a 0.4 per cent rise in the month, while the annual rate of retail price inflation quickened for the third successive month to 1.8 per cent in September, up sharply from June's 1.2 per cent low. More worrying for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who meets his ministers and senior Treasury officials tomorrow to discuss his first Budget on November 30, was September's rise to 3.3 per cent in underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, from 3.1 per cent in the year to August. Central Statistical Office figures also showed that growth in industrial production faltered during the summer with manufacturing output down 0.7 per cent in the three months to August 31 compared with the previous three-month period. A confidential Treasury briefing paper leaked by the Labour party last night said manufacturing output would have to grow by about 2 per cent in September to meet expectations of manufacturing output growth of about  1/2 per cent a month in August and September. Yesterday's figures, following closely on Monday's news of a widening UK trade deficit and rising producer price inflation, underlined the fragility of the UK recovery and pointed to a narrowing of Mr Clarke's room for manoeuvre in the Budget. Weak output might undermine any plans for a tax rise to cut Britain's Pounds 50bn annual budget deficit. The increase in underlying inflation to within the top quarter of the government's 1 to 4 per cent target range may limit his scope for a rise in indirect taxes such as value added tax and affect his ability to cut interest rates to offset fiscal tightening. Those conflicting currents were reflected in financial markets yesterday. Gilts and sterling fell sharply on the two reports, reflecting fears of higher inflation and concern about the recovery. They later made up some ground: 10-year gilt-edged stock closed  3/16 points down, while sterling at the London close was  1/4 pfennig lower at DM2.4425. In late New York trading, the pound slipped to DM2.4390. Equities weakened with the FT-SE 100 index down 23.5 points by early afternoon. But share prices later recovered as investors reasoned that the chancellor would now be less likely to raise taxes. The FT-SE 100 index closed at 3,080.9, down 13.8 points. City analysts said the figures were disappointing, but the Treasury and the Bank of England said the recovery was still on track. The Bank said it expected inflation to remain in its target range and recalled that the rise in underlying inflation had been forecast in its August report. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said Britain was still heading for 3 per cent growth in mid 1994 and denied the recovery was dying. 'We never said this would proceed in a straight line,' Mr Dorrell said. Because state pensions and benefits are upgraded according to September retail price inflation, next April's rise in pensions and benefits will be the smallest since the early 1960s. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said pensioners on the basic retirement pension would get just Pounds 1 a week from the upgrading, while their fuel bills would 'also go up by around Pounds 1 a week as a result of 8 per cent VAT on domestic fuel'. The increase in headline and underlying inflation reflected widespread price rises for retail goods, including dearer petrol and secondhand cars.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Realism and the Eurofighter A COMPLETE breakdown of collaborative arrangements for the European Fighter Aircraft is now a distinct possibility. That would present the British government with a formidable dilemma. It would be loath to abandon the project at this stage and buy another fighter. But it also would - or should  -think twice before committing the UK to undertaking EFA production on its own. The German government is clearly set on having no part in the aircraft the UK wants, and the other partners - Italy and Spain - are at best hesitant. In an atmosphere of political and monetary disarray in Europe, there is a temptation for Britain to say boo to the rest and press ahead on its own. The Ministry of Defence has begun testing the waters to see if a solo programme is politically acceptable. For UK manufacturers it may look like the best solution of all. Britain could build it. It could save the extra costs involved in spreading production work among partners in different countries. It could appoint a prime contractor and lessen the risk to the taxpayer. But a UK-only aircraft would still, almost certainly, turn out more expensive because of the shorter production run. The RAF's requirement is 250 aircraft, less than a third of the original EFA programme. Whether the project was worthwhile would depend - as with the Challenger 2 tank which the UK ordered from Vickers last year - on winning export orders from the third world. Inadequate alternatives The less competitive EFA's price becomes, the less objection there will be to an off-the-shelf alternative such as the US F-15. Britain has, after all, bought American fighters before. But the only realistic cheaper alternatives to EFA are all aircraft of 1970s design. The F-15 has a successor, the F-22, but it is well outside the UK's targets for size, weight and cost. EFA's closest European rival, the French Rafale, was designed for different requirements and costs just as much. Britain insists on an aircraft capable of defeating any likely opposition, including - and here its perceptions stand in sharp contrast to Germany's - in overseas military operations. But it has more than military reasons for wanting to hang on to EFA. The UK has more to lose in terms of strategic industrial capability than the other three partners. The widely-touted estimate of 40,000 UK jobs depending on the programme may not be overstated. BAe faces void The collapse of EFA would be the heaviest blow to the industry since the TSR 2 strike aircraft was cancelled by the Labour government in 1965. That project was eventually replaced by the tri-national Tornado, but no such satisfactory outcome can be expected to follow EFA's cancellation. The alternative collaboration partners, the French and the Americans, both have their own agendas for the time being. A future Anglo-French fighter is mooted, but would not materialise until well into the next century. Before then British Aerospace (as if it did not have enough troubles already) would be facing a void at the core of its profit-making military activities. The UK authorities and the industrial partners must take part of the blame for the project's current state. Britain helped to alienate German opinion by pushing its way into leadership of all the programme's main elements. The Eurofighter consortium of airframe manufacturers also made a clear tactical blunder in April by pitching its price for the production phase too high. Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has since staked his considerable political ambitions on his decision to reject the aircraft. However, Britain still has a strong bargaining position. EFA may look precarious without Germany, but without Britain, Germany's counter-proposal of a new collaborative fighter - dubbed the EFA Lite - looks a non-starter. The UK's best interest is to try its utmost to rescue EFA collaboration at least with Spain and Italy, even if that means making some compromises in the aircraft's performance. If collaboration was judged to be imperative in the mid-1980s - when the cold war persisted and defence spending was at its peak - it is hard to see how going it alone can make sense now.</p>

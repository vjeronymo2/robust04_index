			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 3/5/1994 -- "We believe that  some positive results have been obtained and Romania's relation  with Germany is on the right track," said Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Adrian Nastase at a press conference on Tuesday, 3 May,  while assessing the results of a five-day visit in Germany made  by a Romanian parliamentary delegation.    The members of the Romanian delegation consider they  delivered to the German party a clear message stressing the  interests Germany could have in this zone. In reply, the German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his next visit abroad would  be in Romania. According to the delegation members, the German  minister said Germany did not make discriminations between  Romanian and the member countries of the Visegrad Group.    The members of the Romanian parliamentary delegation opined  that Romania's relations with Germany must develop not only at  federal level but also at the level of the lander, especially  the Eastern ones.</p>

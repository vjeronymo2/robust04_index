In spite of the cutbacks involving  5 billion German marks [DM] that were allocated to the  individual ministries on Monday evening [17 January], all  economic risks for the current fiscal year that are discernible  at this point have been covered. Thus, there is no need for a  supplementary budget from today's viewpoint. The data adopted  in the 1994 budget are clearly "credible targets," even though  they were discredited as "faked figures" by Chairman of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Rudolf Scharping,  Waigel told journalists in Bonn on Tuesday.    Scharping's assessment leaves him cold because it comes from  a politician who has proven to be "not very competent" in the  sphere of economics, Waigel stated. He believes the financial  statement at the end of 1993 and the allocation of the DM5  billion cutbacks to the various ministries will create new  confidence in Bonn's economic and financial policy. Thus, the  government had succeeded in completely achieving the targets  concerning the major data of the budget in the last fiscal year  in spite of enormous national challenges. At a net borrowing of  DM67.6 billion, the government has "impressively" refuted the  SPD's claim that the debt will exceed DM80 billion. The  preliminary results of the 1993 tax receipts are about DM2.25  billion higher than the calculations of the "tax estimation"  working group, presented in November 1993. This is a surplus of  DM1.5 billion for the government, which ensures a solid basis  for the 1994 budget as far as receipts are concerned.    Still, the Federal Government will continue its austerity  course when drafting the 1995 budget, which will be adopted by  the cabinet before the summer recess, despite the election  campaign. Thus, Waigel plans to include the cutbacks involving  DM5 billion, adopted at the recommendation of the Bundestag  Budget Committee, in the 1995 draft, too, to induce the  individual ministries to save as much as possible. Regarding  the receipts of the 1994 budget, he proceeds from the premise  that the tax receipts will nominally rise by approximately 4  percent, which was considered feasible by the annual 1994  economic report. Waigel pointed out that he has no other data  than those of the economics minister. Thus, those politicians  from the Free Democratic Party of Germany who regard a  supplementary budget for 1994 even now unavoidable should first  check with their colleague Rexrodt whether their demands are  compatible with the economic situation, Waigel pointed out.    The finance minister confirmed once more that, at DM1.25  billion, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has to carry out the  largest cuts within the DM5 billion austerity package. It will  not be easy for the Bundeswehr to handle that, and therefore a  repetition is not possible. According to Waigel, the other cuts  involving hundreds of millions will fall on the following  ministries and areas: Transportation DM673 million, Berlin aid  DM642 million, labor and social affairs DM500 million, the  economy DM373 million, research and technology DM250 million,  Interior Ministry DM200 million, agriculture DM187 million,  development aid DM145 million, Finance Ministry DM129 million,  and the Foreign Ministry approximately DM115 million. All other  items in the budget are clearly below the DM100- million limit.  Only housing has to save a larger sum -- DM80 million.    The finance minister sees no need for political action  concerning the DM2.6 billion that the compromise of the  mediation committee on the austerity package cost. He believes  that this sum can be compensated for by expenditure cuts or  increased receipts before the end of the year. This also  applies to the costs of the action program for growth and  employment planned by the coalition.    The SPD described the government's budget decisions as  "insufficient patchwork." The budget is a "financial torso",  its economic spokesman, Oskar Lafontaine, stated. He demanded  the submission of an "honest supplementary budget."</p>

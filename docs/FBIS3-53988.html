In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Tunis, he said  the Palestinian leadership is holding contacts with Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi to lead the Palestinian delegation to these talks.  If he refuses, Ghawshah added, Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the deputy  head of the delegation, will lead the delegation in the next  round.    Ghawshah emphasized the importance of coordination and  cooperation among all Arab parties taking part in the peace  talks, as was the case before the signing of the Declaration of  Principles between the PLO and Israel on 13 September.    He said the positive results of the summit held between U.S.  President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad will  have a positive effect on all tracks and will advance the peace  process. He added that the summit results will also have a  positive effect on the Palestinians.</p>

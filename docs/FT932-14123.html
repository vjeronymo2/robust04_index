			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (24): Windows on wider horizons - For Wordprocessors WORDPROCESSORS have come a long way since the early days of the Wordstar package. Once a wordprocessing file mainly included text. Now it has become 'a compound document into which you can paste drawings or spreadsheets, and from which you can send electronic mail (email).' So says Elaine Sharp, messaging server manager at Microsoft (US). Several technologies have helped to change the focus of wordprocessing (WP): WINDOWS. Applications (such as spreadsheets, wordprocessors and graphics packages) written to run under the Windows graphical user interface (GUI) use similar commands and can therefore be integrated closely. WYSISWIG (for what you see is what you get). Sharp says: 'I used to have to print out what I was typing five or six times to get the layout right. Now that the best WP packages let you see the page exactly as it is going to be printed out (including different fonts, bold and underlining), I just print out one copy and sign it.' DESKTOP PUBLISHING. 'The distinction between high-end wordprocessing and desktop publishing (DTP) is becoming blurred,'says John Tuohy, European brand manager for wordprocessing at Lotus Development. 'High-end packages such as Lotus Ami Pro enable the user to combine text and graphics, vary typefaces and adjust the amount of space between characters and lines - features once only available from DTP software.' Sometimes the 'published' document never even sees paper. For example, long engineering documents/manuals are starting to be published on computer or optical disks. PC NETWORKS. The spread of personal computer (PC) networks has created demand for new features. The best-selling Windows WP packages are 'mail- enabled.' This means that a user simply has to select 'send mail' from a menu to convert a piece of text into a mail message. Some packages also allow users to send each other voice notes. As the penetration of PC networks increases, Tuohy believes that users will start to want document management over the network. They will use it, when they are working on a document with colleagues, to find out when a document is in use because it is being revised. Or to search for files across the network, not just on their own hard disks. Roger Whitehead of Office Futures says: 'Although some wordprocessors allow users to annotate a document and pass it to another person working on it, there are relatively few PC products which allow users to work on the same document at the same time. 'Products which enable two or more users on a network to work on the same page of the same document together (handing over control from one to the other) are relatively rare outside the Unix and Apple Macintosh worlds - but this is coming.' As well as changes in WP technology, there has also been a change in the type of person using it. More managers do their own wordprocessing and this has led to a shift of emphasis in WP design. Shelagh Marsh, Microsoft UK's Word product marketing manager, says 'the 1980s were very much the years of the feature wars. Suppliers were packing in features to gain competitive advantage - even if users didn't need them. Now we're concentrating on ease-of-use. 'We spoke to our users and they said 'we've got lots of features, but we still can't get our work done as fast as we'd like to.' 'So we gave several hundred of them 'instrumented' versions of our WP software, which enabled us to track what they were doing. For example, we noticed that people were trying to insert bullet points in front of certain paragraphs. So in Word for Windows 2.0 (launched late last year), we built in a feature which enables users to insert them automatically by highlighting the paragraphs they want to bullet, and hitting the bullet icon (symbol). 'At the moment, we're sitting down with users and trying to find out what it is they need to achieve. For example, many people produce monthly reports by taking last month's report, leaving in the headings and updating it. So in future versions we might include a monthly-report icon which will do this automatically.' THE FUTURE. Marsh believes that 'the information, not the application' is king. People producing a monthly report - see themselves as doing just that. They don't see themselves as doing some wordprocessing, then using a spreadsheet. She expects the barriers between wordprocessing and other applications to break down even further. Using Windows at present, it is possible to embed a sales graph in a wordprocessing file and call up the spreadsheet program in a Window to update it. But version 2.0 of Microsoft's object-linking and embedding technology will allow 'in place' editing. This will make it possible to update the sales graph without calling up a separate Window. However, Marsh points out that as wordprocessing becomes more closely integrated with other applications, suppliers will have to work hard to reduce unnecessary overlap between their products. For example, users don't need a different spellchecker/dictionary for each PC application they use - just one accessible from all. Roger Whitehead says there are two types of wordprocessing supplier: 'splitters' and 'lumpers.' Microsoft is an example of the former. It is concentrating on a nucleus of function and may, for example, sell its spellchecker separately. WordPerfect is an example of the latter. It has just included 80 per cent of basic spreadsheet commands into the latest version of its DOS wordprocessor WordPerfect 6.0 (available in third quarter, 1993), as well as graphics handling and Grammatik grammar-checking software. It has even added Windows-like features, for users who don't want to invest in the more powerful PCs needed to run Microsoft Windows. WordStar also belongs to the 'lumpers' group. Its WordStar for Windows program comes with a grammar checker, Correct Grammar. David Godwin, general manager of WordPerfect UK, believes that 'as WP packages start to handle different types of information - this is not just word or document processing but information processing.'</p>

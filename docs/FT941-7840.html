			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Prices hamper Europe's competitiveness The study raises 'serious issues' about Europe's competitiveness against the US in telecommunications, according to its author. Mr Robert Harrison highlighted the large difference between national and cross-border charges for leasing lines in Europe, and the much higher cost in Europe of renting very high-capacity lines of the kind needed to provide multi-media services. The cost of leasing 1.5 MBit lines between France and Germany was found to be more than double that of leasing similar lines within either of the two countries. The cost of very high capacity lines, providing 34/45 MBit circuits, was also starkly different, costing more than 2.6 times as much as much for a 50km link in the UK compared with the US. Charges were higher still in Germany. Germany also scored poorly in cost terms. The report suggests that its state telecommunications company pays far more than international market prices for equipment, hampering its ability to modernise its network. Mr Harrison said: 'Multinationals, in particular, tend to look at Europe as a whole, not one country, so these differentials must be a cause of concern.' He said they might be a barrier not only to location, but to innovation, because of the need for low-cost broadband capacity to encourage organisations to experiment with new applications.</p>

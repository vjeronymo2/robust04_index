The talks were held at the Institute of Economic Problems of  the Transition Period directed by Gaydar. It lasted for 45  minutes and both officials spoke English. Journalists were not  invited.    A Russian participant in the meeting told Interfax that Egon  Klepsch had asked Gaydar about the role of the State Duma's  committee for international affairs in making foreign-policy  decisions.    Gaydar believes that it would be expedient to use part of  the  European Community's aid for creating efficient economic  legislation and developing a system of economic education. He  also emphasized the importance of promoting the development of  the democratic institutions and supporting the regional  democratic press which, he said, experiences serious economic  problems and suffers from financial dependence on the local  authorities.    Gaydar assured Klepsch that the Russia's Choice faction  would  support Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade. Commenting on the State Duma's position, he said that it  was unpredictable.</p>

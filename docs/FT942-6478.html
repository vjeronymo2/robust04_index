			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Reunion Mining issue raises Dollars 9m Reunion Mining, which has copper and diamond exploration interests mainly in Zimbabwe, has raised USDollars 9m through a placing with European institutional investors, on terms that give the company a market value of Dollars 30m. Its shares are expected to start trading on the Luxembourg stock exchange in mid-June. Most of the money raised will be used to bring into operation the Sanyati mine, 190km west of Harare in northern Zimbabwe. This is predicted to produce 2,500 tonnes of copper annually for the first four years, and then 5,000 tonnes for another six years. Costs will be very low, at about 45 US cents a lb. Reunion will own 75 per cent of the mine but carry all the costs. The rest will be owned by the Zimbabwe government. Reunion is also one of the most active exploration companies in Zimbabwe, concentrating on diamonds. The company says it had completed regional exploration of 43,570 sq km, representing 11 per cent of the surface of Zimbabwe.</p>

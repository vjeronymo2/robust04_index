			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Observer: Talking point A new party game in Ireland is suggesting venues that might break the deadlock on the second strand of the talks on north-south relations. The Irish government wants them to be held somewhere in Ireland itself. Unionists, against travelling to the south while the 'foreign' government has a constitutional claim over the north, want the Dublin government to cross to their capital - London. More serious compromises dreamed up so far include the Isle of Man. More imaginative are a video conference so neither side need leave home ground, and a circling aircraft. My pick is a hot air balloon.</p>

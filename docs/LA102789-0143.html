			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> POLICE GIVE WARNINGS ON MINOR WARRANTS  </P> <P> A new Costa Mesa police policy allows people caught with outstanding  misdemeanor warrants to get a warning rather than a trip to jail, a top police  official said Thursday.  </P> <P> Under a policy adopted by the department, only people who received a warrant  for skipping an appearance in Harbor Municipal Court will get hauled off to see  the judge, Police Capt. Tom Lazar said. All others are simply warned to clear  up their warrants and set free, unless officers from the department that  originally arrested them want to come and get them.  </P> <P> Without the change of policy -- it was quietly instituted about two months ago  -- Costa Mesa officers would have to drive prisoners wanted for violations in  other jurisdictions directly to County Jail, sharply reducing patrol time,  Lazar said.  </P> <P> For years, Costa Mesa officers avoided the drive and wait at the central jail  by simply dropping off warrant violators at Harbor Court. There, all of those  whose warrants were issued in other Municipal Courts would be held in a  marshal's lockup to await a sheriff's bus for a ride to jail.  </P> <P> But during the summer, the Sheriff's Department stopped providing the bus  service for warrant violators.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said the service was stopped because the  prisoners would have to wait hours before receiving medical checks upon their  arrival at the main jail. Without the checks, the Sheriff's Department could be  exposed to legal liability if a prisoner were later found to be seriously ill  or injured.  </P> <P> Harbor Court handles cases originating in Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Irvine.

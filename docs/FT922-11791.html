			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / US-EC strategy agreed to break trade talks deadlock THE US and the European Community yesterday agreed on a new strategy to try to break the deadlock over agriculture that is bedevilling completion of the Uruguay trade round. Having exchanged what were described as 'new ideas' at a meeting in the White House yesterday, the two sides committed themselves to try to reach an agreement on agricultural subsidies by the end of June. Neither would disclose what the proposals were and both agreed that no dramatic 'breakthrough' had been achieved yesterday. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said it was obvious that the US-EC impasse over agriculture was holding up a new global trade liberalisation pact. There was, he said, 'too much at stake' in the talks - within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) - to allow this impasse to remain. The US and the EC, he declared, 'are not in a mood to pull back'. In particular, he said he had made clear to President George Bush that, regardless of the Uruguay Round, the EC was committed to reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). This would entail, he said, smaller financial subventions, lower farm production, more farm imports and fewer farm exports. On this basis, the EC could make further proposals, as long as they were matched by concessions from the US. Mr Bush responded that he was now convinced that the EC was ready to go for an early settlement. Right up to the White House meeting, which also included Mr Anabal Cavalco da Silva, prime minister of Portugal and currently head of the EC council of ministers, US officials had publicly doubted that Mr Delors had brought to Washington a European consensus. Even afterwards, some US reservations were apparent. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said that, though she was 'more optimistic today than yesterday', Mr Delors still 'wants us to move further and his side to move less'. The EC's apparent willingness to depart from the agreed Uruguay Round text, drafted by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt secretary general, was a concern, she added. Mrs Hills was even reluctant to characterise anything the EC delegation had proposed as 'new'. Asked specifically if the EC had again raised the so-called 'blue box, safe box' scenario, which would allow certain EC farm subsidies to continue for another six years prior to a phase-out, she replied 'those are the parameters we have always discussed,' implying that they had been re-stated. Mr Delors, however, though insisting that it was 'still more my wish than my prognosis', argued that an EC-US agreement on agriculture by the end of June 'means we can relaunch a discussion in Geneva on all the other subjects' in the Uruguay Round draft. It emerged that at the White House the trade discussions focused only on agriculture. Other general topics covered included the situation in Yugoslavia, aid to the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. Keating warns of Pacific trade bloc; Bush senses new ideas, Page 8</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Mysterious Lilli - Fiction IN A HOTEL GARDEN by Gabriel Josipovici Carcanet Pounds 12.95, 148 pages XANTHIPPIC DIALOGUES by Roger Scruton Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15.99, 277 pages THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT by Robert McCrum Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 225 pages SINGLE people often have a surrogate family, the sort now called nuclear, good listeners over the washing up, reassuringly domestic. 'Fish Pie', the second chapter of Gabriel Josipovici's In A Hotel Garden, consists almost entirely of dialogue over a family supper, with interruptions from the sharp-eared son. Even the adult talk is elliptically plain although, like ordinary chat well recorded, it suggests what may or may not be, what happened or did not or might have done. Ben has been on holiday in the Dolomites and, back in London, is telling his friends Fran and Rick about it: well, something about it. Earlier, walking the dog, he has told Rick how his girlfriend Sand left him straight after the holiday and, with relief, he disposed of the debris in black plastic bags. Narrative then tells more of what happened on the holiday, a meeting with Lilli, a Jewish woman on her way home from Siena, where she was looking for her grandmother's past; a great mountain walk with her; Lilli's stay in Siena, reliving a family farewell made final by the Holocaust. Of all this, Lilli's Jewishness in particular, Ben understands little, though he feels much and guesses something. Lilli's experience of the hotel garden in Siena, and Lilli herself, remain mysterious to him, glowing with some inner importance, some experience of ineffable pain, some perhaps misunderstood metaphor. This extraordinary book can be read in an hour, but it glows on in the senses like the rock on the postcard Ben sends his friends that, touched by the setting sun, glows in the darkness. Almost without descriptions except of landscape in the mountain walk, it offers a kind of otherness in which each question leads to another, each door opens, like the hotel door onto the garden, onto other lives, memories and cultures, asking complex, endlessly circular questions. Roger Scruton's Xanthippic Dialogues, a riotous send-up of scholarly writing, can be read in two ways. You can read the footnotes, which are numerous and often long, ignoring the text but ending with the index, which of course will take you back to it. This index is said to be compiled by one of Flann O'Brien's creations, HP de Selby, and needs cryptographic talents, since most of its names do not appear in the text, only echoes of them, internal quotations, hints and ideas. Or you can read the text, supposedly discovered in modern times, under odd circumstances. Socrates' wife Xanthippe, Plato's mother Perictione, his sister Potone and his nurse Castollux, Praxiteles' model Phryne and assorted ancient Grecian ladies are assembled to rethink and humanise our philosophical past and put the record straight. Each is a vivid character, Xanthippe vividest of all: not a shrew or a harpy as history remembers her, but a sympathetic, sharp-witted, clear-eyed companion to the less than heroic curmudgeon she calls Socks. If philosophy seems an unlikely subject for comedy, try this. Robert McCrum's The Psychological Moment suffers by comparison with two such companions, having neither numinous qualities like the first nor scholarly fun like the second. Of course plain realism may produce as good a result, but in this case it seems inadequate for its subjects - betrayal, grief and guilt. It is an upmarket thriller about dirty tricks in Northern Ireland and, because the narrator went to live in America when he was nine and grew up to become one of Jimmy Carter's speechwriters, it is written in American English. Dense and often confusing in its action it has Sam Gilchrist, born Seymour le Fevre, writing an account of things that happened years earlier, a task of filial impiety made possible by his father's death. For the first chapters, when it is impossible to know what weight to give people and events, things remain uninteresting - near names, places and historical signposts: not mysterious, simply a jumble of fictional facts. But later they pick up character, the pace quickens and its Anglo-American view of English life throws new light on familiar places. It may be faint praise, since it clearly aspires to more, to call it a good read; but so it is.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Airline pilots' union appoints head-hunter BALPA, the British Air Line Pilots' Association, has appointed a head-hunter to help it find a general secretary. The move is highly unusual among British unions - most elect leaders from their own members or officers. The Balpa post has been vacant since the death in August of Mr Mark Young, who had held the post since 1974. Mr David Sears of St James's Management Recruitment, the agency appointed by Balpa, said the salary was Pounds 45,000. It was seeking candidates with negotiating ability - gained either as a union official or in industrial relations.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (7): A crash course in running the country - Andrew Gowers finds it easier to predict what an ANC government is not likely to do to the economy SELDOM can a liberation movement have been through such a fundamental political learning process as the African National Congress has undergone in the three years since Nelson Mandela was released from prison. Seldom can an opposition party have shed so much ideological baggage or been so confronted with the limits of its power before taking office - and in no area more than that of economic policy. Not surprisingly in the circumstances, it is easier to predict what an ANC-dominated government is not likely to do to the economy than what its economic priorities will be. To judge by the policy guidelines adopted a year ago and somewhat wishfully entitled Ready to Govern, wholesale nationalisation of the big private-sector business groups - centrepiece of ANC strategy in socialist exile - is out. So, in the light of the state of the government budget, is a drastic expansion in public spending. What remains may look perilously - or pleasantly, depending on your point of view  -like more of the same. A European investor with social democratic sympathies would have difficulty taking exception to the sentiments expressed in Ready to Govern: a mixed economy, redistribution, social partnership involving business and trade unions, sustainable growth - the whole guided by case-by-case pragmatism rather than doctrine. But he or she would also be hard-pressed to discern a distilled economic programme in which choices have been made, options costed and priorities set. The men who run the ANC's economics department are not much more enlightening. Mr Trevor Manuel, economic policy supremo, sketches out eight main areas which the organisation is studying - industrial strategy, trade and foreign investment policy, anti-trust laws, 'special treatment' for the financial sector, land reform, the government budget, monetary affairs and regional economic policy - but is vague on the details. Even on the central issue of the role of the state in the economy, the ANC has left its options wide open. Its document says that a future democratic South Africa will consider: Increasing the public sector in strategic areas through, for example, nationalisation . . . ; Reducing the public sector in certain areas in ways that will enhance efficiency, advance affirmative action and empower the historically disadvantaged . . . Such hedging is not difficult to explain. For as Mr Derek Keys, the finance minister, has relentlessly reminded the ANC and all his other audiences over the past year, the next South African government will in large part be confronted with the same economic constraints as bedevil the present one: static or negative growth, sluggish investment, a bloated and inefficient civil service, an external account squeezed by debt service payments, and the struggle against inflation. What is more, ANC policy-makers know full well that their only chance of breaking out of this vicious circle lies in re-establishing economic confidence, and for this they need to reassure both South Africa's powerful business community and the international financial institutions, whose approval will be vital in reintegrating the country into the world economy after years of sanctions and isolation. If one places these prerequisites alongside the pressures for tangible change - for example in jobs, housing and basic social services - on which the ANC is riding to power, the scale of the challenge becomes dauntingly obvious. Mr Tito Mboweni, chief economist, acknowledges that the international investment community is already uppermost in the ANC leadership's mind. Once a multi-party transitional executive council to oversee elections is in place, or before, the organisation will call for the lifting of international sanctions, and for the opening of formal relations between South Africa and the IMF and World Bank. 'We want their overall stamp of approval,' Mr Mboweni says, 'the kind of working relationship that will send a signal to private investors that we are pursuing policies that are not unsustainable.' This need above all underlies the cautious noises emanating from Shell House  -the ANC's headquarters - about fiscal policy. Mr Manuel insists that an ANC-dominated government will not seek a dramatic expansion in the overall budget, but will try to secure elbow-room to develop its own spending programmes through improving efficiency and trimming in other areas. 'If we say that there isn't much room for manoeuvre in the budget in its present form, we're being defeatist,' he says. 'But we're not talking about throwing money at the problem.' Even if savings on the scale Mr Manuel envisages are obtainable, however, he admits that the pressures for increased spending are potentially overwhelming. 'There is a clamour,' he says. 'People want to know how the quality of their life will improve after an election. So we have to build a consensus in the areas where we can affect the maximum tangible change in the shortest possible time.' Such quick fixes will be hard to identify. So will effective measures to deal with what the ANC believes to be the central structural problem of the South African economy: the concentration of power in the hands of a few large white-owned conglomerates. 'The ANC is not opposed to large firms as such,' says Ready to Govern. 'However, it will introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies in accordance with international norms and practices, to curb monopolies, continued domination of the economy by a minority within the white minority, and to promote greater efficiency in the private sector.' Mr Manuel says his organisation has been working on such a policy with experts from the US, the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission. But details have yet to emerge, and some leading businessmen suspect this exercise is merely an elegant way of disguising the retreat from nationalisation. Indeed, perhaps the best indication of the distance ANC economic policy has travelled in the past three years is the relatively relaxed attitude towards a future power-sharing government on the part of the business community. Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries, the country's largest consumer goods producer, expresses a view widespread among English-speaking businessmen when he says: 'We've not had good economic management in this country for 45 years of National party rule, so I'm not frightened by the prospect of a new government.' Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the former chairman of the Anglo-American/De Beers group and doyen of South African business, agrees: 'Certainly, I think this will be a government with which businesspeople can work comfortably. We've had a good deal of experience working with very, very difficult governments in Africa - a great deal more difficult than I think this one is likely to be.' A leading banker adds: 'Internationally, there is now an accepted code of economic conduct that is conducive to growth. I have no reason to believe that the new leadership will not adhere to that.' In all this, there is perhaps more than a little complacency, derived from the general expectation that the ANC will be slower in wielding real power than in assuming office, and from the strong hope that for the first few years at least someone like Mr Keys will retain a hand on the economic levers. The demands and expectations surrounding a new government, however, may mean that such confidence turns out to be misplaced, at least in the longer term. However sincere the ANC may be in vowing to subject itself to the disciplines of international capital, however vehemently it preaches the need for sustainable economic growth as well as redistribution, it will also face enormous pressure from its constituents to deliver once in power. The trade unions will want a say in industrial restructuring; their members will complain about the slow pace of black economic advancement or about uneven access to capital; the masses will cry out for government spending on expensive programmes such as township electrification. It would not be surprising if at some point the ANC and its only half-reconstructed allies in the South African Communist Party felt the urge to intervene more radically in the economy than its present reassurances suggest.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: THREE QUESTIONED IN PHILLIPS CASE  </P> <P> Police in San Diego questioned but did not arrest three construction workers  Friday in connection with an attack on Charger nose tackle Joe Phillips outside  a Mission Beach restaurant.  </P> <P> The men voluntarily submitted to questioning for about 30 minutes each before  being released, Sgt. Pete Munholand said.  </P> <P> The men, all San Diego residents, were not arrested because they are  cooperating with investigators and are not likely to leave town, Munholand  said.  </P> <P> Phillips was released Friday from Sharp Memorial Hospital after suffering a  concussion, a broken bone around his eye, a broken nose, cuts and bruises in  the attack. In a statement, he offered for the first time his account of the  incident, which occurred early Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> Phillips said that after he and an unidentified woman left Saska's restaurant  on Mission Boulevard, a car pulled up as they walked, and words were exchanged  between men in the car and the woman. The men then got out, Phillips said,  began yelling and pushed the woman to the ground.  </P> <P> At that point, Phillips said, two of the men came at him and he was hit in the  back of the head and fell.  </P> <P> "The next thing I remember is looking up, seeing the girl being held by at  least one of them," Phillips said. "And then I remember getting kicked, and  then I went out. The next thing I remember is walking up to the ambulance.  </P> <P> "All I was saying was, 'Come on, let's get in the car and get out of here.' I  wasn't interested in fighting at all. I'd never seen them before. . . . It was  completely unprovoked."  </P> <P> Phillips is expected to be out of the Chargers' lineup for eight weeks.  </P></p>

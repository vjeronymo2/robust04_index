			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: LA QUINTA'S BRANNAN SHINES IN SHADOW OF STAR  TEAMMATE  </P> <P> Heather Brannan of La Quinta High School hasn't had much time at center stage.  She has spent most of this season waiting in the wings.  </P> <P> But when you're a teammate of Amy Jalewalia, it's difficult to steal the  spotlight.  </P> <P> Brannan's role was increased Friday night in the Southern Section 4-A girls'  basketball final. Brannan, The Times' Athlete of the Week, had 25 points and 14  rebounds in a 72-62 victory over West Torrance.  </P> <P> "She was active and took advantage of her opportunities," Coach Kevin Kiernan  said. "Sometimes in big games, Heather doesn't get mentally into it. I think  she gets a little scared. She tends to stand around and watch sometimes."  </P> <P> That's easy to do when you play on the same team as Jalewalia, who averaged 32  points a game this season. Jalewalia scored 32 points in the championship game.  </P> <P> At times, Brannan and her teammates have let Jalewalia do the bulk of the work.  However, in the championship game, Brannan felt that had to change.  </P> <P> "I knew Amy would have a great game, but whatever the rest of us did would put  us over the top," said Brannan, a 5-foot-10 junior forward.  </P> <P> West Torrance double- and sometimes triple-teamed Jalewalia, which left Brannan  open. She responded by making nine of 18 shots.  </P> <P> "Any time Heather comes through, it takes the pressure off me," Jalewalia said.  </P> <P> It wasn't the first time Brannan has come through for the Aztecs.  </P> <P> Earlier in the season, Kiernan suspended Jalewalia one game for disciplinary  reasons. With Jalewalia out, Brannan picked up the slack.  </P> <P> She had 37 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists as La Quinta defeated  Pacifica, 73-18.  </P> <P> Brannan, who has been on the varsity since she was a freshman, averages 15  points and 12 rebounds. But because Jalewalia graduates this years, Brannan  will have to do even more next season.  </P> <P> "Let's put it this way: if Heather doesn't come back, then I don't come back,"  Kiernan said. "She's going to be the franchise next season."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Tammy Blackburn of Brea-Olinda scored 12 points in a 50-33 victory over Palos  Verdes for the Southern Section 3-AA championship Wednesday. Blackburn held  Palos Verdes' leading scorer, Lisa Humphreys, 10 points below her 15.4 average.  </P> <P> Robyn Camarillo of Mater Dei scored a goal in a 2-0 victory over Santa Barbara  Saturday in the Southern Section 3-A soccer final. Olivia DiCamilli of Costa  Mesa scored only nine points in Wednesday's 3-A championship basketball game  against Rancho Alamitos, but eight were in the fourth quarter en route to 51-49  victory.  </P> <P> Heather Brannan  </P> <P> La Quinta High School  </P> <P> * Position: Forward  </P> <P> * Height, Class: 5-10, Junior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Brannan had 25 points and 14 rebounds in a 72-62 victory over West  Torrance in the Southern Section 4-A championship.  </P> <P> * Season: Brannan is averaging 15 points and 12 rebounds.  </P></p>

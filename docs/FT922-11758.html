			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: JP Morgan set to lead manage public offering J. P. MORGAN is destined to become the first US commercial bank since the 1930s to lead manage a public offering of common stock when it underwrites the forthcoming flotation of an 18 per cent stake in Riverwood International, a paperboard and packing company. The bank's role as lead underwriter was revealed on Tuesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. No date for the offering has been set. The underwriting will be the biggest step so far in the dismantling of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which established a clear division between securities and banking business after the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression. In recent years US financial regulators have gradually allowed commercial banks to participate in securities and investment banking business. In January 1989 the Federal Reserve granted banks the authority to underwrite debt securities, and in September 1990 J. P. Morgan was allowed to underwrite stock offerings. Until now, however, no bank has lead underwritten a stock issue, although J. P. Morgan and Bankers Trust have participated in offerings as co-managers. Although securities companies have lobbied against attempts to dismantle Glass-Steagal, they have failed to persuade regulators that J. P. Morgan, a blue-chip name with one of the banking industry's strongest balance sheets, should not be allowed to participate in equity underwriting. Securities houses have been protective of their equity underwriting franchise because lead managing an initial public offering is one of the most profitable businesses.</p>

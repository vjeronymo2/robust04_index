			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Allstate to float 88m shares ALLSTATE, one of the largest property-casualty insurance companies in the US, said yesterday it planned to float up to 88m shares on the stock market, in what would be one of the largest initial public offerings (IPO, the US term for a flotation) ever seen in the US. Allstate's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed a maximum offering price of Dollars 26 a share. The company is wholly-owned by the Sears, Roebuck retail and financial services group. If all the shares were sold to investors, they would represent around 20 per cent of the group's equity. Sears, Roebuck, which announced plans last year to spin off substantial parts of its financial services business, would retain an 80.1 per cent interest in Allstate. The Illinois-based insurer, badly hit by heavy catastrophe claims last year, will use the proceeds from the IPO to shore up the capital base of Allstate Insurance Company, its main operating company, and repay short-term borrowings. Allstate made a net loss of Dollars 825m last year, against a Dollars 723m profit in 1991. Had Hurricane Andrew losses and accounting changes been excluded, Allstate's profits would have stood at Dollars 1.17bn. Of the 88m shares being floated, 68.5m will be offered to US investors, while 10m will be sold outside the US. A further 9.5m will be available to US underwriters in the form of over-allotment options, and up to an additional 1.5m shares for international underwriters. If the over-allotment options were exercised in full, Allstate would have 450m shares outstanding. The Allstate IPO is the third element of Sears' retrenchment from the financial services industry. The company has sold a 20 per cent stake in Dean Witter, Discover, netting about Dollars 800m, and has said talks with potential purchasers of its Coldwell Banker real estate business are at the due-diligence stage.</p>

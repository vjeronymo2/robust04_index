			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Hebron report urges segregation at prayers Jews and Moslems should be completely segregated at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, where 29 Palestinian worshippers were murdered by a Jewish fanatic four months ago, and Jewish worshippers should be banned from carrying weapons at the site, an Israeli inquiry into the massacre recommended yesterday. The Commission of Inquiry, which investigated the February 25 slaughter at the Hebron mosque, cleared the government and senior military and police officers of any personal blame for the incident, which inflamed Arab-Israeli tension and delayed implementation of the peace process. The inquiry said Dr Baruch Goldstein, the man who fired 111 bullets into Palestinians kneeling in early morning prayers and was then beaten to death by survivors, acted alone - contrary to the testimony and allegations of several Palestinian witnesses. The five-man commission blamed insufficient security precautions, indiscipline of Israeli guards at the mosque and poor co-ordination between police, border police and the Israeli army. The Ibrahimi mosque, once a gothic crusader church, was built on the site on the Tomb of the Patriarchs or Cave of Machpelah - the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham (Ibrahim), Isaac and Jacob and is intensely holy to both Arab and Jew. The report was welcomed by the cabinet, minister of police and army chief of staff but condemned by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. 'I don't think that the act in the Hebron mosque was an individual act,' said Mr Nabil Shaath, Palestinian 'minister' for international co-operation. 'The Israeli government and the policy of (Jewish) settlement carry complete responsibility for this ugly crime.' Hebron municipality, which described the report as a 'whitewash' also accused the Israeli government of continuing to 'oppress' Palestinians by refusing to re-open the mosque and the central market. Col Moshe Givati, former army commander of Hebron, also questioned the report. 'The commission points at a series of faults but finds no-one responsible - this is impossible,' he told Israel radio. However, by recommending segregated prayers and prohibiting Jews carrying weapons the commission clearly points to the fallacy which underlined Israeli security operations at Hebron: that Jews were at risk from Arab attacks and not vice-versa. 'It was never expected that a Jew coming to pray at the mosque would open fire on Palestinians,' said Gen Shlomo Gazit, former military co-ordinator in the occupied territories. Gen Gazit said the military and police had never made contingency plans for such an event because it could not have been foreseen. However Gen Gazit, who was in charge of Hebron when Jews first re-settled there after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, said: 'The writing was on the wall for a long time. If you allow two different religions to pray in the same place and these two religions are in a political, ideological and religious conflict then this calls for trouble.' Gen Gazit said he personally recommended that new security precautions be taken at other religious sites where Jews and Moslems mingle such as the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; the ancient synagogue in Jericho and the tomb of the prophet Samuel.</p>

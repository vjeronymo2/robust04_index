			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE BUDGET PANEL USES WINDFALL TO PAY FOR PARED PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Helped by an unexpected $2.5-billion revenue windfall, the Senate Budget and  Fiscal Review Committee agreed on a nearly $50-billion state budget Tuesday,  voting to spend nearly all of the new money on programs recommended for  cutbacks by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The spending plan, passed on an 11-0 vote, is conditioned on the satisfactory  conclusion of negotiations under way between the governor and legislative  leaders on a variety of complex budget issues.  </P> <P> The committee-approved budget cannot be implemented unless Deukmejian and  leaders of the Assembly and Senate, who have been negotiating in private for  weeks, reach an agreement in the next week or two.  </P> <P> The overriding problem facing Deukmejian and legislative budget writers is that  the state is prevented from spending the bulk of the tax windfall because of a  constitutional limit on government spending approved by voters in 1979.  </P> <P> "There needs to be agreement quickly on a revenue plan that will support the  budget," said Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), the committee chairman.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Alquist and the Republican and Democratic budget writers who  sit on his committee showed that they have been listening to their  constituents. Under intense pressure from mental health groups, hospital and  medical associations, county governments and others to restore the cuts  proposed by Deukmejian, the legislators did just that.  </P> <P> The recommended cuts were contained in the $47-billion proposed budget that  Deukmejian sent the Legislature in January. The governor's budget did not  anticipate the $2.5-billion revenue windfall that state finance officials say  has developed because of stronger-than-expected income tax payments from  individuals and corporations.  </P> <P> The bulk of the proposed new spending in the committee-approved budget --  nearly $1.5 billion of the $2.2 billion that Senate lawmakers want to add to  the governor's budget -- is in health and human services programs.  </P> <P> Alquist said most of the programs have "been underfunded for many years."  </P> <P> Deukmejian's budget proposals generally fared badly, but that was especially so  in the $27-billion health and human services portion of the proposed  $49.7-billion budget put together by the committee.  </P> <P> For one thing, the committee rejected the Deukmejian plan to make up for cuts  he proposed in various health programs by using new tobacco tax revenues  generated by Proposition 99. The committee voted to ignore the governor's  proposed cuts and spend $400 million more than he wanted on the programs. It  decided to spend the tobacco tax revenues on a variety of other health  programs.  </P> <P> A budget subcommittee headed by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) earlier voted  to increase the amount going to immigrant education programs by $100 million  over the amount proposed by Deukmejian. The subcommittee also voted to augment  county health programs for the working poor by $70 million, and it recommended  the complete restoration of the $34.6-million budget of the Office of Family  Planning, which administers grants to local agencies that dispense birth  control and other information to the public. Deukmejian wants to abolish the  agency.  </P> <P> The committee's version of the budget also restores $232.9 million to provide  4.6% increases in basic food and housing payments to welfare recipients and  aged, blind and disabled persons receiving supplemental income assistance from  the state.  </P> <P> And the proposed spending plan would add $97 million to state-supported  research, treatment and education programs to combat AIDS, increase spending on  mental health programs by $180 million, and provide an extra $140 million to  county Medi-Cal programs. Homes providing foster care would also receive a  budget increase of $25 million, enough to increase their allotments from the  state by 4.6%.  </P> <P> Since the recent surprise discovery of the extra tax revenues, Deukmejian  Admininstration officials have indicated that the governor may be willing to  back away from some of his more severe budget cuts. But they have made it clear  that future decisions are directly linked to the negotiations under way between  Deukmejian and leaders of the Senate and Assembly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Proposed Changes  </P> <P> On the bargaining table are proposed changes to the voter-approved cap on state  spending; possible amendments to Proposition 98, the landmark initiative that  guarantees public schools and community colleges a fixed share of the state  budget, and a proposal to raise $20 billion over the next 10 years for  transportation projects.  </P> <P> Since the state is operating at near the legal spending limit, it does not have  the authority to spend the bulk of the windfall money on general state  programs. Law requires that surplus revenues either be given to public schools  or rebated to taxpayers.  </P> <P> The committee action sets up the final phase of budget deliberations that will  lead to approval of a budget for the new fiscal year that begins July 1. The  full Senate is scheduled to vote on the budget Thursday. The Assembly Ways and  Means Committee will complete its version of the budget today, and a floor vote  by the full house probably will be taken next Monday.  </P> <P> Differences between the two versions of the budget will be hammered out by a  conference committee that will begin deliberations during the middle of next  week. The Legislature has until June 15 to complete its work on the budget, but  it has missed its deadline five of the last eight years.  </P></p>

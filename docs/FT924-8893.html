			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Whitehall averts earmuff war THOUSANDS of Whitehall staff due to transfer to the private sector in contracting-out deals will have the right to claim tropical kit, earmuffs and fur hats from their new employers. An internal memo to the NUCPS Civil Service union reports the Treasury Solicitor's advice that companies which win contracts to provide public services will usually have to honour all 11,099 paragraphs of the three-volume Civil Service code that documents staff terms and conditions of employment. Civil servants had feared they would lose their rights to allowances under the code. When working anywhere in the tropics or tropical conditions they can claim for special kit, but they may claim their Pounds 10 for earmuffs or the hire of a fur hat only when working in Moscow or St Petersburg. Closer to home, the code allows staff to claim 80 per cent of the fees for studying with the Open University and take special leave for training courses in youth leadership. Many of the terms in the code are comparable with what the best private-sector employers offer, but the NUCPS said it was 'delighted' with the Treasury Solicitor's advice because it believed 'a lot of cowboys will be scared off'. The memo is certainly cold comfort for contractors who have usually sought to meet efficiency targets by cutting wage costs. Some companies are likely to be deterred from bidding for contracts because about 80 per cent of the cost of government services is labour. Potential contract bidders have been warned about a European directive which means that they will not normally be able to cut the pay and conditions of staff trans-ferring to the private sector and that they may also be liable for accumulated redundancy pay. The government had argued the Acquired Rights directive only protects staff transferring between 'commercial ventures', but last week it amended the UK regulations in line with the view of the European Commission that all staff are covered. In accepting that the UK regulations did not comply with the directive the government may have opened the way for thousands of claims for damages from those who have lost jobs, pay and conditions in contracting out since 1983.</p>

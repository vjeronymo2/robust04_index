			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> CYPRESS MOCK-COUNSEL COURTS SUCCESS  </P> <P> They made the motions when they had the notions, and as a result, the  mock-trial team from Cypress High School is headed to the state capital.  </P> <P> The 14-member team will represent Orange County at the state mock-trial  competition April 5 to 7 in Sacramento, having won the right by defeating Santa  Margarita High School in the county final in December.  </P> <P> Mock-trial teams from Cypress are no strangers to success. Two years ago the  team won both the county and state competitions and last year finished second  in the county.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, Cypress will go up against teams from more than 30 other  schools, each representing its county. The winner of the state competition will  qualify for the national competition in May in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> "I know we've got the talent to win, and if we're all doing our best, we'll  knock 'em dead," said Amy Vaughn, a junior member who serves as a witness for  Cypress.  </P> <P> "One thing, whether we win or lose," Vaughn said, "I'm positive that our team  will have a great time in Sacramento."  </P> <P> The mock-trial program, in its ninth year and with 48 high schools competing on  the local level, is sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation, a  nonprofit organization founded by lawyers and others 28 years ago to educate  students about the legal system.  </P> <P> The students in mock trial portray defense and prosecution attorneys as well as  witnesses on both sides of each case that is tried.  </P> <P> In December's county final -- a culmination of a season's worth of eight rounds  of competition -- the Cypress team represented the prosecutorial side of a mock  case involving issues of gun ownership and homicide. The case was tried before  Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary L. Taylor and two other judges.  </P> <P> The Cypress team, including mock lawyers Lori Uyeno, a senior, and Jyoti Nanda  and April Balangue, both juniors, received information about the case in  October, giving it four weeks to prepare for its first competition.  </P> <P> The students put in more than 180 hours in practice sessions, which often  required sacrificing social and study time.  </P> <P> The other team members are seniors Alice Ho (pretrial attorney), Karen Ahlstedt  (witness), Angela Banchi (witness), Keri Bogdanovich (witness), April Lott  (witness) and juniors Stacey Brooks (witness), Lydia Kim (witness), Elise  Tiregol (witness), David Brown (clerk) and Chris Walters (bailiff).  </P> <P> The Constitutional Rights Foundation recently honored two members of the  Cypress team. Uyeno was named the county's outstanding attorney and Ho the  county's top pretrial attorney -- an honor won by Cypress students for three  consecutive years.  </P> <P> Marc Rozenberg, who works out of the district attorney's office in Santa Ana,  has volunteered his time during the past four years to work with the Cypress  mock-trial team. He has been joined recently by attorneys Dan McNerney and  Jerry Johnston.  </P> <P> John Gruendyke, coach of the Cypress team since its beginning five years ago  and teacher of history at the high school, is grateful for the help.  </P> <P> "I have three things to credit for the success of our program," he said. "The  kids, the attorneys and the judges who hear the cases.  </P> <P> "I think it's terrific that these people, with their hectic schedules,  volunteer their time to work with the kids."  </P></p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Brazil corruption hearings strain party Senior politicians from the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), the country's largest party, are holding talks which could lead to a split in its ranks ahead of next year's presidential elections. The talks reflect worries that the party has been seriously harmed by corruption hearings which are under way in Congress. The hearings, which have accused several leading PMDB figures of corruption, are also seen to be helping the presidential ambitions of Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the candidate of the left-wing Workers Party (PT). Politicians from the PMDB's so-called 'ethical' wing, which has not been tainted by the hearings, are considering whether to try to link with the country's other centre-left party, that of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister. The alliance would then be likely to support the presidential bid either of Mr Antonio Britto, a PMDB minister, or Mr Cardoso. Such an alliance is complicated by regional factors. In states where both groups are strong, for example, one side would need to agree not to run candidates in congressional and gubernatorial elections, also set for next year. But, according to some PMDB figures, an alliance is the best way to split from the competing wing of the party, which has been involved in the corruption allegations and is controlled by Mr Orestes Quercia, the still powerful former governor of Sao Paulo state. In the hearings, investigating allegations of corruption schemes involving funds from the government's budget, five of the eight main individuals so far accused come from Mr Quercia's faction. Any alliance would probably have to be agreed before Christmas, in order to comply with election rules on party affiliation. The shortage of time means the two sides may agree to an unwritten understanding rather than a formal alliance. However, opinion polls released yesterday suggest the party needs to act quickly. Since August the popularity of 'Lula', as the PT candidate is known, has increased by four percentage points to 31 per cent. His nearest likely contestant is Mr Paulo Maluf, the right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, with 12 per cent, while Mr Cardoso is stuck on 7 per cent.</p>

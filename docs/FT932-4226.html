			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: Artistic life of Athens transformed - Max Loppert confirms his initial impression of the Megaron Mousikis Athenon Athens has acquired for itself one of the great arts centres of Europe: of this there can now be not the smallest doubt. The Megaron Mousikis Athenon, a superbly finished building which sets its two differently-sized performance halls amidst airily handsome white-marble foyers, has transformed the artistic life of the city. Everyone you meet says so, in tones of passionate conviction characteristic of the born-again believer. I first visited the Megaron in May last year, some months after the centre had been inaugurated. An invitation to make a return tour of inspection last week revealed previously missing finishing touches now in place. The magnificent organ in the Friends' Hall (the 2,000-seater) will shortly be in action. Beautifully planted gardens have been opened for concert-interval strolling. A well-ordered buffet restaurant in the basement operates for post-performance dining. Every detail - apart, perhaps, from the slight shortage of leg-room in upper-tier seating - seems precise in purpose, exactly executed, un-ostentatiously right. The practicability of the Megaron, which was designed to place up-to-date technology at the service of all the various purposes for which the building was intended, is a remarkable achievement - and, in the light of the various impracticable opera theatres and concert-halls that have recently been unveiled elsewhere in Europe, one rather too obviously exceptional. Its flexibility was fully demonstrated during my two-day sojourn. On my first morning the Friends' Hall was a conference venue for the presentation of the annual Onassis Awards (worth Dollars 100,000, and given this year to, among others, Vaclav Havel and Peter Brook). That evening it was a music-theatre space, with an orchestra pit opened out front-of-platform, for the semi-staging of a Gluck opera. The next evening the side-boxes of additional seating had been slid back into position, the pit was closed and on stage the full Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Claudio Abbado was assembled for a concert of Schubert and Mahler symphonies. Two thematic strands dominate seasonal programme-building at the Megaron: these two successive events exemplified them. A 'Great Orchestras of the World' series is the first strand. The Berlin Philharmonic concert was its concluding and, indeed, culminating item: this is the first of the world's super-elite orchestras to appear in the Megaron, and its playing of the Mahler Fifth Symphony drove the Athens public into ecstasies. These were easy enough to understand. In a hall of such marvellously well-balanced, responsive acoustics, where the full range of Mahler scoring device is permitted to 'sound' with ideal clarity and exactitude of perspective, the Berlin orchestral ensemble was displayed in all its glory. A nit-picker might sense, as I did, that in middle age Abbado has loosened his grip on Mahlerian symphonic drama - memories of LSO Mahler performances suggest, perhaps unfairly, that he now tends to dull its cutting edge of irony, soften its lyrical contours, make less jagged its heights and depths. But under his musical directorship the great qualities of an orchestra for so long thought of as 'Karajan's band' are certainly not lost: the Athens concert hall experience proved as much. The second seasonal strand is the cyclic representation of a figure from Greek mythology - last year Electra, this year Helen, next year Medea - by means of operas, plays, symposia, lectures and other related events. Strauss's Aegyptische Helena (with Anna Tomowa-Sintow) had a full-scale staging last month; a brand-new Greek opera entitled The Return of Helen and the Euripides play Helen are due in the next few weeks. Alongside these, the choice of Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride (in which Helen figures only tangentially, as the offstage provoker of the various tragedies visited on the house of Agamemnon) rather than the admittedly less well-known Paride ed Elena (in which Helen is the heroine) proved distinctly odd. Nevertheless, since the performance itself was a triumph of restrained yet passionate Gluck interpretation, and had clearly an overwhelming effect on the huge audience, excuses for its addition to the Helen cycle were in the end unnecessary. Ellen Shade (Iphigenia), Francois le Roux (Orestes), and Donald Kaasch (Pylades) led the eloquently expressive cast; the Austrian Concentus Vocalis choir and the English Chamber Orchestra were conducted by Marc Soustrot. There was no scenery to speak of. The chorus stood in serried ranks, the singers moved on and off a central dais, changes of lighting played on the organ in the background. One of the supreme examples of opera-as-drama economy was rendered with extraordinary accuracy, tact, directness and emotional force. As always happens in successful operatic accounts of this sort, one came away brooding about the amount of fuss, tat and wasted effort that goes into the average modern opera production.

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Peps help boost unit trust sales to record Pounds 9.1bn A record Pounds 9.1bn was poured into unit trusts last year against a background of sharply rising UK share prices. With base rates at their lowest for 16 years, many private investors have been turning away from building societies to unit trusts, sales of which jumped from only Pounds 648.9m in 1992. Private investors accounted for Pounds 5bn of the total sales, with demand fuelled by personal equity plans, offering tax-free returns. More than 60 per cent of the sales to private investors were through Peps. The record unit trust sales had been achieved by the end of September 1993, when the figure reached Pounds 6.91bn, topping the previous high of Pounds 6.33bn for 1987. Base rates have fallen from 15 per cent in 1989 to 5.5 per cent. However, the steepest falls followed Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. Since then, base rates have been in single figures and private savers have been searching for new homes for their money. Many unit trusts - pooled investment funds - offer returns equal to, or greater than, the income from building society accounts. 'The recession has not been about people having no money but about having money and not spending it,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Warburg Securities. 'People have been paying off their mortgage and, with deposit rates so low, unit trusts and personal equity plans have been a powerful combination.' Building societies, which reaped the benefits of high interest rates in the late 1980s, have had to fight for private investors' money against competition from National Savings and equity-based products. Last year, they recorded a net inflow of Pounds 2.2bn - a significant advance on the very weak 1992 figure of Pounds 295m - but lower than the Pounds 6.6bn and Pounds 5.8bn received in 1990 and 1991 respectively. That compares with net sales of Pounds 391.6m and Pounds 2.8bn for unit trusts in 1990 and 1991. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said that while some of the money leaving building societies was undoubtedly finding its way into unit trusts, he was concerned that the last time unit trusts had had their greatest inflow was just before the stock market crash of 1987. 'I am not sure just how long the steep rise in the market will continue,' he said. The FT-A All-Share, which measures the performance of the UK's 800 leading quoted companies, has risen by more than 23 per cent since the beginning of 1992. However, Mr Paul Walton, UK investment strategist at stockbrokers James Capel, said: 'Individuals are making provision for the longer term. It is fear - rather than greed - that they might not be provided for in the future.'</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA  </P> <P> Christophe Boutin, a French artist working in Los Angeles, is engaged in a  curious attempt to yoke a couple of opposites: ponderously symmetrical lead-  and gold-covered wooden rectangular framing elements and biomorphic  drip-covered paintings executed in a muted and deliberately restricted palette.  The results manage to be neither visually satisfying nor intellectually  provocative.  </P> <P> Arranged in massive steplike formats, the lead and gold blocks suggest an  inert, would-be grandeur. The canvases look grimly programmatic, like a  humorless attempt to prolong the legacy of Clyfford Still. Some of these pieces  also contain arrangements of three-dimensional gold letters -- some placed  upside down or on their sides -- none of which seem to spell out a legible  message. Another group of works -- executed at Boutin's 71 rue Blanche address,  as the titles proclaim -- involves pairs of gold foil-wrapped letters of the  alphabet (the foil is partially peeled away, like boxed chocolates ransacked by  idle hands) superimposed over brown-toned photographs, mostly of male heads and  wire fences.  </P> <P> There might be issues of identity or language buried somewhere in this piece,  but Boutin isn't giving anything away. His fondness for gold -- which also  surfaces in a lone bell glass-encased sculpture and in another piece containing  multiple copies of the gleaming invitation card for the show -- comes across as  little more than a vacuous fascination with luxe. A viewer thinks of ormulu  objets in a pretentious apartement, and fails to see the rigor behind the  gesture. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to July 1.)CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

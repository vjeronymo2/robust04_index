			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Observer: Lady Bradbury's A question for banking history buffs. Is the Darcy Bradbury, who is doing all the borrowing for the US Treasury, any relation to the late Sir John Bradbury, the former UK Treasury chief whose main claim to fame is that he signed a series of Britain's bank notes which came to be known as 'Bradburys'? The normally helpful Bank of England is strangely quiet about this episode in its history which dates back to the outbreak of the first world war in August 1914, when there was a run on gold coin in circulation. Why the Treasury felt it had to issue its own notes is glossed over in the Bank of England's voluminous history books. Surely, the Bank did not refuse? Whatever the reason, the Treasury had to print its notes on postage stamp paper because the Bank of England owned the only supply of banknote paper. The US Treasury, by contrast, has never had to put up with such tomfoolery since its Treasury secretary insists on signing his country's bank notes. Who knows, if Darcy gets promotion she may be able to carry on the fine Bradbury tradition one day.</p>

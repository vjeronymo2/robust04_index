			<p>BFN     [Text] South Korean firms are canceling plans to place  orders with North Korea to process raw materials for light  industrial products as the U.N. Security Council is moving to  impose economic sanctions against the communist country.    According to officials of the nation's leading general  trading companies, the U.N.'s move is forcing them to refrain  from continuing the limited form of cooperation between them and  North Korea.    A typical form of cooperation now is South Korean firms  sending material for light goods, including textiles and toys,  to their North Korean partners for processing.    The officials said domestic companies which have done  business with North Korea in this way will stop trading with the  country if the West-led economic sanctions materialize.    Samsung Corp., a trading arm of the Samsung Business Group,  is expected to abandon a project commissioning its North Korean  partner to produce low-end apparel, said Chong Chin-chol, who is  responsible for the firm's business projects with the North.    "Despite the nuclear issue, we have thus far promoted  economic cooperation between North and South Korea. But, in the  future, we will respect any decision by the Korean Government  concerning economic sanctions against the North," he said.    However, Chong declined to comment on whether Samsung Corp.  will stop contacting North Korean Government's officials in  third nations or not. Through an agent in Beijing, the firm has  kept a close communication channel with high-ranking Pyongyang  officials.    Hyundai Corp., a trading arm of the Hyundai Business Group,  is also expected to stop importing $2 million-worth of zinc  plates and scrap iron from the North until it completely  abandons its nuclear program, a Hyundai official said.    Along with the two general trading companies, Daewoo Corp.  has already decided not to import steel ores and coals from the  reclusive communist nation, said Mun Ki-hwan, a manager of the  company.    In addition, the trading arm of the Daewoo Business Group  will no longer be involved in any processing contract with its  North Korean partner for textile production as long as the  country tries to go nuclear, Mun said.    With the West coming perilously close to the precipice of  sanctions against Pyongyang, Lucky-Goldstar International Corp.  has decided to reserve projects to commission its North Korean  firms to produce apparel and audio speakers, an official said.    In 1993, inter-Korea trade fell 6 percent to $200 million  from $213 million in 1992 mainly because of Pyongyang's shortage  of foreign exchange and the nuclear issue which cooled overall  inter-Korea relations.    To reserve such indirect trading projects with North Korea  will never bring South Korean businesses huge damages, said Kim  Yong-sin, a manager of the Inter-Korea Trade Department at the  Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA).    However, Kim expressed worry over the fact that if South  Korean businesses stop trading with North Korea because of the  West-led sanctions, it'll take a long period of time for them to  revive trade relations with the North in the future.</p>

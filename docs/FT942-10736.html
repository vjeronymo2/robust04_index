			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Early this week, the bund market is likely to suffer repercussions from Friday's sharp increase in yields on US government securities, triggered by data showing faster than expected growth in US employment. In theory, the bund market should move independently of US Treasuries, as German interest rates are due to fall further, in stark contrast to the US where further rate increases are now expected. However, the German market will need proof of the course of German rates and will watch the outcome of this week's repo rate operations to see whether the Bundesbank is prepared to let this key rate drop substantially from its 5.41 per cent level. The nearer the repo rate moves to the discount rate - currently standing at 5 per cent - the more the market will be convinced that further cuts in the discount rate are imminent. The Bundesbank's policy-making council meets on Wednesday, brought forward a day because of a public holiday on Thursday. Few expect the German central bank to seize the opportunity to cut the discount rate - the consensus is that the next cut will come later in the month at the earliest - but the Bundesbank may stay true to its habit of cutting rates when the markets least expect it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. Arde] </F>   [Text] Port Shepstone April 7 SAPA -- The Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] is forging ahead with arrangements  for this month's elections in Natal/kwaZulu and does not think  they should be postponed, IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke  said on Thursday [7 April]. Speaking to reporters after meeting  local IEC officials in Port Shepstone, Mr Moseneke said: "For  better or for worse there will be voting stations for those who  want to vote."    He said he respected the right of people not to vote, but  added: "Let it be peaceful."    Mr Moseneke was speaking at the start of a tour of  Natal/kwaZulu to assess the prospects for free and fair  elections. He said although an IEC technical committee had  disclosed this week that conditions were adverse for free and  fair elections in certain parts of the region, the commission  was pressing ahead to ensure voting took place.    "We want to go ahead and establish a government  representative of all of us."    Mr Moseneke said the whole of Natal/kwaZulu was not a no-go  zone. There were areas where voting was possible. "One shouldn't  speak in absolutes."    He said part of his mission was to make plans to ensure  people in volatile areas were able to vote. The tour would focus  on election readiness, determining locations for polling  stations, securing people to staff them, and security  arrangements.    Natal electoral officer Thabani Jali said after the Port  Shepstone meeting the province was not "very problematic...but  there are flash-points".    Of the seven districts in the greater Port Shepstone area,  only two or three had been identified as flash-points.    Mr Jali said one of the IEC's plans was to put more polling  stations in areas around flash-points.    Although the IEC trip was announced as a two-day affair, Mr  Moseneke's programme states he will fly to Johannesburg at the  weekend and return to Natal for three days next week.</p>

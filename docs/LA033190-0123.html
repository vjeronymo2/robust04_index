			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CATHOLIC CHURCH FAILS TO ATTRACT BLACKS TO CLERGY;  </P> <P> RACE: WHILE LATINOS, BLACKS AND OTHER NONWHITE GROUPS MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF  THE CHURCH'S MEMBERSHIP, WHITES WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE ITS LEADERSHIP  NATIONALLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church in the United States, which has struggled for several years  with public allegations of racism, got more bad news recently: Blacks  interested in becoming priests or nuns drop out of their religious training at  a higher rate than other races. While Latinos, blacks and other nonwhite groups  make up more than half the Catholic population, whites will continue to  dominate church leadership nationally in the near future.  </P> <P> These findings and others on church vocations were presented last week by the  Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate of Georgetown University.  </P> <P> More than 200 people listened to the results of surveys of religious  communities throughout the United States and of Jesuit schools and colleges in  New York state. Later they heard black, Latino, Asian and native American  speakers talk about their frustrating, often lonely experiences in the  53-million-member U.S. church.  </P> <P> A few positive surprises showed up in the data, according to research fellow  Sister Eleace King, such as a relatively large proportion of Asian women  training to be church leaders. But the news from minorities, particularly black  Catholics who make up about 4% of the Catholic population, was not good. Among  the findings:  </P> <P> * Black males constituted 7% of 2,279 students enrolled in high schools that  prepare students for the seminary, 2% of those enrolled in seminary colleges  and 1% of those getting higher degrees in theology. Latino males made up 31% of  high school students, 13% of college students and 4% of the future theologians.  Whites made up 58% of the seminary high schools, 80% of the colleges and 93% of  the seminaries. "Virtually all our new theologians in this church will be  white," King said.  </P> <P> * Among women training to be nuns or sisters, the changes were not as dramatic.  The proportion of black women who had taken temporary vows was the same as  those in the first stage of training -- 3%. Latino women made up 11% of those  in the first stage, 5% in the final, and white women made up 78% of the first  stage, 83% of the final.  </P> <P> A survey of the attitudes of young men in Jesuit schools in New York state  toward the priesthood and toward their church revealed some interesting  differences among ethnic groups:  </P> <P> * When asked whether mandatory celibacy was a serious obstacle to going into  the priesthood, 83% of the whites, Latinos and Asians said yes, compared to 48%  of blacks. Blacks rated the white church culture, high admission standards and  inadequate knowledge about priestly life as other key obstacles.  </P> <P> * More than half the respondents said they had never been asked by a Catholic  adult to consider the vocation of priesthood -- a finding noted by King as  untapped potential. "Significantly," the report said, "black respondents are  much less likely to have been asked than is the case for Latinos, Asians or  whites."  </P> <P> Auxiliary Bishop Joseph A. Francis of Newark, asked at a symposium to give the  church's response to the needs of ethnic communities, read from a report  written six years ago by the 10 black bishops titled "What We Have Seen and  Heard." Page by page, the report delineated the problems and challenges facing  blacks and other minorities in the church.  </P> <P> "These words have not had the impact we had hoped," Francis, a former Los  Angeles-based priest, said in summation. "I get so angry. People ask why are  there so few African Americans in the Catholic church? I used to answer them.  Now I just smile."  </P></p>

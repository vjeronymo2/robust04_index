			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The general staff of the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT]  has categorically refuted allegations that the forces were  responsible for the obnoxious and gratuitous murder of three  persons including a member of the Action Committee for Renewal  [CAR] who had just been elected to the National Assembly. The  FAT believes that the sole purpose of these accusations is to  tarnish its image. Kouakou Tovie has more details.    [Tovie] The FAT's reaction, published today by the Army  headquarters in a statement of clarification, reads as follows:    For some time now, it has become common practice for those  whose objective has always been to discredit, divide, and  destroy our Army, to make gratuitous allegations against the  FAT. Any time a man in military uniform commits a crime,  evil-minded and unscrupulous persons blame such crimes on the  security agencies, and yet everyone is aware that on several  occasions the law and order agencies have arrested organized  groups dressed in Army uniform, who were involved in criminal  activities such as armed robbery, murder, hold-ups, sabotage,  and terrorist attacks. More than once, such criminals have been  arrested and turned over to the Justice Department. It will be  recalled that searches carried out in the residences of some  politicians on 10 and 31 January led to the discovery of fatigue  dresses and green and red berets.    The FAT, which remains committed to its traditional mission  of protecting the territorial integrity of the country, warns  all those who use military uniform to indulge in criminal  activities with the intention of denting the image of the Army  against such action. The forces reiterate their commitment to  democratic principles and to their desire to live in peace and  total harmony with all other sections of the population.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OAK PARK;  </P> <P> LITTLE RADON FOUND IN TRACT'S 1ST TEST  </P> <P> Extremely low levels of radon have been found in an Oak Park condominium whose  owner is the first to test for the gas since Pardee Construction Co. reversed  its earlier position and allowed customers to do so.  </P> <P> The developer had prohibited the test and for two years had required customers  to sign disclaimers releasing it from liability if the gas was later found.  </P> <P> But the company reversed its position after the state Department of Real Estate  ordered it earlier this month to stop selling homes while officials reviewed  the disclaimer.  </P> <P> Frank Hall hired a geologist to test the site, and results show low levels of  the substance in his condominium in the Capri subdivision on Lindero Canyon  Road.  </P> <P> Geologist Donald Carlisle said the average level of radon was 0.5 picocuries  per liter of air. The Environmental Protection Agency lists 4 picocuries per  liter of air as potentially dangerous.  </P> <P> Hall said he wanted to take precautions because, after learning that Pardee was  asking customers to sign radon disclaimers freeing the company of liability, he  became fearful that Pardee was hiding a problem. He said he was also suspicious  because the developer was prohibiting customers from conducting their own radon  tests before the sale was completed.  </P> <P> Pardee officials have said that they know of no radon problems in any of their  subdivisions. They were merely asking customers to sign the disclaimers as a  precaution, officials have said.  </P></p>

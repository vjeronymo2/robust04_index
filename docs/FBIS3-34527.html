He made Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto the target of  his criticism and used very harsh words. He said: Ms. Benazir  Bhutto is turning away from realities. She has forgotton the  atrocities committed on her own people and has lost touch with  the culture of the subcontinent. She has also ignored the  virtues of benevolence of Pakistan and India as well as of all  religions. Otherwise, she would not have ordered the police to  open fire on her own mother, brother, and kith and kin, who had  gathered to pay homage to her father, the late prime minister,  Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.    Shankar Dayal Sharma deserves respect for being the  president  of India and because of his diplomatic stature. But, he did not  maintain the dignity of his post nor did he fulfill the demands  of diplomtic norms. There is no justification for him making  the person of Benazir Bhutto the target of his criticism.  Benazir Bhutto and the Government of Pakistan have expressed  solidarity with the people of Kashmir. They raised their voices  of protest against the Indian occupation forces for perpetrating  atrocities on Kashmiris and also informed world public opinion  of the calamities and hardships befalling the Kashmiris. Do not  the heart-rending facts produced by all neutral international  organizations, human rights organizations, and mass media on the  human rights violations in occupied Kashmir bear testimony to  India's belligerant stand and its oppression of the Kashmiris?  What did the Indian president unravel by referring to the 5  January incident in Larkana wherein only one person was killed?  All the newspapers in Pakistan carried full details of the  incident. The occurrence of the incident as well as the motives  behind it do not remain hidden in any quarters. Can the Indian  president cover up the massacres of thousands of Kashmiri men,  women, and children? Can he deny the burning up of scores and  hundreds of houses there? Obviously, he cannot do so. Is it the  culture of the subcontinent to sidetrack from the pledges made  at the time of the adoption of the UN resolutions to implement  them? Is the forcible occupation of any region against the will  of its people tantamount to the observance of the ideals of  goodwill? For the information of the president, the Larkana  incident, wherein only one life was lost, was the outcome of the  clash between two groups of people. Neither the government nor  the local administration has anything to do with it. Indian  atrocities in occupied Kashmir are being discussed in all the  world fora. What a terrible and abominable culture is it  wherein Indian troops are committing excesses on the defenseless  people of occupied Kashmir and are crushing their bodies, lives,  and their human rights as well!</p>

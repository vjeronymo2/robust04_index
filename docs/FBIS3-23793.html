			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Shumakov, academician of the Russian </F> Agricultural Academy, and Aleksandr Kolganov, deputy minister of  the Russian Ministry of Agriculture: "Is a Rainbow Over the  Fields Something Necessary?"]    [Text] It has already been over a decade that certain  scientists, writers and journalists have been carrying out a  massed offensive against land reclamation policy. First on the  scale of the former USSR, and now in Russia. As a result the  USSR and RSFSR ministries of land reclamation and water  resources were utterly devastated, followed by the USSR Ministry  of Water Management Construction and the Vodstroy State Concern.  The sector has been practically eliminated in Russia itself. The  Main Administration of Land Reclamation and Water Resources,  which has survived under the Ministry of Agriculture, the  Vodstroy Joint-Stock Company and the Rosselkhozvodstroy and  Tsentrinzhselstroy corporations now unite water management  construction and planning organizations only on a voluntary  basis.    Moreover, it was found that in comparison with other  sovereign states that formed atop the ruins of the great  country, the Russian Federation has the smallest percentage of  reclaimed agricultural land (11.5 million hectares, to include 6  million hectares irrigated and 5.5 million hectares drained).  But not only has this foothold not enjoyed any growth in the  last 3 years, it has even decreased by more than 1.2 million  hectares. This has been due to indiscriminate abandonment of  reclaimed land as a result of higher taxes on it and continually  growing operating expenses. Things can get worse--the need for  financing all reclamation work only out of local budgets has  recently been pondered intensively in government circles. If  such a policy is adopted, in the next 3 to 5 years Russia's  reclaimed land will be practically eliminated.    The natural question that arises is this: Does Russia need  such land anyway? Could it be that the need for it was  substantiated by ignorant scientists and specialists who saw  only personal gain in the development of land reclamation?    Let's look at history to get a dependable answer. According  to available documents, development of land reclamation in  Russia goes back more than four centuries, while planned  irrigation and drainage did not begin here until the last  century, in the reign of Nicholas I. A hundred years ago the  Department of Land Improvement, the first state body dealing  solely with the problems of land reclamation, was established in  the Ministry of Agriculture. At that same time, at the end of  the last century, large expeditions were organized under the  leadership of famous specialists and scientists such as I. P.  Zhilinskiy, M. N. Annenkov and V. V. Dokuchayev. As a result  irrigation and drainage systems that were large for those days  appeared in different corners of the country.    We can divide the Soviet era into a prewar period of  peoples'  reclamation projects, when a number of large systems were  created in Central Asia and Russia, and two postwar periods--up  to 1953 and after 1960. At that time land reclamation was  carried out practically in all regions of the former USSR, but  to the greatest extent in republics such as Uzbekistan,  Tajikistan, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Azerbaijan,  Ukraine, Belorussia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It must be  said that there were failures as well, due to inadequate  justification of some projects. These mistakes led to secondary  salinization, swamping and overdrainage of part of the land,  exhaustion of springs, and the advent of the Aral ecological  crisis.    In Russia itself, irrigation was developed in the Northern  Caucasus, along the Volga and in Western Siberia, while drainage  projects were carried out in the Nonchernozem Zone of the  European territory and in Siberia. The relatively small amount  of reclaimed land has until recently provided for the production  of 100 percent of the rice, 80 percent of the vegetables and 80  percent of rough fodder. In other words the contribution to  agricultural production has been substantial.    Returning to the question raised in the article's title,  let's now consider the experience of highly developed foreign  countries.    The 15th International Congress on Irrigation and Drainage  was held in September 1993 in The Hague, with 80 countries  participating. For the first time in the last 30 years, Russia  was not officially there as the successor to the former USSR.  Sad, but true.    It was noted in the general report given by John Hennessy,  president of the International Commission on Irrigation and  Drainage, that irrigation and drainage remain the sole  dependable means of stabilizing and intensifying agricultural  production in the 21st century, providing for execution of the  food program of developing countries. This was the road traveled  in the past by the United States and Germany. Reclaimed land now  makes up over 60 percent of agricultural land in these  countries, while in the Netherlands it is as much as 80 percent.  This is believed to be the optimum ratio here, and there are no  plans for increasing the area of reclaimed land in the next 5-10  years. On the other hand emphasis is now being laid on the work  of operating and rebuilding existing systems, raising their  ecological safety and reducing their energy-intensiveness.  Developing countries must make use of the modern technical level  of reclamation to carry out their food programs.    The congress examined two questions. The first concerned  establishment of systems of a new generation distinguished from  former ones by their ecological safety and resource-conserving  nature. This means economical use of both natural (land, water)  and economic (capital-intensiveness, energy-intensiveness,  metal-intensiveness etc.) resources.    The second question had to do with the forms of financing of  reclamation work. It was noted that in all developed and  developing countries investments are financed both by the state  budget (70-80 percent) and with assets from municipalities and  farm associations. Moreover construction of water intakes,  reservoirs, major canals and pumping stations is proceeding only  at the expense of the state budget, while projects at the farms  themselves are financed both by the state budget and with assets  of the farm associations.    State low-interest loans are being granted for  reconstruction  and reorganization of systems in commercial farms. Then, after  the client's work is 70 percent completed, loans are paid off by  the federal government.    In comparison with the countries discussed above, Russian  agriculture is in more complex climatic conditions. The  country's southern regions are subjected to frequent droughts,  while the central and northern sections are distinguished by  excessively wet farmland. This means that experience should not  be carried over blindly: Our climate and our economic resources  need to be considered. Simple arithmetic shows that in order to  establish stable and highly productive agricultural production,  we need to subject an area of 30-35 million hectares of land to  reclamation--that's 20-25 percent of all agricultural land. When  done in integration with other forms of land improvement  (forest, biological, chemical, erosion control), this can  successfully solve the problems of producing feed with a  balanced protein concentration, as well as sugar, vegetables,  fruits and other valuable food products.    But let's be realistic. In today's economic conditions it is  impossible to consider extensive development of land  reclamation. Maintaining the land we already have, transforming  it somewhat in correspondence with the agrarian reform, and  rebuilding and reorganizing farms must be the priority objective.    Russia does of course need reclaimed land! But the kind that  would have a caretaker, and would support stable, highly  productive production of ecologically clean products.</p>

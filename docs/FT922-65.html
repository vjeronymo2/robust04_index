			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Councils near to white-collar deal BRITAIN'S local councils moved close to a pay deal with 750,000 white-collar workers yesterday as union leaders recommended that rises of between 4 per cent and 4.4 per cent were the best achievable through negotiation. The proposal will set the tone for talks covering 1m blue-collar workers. It would raise the pay bill by 4.1 per cent, although an earlier settlement covering residential social workers will add 0.2 per cent.</p>

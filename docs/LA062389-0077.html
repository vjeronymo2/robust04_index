			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: CITATION CAUGHT THE BRASS RING IN THE GOLD CUP  </P> <P> I guess the greatest horse race I will ever see was the San Juan Capistrano at  Santa Anita between Noor and Citation in 1950.  </P> <P> There are those who think Citation was the greatest race horse of our time and  I could be one of them. But he never could beat Noor.  </P> <P> Most horsemen thought it was a shame. Citation bent a hoof after winning the  Triple Crown in '48 and was laid off a year. When he came back, they were  afraid he wasn't quite himself so they took him out to California for some easy  money.  </P> <P> I was at Santa Anita the day he arrived, walking off the train at the siding  there, and the trainer, Jimmy Jones, a round-faced little man who smiled a lot,  was fussy about who came around him.  </P> <P> "Are you really going to run him?" I wanted to know.  </P> <P> Jones laughed. "We didn't come out here to put him in the Rose Parade," he  said.  </P> <P> Actually, they came out here to make him the first million-dollar horse. Big Cy  had earned $865,150 at the point where he broke down and his owners, Calumet  Farm, figured getting the rest from the Hollywood horses would be a lock.  </P> <P> I learned a lot hanging around Jimmy and Citation that month. I learned that a  sloppy track is the same as a fast track when Jones dropped Cy into a  six-furlong race in a downpour that had washed out a Snead-Hogan golf playoff  cross-town. I thought for his first race in over a year, a horse was owed a  fast surface.  </P> <P> "It'll be fast," Jimmy predicted.  </P> <P> It was. Cy ran it in 1:11.  </P> <P> I learned that time didn't mean anything to a great horse. Jones told me the  story: The stable had Coaltown, who could run through sound. Coaltown would  blister six-furlongs in 1:08 2/5. Citation would run it in 1:10 4/5. Then they  would hook up in a race and Citation would beat Coaltown by three lengths. In  1:10 4/5.  </P> <P> Citation could do everything. He won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, took a  little side trip over to the Jersey Derby, won that, then won the Belmont.  </P> <P> He beat older horses that year in the two-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup. He was so  good, he ran in a Pimlico Special Stakes -- and not one horse contested it.  Their trainers didn't want their horses' hearts broken. He had the race track  to himself -- and still ran 1:59 4/5.  </P> <P> Then they put him in the Santa Anita Handicap and I remember standing in the  paddock when this great black horse came into view. I whistled.  </P> <P> "Boy, he looks as if he could runover everything!" I allowed.  </P> <P> "Don't bet he won't," said Mrs. Connie Ring, the noted owner standing nearby.  </P> <P> And that was my introduction to Noor, a giant horse bred by the Aga Khan and  owned by the sportsman car dealer, Charles S. Howard.  </P> <P> Citation never could catch Noor. He gave away 22 pounds -- 132 to 110 -- in the  Handicap that year but in the 1 3/4-mile Capistrano, they brought them closer  together,Citation's 130 to Noor's 117.  </P> <P> It was, to all intents and purposes, a match race. Race horses ordinarily are  fainthearted creatures, but these two ran head and head for over a mile. Johnny  Longden won the race. He took Noor to the outside and forced Steve Brooks, on  Citation, to whip left-handed or not at all. Mostly, it was not at all.  </P> <P> Twenty years later in this race, there was a dead heat -- Fiddle Isle and  Quicken Tree -- and to me, they were no closer than Citation and Noor. It was  the gamest, gruelingest race I have ever seen a race horse run.  </P> <P> It was sad. It was like Hogan missing a two-foot putt for an Open, Louis unable  to get up at the bell, Ruth popping out, or Mays not able to get to a fly ball.  </P> <P> Citation didn't get his million that year in California, but I bring this up  because this week at Hollywood Park, they're running the renewal of the race in  which he finally went over the top, the Hollywood Gold Cup.  </P> <P> The race is 50 years old this year and some of the greatest names in American  turf history have run in it -- the great Seabiscuit, Swaps, Round Table,  Gallant Man, Affirmed, Native Diver. None greater than Citation.  </P> <P> The horses who are in it this year aren't Citations. They had a nice sort of a  colt, Ruhlmann, given periodically to breaking clocks and track records, but  he's out, leaving the spotlight to the kinds of horses who take turns beating  each other.  </P> <P> The race pays half a million nowadays but it paid $137,000 when Citation ran  his last race here.  </P> <P> They brought Citation up to the Gold Cup carefully that season -- a couple of  sprints at Bay Meadows where he ran third both times at odds-on and then on to  Hollywood Park where, after two losses, he came to form, winning the last three  races of his life.  </P> <P> He managed to sneak into the Gold Cup at 120 pounds. At 120 pounds, Citation  could handle an airplane.  </P> <P> He finally got his million -- the 100 grand put him at $1,085,760. It was a lot  of money in 1951 and Citation was the first million-dollar horse. Today, they  have $80,000 claiming races but Citation went out the way he came in -- with a  visit to the winner's circle.  </P> <P> The horse who wins the Gold Cup at Hollywood Sunday should be proud to stand on  the same ground.  </P></p>

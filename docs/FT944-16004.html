			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Holders' shares fall on warning Shares in Holders Technology fell 24p to 95p yesterday after the supplier to the printed circuit board industry warned that profits would fall this year. The company, which distributes high precision tools and specialist equipment, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 446,000 on turnover of Pounds 4m for the year to November 30. Mr Rudi Weinreich, chairman and chief executive, blamed his company's performance on tighter UK margins. In July the company's shares dropped 32p to 147p when it announced a 39 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 152,000, despite an 11 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 2.21m. This year's profits are also likely to be depressed by the consolidation of Holders' 30 per cent holding in Dyconex Engineering, the Swiss company which was acquired in March. However, Holders expects 'a marked increase' in sales next year after completing changes to its product range. Mr Weinreich said the company intended to maintain last year's 6p dividend to external shareholders.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Phone bill cuts will help Irish business IRELAND'S state-owned telecommunications company is to make large cuts in international call rates, but will increase residential and some local charges to compensate. Telecom Eireann said its aim was to help business. The changes would also help align more closely the prices and costs of calls - a process of 'rebalancing' tariffs taking place across Europe. International call rates will fall by between 16 and 59 per cent from September. The peak-time rate for calls to Britain will fall from 48 Irish pence a minute to 30p, and calls to continental Europe from 61p a minute to between 36p and 48p. The minimum charge for local calls in peak period will change from 11.2p for 15 minutes to 9.5p for three minutes. Residential customers will also have to pay more VAT on their phone bills. Consumer groups reacted angrily to the changes; business welcomed the prospect of cheaper overseas calls.</p>

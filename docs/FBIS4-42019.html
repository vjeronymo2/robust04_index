			<p>BFN     [Text] On 29 June Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of Ukraine's  Supreme Council, received Michel-Yves Peissik, French ambassador  to Ukraine. Issues related to the development of  Ukrainian-French relations were discussed during the  conversation. Much attention was paid to ways of encouraging  French investment in Ukraine's economy. Whoever is the first to  do this will gain a higher profit, Moroz stressed.    Among the major topics discussed was the issue of  eliminating  the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Chernobyl is a  misfortune not only for the Ukrainian people. The world  community should understand that this is a matter of concern for  all. It is necessary to resolutely move from declarations to  concrete assistance, Moroz declared.    Peissik said that a representative of France's prime  minister  is expected to arrive in Ukraine in early July. This visit will  be entirely dedicated to the Chernobyl issue. During the talks  they also discussed ways of expanding Ukrainian-French  interparliamentary relations.</p>

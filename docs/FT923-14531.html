			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley sidesteps accusation that benefits will be cut THE GOVERNMENT was accused yesterday of planning cuts in unemployment and training benefit as Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, sidestepped Labour questions on the subject in the Commons. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, seized on Mr Lilley's less-than-full-blooded denial to make the accusation, saying it was as near as any minister could come to admitting there was 'some validity' in press reports last weekend. Mr Meacher described the government's reported deliberations as 'a further smack in the face for the unemployed' whose benefit had been halved in relation to average earnings through 11 cuts since 1979. The reports suggested the government was studying a series of options as part of a Treasury initiative to reduce the annual Pounds 70bn social security budget - the largest single item of public spending. Steps under consideration were said to include limiting unemployment benefit payments to six or nine months, rather than a year as at present, and replacing training allowances of up to Pounds 35 a week to those on Youth Training schemes with the equivalent of child benefit. Tory MPs are convinced that concerted efforts to rein in social security spending will be made as part of a tough public spending round. Commercial interests associated with private prisons would want to keep the prison population at a level which ensured profitability, Mr Barry Sheerman, a Labour spokesman on home affairs, told the Commons last night. He said Labour MPs were opposed in principle to the privatisation of prisons because they believed the deprivation of liberty should only be undertaken by the State. Mr Peter Lloyd, home office junior minister, said the first privatised prison - Wolds in Lincolnshire - was providing a more positive regime for remand prisoners than any other prison in the country.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bristol Scotts cuts loss to Pounds 246,000 Losses in its restaurants division left the pre-tax deficit at Pounds 246,073 at Bristol Scotts for the 1993 year, against losses of Pounds 2.58m. The property and leisure group has decided to close the division and since the year end two outlets have been sold and the third will be closed next month. Mr Anthony Kerman, chairman, said the moves would eliminate the losses in the second half of the present year allowing the group to benefit fully from the positive contributions expected from the remaining divisions. Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 8.7m, most of the fall being the result of the restaurants disposals. Losses per share were 3.81p (45.43p).</p>

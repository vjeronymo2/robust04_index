			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Scrapping Thorp plant 'may cost Pounds 3bn' CANCELLATION of British Nuclear Fuel's plans for reprocessing nuclear waste may cost Britain up to Pounds 3bn, the director in charge of the project said yesterday. Mr David Bonser, director of BNF's Thorp plant at Sellafield, said Britain would lose Pounds 900m in future earnings from overseas, and the state-owned company or government might have to pay back 'a good whack' of the Pounds 2bn foreign customers paid in advance if the Pounds 2.8bn plant was abandoned. 'There's no question that millions of pounds would be due under contracts with customers,' Mr Bonser said - and possibly all of it, depending on the outcome of legal action. BNF said that if Thorp did not go ahead Sellafield would shut after 10 years when present contracts ended. Mr Bonser said Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution had told BNF that there were no 'safety, technical, or waste management reasons' why the plant should not start operation. The Thorp plant, which has taken 10 years to build, was due to start processing spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors in the UK and overseas within two weeks. The start of operations has been on hold since a delay in authorising new levels of radioactive emissions by the inspectorate. BNF fears the inspectorate's two-month public consultation period, ending mid January, might be followed by a public inquiry lasting months. That might jeopardise the future of the plant. Mr Bonser said Touche Ross, the consultancy firm, had calculated that if Thorp were abandoned Britain would lose Pounds 900m in future earnings from overseas customers, after taking into account Thorp's running costs. Britain might have to compensate foreign customers for the change of plans, and would be obliged to send back the 2,500 tonnes of foreign radioactive fuel Cancelling such an expensive high-technology project has so far appeared politically unthinkable.</p>

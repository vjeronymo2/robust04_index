			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Lloyd's may fund extra aid for Names LLOYD'S of London is in discussions with agents and brokers at the insurance market to fund extra hardship relief for Names suffering in recent losses, Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's, announced yesterday. A fully fledged bail-out scheme that would cap past losses has been rejected as 'unviable', Mr Lord added. Under the hardship arrangements, negotiated individually, Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the market - are allowed to retain a home and a modest income. In return, Lloyd's restructures their debts. 'We do not reduce them to penury', Mr Lord said. Mrs Mary Archer, who chairs Lloyd's hardship committee, said the market's governing council had reached agreement with 39 Names, while a total of 95 offers had been made. A total of 1,185 Names had applied to the committee. 'Contrary to popular opinion, Lloyd's has never bankrupted, nor will it bankrupt Names who wish to meet their underwriting obligations,' said Lloyd's. Referring to the bail-out schemes, Mr Lord said the council had considered three types of plan over the past two months covering: losses for 1989 alone; net losses for the 1986-89 period; and a loan scheme to help Names facing liquidity difficulties. All were rejected on a variety of legal, practical and commercial grounds, Mr Lord added. A plan to limit Names' losses from next year has been introduced, its terms improved from those proposed in January.</p>

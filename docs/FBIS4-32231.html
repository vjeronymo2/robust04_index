			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Milenko Pesic: "Concerning Support for </F> Strengthening the Federal State: Is Centralization Possible in  the FRY?"]    [Text] Slobodan Rakitic, DEPOS [Democratic Movement of  Serbia]: "The federal state has too few authorities";  academician Miodrag Jovicic: "A two-member federation has no  chance of succeeding"; Dr. Pavle Nikolic: "For a unified state  of Serbs and Montenegrins."    Time will tell what the future of Djindjic's idea on the  need  to centralize Yugoslavia is. The opposition offered in  Montenegro to his support for strengthening the federal state  was more than vehement.    Responding to charges by the Montenegrin political public,  Zoran Djindjic said: "I do not challenge the fact that  Montenegro has its own statehood and its own symbols and  sovereignty. However, some questions concerning money and the  economy must be separated out. There is no equality if someone  gives 10 dinars and someone else gives 20 dinars, and then they  have an equal voice in deciding how that money is going to be  used."  <H5>  Djindjic in a Rush </H5>   Many people feel that the disintegration of the SFRY  [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] first began in the  monetary sphere. As soon as the stories of who was exploiting  whom and who was making decisions about money began circulating,  post-World War II Yugoslavia signed its own death sentence.    Two years in the life of the third Yugoslavia as a  two-member  federation have been enough to show that not everything in the  new federal state is functioning smoothly.    Slobodan Rakitic, leader of the DEPOS caucus in the Federal  Assembly, agrees that the federal state has too few authorities.    "This is evidenced by the fact that sessions of the two  chambers of the Federal Assembly are very rare, while  announcements that the federal government has not prepared bills  for the legislature are very common. Legislative activities have  been sharply curtailed, to the benefit of the  member-states--Serbia and Montenegro," says Rakitic.    Rakitic feels that Djindjic was right when he raised the  question of the competence of the federal state and its  influence on the political and economic life of the citizens,  "if one does not want this present-day state to resemble the one  portrayed in the 1974 Constitution."    "Nevertheless, I think that Djindjic has rushed the whole  story. It would be nice if we as a state could deal with these  problems now," the head of the DEPOS caucus in the federal  parliament warns.    The current federation has no chance of succeeding,  academician Miodrag Jovicic believes.    "There are three reasons why the FRY [Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia] cannot be effective as a federative state," this  expert in constitutional law explains.    First, the theory and practice of federalism show that  two-member federations have no chance of succeeding. As his  second argument, Jovicic cites the differences between Serbia  and Montenegro in terms of size and economic power; finally,  there is the Zabljak Constitution, which contains a number of  weaknesses and numerous confederal elements that were present in  the former SFRY.  <H5>  Way Out of Current Situation </H5>   As a strong critic of the current constitutional solution  for  the FRY, Jovicic warns that the supreme legal document grants  privileges to Montenegro in a number of regards.    "There are two ways out of the current situation. One is to  abolish the current republican and provincial borders and form a  state of regions. Such a solution would be somewhere between a  unitary and federal structure for the state," Jovicic  emphasizes, adding that he is opposed to a unitary state.    Jovicic sees another possibility for overcoming the current  discord between the two members of the federation in granting  Montenegro special autonomous status, so-called corpum  separatum, like what the Banovina of Croatia gained in 1939.  "That means that Montenegro would no longer have its own  constitution and president," says academician Jovicic.    Dr. Pavle Nikolic, a professor at the School of Law and  federal deputy, also says that the current two-member federation  is untenable as a solution, because it does not ensure the equal  rights of the federal units and the equal rights of its citizens.    "The two-member federation is fertile ground for sovereignty  disputes and rivalries, which always bring forth aspirations  toward confederalism on the one hand and centralism on the other  hand," Nikolic stresses.    Despite the unification of Serbia and Montenegro in 1918,  the  post-World War II arrangement, and the constitutional solution  of 1974, these two states have grown apart over the course of  time, emphasizing their statehood and sovereignty.    "I support a unified state of Serbs and Montenegrins with  divided democratic-political territorial autonomy, as a  community of the Serbian and Montenegrin states. Through this  sort of renunciation of statehood by Serbia and Montenegro, the  basis for creating a unified statehood of the entire nation  would be created," Nikolic believes, adding that this would  avoid centralism, which is inherently undemocratic.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A MEAN-SPIRITED LOOK AT LOSERS, MORONS AND LUST  </P> <P> A Woman's Guide to Adultery by Carol Clewlow (Poseidon Press: $17.95. 224  pages)  </P> <P> The other day at a business lunch for writers, a middle-aged man, forgetting  there were two women present, remarked with a cheery smile, "Well, at least we  don't have women's liberation to worry about anymore. That's ancient history!"  </P> <P> "A Woman's Guide to Adultery" proceeds off that assumption, which gives rise to  a passel of other assumptions: That men are in the driver's seat, that sex for  men is fun, that sex for women means suffering, that it's a hard world for  women, etc., etc., etc. And -- if you're 23 and prefer to go out with married  men; if you prefer to complain about mean men while you're getting your  manicure, this is definitely your kind of book. If you're anybody else, this  book is as strange as if a lady who ate spaghetti three times a day and gained  weight then wrote a furious book denouncing spaghetti.  </P> <P> "A Woman's Guide to Adultery" is a book about four women friends who only fool  around with (excuse me, fall in love with) married men. "Let's face it," one of  them says, "given my age and the unavailability of single men, not to mention  their inferior quality, I really have no choice. If I want sex, and I do, I  have to accept that the men will be married."  </P> <P> Each to her own taste, of course, but in this book, the fact that "good" women  are forced to love married men is presented with the same unquestioning belief  as, for instance, that communism is bad and flossing your teeth is good. As far  as the author is concerned, the only men worth loving are married. She's  serious about this.  </P> <P> </P> <P> But He Loves Another  </P> <P> What you get, then, is an elaborate score card of characters: Jennifer loves  David, a disagreeable poet. Jo loves Martin, a Socialist Party hack. Helen  loves Ray, a businessman. And Rose (our heroine) loves Paul, a generic academic  charmer who grazes happily among his female students (seven girlfriends in nine  years of marriage; but who's counting?). The trouble is: David is living with  Francie, his high school sweetheart. Martin is married to Margaret, who has let  her perm grow out and has three kids. Ray is married to Sandra, a beautiful  woman who has big breasts and dresses in bright clothes. And Paul is married to  Monica, whom he says he loves. OK?  </P> <P> The trouble is, Rose has ethics. (The subtitle of this book, which we only see  on the back, because it won't sell copies), is "Thinking About Monica," and  Rose thinks a lot about Monica. Rose only lives by one commandment, she tells  the reader at one point. Thou shalt not hurt another woman. But Rose starts  breaking that commandment in a big way because the sex is so Hemingway-esque  (see Page 122 for flossy sex from before the days of women's liberation). Rose  doesn't want to hurt Monica, but she does because she just can't help herself.  And, toward the end of the novel, as Paul is brushing Rose off, she tells a  girlfriend: "And now I'm shocked to the core that he doesn't love me. . . . He  thought we were both just in it for a good time. Love was never on the agenda."  (Well, isn't that just the way it is, girls?! Pass the Danish pastry and the  steam curlers, make abortion a crime again, and let's have a gab fest! Men are  beasts and women were made to suffer!)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Separate Parts  </P> <P> The trouble is, such a mindset makes for very peculiar writing. The book has  those two titles, and two very separate parts. The first half is viciously  against women: Helen, Jo and particularly Jennifer are painted here as a  species far lower than toads.  </P> <P> But, in the second half here, the men -- Martin, Ray, David and Paul -- are  also painted as a species far lower than toads. The men made those girls do it.  Don't you see? They victimized their wives and mistresses with their low  desires and their devious ways. Everything gets blamed on them, including a bad  case of breast cancer.  </P> <P> I have two things to say about this. One is to "other women," whatever their  walk of life. Fooling around with married men is asking for trouble, whether  "women's liberation" is in effect or not. Second, this book may serve as a  harsh reminder of what the war between the sexes was like before what we call  "women's liberation" came into effect. Is that really what we want again? Men  seen as snuffling wart hogs and women as drooling morons?  </P> <P> Clewlow can write very good sentences, but her thought processes are  mean-spirited at best, and, at worst, schizophrenic.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Safety Importance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC's staff's rationale for proposing the requirements described previously is that they will provide substantial safety improvements, and the costs of implementation are justified in view of the benefits to be provided. This judgment is based on a qualitative assessment supplemented by a quantitative analysis. The considerations that principally support the proposed action are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The improvements reflect the NRC safety philosophy of ``defense in depth'' in that they address: (a) Prevention of credible challenges to safety functions through improvements in operations and fire protection; and (b) mitigation of challenges to redundant protection systems, through improved procedures, training, improved controls on plant equipment and contingency plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Accident sequences during shutdown which are as rapid and severe as those that might occur during power operation should be addressed with commensurate requirements. This is supported by the staff's engineering analysis of accidents during shutdown conditions documented in NUREG&hyph;1449.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The improvements being proposed are aimed directly at problems that have been repeatedly observed in operating experience, e.g., loss of decay heat removal, loss of ac power, loss of RCS inventory, fires, personnel errors, poor procedures and poor planning, and lack of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only a very limited number of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covering shutdown conditions have been performed and those studies contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable uncertainty. The uncertainty is due largely to the predominant role played by operators and other licensee staff in shutdown events and recovery from them. Human reliability is difficult to quantify, especially under unfamiliar conditions which are often not covered in training or procedures. The collection of PRA studies discussed in NUREG&hyph;1449 gives some insight into the likely range of shutdown risks for the spectrum of current plants. The mean CDP for shutdown events appears to be in the range of 6E-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 05 to 7E&hyph;06 per reactor-year. Although detailed uncertainty analysis is not available for most of the PRAs covering shutdown conditions, some insight can be gained by examining the uncertainty analysis in NUREG&hyph;1150 where the CDP uncertainty ranges (5th and 95th percentiles) are approximately one order of magnitude. From this limited information, the staff concludes that a reasonable estimate of the range of CDP is 1E&hyph;04 to 1E&hyph;06 per reactor-year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the analysis of operating experience in NUREG&hyph;1449, including the accident sequence precursor analysis, the NRC staff identified the following as dominant event sequences during shutdown: loss of all ac power, loss of RCS inventory, and loss of reactor vessel level control in PWRs. These sequences have been modeled as part of the regulatory analysis of proposed improvements in shutdown and low-power operations. Core-damage probabilities for these sequences are point estimates built from best estimates of each step in the sequence. No uncertainty analysis was performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the lack of reliable statistical data for shutdown conditions. However, a sensitivity study has been performed to assess the effect of uncertain assumptions on the overall results of the analysis. The results of the sensitivity study show that despite sensitivity to changes in PRA assumptions, the estimated changes in risk associated with the proposed improvements remain significant even when inputs are changed significantly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of the analysis of the dominant event sequences indicate potential reductions in core-damage probability of greater than 5E&hyph;05 per reactor-year for each PWR's improvement, and approximately 1E&hyph;05 per reactor-year for improvement to BWRs. As previously stated, the staff recognizes that significant improvement in core-damage probability has already been achieved through recent industry actions, however, the proposed rule would place a regulatory ``footprint'' on outage safety and codify improvements made by industry to ensure that (1) reductions in risk already achieved are not eroded in the future and (2) consistency and uniform achievement of the safety improvements is realized throughout the industry. The proposed rule would also set minimum standards for all plants and further reduce risk by improving safety in the areas of fire protection for shutdown decay heat removal and effective reactor vessel water level instrumentation for PWRs in midloop operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fresh legal doubt over Maastricht RENEWED DOUBT was last night cast over the government's legal verdict on Labour's amendment to include the social chapter in the Maastricht bill when Mr Paddy Ashdown released a legal opinion 'totally at variance' with the advice given by the government's law officers. In an open letter to prime minister John Major, the Liberal Democrat leader said the opinion by Mr Anthony Lester QC reached a 'wholly different' conclusion from that given by the law officers. This raised questions related 'not just to the Maastricht bill, but to the quality of advice offered by the attorney-general,' he said. Mr Major last night turned down a request by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for the publication of the apparently conflicting advice on the amendment given by the law officers and the Foreign Office. The request, echoed by Mr Ashdown, followed the government's U-turn in the Commons last Monday when it admitted that its original advice - that the amendment would wreck the treaty - had been mistaken. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had set out the government's view on Monday, Mr Major said. Government law officers would be on hand in future when Maastricht was debated. Separately, ministers have accepted if Labour's amendment is passed they may have a problem in meeting the administrative costs of the social chapter, for which Britain could be liable despite its opt-out. The government might not have the parliamentary authority to make the payment. The issue has been raised by Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, in a letter to Mr Hurd. Ministers do not believe it can prevent ratification of the Maastricht treaty, however. Mr Ashdown says the new opinion highlights Section 6 of the European Assembly Elections Act 1978, emphasising that parliamentary approval is required for any treaty which extends the power of the European Parliament. This is 'clearly applicable to the Maastricht treaty and its protocols', Mr Ashdown said. He described Mr Hurd's Commons statement as 'curious and perplexing'.</p>

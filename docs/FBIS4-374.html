			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala, April 9 (AFP) -- French troops in the  Rwandan capital should not "stand in the way" of the rebel  Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops marching on Kigali, an RPF  spokeswoman said in the Ugandan capital Saturday [9 April].    Spokeswoman Christine Umutoni Nyinawumwami said the RPF "had  taken it upon themselves to move to Kigali, but would not allow  French troops to stand in their way during this mission."    She said the Rwandan rebels were heading for Kigali to  "rescue people from the carnage" triggered by the plane crash  death on Wednesday of President Juvenal Habyarimana and his  prime minister the following day in a revenge attack.    Thousands have died in the inter-ethnic bloodletting that  followed the president's death.    "We understand that there are some French troops in Kigali,  but they are warned that they should not break our way to this  mission. If they do it, we are ready to face them, as they have  blood and can be killed," Nyinawumwami, who is a member of the  RPF political bureau here, told AFP.    She was referring to some 300 French troops who took control  of the Kigali airport early Saturday. The French troops are to  organise the evacuation of the 600 French nationals in Rwanda.</p>

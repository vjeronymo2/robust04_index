			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLIGHT OF THE RETARDED  </P> <P> Not so many years ago large state hospitals for the mentally retarded were  often dungeons of despair. Now the apparently humane option of community care  is itself turning sour. In too many privately run but state-financed homes the  retarded face physical abuse, poor diet, neglect or financial exploitation.  State government clearly must return to the question of how best to care for  the retarded, and must do so soon.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Hurst has documented case after case of neglect, even  death, among the retarded housed in privately operated centers. In one 1987  case, for example, a 29-year-old woman living in a community-care home west of  downtown Los Angeles died of a neglected abdominal infection. Five months later  the center's license was suspended.  </P> <P> Some homes are run by well-motivated people attempting to stretch limited  funds. They need the discipline of frequent inspections and help in learning  what corners simply cannot be cut. Other homes are run by out-and-out schemers  who shortchange patients and pocket the difference. State social-service  agencies must actively monitor all the care for which California pays, stiffen  the penalties against those who exploit and abuse, and put those who persist in  shabby practice out of business.  </P> <P> There are two fundamental problems in grappling with the issue of caring for  the retarded. One is financial, the other philosophical. It costs money to  provide inspectors and social workers to monitor such programs. California is  already in a financial bind, and a state that once was an innovator in social  services cannot, for now, respond to all legitimate demands on its dollars.  </P> <P> It may be that the current system of paying private nonprofit regional centers  to place the retarded in community homes has simply facilitated buck-passing.  State agencies can say that an incorrect placement isn't their fault. The state  should finance some small pilot projects to see whether its own staff could do  a better job at both placement and management of community care programs and to  determine how much that would cost.  </P> <P> California government has made a philosophical commitment to help the retarded  live in community settings rather than large hospitals. In an ideal world,  that's the best approach. But Hurst's interviews showed that many parents find  state hospital care for their children vastly improved and safer than the worst  of community-care homes. Honoring a general commitment to community care is not  a good reason to ignore the fact that for some individuals state hospitals are  more suitable.  </P> <P> Debate on care for the retarded should be reopened. The discussion should focus  on how to fashion care to fit individual needs and on deciding how California  can best provide that care. Such a debate would benefit both the state and its  citizens who are retarded and often ill served today.  </P></p>

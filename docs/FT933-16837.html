			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report BASE METALS prices fell away from the highs yesterday afternoon on the London Metal Exchange, although most were still higher on the day. Three months ALUMINIUM retreated from a high of Dollars 1,260 a tonne in after-hours trading, with talk circulating that other North American producers did not intend to follow Alcoa's lead and cut production. But the price still ended Dollars 17 to the good at Dollars 1,248 a tonne. Three months COPPER consolidated above Dollars 1,900 a tonne but could not overcome resistance around Dollars 1,915 a tonne, the top of the recent technical range, dealers said. The market's strength has been helped by lost production at Chuquicamata and expectations of heavy drawdowns in stocks. But dealers warned that prices might head lower again if there was no stoppage at Kennecott's Bingham Canyon mine, where the labour contract expired yesterday. The July position on the London COCOA futures market rose to a peak of Pounds 736 a tonne in what traders interpreted as a bout of short-covering ahead of first notice day for deliveries against that contract. The September contract closed at Pounds 714 a tonne, up Pounds 6. Compiled from Reuters</p>

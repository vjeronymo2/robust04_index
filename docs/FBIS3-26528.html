During the forum he  pointed out: Personnel engaged in journalism should uphold the  correct guiding direction of public opinions. They should  vigorously carry forward their major missions, enhance the  construction of the journalist corps, continuously upgrade their  working level, and create a good environment in public opinion  for reform and development.    On the morning of 21 January, the meeting room on the third  floor of the provincial party committee's building was filled  with a happy and relaxed atmosphere, in which the responsible  comrades of the provincial level journalist units delivered  reports by bearing their working reality in mind regarding their  past year's work in supporting the central work of the  provincial party committee, in bringing their strong points into  play, and in carrying out the propaganda work of journalism, as  well as regarding the methods of conducting their work this year.    During the forum, Comrade He Zhukang fully acknowledged the  work done by the provincial level journalist units over the past  year. He said: Over the past year the provincial journalist  front, in line with the central work of the provincial party  committee, has done a great deal of work in building  journalistic theories; publicizing economic affairs; giving  guidance to public opinions; investigating and discussing  situations; and popularizing knowledge. The front has fostered a  journalistic pattern primarily consisting of positive  propaganda, multiple propaganda styles, and a method of arousing  people to progress which is being adopted. It has played an  active role in promoting the province's programs of reform,  opening up, and economic construction. The self-improvement of  journalist units has also achieved new progress. It has also  made active contributions to developing the tertiary industry  and improving the conditions for raising funds. Some work done  by our province's journalist units were commended or encouraged  at the national appraisal events and have expanded the influence  and exposure of Jilin Province. In this connection, the  provincial party committee is very proud of them and I would  like to take the opportunity to extend congratulations on their  achievements, to express thanks for their contributions, and to  extend cordial regards through the comrades at the forum to all  journalist workers throughout the province.    During the forum, Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: We are in  a period of large-scale development and changes. The year of  1994 is the last period of improving the province's economy to a  new level and also a crucial period of building Jilin into a  developed, border, and maritime province. In facing such a  situation and task, duties assumed by the journalist front are  important and great and the provincial party committee places  great hopes on the front.    Personnel engaged in journalistic work should uphold the  principle of regarding positive propaganda as the main task and  provide powerful support in public opinions for improving the  province's economy to a new level and building Jilin into a  developed province by the sea. In line with the demands of  unity, stability, and arousal, they should give priority to  their major professional missions. Deepening reform and  accelerating development represent major tasks of our age as a  whole. New demands were set by new situations and tasks. The  journalistic work is exerting special efficacy and the  journalist units should do a good job in directing the public  opinions in the society. First of all these units, themselves,  should make a clear distinction between right and wrong and dare  to adopt a clear attitude. They should adopt a clear-cut  attitude toward what they should advocate, carry forward, and  resist. They should resolutely resist the things that have been  proved as wrong, negative, and harmful. By no means should they  leave these things unchecked. Journalistic propaganda has its  own law. Journalists should study the law and deeply carry out  investigation and study some problems so as to learn about the  feelings of readers, audience, and viewers. They should foster  the mental attitude of being high-spirited to make progress,  actively conduct healthy and favorable propaganda, and resist or  weaken the negative and retrogressed things. In conducting  journalistic propaganda, it is imperative to integrate intention  with results.    Comrade He Zhukang stressed: In conducting the work of  journalistic propaganda, it is necessary to uphold a high  standard and a strict demand; to enhance the construction of the  journalist's contingent and the self-improvement of journalists;  and to upgrade the level of journalists. Personnel engaged in  journalistic work should steadily engage in study and upgrade  their level through practice. Upgrading the work level has a  bearing not only on technology and equipment but also on the  quality of personnel. Journalists should stress ethics, observe  the party's discipline, and implement the party's principles and  policies. By no means should they conduct paid journalism. In  conducting their work, journalists should advocate an earnest  and rigorous work style. Personnel in every link, from  reporters to editors and directors of newspaper offices and  broadcasting stations, should earnestly take up their  responsibility. The journalist units should strictly conduct  management and their leading personnel should set themselves up  as an example in boldly taking up and handling problems. These  units should also do a good job in conducting self improvement,  foster the characteristics of their own, upgrade their level,  and broaden their influence.

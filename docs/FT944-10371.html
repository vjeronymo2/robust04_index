			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Charities facing long delays for funds from lottery Mr David Sieff, chairman of the National Lottery Charities Board, admitted yesterday that the board, which could have Pounds 100m a year to distribute to charities, may not start making grants until late next year. The admission came a week before the first multi-million-pound National Lottery draw takes place on November 19. Twenty per cent of the proceeds of the lottery will be distributed to UK charities via the board, and up to 200,000 applications for money are expected each year. There is growing concern, however, that delays may mean that the board may not be in a position to accept applications until 'the latter half of next year', according to Mr Kirk Coulson-Gilmer, acting secretary, 'It's a shambles. An absolute disgrace,' a lottery specialist, who asked not to be named, said yesterday of the progress so far. Mr Sieff, a director of Marks and Spencer, admitted yesterday: 'If we are going to succeed we need time to prepare - certainly many months - before we can begin the actual distribution of funds.' Money will be held in interest-bearing accounts until grants are made. Mr Sieff added that he would not be put off from doing the job properly 'either by media pressure, or by the understandable anxiety or impatience of possible recipients of grants'. At the moment the board is staffed by four civil servants on secondment from the Home Office, although consultants with expertise in business systems, management and public relations have also been engaged. Advertisements for a chief executive were placed two weeks ago. There have also been complaints that charities trying to contact the board have only been able to reach an answering machine. Calls have been going instead to Camelot, the lottery operator, and the Office of the National Lottery. At a meeting last week attended by Camelot and Charities Board representatives, it is believed that Camelot asked what callers to the Lottery Hotline should be told about the Charities Board. A board member suggested they be asked to call back in a few months. The Charities Board agreed that its address, 7th Floor, St Vincent House, 30 Orange Street, London WC2H 7HH, could be given out but not its 071-839 5371 telephone number. The problem has been caused partly by the apparent slowness of the Home Office in making appointments. Nothing left to luck, Page 14</p>

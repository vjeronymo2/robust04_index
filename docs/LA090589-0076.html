			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PANAMANIANS BLACKLISTED  </P> <P> The United States has placed more than 150 Panamanian officials on a blacklist,  forbidding U.S. companies and government agencies from buying from them or  their businesses. U.S. Embassy officials said the action is intended to "hurt  the pocketbooks" of people associated with Panamanian strongman Manuel A.  Noriega, who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on  drug-trafficking charges. The measure affects Panamanian officials who own  companies that do business with the U.S. Southern Command military  installations or with the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. government agency  that administers the Panama Canal.  </P></p>

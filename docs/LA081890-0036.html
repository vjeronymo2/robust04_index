			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RUELAS SEALS WALTERS' FATE IN 9TH TO SET UP A TITLE FIGHT;  </P> <P> BOXING: ARLETA TEEN-AGER RUNS RECORD TO 20-0 WITH OVERPOWERING PERFORMANCE  AGAINST JAMAICAN FEATHERWEIGHT.  </P> <P> Job Walters, a swift and muscular Jamaican featherweight who had easily whipped  former world champions in his past two bouts, was a fighter on his way up.  </P> <P> But just seconds after running into a crushing left hook from Rafael Ruelas of  Arleta, he was a fighter on the way down.  </P> <P> Ruelas, 19, dropped Walters early in the first round, then stopped him with a  blistering barrage of punches in the ninth Friday night in a scheduled 10-round  bout at Bally's Hotel. Ruelas used the overpowering performance to run his  record to 20-0 with 17 knockouts.  </P> <P> The victory set up Ruelas' first shot at a title. He is scheduled to fight Pee  Wee Parker of Los Angeles in November at the Forum for the International Boxing  Council featherweight championship.  </P> <P> Friday's bout ended 2 minutes 10 seconds into the ninth after Ruelas had  blasted Walters, who fights out of New York, with stinging combinations from  the start of the round. He staggered Walters with a whistling left hook and as  Walters sagged against the ropes, Ruelas unleashed a furious combination,  snapping back the head of the defenseless Walters seconds before referee Toby  Gibson jumped in and stopped the beating.  </P> <P> Ruelas, 126 1/2, who entered the bout ranked 20th in the featherweight division  by the World Boxing Council, was ahead by five points on the scorecards of two  judges and by three points on the third scorecard after eight rounds.  </P> <P> Walters, 125, came into the bout off a pair of impressive wins over former  world champions Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela and Azael Moran of New York.  Moreover, he had not lost a fight in more than four years.  </P> <P> He withstood the punishment that Ruelas was handing out in the early rounds,  and, after the first-round knockdown, he began landing solid punches of his own  to win a few rounds. But none of the punches seemed to bother his opponent and  by the fifth round Ruelas -- a tall featherweight at 5-foot-10 -- had regained  control. His quick and heavy jabs nearly closed Walter's right eye in the sixth  round.  </P> <P> In the eighth, Walters' swollen eye began to bleed heavily and Ruelas began a  heavy attack, rocking Walters with stiff jabs and left hooks to the body and  head.  </P> <P> "It was hard because he moved a lot and stayed busy," said Ruelas, who fights  out of the Ten Goose Boxing Club of Van Nuys. "But I thought I was in control  throughout the fight. He never hurt me.  </P> <P> "I'm happy. I'm really pleased."  </P> <P> Ruelas won 50 of 55 amateur bouts before starting his professional career just  19 months ago, fighting mostly at The Country Club in Reseda.  </P> <P> In April, Gabriel Ruelas -- Rafael's 20-year-old brother -- had his career put  on hold when he sustained a freak injury during a bout against Jeff Franklin in  Las Vegas. In that fight, Gabriel Ruelas, who had piled up a 20-0 record,  sustained a broken bone in his arm and underwent surgery on his elbow a day  later.  </P></p>

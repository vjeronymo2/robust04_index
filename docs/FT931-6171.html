			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Hungary widens net in sell-off campaign HUNGARY yesterday set in motion plans to draw most of the population into the country's privatisation programme. J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK investment bank which is to advise on the government's campaign to speed sales and recruit the general public as investors, said Hungary was considering offering millions of small investors concessions, including cheap credit, to buy assets remaining in state control. Entrepreneurs would be able to buy small state-owned companies, or to invest in shares in a company through Hungary's stock market. The proposals for popular participation mark a departure for Hungary. Until now it has relied heavily on foreign investment and market pricing. The first phase of privatisation, predominantly involving trade sales to western consumer goods companies, is running out of steam. Acquisitions by Ferruzzi, Unilever, Nestle, British American Tobacco, Philip Morris and many other multinationals helped give privatisation proceeds of more than Ft100bn (Pounds 80.4m) in 1991-92. But the frequency of large deals is declining because the most attractive and easily digestible properties in the state's portfolio, like the cigarette makers, have already been sold. Foreign investor interest is now focusing on the utilities, but their privatisation needs to be preceded by time-consuming regulation. The conservative government is anxious to draw in popular support for privatisation because of a widespread belief that foreigners and state company managers, many of them former communists, have monopolised privatisation. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the governing party, is given added incentive by its political predicament; elections are approaching in 1994, with the Forum trailing the liberal and socialist opposition heavily in opinion polls.</p>

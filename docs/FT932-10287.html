			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Plethora of plans to tackle unemployment: The partnership between the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils and the government is one of the most ambitious forged with the private sector. The performance of the Tecs, which handle Pounds 2.3bn of public money each year, will help determine the private sector's willingness to push ahead with other programmes DIRECTORS of Tecs had plenty to say when asked how tackle unemployment should be tackled. Their proposals included: Creating a national economic strategy based on support for manufacturing industry and statutory regional development agencies. Increasing public spending on capital projects to kick-start the economy and create jobs. Halting the fragmentation of local government services which 'provide a major source of local and community employment'. Continuing to resist the social chapter. Sacking Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Further cuts in interest rates and corporate tax cuts. Creating new measures for inward investors which 'will convince them that the UK is the most attractive location in Europe'. Encouraging local chambers of commerce to take the lead in creating export opportunities. Getting 'the banks under control' and preventing them from destroying viable small businesses. Greater co-ordination of government departments involved in education, training and enterprise. Creating structured partnerships among the several bodies responsible for developing local economies. Changing the balance of Tec funding to favour enterprise, not training, and allowing Tecs more discretion in setting local priorities. Putting effort into re-skilling and enhancing the skills of the employed. This would create a 'pull-through' of vacancies for the unemployed. Raising the status of part-time work by ensuring that pay and benefits correspond to full-time employment, while 'recognising and developing a culture that accepts that full-time work and employment as we now know it will not be possible in the future'. Allowing people to take on more part-time work before losing benefits. Cutting tax for the low-paid and eliminating the 'poverty trap' of lost benefits on returning to work. Reducing taxation in the first year for the long-term unemployed returning to work. Subsidising employers to retrain workers they intend to make redundant. Providing financial incentives to employers to take on the unemployed, such as paying most benefits to the employer for up to six months. Considering subsidies for companies which are considering compulsory redundancies to assist them through a bad patch, when they might be panicked into making people redundant and subsequently find they have over-sacked. Improving the careers service. Creating financial incentives for small companies to take on staff - for example charging no national insurance in the first year. Building on existing training initiatives rather than creating new ones. Creating a national community service programme for people aged 18 to 19. Resurrecting the Community Programme work experience scheme in areas of high unemployment. Relaxing the rules surrounding Tec training and the enterprise allowance scheme. 'It is foolish for people to have to be unemployed for six months before they can be trained to set up their own business,' said one director. Allowing greater flexibilities in applying the 21-hour rule to allow unemployed people to study for more than 21 hours without losing benefit. This would allow unemployed people over 21 to return to full-time education or training without loss of benefit.</p>

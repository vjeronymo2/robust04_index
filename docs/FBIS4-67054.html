			<p>CSO     [Text] The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) said yesterday that a  direct link has emerged between Colombian drug lords and two  Jamaican gang leaders described as prominent political activists.    A statement from Derrick Smith, party spokesman on National  Security, said hostilities had developed between the two  gangsters after a robbery in New York by the Black Roses Gang.  Twenty-five kilograms of cocaine and US$1 million in cash were  stolen from a Colombian drug ring.    According to the JLP, two Colombians are now in Jamaica to  ensure that approproriate punishment is inflicted for this  violation.    An associate of one of the gang bosses known as "Rat" had  four of his cronies killed and their bodies found in a car along  Diamond Road recently. "Rat" fled to New York shortly after but  was shot dead less than 24 hours after arrival.    In the ensuring hostilities between both gangsters, the JLP  says, there has been increasing importation of guns and  ammunition concealed in bags of rice, barrels of clothing, and  in the guts of television sets and refrigerators.</p>

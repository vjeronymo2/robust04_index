			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Taking the paper out of trade - The quest for more efficient commerce The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade recently put the global gains from the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords at an eventual Dollars 500bn a year. Next week ministers, officials and industry executives from more than 130 countries will meet in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss how to boost that sum by another Dollars 100bn - by cutting the costs of doing business abroad. The United Nations International Symposium on Trade Efficiency is focusing on ways of making trading cheaper and easier, so enabling smaller companies and poorer nations to exploit the global market on more equal terms with established traders. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development, which is organising the five-day symposium, the costs of voluminous paperwork, complex formalities and associated delays and errors amount to about 10 per cent of the final value of goods. A typical trade transaction may involve 30 different parties, 60 original documents and 360 document copies, all of which have to be checked, transmitted, re-entered into various information systems, processed and filed. For small companies, this can be daunting, even without the additional handicaps faced by many Third World exporters such as poor infrastructure and cumbersome, sometimes corrupt, bureaucracies. However, transaction costs - totalling perhaps Dollars 400bn a year by the end of the decade - could be sliced by 25 per cent by streamlining procedures and extending use of paperless trading, Unctad argues. The symposium is expected to adopt recommendations for tackling problems encountered by exporters in the areas of transport, trade information, telecommunications, business practices, and customs and finance, with special emphasis on the difficulties confronting smaller companies and developing countries. One example is computerisation to speed customs clearance, increase government revenues and reduce opportunities for corruption. Unctad's Automated System for Customs Data (Asycuda), used by more than 60 developing countries, enabled Ghana and Mauritius, for example, to cut clearance times from a week to half a day. Sri Lanka boosted revenues by Dollars 25m or 10 per cent in the first three months of operation, despite lower tariff rates. Though more than 100 countries operate fully automated customs clearing systems, most trade transactions are still paper-based. Errors and delays in paperwork cost companies business and customers, Unctad says. 'With the growing trend towards purchasing 'just in time', delays increasingly imply lost business. If local suppliers can produce and deliver inputs within a given deadline, remote suppliers must be able to do likewise or they will lose the market.' The answer, Unctad believes, is paperless trading or electronic data interchange (edi). However, to be effective all the participants in a trade deal - companies, customs, banks, insurers, transport agents and so on - have to use it. Even in industrialised countries, edi is used by fewer than 7.5 per cent of companies. For exporters in developing countries, poor telecommunications may make edi impracticable. Similar problems apply to that other essential of successful trading - business information. This is increasingly available in electronic form but many companies, especially in the Third World, could find themselves excluded from trade if they cannot adequately exploit the new technologies. 'In a world where information has become the main strategic factor of competitiveness, the border between trade winners and losers is often the one that separates the haves from the have-nots of technology,' Unctad warns. To help prevent this gap emerging Unctad came up with the idea of a worldwide network of 'trade points'. Since the first was set up in February 1992 in Cartagena, Colombia, trade points have been set up or are planned in 60 countries. By the end of next year 100 should be operational. Trade points bring together under one roof all the services needed by exporters, such as government departments, customs authorities, chambers of commerce, banks, insurers and freight forwarders. Through trade points companies have the possibility of using edi as well as gaining access to computerised information on markets, potential clients and investment partners, tariffs and trade rules worldwide. Next week's symposium will formally launch the Global Trade Point Network, an electronic network linking the trade points with each other and other international networks, which Unctad hopes will become an important player in the field of trade information and electronic trading. Trade points already claim success in increasing the number of companies involved in international trade and helping them trade more efficiently. Ms Rossana Trucco del Castillo, director of the Cartagena trade point, says 70 per cent of its users are small and medium-sized companies and half are new to international trade.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala, April 16 (AFP) -- Some 2,500 Ugandan  soldiers were pensioned off Saturday [16 April] as part of an  ongoing military demobilization programme aimed at reducing  government defense spending, military officials said. The  demobilization, backed by Western donors, is intended to bring  down Uganda's 90,000-strong military to about 40,000.    Military expenditure by the Ugandan government is estimated  at 30 percent of the country's annual budget.    Some 10,000 soldiers will be laid off by the end of this  month, the officials said, bringing to 33,000 the number of  troops demobilized since 1992.    Donors have so far given 31 million dollars for the  programme, but Uganda is seeking more funds to complete the  exercise.    A retiring soldier's benefits include 550 dollars in cash,  bulding material and transport home.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: The double acts that strut and fret - Jurek Martin in Washington looks at the performances of some of the tournament's odd couples If Denmark had qualified, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern would not have been the talk of the World Cup - far too subtle and self-effacing, too fond of screen passes, unwilling to give their prince of a striker a good look at anything other than a dead ball. Inevitably, sports seem to produce inseparable pairs: Hoad and Rosewall, Koufax and Drysdale, Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Montana and Rice, etc. They do not even have to play for the same side. Bird (Larry) and Magic (Johnson) reinvented basketball in the early 1980s while playing a continent apart in Boston and Los Angeles, and only a few times a season against each other. So it is more than convenient to look at this World Cup in terms of its twins, especially among the survivors. Batistuta and Caniggia engaged our attention while Argentina were alive, and no finer goalkeepers have been seen than old Preud'homme of Belgium and young Al Deayea of Saudi Arabia, but they are all now back home. Hristo Stoichkov and Gheorghe Hagi are a natural pair, and not only because Bulgaria and Romania are neighbours. Neither looks like the sort to be met in a dark alley. If Richard Nixon had sported a five o'clock shadow resembling Stoichkov's, he would never have been elected dog-catcher. Both are combative and both are artists at petulant gamesmanship, forever seeking that niggling edge that can induce mistakes by the opposition. Hagi drove John Harkes of the US into just such a silly reaction - and a yellow card that took him out of the match against Brazil. How Jamal Al-Sharif, the Syrian referee, survived the Bulgarian's menacing reproaches in the Mexican game without going ballistic is a tribute to Arab tolerance. But both are marvellous creative players able to finish what they start. They might even be softies at heart. There was Stoichkov after the penalty shoot-out with consoling arms draped around Jorge Campos, the psychedelic Mexican goalkeeper. Lip-reading Spanish (Stoichkov plays for Barcelona) is not easy, but Campos seemed to appreciate what he heard. Even Hagi smiled, deathlessly, after Romania had done in Argentina. Romario and Bebeto, the Brazilian attacking twins, apparently do not like each other. Romario does not seem to like anyone. He even refused to sit next to Bebeto on the flight to the US, which, presumably, was not in economy class. They may have developed a new theory in human relations - that if personal contact is confined to kicking a ball it can be civil. Thus, two inherently selfish, egotistic and highly-skilled people instinctively know where the other is and what his intentions are; if they don't, they don't talk to each other. It is most logical to couple Roberto Baggio of Italy with Lothar Matthaus of Germany. They do not play much alike, nor even mostly in the same part of the field, but both came to the World Cup with the advance billing of miracle workers and with the cares of their countries on their shoulders. Not surprisingly, both have come close to being disappointing. Baggio had to suffer the humiliation of being removed from the Norway game after barely 20 minutes when Italy fell a man short, and his temporary redemption came perilously late, with two goals in the 89th minute and in extra time against Nigeria. Prior to then, on his own admission, he had been in a slump. He looked care-worn, his ponytail drooping, no encouraging Buddhist mantra passing his lips. At least he was a stoic about it - until he scored and exulted in a manner that put even Maradona in the shade. The super-cool Matthaus has not had to bestir himself so much and has been handicapped by an injured foot, which meant he missed the excruciating last half-hour against a rampant South Korea. But not until Belgium can he be said to have imposed himself on a game, and even then he took second billing to another odd couple, Jurgen Klinsmann and Rudi Voller. It is hard to pair goalkeepers, who are solitary fellows given to screaming at their own defences. But a certain affinity under the skin may link Thomas Ravelli of Sweden, than whom no-one is more manic of face and manner, and Claudio Taffarel of Brazil, a country with a long history of eccentric last lines of defence. Taffarel's calmness to date can only reflect the fact that he has hardly had a shot to save in four matches (the one he missed, by Kennet Andersen of Sweden, would have beaten Cerberus). If he flubs one, or if a defender goofs  -look out. As already noted in the FT this week, there is no slower pair afoot than Ronald Koeman and Frank de Boer of Holland, though both compensate in other ways. The contrasting speed merchants out of defence must be Sergi and Albert Ferrer of Spain, who may or may not have trained in Pamplona. Luis Enrique of Spain and Florin Raducioiu of Romania may be linked as exemplary all-purpose forwards, mean enough to intimidate defenders and quick enough to get outside them. Both play well with their backs to the goal, laying the ball off and running at goal. The finest actor on display remains Klinsmann, but Emil Kostadinov must have a formidable theatrical reputation back home in Bulgaria, now being magnified on the world stage. Gianfranco Zola of Italy and Emil Kremenliev, also a Bulgarian thespian, gave virtuoso performances in the face of red cards, especially the Italian with a truly passionate assault on surrounding fences and advertising hoardings. The pair - there had to be two of them - who have been sent home (Stefan Effenberg of Germany and Ion Vladiou the Impaler of Romania) merely played to the audiences and referees too much. That is something of which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern would never have been guilty.</p>

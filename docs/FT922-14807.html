			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Grampian selling Mitre for Pounds 17m as profits decline 14.7% GRAMPIAN HOLDINGS, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, is selling Mitre, one of the UK's best known makers of footballs, rugby balls and sporting goods, to an American company keen to cash in on Mitre's brand name ahead of the 1994 Football World Cup, to be staged in the US. Grampian is selling Mitre for about Pounds 17m to Genesco Inc, the US clothing and footwear manufacturer which already owns the Mitre licence in North America. The sale is expected to be finalised before Easter. Mitre and Patrick have been separately managed, although Grampian recently looked at combining their distribution and administration to reduce overheads. Mitre is the more profitable of the two companies, making pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.5m from sales of Pounds 14m in 1991. But the company was affected by bad debts in the fourth quarter and Patrick, which was acquired in 1987, has more potential in Europe. Sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings of about Pounds 20m at year end. Grampian also announced a 14.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.2m in the year to December 31, below expectations. The shares fell 9p to 163p on news of the results and sale. Earnings fell less sharply, due to a lower tax charge, and totalled 12.77p, an 8.8 per cent fall. Grampian is recommending a final dividend of 3.8p (3.5p), to make a total of 5.5p, a 10 per cent increase. Turnover improved 1.9 per cent to Pounds 142.8m, mainly due to strong performances from animal pharmaceuticals in the UK and Germany. COMMENT Disposing of Mitre, with apparently no pressing need to do so, raises the question of what else is for sale. Patrick is a likely candidate, although Grampian may prefer to wait for its premium brand name credentials to be acknowledged in any price tag. Mitre's sale also accelerates Grampian's transition from conglomerate to niche pharmaceuticals company. Animal pharmaceuticals increased their share of group profit above 50 per cent for the first time last year. Following the disposal and the purchase of Peter Hand, that figure is set to top 60 per cent this year. Even so, the market still sees the company as a conglomerate and wants further evidence of pharmaceuticals growth before any re-rating. Forecast profits of Pounds 12.5m put the shares on 12 times and make Grampian an interesting hold.</p>

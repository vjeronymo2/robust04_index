Prior to  this visit, our radio station had an interview with Lithuania's  President Algirdas Brazauskas, who, from the very beginning,  expressed his belief that the relations between his country and  Romania must be more dynamic.    Mr. Brazauskas viewed the visit of the head of the Romanian  state to Vilnius as a good opportunity to get first-hand  information about the situation in the two countries and to  exchange opinions about their efforts aimed at European  integration, in the European structures of collective security.    The Lithuanian president reasserted that our countries were  the first ones that signed the Partnership for Peace accord in  Brussels at the end of January.    The basic political treaty between Lithuania and Romania  that  will be signed in Vilnius will elevate the bilateral relations  to a higher level, Mr. Brazauskas mentioned and added that so  far, no broad cooperation plans have been achieved, but such  intentions might be favored by the signing of the treaty.    In this respect, the Lithuanian president mentioned the  interest of his country in building a north-south highway, which  will be called Via-Baltica and will cross Romania.    Our country that is neighboring the Black Sea and Lithuania  neighboring the Baltic Sea also have mutual interests in making  appropriate use of harbors and ensuring maritime access from  both countries to those harbors .    Such issues will be discussed during the meeting of the two  heads of state as well as during discussions that will be held  between the Romanian delegation and Lithuanian experts,  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said in the interview  he granted to Bucharest Radio station.</p>

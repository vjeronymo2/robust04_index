			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: 'The Kingdom' and a trio with promise - Concerts Although Columbus dominated radio and television at the weekend, the BBC also found time for a small festival that set sail in quite another direction. In Birmingham the BBC orchestras came together over four days to present a series of concerts featuring the music of Elgar. Most of what they played was the best-known Elgar, the exception being The Kingdom. The oratorio had its premiere in Birmingham in 1906 and it sounded resplendent in the Radio 3 broadcast on Saturday from the city's Symphony Hall and the BBC forces came to London's Royal Festival Hall to give a repeat performance on Monday. Of Elgar's three major oratorios, The Kingdom was the last. Its maturity shows: the choral writing is surer, there is greater expertise in the handling of large-scale movements. While the music does not confront the great issues of life and death or good and evil, like The Dream of Gerontius and The Apostles, the work does exhibit the virtue of a more consistent standard. Its strengths, of pacing and architecture, were well realised by Andrew Davis. We cannot now hear what Elgar himself, the young Boult and Barbirolli would have made of the music, although we can guess at their spontaneity and generous emotion. Davis is cooler at heart; his performance had a simple dignity. As is coming to look typical of Davis's time at the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the music was scrupulously prepared. The detail in the orchestral part was clear and articulate. The choral singing from the BBC Singers, the BBC Symphony Chorus and (in Birmingham only) the Worcester Festival Chorus was a good deal above what one usually encounters in this work. In Birmingham the beautifully delicate soprano soloist was Joan Rodgers; in London her place was taken by the more fully lyric soprano of Pamela Coburn. David Wilson-Johnson aimed to inject the right visionary fervour into the bass Peter's scenes, with Christine Cairns and Laurence Dale giving support as mezzo and tenor. Ideally, however, the music demands four solo singers with either more power or presence, or both.                            *      *      * There was a packed Queen Elizabeth Hall for the Sunday afternoon recital by the trio of Joshua Bell (violin), Steven Isserlis (cello) and Olli Mustonen (piano) - with a pleasing number of parents and children in the audience. Chamber music of this sort, given by three exceptionally talented young instrumentalists who are also engagingly fresh platform figures (each in his own version of the schoolboy-scruff shirt and tie), presents an unstuffy, welcoming impression - which is all to the good. Whether, on the other hand, these performances of Schumann's Phantasiestucke and D minor Trio and the great Schubert E flat Trio can be counted genuine chamber music at all is a curmudgeonly question which haunted the concert like Carabosse at Aurora's christening. Three such distinct musical presences - the admirably straightforward Bell, the rapturous Isserlis, the mercurial Mustonen - could indeed be forged into an inspired ensemble, with repeated experience and regular applications of effort; but on this evidence, the process simply has not begun to happen. What we heard in all three works were three strongly individual approaches to the music, amicably and often vigorously confronted. The 'conversational' arts of the medium - the immediate responsiveness of one player to the nuances of another, the sense of deep and long-range command of the movements - remained out of reach. In both Schumann works there was a great deal of 'feeling' on show with lingering in soft passages and frenzy in loud. More variety of expressive approach marked the Schubert, and individual contributions were often beautifully eloquent. Altogether, though, the concert was an indication of chamber-musical promise, not fulfilment.</p>

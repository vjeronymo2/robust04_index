However, the opposition People's Front abstained, its  leader,  Zenon Pozniak, said.    State Secretary for Commonwealth Affairs Vladimir Zalomay  said the ratification "will be of huge importance for shaping  the country's foreign policy and become a new step by Minsk on  the way to consolidating the CIS and raising its efficiency."    For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who also  supports the ratification of the CIS basic agreement, dwelt upon  the prospects of relations with Russia and a monetary union with  Moscow. He said that "despite all difficulties, Belarus has an  economic potential enabling it to negotiate with Russia on equal  terms."    The Prime Minister said that some of the Russian politicians  who see the union as a handout to Belarus were wrong. He said  Belarus had never lived at the cost of others and that the  monetary union would not resolve its problems but create an  economic environment for removing artificial barriers to  bilateral cooperation.    Kebich strongly attacked Zenon Pozniak's accusations of  Russian imperialism carried by the parliament-sponsored NARODNYA  GAZETA newspaper. The Prime Minister said that an overwhelming  majority of Belarusians opposed to the country's self-isolation  wanted a union with Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Luchegorsk (Maritime Territory), 27 Jun -- The  northern regions of the Maritime Territory have turned out to be  on the verge of economic catastrophe. A strike by transport  workers of the Luchegorsk opencast coal mine, which is the main  supplier of fuel for the Primorskaya state regional electric  power station, the giant of far eastern power engineering, has  been going on for ten days now. The shortfall in deliveries of  coal over the ten days exceeds 500,000 tonnes.    The main reason for the protest action was that the  transport  workers' wages are regularly overdue and they have not been paid  since April. Besides this, the strikers are demanding the  abolition of tariff cuts, as well as the resignation of the  director of the main enterprise of "Primorskugol".    In their turn, the administration of the transport  directorate, believing the action to be illegal, have instituted  court proceedings against the strikers. In response, according  to a report from Mikhail Byankin, chairman of the strike  committee, their families will picket the court sitting.</p>

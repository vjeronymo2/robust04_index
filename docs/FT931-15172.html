			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Real cost to early leaver Sir, Mr Smallbone's and Mr Long's letters (December 30 and January 4) dealt with the unfairness caused by 'early leavers' contributions to pensions funds effectively paying for the larger pensions received by those fortunate enough to stay with the same company until retirement. According to the calculations quoted the government therefore allows early leavers to be robbed of about Pounds 20bn a year, this sum then going to subsidise the pensions of those who stay in the same company until retirement, since the contributions of the latter group will only fund about 60 per cent of their final pension. I would suggest, however, that the position is not as simple as this. A person who as an early leaver in, say, 1965 and who did not take up another pensionable post until he retired in, say, 1990 will clearly lose out under the present system since he will be paid at 1965 salary levels. Most early leavers, however, whether voluntary or enforced due to redundancy, will not take up one or more other pensionable posts until they reach retirement age. They will then become both 'robbed early leavers' and 'subsidised final retirees'. Presumably the Occupational Pensions Board has done such calculations and it would be interesting to know their conclusion as to how many suffer serious injustice.

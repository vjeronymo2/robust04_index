			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Some hope - Ballot Box The official statement on the possible separation of the Duke and Duchess of York began with the words: 'In view of the media speculation which the Queen finds especially undesirable during the general election campaign . . . ' It is unclear why the speculation is any more undesirable at election time than any other. The main political interest was in how far the story would knock yesterday's unemployment figures off the front pages of the tabloids. Anyone who thinks that the story will die because of the Palace statement does not know the popular press. A more intriguing question is how far the broadsheets will follow the tabloids' example.</p>

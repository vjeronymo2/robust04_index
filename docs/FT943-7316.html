			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Management: Dissection of the professional firm - Book Review Charles Handy, Tom Peters and other management gurus have a habit of pointing to the professional service firm as one of the most instructive models for the business of the future. But definitive literature on the species, and its management problems, remains sparse. Accountants, lawyers, architects, consultants and other professions arranged as partnerships are significant employers, revenue generators and influence-formers around the world. Yet - partly because of their own secrecy - they are rarely analysed. An exception is the work of David Maister, a US-based consultant and former academic who over the past decade has become one of the world's few commentators on the subject. His Managing the Professional Service Firm*, just published in Europe, provides useful and readable insights - in spite of some drawbacks. The book's style reflects Maister's frequent oral presentations in his work as a consultant to professional firms. Much is honed into simplistic but memorable alliterative 'rules of three'. Hence firms are about service, satisfaction and success; client benefits relate to expertise, experience and efficiency. In a phrase borrowed from medicine, the most important priorities are availability, affability and ability - in that order. Borrowing an image from social science research, Maister says most firms are either 'farmers' specialising in particular areas, or 'hunter-gatherers' in a constant search for new sources of meat (types of work), whatever these may be. Many firms still believe they are offering high-value, top-level 'brain surgery' to clients while their clients, by contrast, increasingly view the services they offer as more those of the 'chemist shop'. Moreover, he argues that many firms have maintained profitability by focusing on short-term 'hygiene' performance measures (such as staff utilisation, boosted by sacking staff) rather than on long-term 'health' measures (such as fees per hour). Maister manages to bring off his analysis without the worst excesses of guru-speak. He includes some pertinent personal and self-deprecatory stories, valuable expertise from his consulting work, and a few references to other specialist writers. He talks about the systematic failure by firms to delegate more to junior staff; the fact that professionals tend to be more geared to their own values than what the client might want; and that the difficulty professionals have with marketing themselves is less of a 'marketing problem' than the result of inadequate management to create the opportunities for the effective sale of services. One value of the book is that Maister is able to appeal to the widest audience of different types of firms and is able to draw on their varying experiences. But this is also a weakness. While there are clearly many parallels, there are also a good number of differences between the types of firm: in size, structure, culture, market, willingness to change and so on. Maister makes little attempt to highlight these. Irritatingly, he rarely gives named examples, blaming the need to retain confidentiality to clients. Some of his material on particular organisations is also outdated. In spite of that, he does provide useful analysis of several firms that are commonly held to be well managed: Arthur Andersen, Goldman Sachs, Hewitt Associates, Latham &amp; Watkins and McKinsey. He describes them all as 'one-firm firms' with a single structure, identity and method of operation. The staff and partners are characterised by their loyalty, teamwork and hard work, for downplaying stardom and generating a sense of mission. The book's principal weakness, other than its rather banal tables and graphics, is that it is essentially a compilation of articles - some written as long ago as 1981 - rather than something specially written and coherently structured. He admits that a few years ago, friends told him his clients were saying: 'Oh yeah, we've had Maister in and heard his stuff. What else has he got?' His next book should prove the real test of whether he has an answer to that. *Free Press/Simon &amp; Schuster. Dollars 39.95/Pounds 29.95.</p>

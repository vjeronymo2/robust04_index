			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / US consumer confidence falls again US CONSUMER confidence fell again this month and is lower than on the eve of any of the past five presidential elections, figures released yesterday indicated. The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its index of consumer confidence fell 2.6 points this month to 56.4, casting fresh doubt on President George Bush's re-election hopes. In another gloomy report, the Commerce Department reported a 0.2 per cent decline last month in the index of leading indicators, its main gauge for forecasting economic turning points. This followed a fall of 0.3 per cent in June and a marginal gain of 0.1 per cent in July. Yesterday's figures were the latest in a series of consistently weak economic reports that have put renewed pressure on the dollar. Attention has shifted to September's employment report, due on Friday - the last before the election. Most analysts expect another sharp decline in employment, which would put additional pressure on the Bush campaign and increase the likelihood of another cut in interest rates. Consumer confidence has fallen for three months running and is at its lowest level since March, when the economy was recovering from a second dip. Confidence has fallen 16 points since June and is running at about half the level expected during a healthy economic recovery. Yesterday's survey revealed a further weakening in consumers' intentions to buy cars, houses and home appliances. The proportion of respondents expecting business conditions to deteriorate and jobs to become more scarce rose relative to already weak figures in August. Only 6 per cent of 5,000 families surveyed said jobs were plentiful. Seven of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators fell last month, led by declining commodity prices, rising claims for state unemployment insurance and weaker order books in manufacturing. The index of coincident indicators - designed to measure the current state of the economy - dropped a sharp 0.9 per cent in August, but this mainly reflected the damage inflicted by Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana. President Bush yesterday rejected for a third time a plan to debate Governor Bill Clinton, his rival in the US presidential election next month, forcing the cancellation of a meeting that was scheduled for Sunday in San Diego, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Bush refused to accept the ground rules set by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates that call for a single moderator, wanting instead a panel of three journalists.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: South Africa JOHANNESBURG staged a partial, intraday recovery from early fears of continued strength in the financial rand. Gold's brief flurry above Dollars 355 an ounce offered mild support to that sector, which confined its fall to one point at 1,504. The industrial index was 23 lower at 4,476, and the overall index was 7 down at 3,763.</p>

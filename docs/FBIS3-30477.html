			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F> Democrats, by Gabor F. Havas and Ferenc Koszeg; place and date  not given: "If the Liberal Parties Together...."]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [BESZELO] In your speech  [at the national meeting of deputies, 28-31 January] you said  that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is a true people's  party. At the former meeting of deputies, you used the term  social-liberal people's party. Contrary to this, our political  opponents, including the prime minister himself, has often said  that the SZDSZ is a civic radical, rather than a liberal, party.  Does this kind of distinction mean anything and does it have  anything to say for us?    [Peto] Today these terms are not unequivocal in Hungary. If  I call the SZDSZ a people's party, this in itself does not  clearly define the SZDSZ for others. However, it can be used as  a self-definition. The SZDSZ can be called a people's party in  the sense that it has become a lasting institution of Hungarian  society, and no one any longer assumes that it will play an  insignificant role in the elections. For the SZDSZ to achieve  similar results to those in the 1990 elections, the support of  the intelligentsia who follow otherwise attractive  turn-of-the-century civic radical traditions is not enough --  just as it would not have been enough in 1990, either. Today, it  is possible to find many people in all strata of Hungarian  society who are receptive to the political efforts -- which by  no means can be called civic radical -- represented by the  SZDSZ. The SZDSZ's supporters and members are represented in  all strata of society, and the reason they vote for us can also  be grasped to a certain extent. It might be easier to put this  into words in negative statements. They vote for us because  they seek a kind of party for themselves that is not like the  current government parties, not like the current Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP], and not like the current Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz]. However, it is also possible to  explain the differences because the SZDSZ's image has been  established fairly firmly over the past five years. It is a  party of modernization that does not delve much into history or  ideology, and does not formulate Christian-national or other  similar goals that can be seen as ideological goals. It  professes to be liberal, but at the same time, the difference  from, for example, the Fidesz can be perceived, and this is when  we say we are social-liberal. [passage omitted]    [BESZELO] What kind of cooperation would you consider  desirable between the liberal parties, especially the two "big"  ones, namely the SZDSZ and the Fidesz?    [Peto] It would be desirable for these two parties if,  rather than eyeing each other distrustfully, their cooperation  was determined by common interests. If I accept that these are  two clearly distinct parties, not only in age but now also in  their principles, it would be good if they represented their own  principles until the first round in the elections and put their  own candidates in the best possible positions, while in the  second round, in accordance with the principles laid down in the  SZDSZ-Fidesz agreement, candidates would be mutually withdrawn,  and we would try to determine the character of the next  government through forming a small coalition.    This would be the optimal situation but I would not like to  appear unaware of the obstacles. In spite of the agreement, the  Fidesz is putting much energy into differentiating itself from  the SZDSZ by strengthening its own identity, even in cases when  cooperation would be better. There is no point in denying that  the Fidesz's goal is to become a bigger liberal party than the  SZDSZ, and it is putting an awful lot of energy into this. It  is also obvious that the Fidesz would be happier to form a  coalition with the current government coalition than with the  MSZP. However, in the SZDSZ's view, one is worse than the  other, and, therefore, it does not yet want to decide on this  issue. Finally, it would be no use denying that there is a fair  amount of mutual mistrust. I do not know what the Fidesz  actually thinks and what it is just saying or doing for tactical  reasons; however, its behavior is determined by the unfounded  assumption that the SZDSZ has intimate relations with the MSZP.  On the other hand, the SZDSZ is suspicious because there are  many signs that the Fidesz has particular links with the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the government. [passage  omitted]    [BESZELO] Actually, it would be of vital interest to the  Fidesz to try to reduce the mistrust because it is obvious that  the liberal line could really determine the next government if a  liberal small coalition were formed before the actual government  were.    [Peto] This is true but it is not always the practical  solutions that happen. For a long time -- here there is no  change -- the Fidesz has been forming its relations with the  SZDSZ from viewpoints of rivalry, rather than general political  principles. In certain cases in the past, we could have  achieved much more if the Fidesz, rather than seeing the  assertion of its self-identity as the main task, had looked at  the issue itself on which we could have worked together.  However, we have to accept the Fidesz as it is. It would be bad  politics to impose our own norms on them. If the Fidesz thinks  that it can only work in a coalition where the MDF is on one  side, perhaps the SZDSZ on the other, and the Fidesz in the  middle, this indicates what they might do. If, in addition to  this, they did not consult the MDF before making this decision,  the MDF could all of a sudden upset the whole thing by saying  that it cannot imagine a coalition with the SZDSZ; if in the  meantime, the Fidesz could not afford to be angry with the MDF  so became angry with the SZDSZ even for this, well, this would  be bad luck, but what could one do? The two big liberal parties  with the Agrarian Federation and the Entrepreneurs' Party can  only jointly be sure of becoming inevitable parts of the  government. Whatever kind of coalition is formed, if only one  liberal party is part of it, then its importance will be much  less than its numerical proportion. However, the liberal  parties together could be a determining force in any coalition.</p>

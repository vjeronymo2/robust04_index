			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Packwood diary order Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon has been ordered to hand over his diaries to a federal court until the judge decides whether the Senate may seize them for its investigation of Mr Packwood on charges of sexual harassment, George Graham writes. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he wanted temporary custody of the diaries - around 8,000 pages transcribed from tapes - in their entirety while he decided on a request by the Senate ethics committee for a court order compelling Mr Packwood to hand them over.</p>

It  created, on the initiative of the European Union, an arbitration  commission. It invited all involved parties to conclude a peace  agreement on the occasion of sundry conferences. It implemented  a humanitarian aid process in order to alleviate the suffering  of civilian populations. Under a UN mandate, it has sent to the  region troops which amount to some 30,000 men.    France has played a pivotal role in this action, especially  from a military standpoint, since it is today the country with  the most soldiers in the region.    However, it must now be acknowledged that all these efforts  failed to achieve the intended results, that the fighting goes  on, and that none of the parties involved appear ready to agree  to a peaceful settlement.    In such a context, it is up to the international community  to  face up to its responsibilities. It must keep working toward a  peace agreement by calling on all the belligerents to make the  necessary concessions. This is possible if the international  community acts in a consistent and closely coordinated manner.    Furthermore, all steps likely to ensure a better protection  of the populations must be implemented.    Accordingly, it was decided at the last NATO summit to  ensure  that UN forces in Srebrenica are relieved and that Tuzla airport  is opened for humanitarian aid purposes. It is time for this  decision to be implemented, including through military means if  need be. To this end, the United Nations must deploy the  necessary means without delay.    However, sustainable peace can only be achieved if the  international community, spearheaded by the European Union, acts  consistently with a view to convincing the warring parties that  they must come to an agreement. The necessary talks within the  European Union will take place this week.</p>

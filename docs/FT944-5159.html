			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / The Markets: Nickel in the LME spotlight - Commodities When business starts at the London Metal Exchange this morning Russia will be uppermost in many traders minds; and more particularly the north Siberian town of Norilsk, site of the world's biggest nickel refinery. It was concern about output losses following an explosion early last month at the power plant supplying this refinery that was largely responsible for last week's 19 per cent surge in the exchange's nickel prices. And the general situation at Norilsk, faced with daunting financial and technical problems, is giving rise to serious doubts about the plant's ability to maintain production at last year's level of about 140,000 tonnes even if its power supply gets back to normal quickly. Norilsk needed 'a huge amount of capital and there is no sign that it is getting any', said Mr David Allen, vice president for public and government affairs at Inco of Canada, last week. Inco signed a technical assistance protocol with Norilsk last year, but Mr Allen said it was 'very difficult to conduct relations with them. . . they have shown no interest'. The company was so short of money, he stated, that it was failing to pay its workforce for weeks on end and was being forced to cannibalise equipment to keep going. LME traders told the Reuters news agency on Friday that the three months delivery nickel price, which closed at Dollars 8,952.50 a tonne, should clear Dollars 9,000 easily and did not think Dollars 10,000 was an unreasonable target in the medium term. There will also be interest at the exchange to see whether or not copper, its flagship contract, can continue the upsurge that was resumed last week. A Dollars 116 rise on the week took the three months position to a four-year peak of Dollars 2,943 a tonne at Friday's close. Traders said the next resistance level was at Dollars 2,975 with Dollars 3,000 the main target. 'There have been quite a lot of financial institutions looking to buy into the market,' one told Reuters.</p>

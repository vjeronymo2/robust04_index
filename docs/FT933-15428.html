			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (7): Streamlined food producer / Profile of Delta Dairy WITH ITS matt grey floor and stainless steel fittings, the office of Dimitris Daskalopoulos, chief executive of Delta Dairy, bears more than a passing resemblance to a streamlined milking unit. In fact, Delta has moved on from being Greece's largest fresh milk producer to become its biggest food processor, adding ice-cream, chilled fruit juices and frozen foods to the product list. Turnover reached Dollars 235m last year, up from Dollars 160m in 1990, the year that the company launched a Dollars 210m investment programme to expand its dairy output. Pre-tax profits totalled Dollars 28m in 1992, a 5 per cent decline from the previous year. Last year, the company added new lines in juices and a series of milk products aimed at the children's market, where consumption of tinned milk has remained surprisingly high. Sheep and goats used to be the main source of milk supplies. The fresh milk supply was often limited to the surpluses from cheese and yoghurt-making. Although output of cow's milk has soared, Delta is still obliged to offer producers incentives and considerable back-up. 'Getting hold of enough fresh milk to meet steadily rising demand is a constant problem,' Mr Daskalopoulos says. 'Fresh milk is a basic product but it's still a big struggle to get our EC production quota increased, and we haven't yet raised the issue of importing milk from the Balkan countries with Brussels.' Under Delta's vertically integrated system for milk production, Greek farmers are offered favourable terms for buying cows imported from the Netherlands. To help standardise production, Delta acquired an animal feed plant which sells to its milk producers at subsidised prices. Refrigerated milk tanks are supplied free of charge and the company also runs seminars for farmers, as well as a veterinary service. Delta will start competing seriously in the yoghurt market at the end of 1993, when its new Dollars 30m plant outside Athens is due to start up. 'It will be tough at first because we're entering a mature market, competing against well-established rivals. But it was the next move to be made, considering that we also plan to export yoghurt,' Mr Daskalopoulos says. Juice production has grown by leaps and bounds since Delta introduced chilled orange juice to the Greek market four years ago. Its Life brand has built up a 30 per cent share of the overall fruit juice market. This year, Delta started exporting chilled fruit juices to France under its own label, Delios, which are distributed by a French-based subsidiary. 'We're in all the main French outlets, and we're doing quite well, especially with small packs,' Mr Daskalopoulos says. However, the difficulties of transporting refrigerated juices across Europe have worsened following the ban on transiting the former Yugoslavia, imposed when UN sanctions were tightened in April. Faced with a 25 per cent increase in transport costs and a loss of up to five days in the product's shelf life, Delta decided to move some production to Switzerland. A Swiss food processor, Milco, is to produce chilled fruit juice under the Delios label for sale in France, Switzerland and northern Italy. The decision underlines Mr Daskalopoulos's uncertainties about prospects for export growth to western Europe, 'where it's really very difficult for Greek companies to compete successfully'. He thinks the outlook is brighter in the Balkans, in spite of low consumer spending there. Delta has invested about Dollars 4m in a joint venture to produce and distribute ice-cream in Bulgaria. 'We've started sending ice-cream to Albania and Romania, where we're looking for production facilities. We're developing a master plan for expanding into the Balkans that will also cover fruit juices and yoghurt,' Mr Daskalopoulos says.</p>

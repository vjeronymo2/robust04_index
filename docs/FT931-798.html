			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Bordeaux's record - Appetisers THE official figures for the 1992 Bordeaux vintage show that the red wine crop was 5.03m hectolitres - a record and twice the size of the frost-stricken 1991. The white wine harvest at 1.23m hl - was three times larger than the previous and the biggest since 1973. The quality of the superior appellation wines will be better known when the representative Union des Grands Crus tasting take place at the end of this month and the beginning of April. Early indications are that the reds are at least a fair average to good; and some dry whites were made. If the reds are to be sold in such large volume, opening prices must come down, but there will be little en primeur sale. Nevertheless, although many superior chateaux owners are short of cash, they may defer offering their wines on the market until they are in bottle and prices improve. Three new restaurants have different approaches to publicity. The Nosh Brothers, Mick and Nick, originally caterers to the rock and roll world, now have a bar and restaurant at 773 Fulham Road, SW6 5HA (071-736-7311, open Tuesday-Saturday night and Sunday lunch). A tough, mean approach to food with smokers encouraged and vegetarians just tolerated. In spite of an off-putting press release, the arrival of Richard Corrigan, formerly head chef at Mulligans of Cork Street, should breathe new life into Bentley's, 11-15 Swallow Street, London W1R 7HD (071-734-4756). And finally to Mark Broadbent, a talented chef now at Twelve Sloane Square, SW1 8EG (071-730-1499) part of the Royal Court Hotel, reduced to writing his own press releases but a chef to be applauded for his initiative and his cooking. Set lunch Pounds 9.50, dinner Pounds 15.50 (two courses). On a more disappointing note for restaurant goers, the Government has announced that it will not be introducing legislation to regulate the inclusion of the service charge on restaurant bills because it believes the industry should do the job itself. Sadly, restaurateurs show little sign of wanting to do so. Corners are fought fiercely between those who believe that the price on the menu should be the price paid, as in most retail businesses, and those who believe that the words 'discretionary' or 'optional' alongside the service charge stimulates a waiter's performance. But, as anyone who pays their own restaurant bills knows only too well, the imposition of a 15 per cent service charge on every item of a bill - from each vegetable dish to mineral water, coffee and wine - can leave a nasty taste in spite of all the kitchen's best efforts. WHAT HOPE for the undoubted skills of the independent wine merchant now that the supermarkets are diving into mail order? Marks and Spencer has been dabbling for a while. Sainsbury has been trying it out in north-west England. And now Waitrose has bought Findlater, Mackie Todd, a long-established wine merchant whose chief asset was once the Dry Fly sherry label but is nowadays its mailing list. It will be some time before Waitrose will be delivering wine to doorsteps throughout the land. In the meantime, their Blaye Blanc at Pounds 2.99 is a particularly good buy for lovers of well-made dry white bordeaux. Chocaholics will be interested in Godiva's big egg, some 4 ft high, with a 34-inch 'waist' and weighing 6 kilos. The egg is made of finest Belgian chocolate - with an outer dark crust, a thick filling of nougatine and an inner layer of milk chocolate. Generously filled, it costs Pounds 264. Will anyone buy it? The company, has also launched two chocolate spreads and a range of jams and jellies. Spreads are a crunchy praline with hazelnuts or dark chocolate. It is nice served melted with a little butter and cream, over chocolate marquise. Godiva's jams, jellies and marmalades are less sweet than most commercial varieties and packed full of whole fruits. Flavours include rose petal, bitter orange marmalade and passion fruit or redcurrant with raspberry gelee  -delicious served with roast duck or baked ham. Prices are from Pounds 2.95 to Pounds 3.95 for a 400g jar with an additional Pounds 1.75 for postage and packing. They are available from the two Godiva shops at 247 Regent Street, London W1 and 150 Fenchurch Street, London EC3 and other stockists.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Tories claim late surge of support ahead of Euro poll: Lib Dem by-election candidate's defection boosts Labour hopes The Conservatives last night claimed a strong late surge in support as Mr John Major prepared for the most daunting test of his government's authority since the 1992 general election. But a spectacular defection by a Liberal Democrat by-election candidate boosted Labour's confidence that the European elections will provide its strongest performance in a nationwide poll since 1966. Optimism among ministers that Tory losses could be limited to perhaps a dozen of their 32 seats was dented by a new opinion poll suggesting it will win a smaller share of the vote than in any other postwar election. The government has already discounted a crushing defeat at the hand of the Liberal Democrats in the once safe Tory seat of Eastleigh in today's clutch of five by-elections. Mr Major used the final day of campaigning to emphasise the Conservatives' claim to be the only party willing to stand up for Britain's interests in Europe. Seizing on the latest indicators as evidence that the pace of economic recovery was accelerating, the prime minister said the campaign had provided a powerful endorsement of its call for a flexible rather than centralised European Union. Britain was leading Europe out of recession. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, ended an intensive nationwide tour with a similarly confident assertion that the government had recaptured core Conservative supporters. The Liberal Democrats were stunned by the public announcement from Mr Alec Kellaway, the party's candidate in the Newham North East by-election, that he intends to join the Labour party. With Mr Tony Blair widely expected to win the leadership election which will follow immediately today's poll, it was being cited by Labour as evidence that Labour is poised to regain its lost following in southern England. The two opposition parties wound up their campaigns by insisting the outcome would represent voters' judgment on Mr Major's 'failed' government. Labour officials were predicting privately that the party is assured of around 55 of the 84 seats being contested in Britain. The Liberal Democrats, currently unrepresented in the Strasbourg assembly, are confident of securing at least three and hopeful of winning up to 10. A Mori opinion poll in today's Times, based on an unusually large sample, supported opposition hopes that the electorate is ready to punish the government for its domestic record. The poll gave Labour a 28 point lead, with 51 per cent of the projected vote, against the Conservatives' 23 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 20 per cent. Mori calculated that on the basis of those figures the number of Conservative seats in Strasbourg could fall to between four and 15.

The Council appointed Maurice F. Doyle, Governor of Ireland's  central bank, as vice-president and adopted various provisions  related to the EMI organizational framework and functioning. In  contrast, no decision was taken on the building that will house  the Institute (and later the European Central Bank) on a  permanent basis. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr.  Lamfalussy reviewed a number of aspects concerning the work of  the EMI and European Monetary Union [EMU] in general, as follows:    - election of Mr. Doyle. Mr. Lamfalussy said he was happy to  announce this appointment because Mr. Doyle is a "heavyweight"  who enjoys a far-reaching reputation among professionals. The  EMI president underscored Ireland's remarkable macro-economic  results in recent years, "due in large measure to monetary  management of the country," before going on to stress the  "absolutely substantial" role played by Mr. Doyle in this  context. As Ireland remains a relatively poor country, it also  is particularly sensitive in various areas;    - EMI offices. The two buildings mentioned most often  (namely, Posseidon-Haus and Messeturm) "are not the only ones"  in the running. "I am still receiving and reviewing other  proposals and I do not think a final decision can be taken  before the next Council meeting." Mr. Lamfalussy will try to  submit a proposal at this next meeting. This delay is related  to the EMI's very specific needs as it is a "foreign  institution" with extremely frequent meetings. The final choice  will also have to take account of concerns to limit the costs of  the operation as much as possible. This first meeting was held  in Frankfurt for purely symbolic reasons, "to show the entire  world that we respect the choice of Frankfurt," said Mr.  Lamfalussy. He then said this location close to the Bundesbank  would in no way change the Institute's relations with German  monetary authorities. "I will not accept a greater Bundesbank  influence on our work due to the fact that I will be in  Frankfurt than I would if I were on a mountaintop elsewhere," he  commented;    - transitional period. A period of "probably six months" was  agreed, during which the work of the Committee of Governors of  central banks will continue as in the past (this committee  ceased to exist with the start of the second stage of EMU)  pending the recruitment of appropriate personnel. Recruitment  is expected to be concluded next summer and should coincide with  the EMI's move into its definitive location in Frankfurt. Until  then, the main staff members the EMI inherited from the former  Committee of Governors will continue working under Mr.  Lamfalussy's command in Basel, where meetings of the EMI Council  will also take place during the transitional period.  "Obviously, once the decision on the building has been taken,  we will transfer more staff members to Frankfurt with a view to  preparing the Institute's move," he added;    - decisions of an organizational nature. These concern  fixing the pay of six EMI "key officials" (who will have a grade  equivalent to director at the European Commission), making it  possible to hire the appropriate individuals for these key  posts. These include the director general (a post for which Mr.  Lamfalussy intends to propose a candidate at the next Council  meeting), and five heads of departments for the following  sectors: economic and statistics unit, secretariat general,  administrative service, information systems and financial unit  (essentially responsible for managing the monetary reserves of  the national banks wishing to deposit them with the EMI). At  the end of 1994, the EMI is expected to have around 140  employees, a number that could rise to 250 once it is fully  operational. Answering questions, Mr. Lamfalussy added the  following information:    - the single currency from 1997 "seems an unrealistic  perspective for the moment" (he declined to make any projections  about achieving this objective in 1999). Meanwhile, the EMI  president can nevertheless imagine other sorts of arrangements  between member states, such as those concluded in August 1993  between Germany and the Netherlands to maintain a stable link  between the Deutsche mark and the guilder;    - asked about Mr. Delors' recent statement that the first  stage of EMU was a failure and that study should begin on how to  boost the second stage, possibly by giving the EMI greater  responsibilities, Mr. Lamfalussy voiced some reluctance  regarding an expansion of the EMI's powers even before he has  begun to work on the basis of existing prerogatives. Moreover,  he added, unquestionable progress (though still "too slow") has  been made in the last five years in several areas aiming at  improving convergence between the member states (to curb  inflation, in particular) and several currencies have moved  closer in recent months to the initial fluctuation bands of the  EMS, which proves that an attitude of "common interest" is  developing and is promising for the future;    - despite the difficulties currently facing the EMS, the  single currency objective will one day become a reality because  "with the extremely high degree of economic integration in  Europe, I cannot imagine that it could eventually function  correctly without a single currency." For now, it is still  premature to say what states will take this step, when and under  what circumstances, "but I am absolutely convinced that the  process will lead to this specific objective;"    - outside of France, which during the negotiation of  Maastricht raised the possibility of depositing currency  reserves with the EMI (as provided in the protocol of the EMI  statutes, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht), up to now no  central bank has requested the Institute to manage its monetary  reserves, said Mr. Lamfalussy. This is due to "practical  reasons," in his view, because it is a highly specialized task  that must be carried out with great caution and which  necessitates a "major technological investment." The EMI will  be prepared to set in place such capacity "as soon as we have  the impression there is a real demand along these lines".</p>

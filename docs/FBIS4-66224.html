			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Chien-hsun (7115 1696 8113): "Election of </F> New Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Representatives and Its  Effect on the Inner-Party Power Structure--One Large Earthquake  Split the Two Large Into a Number of Small Mountain Tops"]    [Text] After the election on 12 March of regional party  representatives for the various regions, the inner-party power  struggle in the DPP reached white heat intensity. From the local  branches to the center, from factions to individual persons,  everyone was flexing one's muscles and scheming as to how many  votes could be garnered.  <H5>  Different Inner-Party Factions </H5>   Presently, it is no more possible to divide the DPP  comprehensively into the traditional two factions, the Meilitao  [Formosa] Faction and the Hsin Chaoliu [New Trend] Faction.  Speaking of factions that would constitute appreciable forces in  the present inner-party power struggle, we would have to include  the old stronghold of the Meilitao group and its affiliated  organizations of local party branches that have been penetrated  by the Meilitao's medium-age group [zhong sheng dai], then also  the Hsin Chaoliu Faction, the Taiwan Independence Alliance, the  Kungtouhui group, the Alliance for Justice, the Welfare State  Alliance, and other local factions not otherwise affiliated.    Apart from this, and apart from setting up DPP  representatives for the various districts, certain local  political personages have also begun to gain such power as would  allow them to intrude into the power centers of the DPP. For  instance, of the 11 seats of party representatives of the Tainan  City party branch, there are two seats that had been created in  the present election by Lin Nan-sheng [2651 0589 3932], who had  been expelled from the Kuomintang, but who had still, in  violation of party discipline, participated in the election. He  and some of his supporters later joined the DPP. There was also  the case in Chiayi County where, as we understand, one seat was  given to a person who had strong connections to the local  faction. Although the number of this type of party  representatives is extremely small, also of little impact on the  present power core of the DPP, the phenomenon is still very  worthwhile watching as to its future development.    Although some "thorough accounting" [jing suan] was started  as soon as the election of party candidates had been completed  and much planning was done as to how to combine the diverse  factions and personalities, the main focus of attention was  directed to the election of the party chairman. However,  actually, with the factual attachments of the party  representatives in so confusing a state of entanglements and not  even the beginnings of unification apparent among them, it is  only the 31-seat central executive committee, the power core of  the party, that most people can now definitely figure out and  get a good grasp on.    Because the status of the large majority of natural DPP  party  representatives is that of public servants, they ordinarily have  their base of actions and operations within their faction,  therefore, as far as the various factions are concerned, the  difficulty of assessing votes is still when concerned with the  local party representatives.    For instance, Taipei and Kaohsiung have 35, 36 local party  representatives, but almost all belong to various public service  bureaus, and we may still differentiate between them  comparatively easily according to the factions of the public  office they belong to. However, there may also be some factional  overlapping, and this may lead to erroneous assumptions. In all  other localities it is even more difficult to get a grasp of the  true situation.    For instance, the five seats for local party representatives  in Pingtung County comprise one seat for the Hsin Chaoliu  faction, one seat for the Taiwan Independence Alliance, while  the allotment of the other three seats is not clear. But we  understand that it was already more or less openly promised the  local party representatives during the election campaign that Su  Chen-chang [5685 6297 2490]--not supported by any particular  faction--a man who had failed in the election for county  magistrate and who is now DPP secretary-general, will certainly  become member of the central standing committee. This is an  example of relying on some kind of local bondage.    Again, almost all the ten seats for party representatives of  Kaohsiung County are considered the domain of the Yu [0151]  family group [jia ban], who belong to the Meilitao faction, but  magistrate Yu Cheng-hsien [0151 2398 2009] belongs to the  Alliance for Justice. If Yu Chen Yueh-ying [0151 7115 2588 3841]  will enter the contest for membership in the central standing  committee, the direction in which the votes of the Yu family  bloc will be split between the Meilitao and the Alliance for  Justice would become a matter of close speculation.    Moreover, in the present power struggle within the DPP, two  new forces are joining the fray from abroad, namely the  Kungtouhui and the Taiwan Independence Alliance, but the power  of these two factions and their work at the basic level is  somewhat related. Insiders in the Taiwan Independence Alliance  have pointed out that after election of the regional party  delegates, the strength of the Taiwan Independence Alliance is  after all not as formerly anticipated, while that of Tsai  Tung-jung's [5591 0681 2837] Kungtou system is exceeding general  anticipation. These persons believe that it has much to do with  the fact that the Taiwan Independence Alliance has been doing  work at the basic level for only a little over one year and has  not yet completed its deployment and build-up.    For example, in the case of Chang Tsan-hung [1728 3503  1347],  now elected party representative in Tainan City, it was pointed  out that the forces of Tsai Chieh-hsiung [5591 0094 7160], a  provincial counselor of the Meilitao faction, had provisionally  allocated over 100 votes in support of Chang Tsan-hung before  the election. However, many among these supposed voters failed  to vote. On the other hand, cadres of the Taiwan Independence  Alliance in the Tainan district came up before the election with  urgently needed votes and thereby achieved their task of  "protecting their lord" and indeed had Chang Tsan-hung rise to  become third-highest vote-getter. However, this version has not  been confirmed.    As to the trial of strength between the two forces coming  from abroad, Yulin County might be expected to become indicative  of how their struggle will go. Yulin County will have seven  votes for party representatives, one will belong to the Taiwan  Independence Alliance and one to one of its affiliates, while  the designation of the remaining votes has not yet been clearly  determined. Hsu Lung-chun [6079 7893 0193], the newly elected  chairman of the Yulin County party branch, has had good  relations with both the Taiwan Independence Alliance and the  Kungtouhui.    As we understand, the local party representatives in Yulin  County have temporarily come to one common understanding, namely  not to allow themselves to be manipulated as pawns by any  faction or personality during the coming elections. When the  various forces will come and try to win over new followers,  they, the Yulin representatives, will therefore probably resort  to the method of asking these factions first how many seats they  control, and then, after assessing the "true strength" of each,  arrive at their final decision.    Among the older factions, the Meilitao faction, although  fragmented and dispersed, is presently still the largest  faction. At the time of election to the central executive  committee and central standing committee, the Meilitao faction  will only have to exchange votes with the various local bosses  and both sides will have to render mutual support. The  medium-age group [zhong sheng dai] of the Meilitao faction are  assessed as presently having a good chance of getting the  membership in the central executive committee, out of the two  top possibilities. The forces of the old Meilitao faction are  still in the process of consolidation. The important variable of  great influence will then be whether legislator Chang Chun-hung  [1728 0193 1347] will decide to enter the race for party  chairman.    Because Chang Chun-hung's forces had not yet been mobilized  during the present selection of delegates, they gained only one  seat among the seven candidates for Taipei City party  representatives, and that created a crisis for the Meilitao  faction. Most members of the Meilitao faction believe that if  Chang Chun-hung will stand for election as party chairman, he  would be the most formidable challenge for the re-election of  the incumbent chairman Shih Ming-teh [2457 2494 1795]. On the  other hand, it has already assumed the appearance of a "fight  for the protection of the Meilitao faction." Chang Chun-hung  could exercise extremely powerful pressure, and it is for this  reason that he appears even more cautious in every respect in  his present solicitation of opinions and assessments.    The likelihood of re-election of incumbent chairman Shih  Ming-teh has much increased after he gained the support of the  Hsin Chaoliu faction and most personages of the Welfare State  Alliance [Fuliguo lian xian].    As to Tsai Tung-jung's drive to enter the campaign for party  chairmanship--he, like Shih Ming-teh, belongs to the Welfare  State Alliance--this has evoked calls for his retirement from  some colleagues in the Welfare State Alliance, while Chang  Tsan-hung's campaign strategy gradually shifted toward mainly  external propaganda and enhanced external influence. It is  generally foreseen that if the present DPP election for party  president will ultimately develop into a confrontation between  personalities on the island and those abroad, it  will--regardless of whether the two men will fight it out to the  end--create for both of them a rather unfavorable overall  situation.    Because the present realignment of power within the DPP will  have an impact on overall position in future major elections,  everyone inwardly figures that the drive to bring all the  diverse forces within the factions together will become even  more acute. Add to it the fact that after the experiences of all  these years, fighting skills on all sides have been further  developed and matured. If one would, therefore, still have the  idea that this new wave, the change-over of teams in power  within the party, could now be weathered as a smooth transition,  that would, by all appearances, be a difficult thing to achieve.</p>

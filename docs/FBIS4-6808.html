			<p>BFN     [Text] THAILAND and Iran have finally agreed in principle  to exchange Thai rice with crude oil from Iran after the  Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) suggested the government  refine the low-quality crude oil at lower costs in a third  country, instead of burdening the local refineries with the  additional costs of refining the crude oil, which contains  higher sulphur and metallic contents.    The PTT suggested the government refine the problematic oil  in Italy because if the local refineries are to refine the crude  oil, it would have to spend additional funds for the  installation of machinery designed to properly refine the crude  oil from Iran, said Oranut Osathanan, director-general of the  Foreign Trade Department.    Iran has long been the customer of rice from Thailand, but  Thailand has been reluctant to buy oil from Iran because the  Iranian oil possesses an undesirably high sulphur and metallic  content. Thai and Iranian governments agreed a few months ago to  conduct a counter trade by exchanging Thai rice with the crude  oil from Iran, but so far they have yet to exchange their goods  because the local refinery, Petroleum Authority of Thailand, has  asked for compensation to offset the additional cost associated  with refining the crude oil from Iran.    The two sides last week signed the MoU, said Commerce  Ministry Uthai Phimchaichon, speaking upon his return trip from  Iran. He said Thailand agreed in principle to export  300,000-400,000 tonnes of Thai rice to Iran in exchange for  crude oil. The amount of crude oil under the deal has yet been  disclosed.    PTT will decide how much Iran crude oil Thailand should buy  before submining the proposal to the cabinet for approval,  Oranut said.    "Iran is a regular customer, and if we want to maintain our  rice market we should buy its crude oil," she added.    Oranut Osathanan, director-general of the Foreign Trade  Department, without elaborating on the compensation, said Iran  has allowed Thailand to refine the crude oil at Singapore and  Okinawa in Japan.</p>

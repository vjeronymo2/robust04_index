			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the House of Government in Minsk, the 13th  session of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet continues its work.  Deputies began their working day, as usual, with the  miscellaneous section, which was followed by the registration --  279 people's deputies attended today's debate. After that,  deputies returned to the issues that they began to discuss at  yesterday's session -- draft legislation on local administration  and the economy of the Republic of Belarus and new legislation  on Supreme Soviet elections. While the first bill was approved  quickly, clashes erupted over the second one, and as the result,  it was submitted for further consideration.    Having done this, the deputies began to adopt one piece of  legislation after another with renewed zeal. Thus, without  special difficulties, the draft housing code of the Republic of  Belarus, the draft program for housing development, and draft  legislation of public roads were adopted. Issues connected with  taxes, however, generated many disagreements among deputies.</p>

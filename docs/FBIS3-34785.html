He said resistance is a result,  not a cause of the Israeli occupation, and Israel's withdrawal  will return things to their old situation. President al-Hirawi  reiterated that there can be no just and comprehensive peace  before liberating the south and Western al-Biqa', because this  is the will of all Lebanese.    President al-Hirawi was speaking at an iftar [fast-breaking]  banquet hosted by Mrs. Randa Birri, head of the Lebanese  Handicapped Society at the Summerland Hotel. The iftar was  attended by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, Prime  Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, and a number of ministers, deputies,  and foreign diplomats.</p>

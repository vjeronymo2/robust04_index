RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C), 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether states have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibilities provided by 40 CFR Part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria shall apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 USC &sect;6945(c)(1)(C). EPA Region I has reviewed Massachusetts's MSWLF permit program adequacy application and has made a tentative determination that all portions of Massachusetts's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. The public comment period is being extended for 30 days in order to ensure that all interested parties have an opportunity to comment on the Massachusetts MSWLF permitting program. Massachusetts's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment at the places listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section below during regular office hours. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments on Massachusetts's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of Massachusetts's application for adequacy determination are available during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5:00 p.m. at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Solid Waste Management, One Winter Street, 4th Floor, Boston, MA 02108; U.S. EPA Region I, Waste Management Division, Solid Waste Section, 90 Canal Street, Boston, MA 02203, Attn: Fred Friedman, telephone (617) 573&hyph;9687.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR Part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under 40 CFR Part 258. Subtitle D also requires in Section 4005(c)(1)(C), 42 USC &sect;6945(c)(1)(C) that EPA determine the adequacy of state municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits, or other forms of prior approval and conditions (for example, license to operate) to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Second, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval and conditions to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 USC &sect;6974(b). Finally, the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: More in the waiting than in the expectation Sir, The two items appearing in the FT on Credit Lyonnais's announcement of 'bad results' translate attendre as 'to wait for' ('Credit Lyonnais goes to the people' and 'Observer: The laughing bank', September 30). Although this may be the meaning that first comes to mind, context leads to a different understanding. The verb attendre also means 'to expect', eg 'Je vous attends a neuf heures' is 'I'll be expecting you at nine'. In fact, there is no other way to say 'to expect', except by using the same word in the more cumbersome reflexive s'attendre a. This would have produced the somewhat leaden headline: 'Voici les mauvais resultats auquels tout le monde s'attend' rather than the headline cited from Le Monde of 'Voici les mauvais resultats que tout le monde attendait'. No wonder the latest public relations effort by Credit Lyonnais raised a hoot from Observer. I think you will agree, however, that 'Here are the bad results which everyone has been expecting' does not have the same piquant.

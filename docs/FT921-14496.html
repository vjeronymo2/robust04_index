			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall as hopes of cut in interest rate fade THE SELL-OFF in the US bond market continued unabated yesterday morning, despite a set of weaker-than-expected retail sales data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 105 3/8 , yielding 7.533 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, down 1/16 at 100 1/32 , and yielding 4.965 per cent. News of a 0.4 per cent decline in December retail sales, and a totally unexpected revision in November sales - down from an initial rise of 0.3 per cent to a drop of 0.5 per cent - should have provided a boost to the market. The fact that it did not, was the result of two factors: faded hopes of another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve; and persistent profit-taking as players continued to sell into the recent rally. In the credit markets, the Fed performed two-day matched sales just before midday in an attempt to push the Fed funds rate higher. After the matched sales, the rate - which has been depressed in recent days because of an excess of funds in the system - firmed slightly from 3 7/8 per cent to 3 15/16 per cent, but still just below the Fed's target of 4 per cent. UK government bonds gained up to half a point yesterday, boosted by positive inflation news and sterling's strengthening against the D-Mark. The news that UK producer output price growth slowed in December was seen in the market as a sign of falling underlying inflation. Output prices rose 0.1 per cent on the month and 5 per cent year-on-year, compared with November's 0.4 per cent monthly rise and 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase. Short-dated gilts rose by about a quarter of a point as the pound strengthened to 2.844 against the D-Mark. The 10 per cent gilt due 1994 increased from 100 1/4 to 100 13/32 , while among long-dated issues the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 114 19/32 to 115 by late afternoon. The Liffe gilt futures contract rallied from its opening of 96.14 to 96.28. Other factors which helped to lift gilt prices included the rise in German government bonds and rumours that an opinion poll due to be released today would show the Labour party's lead over the Conservative party had fallen to one point. STRONG demand for 10-year German government bonds pushed bund prices up yesterday as traders noted demand from central banks and fund managers. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from its opening of 87.94 to close just below the high of the day of 88.29. JAPANESE government bond prices firmed yesterday afternoon on news that central bankers at a Bank for International Settlements meeting agreed to accept the yen's appreciation. The news report appeared in the Japanese economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun and helped to push the yield on the benchmark No 129 from 5.37 per cent to close at 5.35 per cent in Tokyo. The dollar finished at Y126.05, lower than Y127.00 in New York late on Monday.</p>

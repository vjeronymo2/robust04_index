			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shuang Mu: "Broader B-Share Issues Weighed as a </F> Stimulus"]    [Text] China is considering expanding the issuance of B  shares, which are exclusively for foreign investors, to  stimulate the sluggish B-share market.    Also, said an official with the China Securities Regulatory  Commission, firms outside Shanghai and Shenzhen would be allowed  to issue B shares in the future.    So far, 42 enterprises have issued B shares with a total  capital of 3.01 billion yuan ($346 million). All are in  Shanghai and Shenzhen.    Many enterprises outside the two cities want to issue B  shares, because they think it is a quick way to pool foreign  capital.    The regulatory official said some large enterprises dealing  in energy, communications, transportation and railways will be  selected to issue B shares.    To ensure that the expansion proceeds smoothly, he said, the  most important thing is to improve the trading mechanism and the  information-disclosure system.    Supervision over listed B-share companies will be enhanced,  and the issuance, trading and settlement of B shares will be  improved.    He said authorities are drafting a set of national  regulations governing B shares.    When they are adopted, he said, the State will consider  listing B-share companies outside Shanghai and Shenzhen.    But the official ruled out establishing a third market for  trading B shares besides the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities  exchanges.    While expanding the domestic B-share market, the country is  also considering the listing of B-share companies on the Hong  Kong Stock Market.    Meanwhile, the country is considering expanding the investor  base by allowing B-share firms to issue American Depository  Receipts, convertible bonds and other stock-related instruments.    China opened its B-share market in November 1991, when the  Shanghai Vacuum Electronics Co Ltd signed the first agreement to  issue B shares.    Creating B shares, which are denominated in renminbi but  traded in foreign exchange, was based on two considerations.    First, that the establishment of a stock market available to  foreign investors would help Chinese enterprises gain access to  foreign capital.    Second, that, since the renminbi is not freely convertible,  foreign investors and stock exchange firms are limited in their  scope of business and must be separated from the A-share market,  which is devoted to Chinese investors.    In this way the development of a domestic market could be  shielded from the influence of foreign factors while the  interests of overseas investors, in turn, would be protected.    Securities authorities have come to realize that the  long-term division of the A- and B-share markets could create  many problems.    "From the view of progress, the two market should be  merged,"  said Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory  Commission.    The most essential prerequisite for the merger, Liu said,  would be the free convertibility of renminbi.    Technically, the timing depends on the prices on the A-share  and B-share markets.    Some local investors have suggested opening the B-share  market to Chinese.    Analysts say that opening the B-share market to domestic  investors would give it a big boost. They note that, as of the  end of April, individual foreign exchange savings in the Bank of  China surpassed $10 billion, enough capital to easily push up  the price of B shares.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There has been an ugly turn of events in  Bophuthatswana. A former member of parliament and his brother, a  government official, have been necklaced.    The two were murdered by a mob in Mshana near Mmabatho. Eye  witnesses say the crowd was made up of ANC [African National  Congress] supporters. Tutu Msomi has the story.    [Begin recording] [Msomi] Mr. Johannes Kadi, a member of  parliament, and his brother, Mr. Petrus Kadi, were necklaced in  front of this house. The MP's house and shops were burned down.  Lilian, Mr. Kadi's daughter who witnessed the attack, had a  narrow escape. She said more than 1,000 people -- some she  knew -- invaded the house yesterday in the afternoon.    [Lilian] There was a meeting between the ANC and the people  of the village. After the meeting a lot of people came here.  They were throwing stones at the house, then we went into the  house. They were burning the house, then we ran away from the  house as the house was burning. Then they took my father out,  then they came here.    [Msomi] Lilian said they reported the matter to the police  and no arrests had been made. But Chief Edward Lemeco, an ANC  member, denied that he had a meeting with ANC supporters.    [Lemeco] We discussed our post office that was taken here by  the president and Mr. Kadi. The community wanted to go and take  the post [as heard] back by force, and I told them that that  cannot be allowed.    [Msomi] We tried unsuccessfully to get Mr. Lucas Mangope's  comment on this matter. We were told he was asleep and could  not be disturbed. [end recording]</p>

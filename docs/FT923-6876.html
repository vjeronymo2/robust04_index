			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Retirement benefits stressed THE GOVERNMENT is trying to contrast favourably the treatment of British pensioners with their Continental counterparts as it embarks on further consultations over its plans to equalise retirement ages for men and women. The government's message is that British pensioners fare well by European standards when comparing all services provided and not just the cash value of pensions. Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior social security minister, said yesterday: 'European comparisons simply based on cash value take us nowhere.' The timing of the initiative will increase speculation that the government intends to equalise the state retirement age at 65 - a move seen as politically unpalatable because it would require women to work five years longer before being entitled to benefit. The Social Security Advisory Committee, the government's adviser on pensions policy, this month came out in favour of such a move. It suggested the Pounds 3bn annual savings could be used to help pensioners penalised by low pay and interrupted service in their working lives. Miss Widdecombe, stressing that the government had still not decided between the options for equalising state pension ages it set out last year, said she was concerned that current discussions should mark the start of a longer debate about how best to meet the needs of future generations of pensioners.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Europe's Jobs Crisis: A labour market 'gripped by Euro-sclerosis' - Why is unemployment so much worse in the European Community than in the US or Japan? Is it the recession, or are there deeper factors? / FT writers report as EC leaders seek answers at today's summit THE European Commission is worried. Mass unemployment has become a scar across the Community, threatening the social and political cohesion of a single market in which 10 per cent of the labour force are excluded from its supposed rewards. But the Commission's concern runs deeper: it fears the combination of persistent unemployment and sluggish job creation in EC countries, relative to other developed countries, may indicate a lack of flexibility and competitiveness. These fears led Commission President Jacques Delors last month to order a study of the EC's unemployment and competitiveness. Euro-sclerosis - the notion that European economic performance is being undermined by excessive regulation and labour market inflexibility - is thus firmly on the EC agenda at today's summit. Europe's recent record has certainly been miserable. EC employment fell by 1.3 per cent last year. The Commission's latest forecasts expect a fall of more than 1.75 per cent this year, the worst performance in EC history. As a result, the Commission expects EC unemployment to rise to 12 per cent next year, over 17m people, and fall only modestly thereafter. The immediate cause of this poor performance is the recession. So long as the European exchange rate mechanism continues to transmit high German interest rates across the continent, growth will remain depressed and unemployment will keep rising. European officials play down the effects of falling output. But a group of leading US economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Nobel prize winner Mr Franco Modigliani said recently they were 'amazed' that Mr Delors' unemployment initiative made no mention of the Bundesbank's high interest rates. 'We believe this policy to be one of the major, if not the major, cause of unemployment in the EC,' they said. Still, EC countries have good reason to feel worried when they look beyond lower interest rates and recovery to the future. For unemployment appears to be 'ratcheting up' from each cyclical trough to the next. And the malaise runs deeper. Europe has high unemployment, but also a miserable record of job creation compared with other developed countries. Twenty years ago the percentage of the US population of working age who had jobs was much the same as that of the EC. Since then the US has succeeded in increasing the numbers in employment by 30m - three times as many as the Community. As a result the EC has a very low rate of employment compared to other industrialised countries - less than 60 per cent of the working age population is in employment, compared to around 70 per cent in the US and Efta countries and over 75 per cent in Japan. What, EC governments ask, has gone wrong? The economic performance of the US over the past 20 years, judged by its growth rate, export performance or budget and trade deficits, has not been noticeably better than that of Europe. Both regions worry about the small but growing competitive threat from low-cost east Asian producers; both have seen technological change reduce the number of 'good' manufacturing jobs for poorly educated male manual workers at other than low wages; neither have been very effective at replacing old-style manufacturing jobs with well-paid ones in high technology industries. So why is unemployment persistently higher in Europe? Why are US workers, especially women, more likely to find a job than Europeans? And why have only 6 per cent of North America's unemployed been out of work for more than a year compared to nearly 50 per cent of European job seekers? The answer seems to be the regulated nature of the European jobs market, as the OECD, the European Commission and national governments are increasingly realising. In the US, with a deregulated, job-creating labour market, the result has not been long-term unemployment but, instead, falling real wages for people in work. Real wages for the poorest 10 per cent of US workers have fallen by a third since 1970, while unemployment benefits offer only a short-term alternative. Many women have entered the labour force - a worrying number of prime-age male workers have left it entirely. Most European governments have deliberately avoided the US route - the creation of large numbers of low wage, service sector jobs - by preventing pay from falling through maintaining relatively high minimum wages and unemployment benefits or public sector employment. This policy, the OECD argues, 'serves only to manifest the problem in a different form: instead of being working poor, unskilled workers are unemployed.' It also means that many women who would have entered employment in the 1980s have not been able to do so. Seventy per cent of the new jobs created in the EC in the second half of the 1980s went to new entrants to the labour market while only 30 per cent were taken by the unemployed. But female employment rates remain much higher in the US and the UK than in continental Europe, while, with the sole exception of the UK, unemployment rates in Europe are higher for women than for men. EC officials acknowledge that the balance has swung too far towards employment protection rather than creation. 'The inability of firms to hire and fire can be a problem in some parts of the Community,' says Mr John Morley, head of the Commission's employment policy unit. He lists high non-wage labour costs and employment taxes in some parts of the Community, inadequate training provision and the rigid working hours arrangements as possible reasons for this poor record of job creation. OECD officials say that European governments have so far only paid lip-service to the need for more flexible labour markets. In particular, they complain that too little effort has been made in switching employment spending from 'passive' measures - unemployment benefits - to 'active' ones such as counselling and retraining. But this failure goes to the root of the EC's dilemma. It may be wasteful to pay unemployment benefits to the growing army of long-term unemployed. But the US alternative - falling real wages for the unskilled, greater inequality and lower welfare benefits - can hardly be more palatable to EC governments.</p>

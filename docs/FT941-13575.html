			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Tory backbenchers furious at plans to abolish councils Local Conservative MPs responded with fury yesterday to proposals by Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission to abolish Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils and split them into seven all-purpose unitary authorities. Hull and York would be given self-governing status and Lincolnshire would retain its present two-tier structure with a county council and seven districts. North Yorkshire and Humberside would be split into three large rural authorities called 'ridings'. Mr Robert Banks, MP for Harrogate, said: 'I think the decision is a complete load of rubbish. This is a totally unworkable proposal, and I don't see any liking for it among the people in the areas concerned.' Several influential Conservatives attacked the plans as political opposition intensified to the commission, which is due to redraw the administrative map of non-metropolitan England by the end of this year. But Sir John was confident that his proposals would be implemented: 'We have learnt to have great confidence in the ability of local people to see through the posturing of local interests and the knee-jerk reactions of sound-bite politicians.' Sir John's proposal for Lincolnshire conflicts with Mr Gummer's latest guidance to the commission that the status quo should be retained only in 'exceptional' circumstances. The department has already told the commission to reconsider proposals to retain two tiers in Derbyshire and County Durham. But Sir John said there was 'no demand for change' from either local people or the special interests involved in Lincolnshire. He said: 'I would be surprised if ministers would be so foolish as to force down the throats of the people changes to the structure of local government, disruptive as it is, unless there was very persuasive evidence that change was what local people wanted to see.' Environment Department officials privately admitted that MPs in the Lincolnshire area had formally expressed their concern at the end of last year that there should be no change to the structure in their county. Political reaction concentrated on Yorkshire. Mr William Hague, a social security minister and MP for Richmond, predicted that the new 'North Riding' would cover too wide an area. Local district councils also said the three new ridings would be too big. Banham changes Ridings' boundary, Page 9</p>

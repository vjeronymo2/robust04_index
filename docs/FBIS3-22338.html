The prologue to this "renaissance" was Russia's refusal to  join the international ban on dumping toxic waste at sea. Tokyo  has assessed this action as a sign of preparation for new  dumping operations in the Sea of Japan. The government's  environmental protection agency has issued a special statement  on this subject.    Things did not end there, however, being continued in a  rather spicy way. Citing government sources, the South Korean  news agency YONHAP reported that the Russian side has sent an  unprecedented notification to Seoul, formulated in the style of  mild blackmail, according to Korean assessments. The Russian  document, the agency writes, sets forth the following  alternative: Either Seoul, together with Tokyo, immediately  provides money for the construction of land-based capacities for  the processing of the Pacific Fleet's radioactive waste, or  Russia dumps another portion of toxic muck, generated by 150  nuclear submarines in its fleet, in the waters of the Sea of  Japan.    At the official level, the Korean side has announced that at  present it does not intend to allocate any additional funds for  erecting land-based purification and processing installations.  At the same time, Seoul has stressed that there can be no  question of new credits for Russia until the problem of the  existing major Russian debt is resolved.</p>

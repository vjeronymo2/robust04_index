			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES / DAVID LEWINSON: EXHIBIT HIGHLIGHTS THEATER DESIGNER'S CAREER  </P> <P> Theater designers, those artists who create the sets and costumes for the  performing arts, face a peculiar situation unknown to their creative cousins in  the fine arts, whose talents in painting, sculpture, even architecture, the  theater designers combine.  </P> <P> Like painter, the designers create images both realistic and abstract. Like  sculptors, they create objects that are three-dimensional and free-standing.  Like architects, they create at least the appearance of cities and building  facades, and their structures must be engineered so they don't collapse and  injure people.  </P> <P> With all this, the costume design aspect only complicates the theater  designer's responsibility, demanding a combination of talents unexpected of  other artists.  </P> <P> However, unlike other artists' works, the theater designer's art achieves its  full realization not in the quiet timelessness of a gallery or museum  exhibition but in the often frenetic and always ephemeral context of a  performance in which the design is but one element serving in combination with  action, dialogue, dance or song, all of which constitute distractions if one  wishes to look at theater design as an art in its own right.  </P> <P> This situation defines a kind of built-in frustration inherent in "Robert  Israel: A Decade of Theatre Design," at UCSD's Mandeville Gallery (through  April 9). On view are 57 drawings, paintings, photographs, blueprints, and  costumes representing six major projects by Israel, an internationally known  and widely honored designer who has been on the UCSD faculty since 1977 but  will soon take a position at UCLA.  </P> <P> To look at the representations of any one of the productions as singularly  exemplary and impressive relative to the others misses the point of the  exhibition. It seems, in fact, that the show is set up intentionally to defy  such an approach because it concerns itself more with presenting aspects of the  design process than with trying to convey the final outcomes of that process.  </P> <P> Consider, for example, the presentations of Israel's designs for "The Yellow  Sound," commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum and inspired by a previously  unproduced 1913 libretto (or text) by Wassily Kandinsky, one of the giants of  early modern art, with music by the contemporary composer Thomas DeHartmann.  </P> <P> The story evolves from Russian mystical sources and deals with the continuity  of the sensual and spiritual aspects of human life. To realize the production,  Israel had to develop the scenic and costume elements called for by the text  and suggested by the music. In the 20 or so sketches and drawings that Israel  produced, we see yellow giants that look tree-like, a beautiful flower that is  a character in its own right, a leaning bell tower, images of boulders, and  representations of forms described on the drawings as "vague creatures" and  "imprecise figures."  </P> <P> The overall suggestion of the images as a group is decidedly mythic, even  primeval. But we never actually hear the sound of the music or see these  designs in their ultimate realization at full scale, with accompanying dialogue  and action. There aren't even any photographs of the actual performance in  progress, nor are any of the actual costumes displayed.  </P> <P> Apparently, this isn't oversight or cheapness on the part of the exhibition  organizers because, on the other hand, Israel's work for Prokofiev's "Fiery  Angel" is presented entirely in photographs, while his designs for "Mahagonny"  -- an opera by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill -- appears only through a set of  10 construction blueprints. Of Israel's work for the Philip Glass opera  "Akhnaten," we see actual elements from the production itself, gold-leafed hawk  and ibis masks, a silk gown and a headdress worn by the character of Nefertiti.  </P> <P> Five sketches of these costumes are on view, but no other drawings, blueprints,  or photos of other aspects of the production, either its preparation or final  form, are displayed. The focus is similarly concentrated in the representations  of another Philip Glass opera, "Satyagraha," an exploration of the evolution of  Gandhi's ideas of nonviolent resistance. On view are five drawings showing the  various characters' costumes, which consist of straightforward late 19th and  early 20th century styles.  </P> <P> The realism of the imagery from "Satyagraha" contrasts sharply with the  fantastic and unnerving creations for "The Yellow Sound," which, in turn,  displays a very different sensibility relative to the designs for "Akhnaten."  So, the exhibition steps not only from style to style in expressing the breadth  of Israel's responsibilities and creative as a theater designer. And it does  this quietly and subtly, not with occasional dramatic images but with the sum  of many images.  </P> <P> As to whether the works on view bear up to scrutiny as "art" independent of  their descriptive and documentary functions, argument could be made either way.  But there's this: the drawings from "Satyagraha" are on loan to the exhibition  from the collections of the Museum of Modern Art. Those from "The Yellow Sound"  are on loan from the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Art Collection. And many other  images and objects on view come from the Daniel Weinberg Gallery in Los Angeles  and the Max Protetch Gallery in New York.  </P> <P> Clearly, the line between these images from the realm of theater design and  more conventionally understood visual art is difficult to find, if it exists at  all.  </P></p>

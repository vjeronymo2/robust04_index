			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Hope dims for all-Americas trade bloc - Plans for a wider Nafta The US and its western hemisphere trading partners are struggling to chart the next stage in the economic integration of the Americas. After the successful negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, which came into force at the beginning of the year, hopes were high that the accord could be the first step towards a free trade zone across the hemisphere, In the afterglow of Nafta's passage, the Clinton administration called a summit of western hemisphere heads of state. That summit, to which all the region's heads of state except Fidel Castro were invited, is due to take place in Miami on December 9 and 10. Since last year, however, the prospects for hemispheric economic integration have receded, rather than advanced. While integration across Latin America has continued apace, the idea of the US being at the centre of a hemispheric free trade zone has suffered badly. The Clinton administration lost its authority to push through trade agreements under 'fast track' - without line-by-line scrutiny by Congress. With that receded prospects of a rapid accession to Nafta of Chile - the next country in line. Also buried was a proposal that would give for a period the countries of central America and the Caribbean 'Nafta parity' - the equivalent access to the US market enjoyed by Mexico. The losses for Mr Clinton's Democratic party in last week's mid-term congressional elections have further increased uncertainty about his administration's ability to carry through on its promises. And while a row over Haiti has been averted by the success so far of US intervention there, Latin countries will raise the contentious issue of the US embargo against Cuba. All this has worried some participating governments. In a bid to ensure that a lack of progress towards hemispheric integration does not imply the process will go into reverse, Canada, Mexico and Chile have been pressing the US to come up with a coherent hemispheric strategy for the summit. Some governments now think the summit may do something useful, after all. Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's minister of finance, said last week: 'Three months ago, we saw the summit as having a very unchallenging agenda. It's OK to talk about good government, corruption and drugs and that kind of thing - but trade had to be part of the talks. Otherwise, we would not have needed all those presidents and ministers there. Now, we think there might be an interesting discussion.' He said he saw two possible concrete developments emerging from the summit: A survey of existing trade and integration arrangements in the hemisphere to bring out what tariff and other rules apply. This would be a first step to ensure that current free trade arrangements do not place obstacles in the path of future economic integration. A timetable for action that would 'at the very least' freeze existing tariff and non-tariff barriers within the region. The patchwork of free trade agreements and customs unions that has been established in the region has been a source of worry for some trade experts. They are concerned that rules of origin and other arrangements in some free trade accords would be incompatible with others. They are also worried that the proliferation of bilateral free trade accords could hinder broader economic integration. These concerns are reflected in a joint paper from three pan-American organisations - the Organisation of American States, the InterAmerican Development Bank and the UN Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean - prepared for the summit. Moving towards free trade in the hemisphere through bilateral accords 'has several inherent limitations which make it less viable and less active than a multilateral route'. Using Nafta as a basis for a multilateral approach, it says, would be 'strong option'. This is the route favoured by Canada's Liberal government. A year ago, it was dithering over whether or not to ratify Nafta. Now it views Nafta enlargement as a centrepiece of foreign policy. Ottawa is nervous of losing what limited influence it has, should the US cut bilateral deals with its Latin American trading partners. Some work - such as harmonisation of trade statistics - is already under way to smooth the way for Chile's entry into Nafta. 'We're trying to make it as easy as possible for Nafta accession to go ahead should the US decide to do the right thing,' says one Canadian official. The joint paper suggests the summit set a target date - for example, the year 2000 - to complete formal multilateral negotiations on a hemispheric free trade zone. It proposes a commitment to annual ministerial meetings to establish principles to underpin the negotiations and to avoid the creation of obstacles against hemispheric integration. It says an existing group - the OAS special committee on trade - should act as the forum for these meetings, thereby avoiding the premature establishment of an institution which may not be the most appropriate in the long-term. It also suggests more support, in particular from the IADB, for investments linked to integration and trade, such as regional infrastructure projects. Priority finance could be given to those groupings following principles laid down by the OAS committee. Mr Jeffrey Garten, the Commerce Department undersecretary for international trade, says the US would like the summit to endorse free trade in the hemisphere and adopt 'concrete measures' to move towards that goal. However, the process will not be rapid. He acknowledges that 'our goals cannot be achieved in one year, or even five' but says 'the momentum towards trade expansion should be bolstered and accelerated'.</p>

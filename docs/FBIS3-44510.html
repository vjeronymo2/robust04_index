"It is encouraging, and will surely contribute to future  cooperation with those countries," Tai said in a regular  presidential press conference.    Lien began his two-leg private visit last Thursday. He has  already met with the leaders and other ranking officials of the  two Southeast Asian countries.    Tai said Lien's current trip is a realization of the  "practical diplomacy" initiated by President Li Teng-hui. He  said, however, that Li does not have plans to visit any foreign  countries in the near future.    According to a CNA dispatch, meanwhile, Premier Lien and his  wife spent a happy Tuesday in Singapore.    Lien started the day by playing golf with Singaporean Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong in the morning, and then took a ride on  the Mass Rapid Transit [railway] system and toured the city in  the afternoon.    Lien and his wife were honored by Senior Minister Li Kuan  Yew  at a dinner party held at the presidential office Tuesday night.  Several Singaporean cabinet ministers were also in attendance.    Lien will leave Singapore Wednesday, winding up his first  overseas trip since he assumed the premiership early last year.</p>

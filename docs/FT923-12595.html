			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Councils face wide tests of performance COUNCILS may find themselves forced to compile up to 178 'performance indicators' - or measures of effectiveness - if draft proposals from the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, for implementing the Citizen's Charter in local authorities are adopted. The indicators are intended to be used in 'league tables' to enable people to see how well their own council is performing. They will cover specific services such as local tax collection and education, as well as overall measures such as staff sickness rates. The draft admits, however, that even all those indicators will not give much guide to how well local services work. Today's Local Government Chronicle, which gives details of the Commission paper, says that full tables of indicators for all the councils in England and Wales would involve more than 44,000 measures of performance, making national comparisons complicated. The draft has been sent to a number of local authorities in a pre-consultation exercise before formal comments are invited on the proposals from all councils in September. The 98 'upper tier' indicators would apply to county councils, while districts would have to compile 69 'lower tier' indicators, and both tiers would face 11 general measurements. Metropolitan districts and London boroughs would have to collect all 178 of the indicators. In spite of the argument from some authorities that the raw data on, for example, the number of council homes unfit to live in will not give the basis for fair comparisons, the commission has so far decided against making adjustments to the material. 'Those intent on misusing figures will do so anyway,' it says. In some cases, however, 'context' indicators - for example the local crime rate - will be included. The difficulties the Audit Commission has found in trying to devise a workable system are apparent. 'The commission is conscious that the performance indicators listed here provide a generally unsatisfactory measure of the quality or effectiveness of services . . . It invites those that make this criticism to suggest practical ways in which this could be done,' the paper says. The scheme was the main element of the Department of the Environment's contribution to the Citizen's Charter, the necessary legislation being passed just before the election. Although some of the measures included are flagged only as 'possibles' because of doubts about their usefulness or measurability, professional organisations have commented that there should be additional measurements to give a clearer picture.</p>

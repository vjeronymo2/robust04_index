			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia and China have launched a joint project  to help clean up China's mine waste sites which take up more  than 20,000 square kilometers -- about one third of the size of  Tasmania.    Australian International Development Assistance Bureau has  allocated Australian $3.5 million to fund the four-year  technical assistance program.    Project involved technology transfers and would also  identify  health risks to nearby communities. It will be based at the  Beijing Central Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and the field  work will begin at two experimental sites -- the (Shiochaoyang)  Mine in Jiangxi Province and the (Tongling) Mine in Anhui  Province.</p>

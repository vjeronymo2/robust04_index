			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 15 June (MTI) -- Prime Minister Peter  Boross met -- at his own initiative -- leaders of the six  parliamentary parties in his parliamentary office on Wednesday  [15 June]. Speaking to journalists after the over two-hour  meeting, Boross said the informal conversation concerned the  transfer of governmental affairs, and did not cover the  coalition talks between the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and  the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ).    He handed a list of bills and proposed resolutions not yet  passed by Parliament to the party heads, and asked the MSZP and  SZDSZ leaders to select those they wish to adopt, because the  government will withdraw the others.    At the talks, the prime minister offered to propose the  president of the republic dismiss the radio and television  vice-presidents, after it became clear to him that the new  cabinet wishes to see a new leadership at the two media. On  Thursday [16 June], Boross will put at the parties' disposal the  privatization files, a report on state commitments, the balance  of external and internal debts, and ministry reports on affairs  in progress.</p>

Yi sent an aide to Beijing on Jan. 7 to arrange meetings  with  President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders, but the aide  failed to get a schedule fixed, according to the official.    "I've heard that Yi's aide returned home on Monday and  explained the results of his trip to Beijing to Yi," the  official said. "The aide pushed for meetings between five  Chinese leaders and Yi, but he could not fix a schedule."</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CE Heath cuts Australian holding to raise Pounds 46m CE HEATH, the insurance group, is planning a sharp reduction in its stake in its Australian underwriting subsidiary, CE Heath International Holdings (HIH), through a public offering of new shares to raise about ADollars 105m (Pounds 46m). Following the flotation, CE Heath's stake in the company will be diluted from 90 per cent to about 45 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Cash raised from the offering will be used to repay HIH's borrowings and provide the Australian company with capital for expansion. The decision follows last year's disposal by CE Heath of its Bermuda-based financial reinsurance arm, Pinnacle Reinsurance. CE Heath said at the time it planned to concentrate on its core broking business rather than underwriting. Ord Minnett Securities has been appointed by HIH as manager and underwriter.</p>

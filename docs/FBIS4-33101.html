			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lou Kuang-jen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] San Salvador, June 1 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan said  Wednesday [1 June] that he will visit New York for private  reasons following his official visit to Guatemala.    This was the first time Lien publicly confirmed his New York  trip.    Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, arrived in San Salvador  Tuesday to attend the inauguration of the new Salvadoran  president, Armando Calderon Sol.    Lien will leave here Thursday for Guatemala for a four-day  visit. He will then proceed to New York for a two-day stay.    Lien told a group of Taiwan reporters after attending a  cocktail reception given by Calderon that his New York trip is  purely for private purposes.    "While there, I won't meet with any person except my  children," Lien noted. Two of Lien's children are studying in  New York. "I expect a happy family reunion there," he said.    Lien, who has a doctoral degree from the University of  Chicago, said he visited New York many times while he was  studying in the United States. "I have fond memories of that  city," he added.    Lien's wife, who is accompanying Lien on his Salvador and  Guatemala visits, will fly to New York along with Lien. Other  members of Lien's entourage, including Economic Affairs Minister  P.K. Chiang and Chairman Sun Ming-hsien of the Council of  Agriculture, will return to Taipei after the Guatemala visit.    On his way to San Salvador from Taipei, Lien stopped in Los  Angeles and Miami. Lien also made stopovers in the two American  cities when he visited Honduras early this year.    Taiwan does not maintain diplomatic ties with the United  States. For fear of offending Beijing, the U.S. Government has  been reluctant to engage in high-level contacts with Taiwan. It  only allowed Taiwan's President Li Teng-hui to make a short stop  in Hawaii on his way to Nicaragua in May.</p>

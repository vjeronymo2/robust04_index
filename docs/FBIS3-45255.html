			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Fan Liqing (5400 7787 </F> 7230): "Heading Toward a New Stage of Nongovernmental and  Economic Consultations and Cooperation -- a Reexamination and  Observation of Mainland-Taiwan Relations in 1993"]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (XINHUA) -- With the successful  meeting between Wang Daohan [president of the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- ARATS] and Gu Zhenfu [Ku  Chen-fu, chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange  Foundation -- SEF] as the benchmark, mainland-Taiwan relations  in 1993 stepped into a new stage in which real problems were to  be resolved through consultations. During 1993, mainland-Taiwan  relations continued to relax, contacts and exchanges continued  to increase rapidly in various fields, two-way exchanges  broadened, economic contacts and trade continued to maintain the  momentum of rapid development, and the need "to intensify  complementary and reciprocal cross-strait economic exchange"  became an understanding shared by the two sides. Meanwhile,  people at home and abroad were greatly concerned with the  repeated disputes on the island surrounding the so-called "two  sovereign states" and the moves for "returning to the United  Nations."    The "Wang-Gu meeting" certainly was the most noticeable  event  in the development of mainland-Taiwan relations in 1993. Thanks  to the efforts exerted by the two sides, including ARATS and the  SEF, the meeting eventually took place in Singapore at the end  of April after 18 months of preparations. Even though it was  described as nongovernmental, this first formal meeting of  high-level personnel of the two sides in more than 40 years was  a highly significant meeting. The four accords signed at the  meeting set the principle that the two sides should intensify  their complementary and reciprocal economic exchanges and  formally established the channels for cross-strait contacts,  thereby providing guidance for future cross-strait consultations  and enabling the two sides to take an important, historic step  forward in developing their relations. After the accords reached  at the "Wang-Gu meeting" became effective at the end of May, the  use of notarization documents and inquiry of relevant issues  proceeded smoothly, and the quantity of cross-strait registered  mail increased rapidly, greatly facilitating family contacts and  various other exchange activities between people of the two  sides. In order to fully implement the accords, ARATS and  Taiwan's SEF had three working meetings -- held respectively in  Beijing, Xiamen, and Taibei [Taipei] -- during the second half  of 1993. In addition to discussing and exchanging views on the  issues prescribed in the "Common Agreement of the Wang-Gu  Meeting," the two sides, because of actual needs, also agreed to  discuss the issue about "repatriation of plane hijackers." With  the understanding and support from people of all walks of life  in Taiwan for the ARATS representatives' first visit to Taiwan  for consultations, ARATS-SEF contacts and cooperation continued  to develop, and nongovernmental cross-strait consultations  continued to deepen.    The successful "Wang-Gu meeting" has instilled new vitality  into cross-strait contacts and exchange. In 1993, two-way  exchanges broadened and there were contacts of personnel of  higher levels. It has been estimated that over five million  countrymen in Taiwan will have visited the mainland over the  years, including the 1.5 million in 1993. Among those  countrymen visiting the mainland for various exchange programs,  there was noticeably a greater number of well- known personages  including "national assemblymen," "legislators," members of the  Kuomintang [KMT] Central Committee, and principal leaders of  other parties. Mainland personnel have also made new headway in  visiting Taiwan for various exchange programs. The number of  groups organized by scientific-technological, art, sports, and  journalistic circles to visit Taiwan for exchange programs was  noticeably higher than previous years. According to statistics  released by relevant authorities, during the period from January  to 15 December, 3,140 persons were approved to visit Taiwan for  481 exchange projects. The broadening and deepening of two-way  exchange have powerfully promoted the understanding between  countrymen of the two sides.    The strong momentum in the development of cross-strait  economic contacts and trade has continued. According to  statistics, indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong exceeded  $6.3 billion during the January-September period, and the trade  volume in 1993 was estimated at more than $10 billion. Taiwan  countrymen's craze for investing their money on the mainland  continued. In fact, the craze heated up as a result of the  "Wang-Gu meeting." By the end of June 1993, over 15,100  Taiwan-funded businesses with a total negotiated investment of  $13.6 billion had been approved. More large businesses and  consortia in Taiwan came to the mainland to study investment  possibilities. In early May, the first group of bankers from 15  nongovernmental banks in Taiwan came to visit the mainland. At  stockholders' meetings in Taiwan in mid-July, 38 percent of the  270 listed Taiwan corporations authorized the corporations'  boards of directors to directly handle their mainland's  investment businesses, which involved NT$42.7 [new Taiwan  dollars] billion. Although Taiwan's banking business and the  listed corporations were unable to realize their mainland  investment plans owing to the Taiwan authorities' obstruction,  their attempts indicated the significant trend for cross-strait  economic exchanges and cooperation. To expedite cross-strait  economic cooperation and trade, an executive meeting of the  State Council adopted the "PRC Law for Protecting Taiwan  Countrymen's Investment." This law, which was submitted to the  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee on 20  December for its deliberations, shows the mainland has made  substantial progress in standardizing and institutionalizing  cross-strait economic relations and trade.    Another major event relevant to mainland-Taiwan relations in  1993 was the publication of the Chinese Government white paper  entitled "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," which has  aroused enthusiastic response among people at home and abroad.  This programmatic document bearing on the motherland's peaceful  reunification has fully and comprehensively expounded the  Chinese Government's Taiwan policy and the origin and nature of  the Taiwan issue, and it has summed up all the general and  specific policies drawn up since the NPC published its "Message  to Countrymen in Taiwan" in 1979. The white paper has firmly  safeguarded China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and  denounced the fallacies and activities of "Taiwan independence."  It also points out that "Taiwan countrymen's wishes to be the  masters of their own house are fair, reasonable, and legitimate.  These wishes are different from `Taiwan independence,' and  these countrymen are totally different from those who insist on  following the course of `Taiwan independence.'" By stating  this, the white paper has pointed out the way of knowing  Taiwan's real public opinion.    In the past year, there have been fluctuations in the  progress of cross-strait relations, and some new variables have  appeared. Taiwan authorities have relaxed somewhat their policy  on cross-strait exchanges. At the end of 1993, Taiwan's SEF  proposed, on its own accord, that its third working meeting with  ARATS be held in Taibei. Consequently, a meeting concerning  cross-strait general affairs was held on the island for the  first time. On the other hand, Taiwan authorities have in the  past year spread various inappropriate remarks on the principle  of one China, including repeating the statement on "giving  priority to Taiwan" within the island, and spreading the  comments that "political entities on both sides of the Taiwan  Strait are on an equal footing." Immediately after the "Wang-Gu  meeting," Taiwan authorities played up the view that "the  meeting has demonstrated the fact that both sides of the strait  are on an equal footing, split, and under separate  jurisdictions." During the three follow-up meetings aimed at  implementing accords reached at the "Wang-Gu meeting," the  Taiwan side also repeatedly stressed the so-called "sovereign,  administrative, and judicial powers," attempting to use  cross-strait routine meetings to fulfill its objective of  playing up the allegation that Taiwan is the so-called  "political entity on an equal footing." In the middle of 1993,  the "National Unification Conference" held by Taiwan authorities  "redefined the meaning" of the principle of one China.  Additionally, at the end of 1993, officials -- sent by Taiwan  authorities to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  conference in Seattle -- publicly announced they would implement  the "policy of two China's as a phase [jie duan xing de liang ge  zhong guo zheng ce 7132 3008 4104 0257 0020 0022 0948 2398  4595]." Meanwhile, the Taiwan authorities' campaign to "expand  their international space" has gone astray. Before, during, and  after the United Nations General Assembly's sessions in 1993,  Taiwan authorities sent many personnel to launch activities in  various localities in the international community, clamoring "to  reenter (or termed as join) the United Nations." The Taiwan  authorities' regression on their one-China position has provoked  strong opposition from people on both sides of the strait, and  from the broad masses of Chinese overseas. Domestic and  international public opinion have pointed out: There is only  one China in the world. The position of Taiwan as a part of  China is definite and unchangeable. Any plots attempting to  create "two China's," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan  independence" are doomed to failure.    When reviewing the progress of cross-strait relations in  1993, we notice: Enhancing cross-strait relations and  expeditiously increasing further bilateral exchanges and visits  suit the interests of people on both sides of the strait.  Therefore, the broad masses of people support such activities.  On the contrary, all attempts -- obstructing the progress of  cross-strait relations and hampering further cross-strait  exchanges and visits -- will definitely fail because of the  people's opposition. When looking forward in 1994, we believe:  With high expectations and joint efforts from people on both  sides of the strait, cross-strait exchanges and visits will  increase further. When judging the progress of cross-strait  relations, people will focus their attention on the outcome of  meetings concerning cross-strait general affairs. Nevertheless,  we should also notice: A very small number of people, inside  and outside Taiwan, who are unwilling to see a reunited China,  will continually change their methods; will create trouble under  various pretexts; and will promote their plots of attempting to  create "two China's," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan  independence." We must remain highly vigilant and mete out  resolute blows to such moves.</p>

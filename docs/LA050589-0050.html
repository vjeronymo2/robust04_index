			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GRANT OKD TO STUDY VENICE PIER REPAIRS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council approved a $30,000 grant from the state Coastal  Conservancy this week to pay half the cost of an engineering study on the  deteriorating Venice Pier, which was closed two years ago.  </P> <P> Joel Breitbart, assistant general manager of the city Recreation and Parks  Department, said a consultant is expected to be selected within two weeks.  Results of the study are due in the fall.  </P> <P> Breitbart said the study will determine the extent of damage to the  1,200-foot-long, reinforced concrete-and-steel pier. He said the study also  will look at the costs of repairing and replacing the pier.  </P> <P> The other half of the money will come from $500,000 that already had been  approved for demolition of the pier. The Coastal Conservancy is a state agency  charged with preserving coastal resources.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old pier was closed in November, 1986, after pieces of concrete  fell off.  </P> <P> Engineers found that salt water had corroded the steel frame and that the  rusted steel was expanding, causing the concrete to break.  </P></p>

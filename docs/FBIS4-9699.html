			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 29  March.    The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE,  has disclosed that in 1993 commercial trade increased 4.25  percent, due primarily to an increase in the sale of furniture  and electrical appliances which, in turn, was prompted by  increased construction. DANE figures show that sales in December  increased by 8.79 percent compared to the same period on 1992.  Vehicles and replacement parts sold the most at 15.62 percent,  and fuel and lubricants sold the least at minus 7.26 percent.  Although sales were up, jobs decreased by 1.48 percent in  comparison to 1992. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 17  Mar 94 p 4B)    The prices of staple products continue to increase in a  worrisome manner. During the first 10 days of March the cost of  living increased by 1.94 percent, which usually happens every  month, but the government fears that if the trend continues  throughout the month the quarterly cost of living rate could  increase to up to 10 percent. Some analysts believe the excess  of money in circulation is also a factor. In 1993 food, which  represents 34 percent of the cost of living, increased by only  14.5 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 18 Mar  pp 1, 1B)    Foreign investment in Colombia increased by 8.6 percent in  January compared to the same month in 1993. Total investment,  excluding petroleum, was $21.7 million in January 1994 compared  to $19.9 million in January 1993. The Investing in Colombia  Corporation reported that 89.7 percent of this investment went  to the mining sector. The manufacturing sector received 6.2  percent. The United Kingdom was the top investor with $17.4  million, that is, 84.4 percent of total foreign investment in  Colombia in January 1994. All of it went to the mining sector.  The United States was second with 13.1 percent and it also  invested in the mining sector. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in  Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3B)    Colombian purchases abroad increased by 47.2 percent between  January and November 1993 compared to the same period in 1992.  Exports grew by only 2.7 percent in the same period. According  to DANE, imports totaled $8.948 billion, and exports totaled  $6.504 billion. Economists think that this is due to the  revaluation of the peso. The import of consumer and capital  goods and construction materials experienced the highest growth  rate, more than 70 percent. The import of vehicles grew by 148  percent and the import of weapons by 215 percent. Exports  increased from $6.332 billion to $6.504. Traditional exports,  such as coffee, petroleum, coal, and ferrous nickel  [ferroniquel], dropped by 6.46 percent. Meanwhile,  nontraditional exports grew by 11.37 percent. (Santa Fe de  Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 19 Mar 94 p 3B)    The Board of the Cartagena Accord has reported that the  exchange of goods and services among the members of the Andean  Group, comprised by Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and  Venezuela, reached $2.886 billion in 1993, that is, a  117-percent increase compared to 1990. Excluding fuel, exports  among Andean countries in 1993 reached $2.642 billion, a 34.1  percent increase compared to 1992. In 1993 Colombia exported  $1,159,800,000 or 40.2 percent of total intra-subregional trade.  Venezuela was the main destination for Colombian exports.  Sales to that country totaled $711.6 million. Venezuela was  the second Andean Group exporter with $987.5 million or 34.2  percent of total intra-subregional sales. Most Venezuelan  exports went to Colombia. Ecuador registered the largest  increase in intra-subregional exports with 76 percent. Bolivia  increased exports by 8 percent and Peru by 10.4 percent in 1993.  (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 23 Mar 94 pp 1B, 3B)    Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos and Agriculture  Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo sent a letter dated 23 March to the  newspaper EL TIEMPO stating that the government is not planning  to reduce tariffs on and protective measures for the  agricultural sector, or alter the price of agricultural produce  in order to stop the rise of inflation. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL  TIEMPO in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 8A)    The members of the Association of Coffee Producers on 24  March decided to reduce from 20 percent to 10 percent their  withholding of exportable coffee, a measure they have  implemented since October 1993. They had agreed that as soon as  the price of coffee reached 75 cents per pound they would cut  withholding by half. This in fact happened because the price of  coffee was over 75 cents yesterday. This decision was made  during a meeting in London. The member countries decided to  continue this strategy because it has so far produced good  results. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 25 Mar 94 p 1B)    The next government must manage the petroleum bonanza very  prudently and save part of those resources if it wants to come  out a winner from one of the greatest economic challenges of  recent years. President Cesar Gaviria, World Bank officials, and  international experts made this recommendation yesterday at the  opening of a seminar organized by the National Planning  Department. President Gaviria said that the Cusiana oil fields  must be used to decrease poverty levels and achieve a sustained  growth rate. The country currently has a reserve of 3.6 billion  barrels of petroleum. Gaviria pointed out that the country must  continue its search for new oil fields. Gaviria urged his  successor to follow the example of Indonesia, which progressed  after a petroleum boom. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish  25 Mar 94 p 1B)</p>

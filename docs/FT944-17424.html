			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Labour attacks ex-minister's move to City: MacGregor appointment as deputy chairman of Hill Samuel condemned as 'sleazy and scandalous' A move by Mr John MacGregor, former transport secretary, to rejoin merchant bank Hill Samuel sparked a political row last night as Labour attacked the system which gives former ministers freedom to take City directorships. Mr Brian Wilson, the opposition transport spokesman, said he would raise the appointment in the Commons when MPs return to Westminster in 10 days' time. Hill Samuel, a subsidiary of TSB Bank, is advising the Department of Transport on the Channel Tunnel Rail link. It was selected to advise on the rail link in August last year after a competition among a number of banks. Mr MacGregor asked to take no part in the selection process because of his former links with the bank. Under government rules there are no restrictions on ministers taking jobs in the private sector which have connections with their previous ministerial posts. But Mr Wilson said Hill Samuel's involvement in the Channel tunnel link meant that Mr MacGregor's appointment as non-executive deputy chairman was 'completely unacceptable'. He said: 'Hill Samuel are the direct beneficiaries of Mr MacGregor's policies, particularly in relation to the Channel tunnel link.' Accusing the Conservatives of 'sleazy and scandalous' behaviour, Mr Wilson said: 'It is completely unacceptable that the secretary of state at the time of Hill Samuel's appointment should immediately move over from government to boardroom.' He added that 'common decency dictated that Mr MacGregor should have steered clear of companies which were direct beneficiaries of his own policies'. Downing Street indicated that it saw no conflict of interest. The row follows a series of attacks at the Labour conference in Blackpool on the jobs taken by former ministers. The opposition's opinion polling shows that the charge has a resonance with the electorate. Rules issued by the cabinet office say there are no formal restrictions on former ministers taking up private-sector posts other than those which apply to all backbench MPs. The rules add that former ministers should avoid any actions which reflect adversely on their or the government's reputation. Mr MacGregor worked at Hill Samuel for 11 years before his 15-year ministerial career. He remains MP for South Norfolk. Before he became transport secretary in 1992 he served as chief secretary to the Treasury, minister of agriculture, education secretary, Lord President of the Council and leader of the Commons. Mr Hugh Freedberg, Hill Samuel's chief executive, said Mr MacGregor's experience would be valuable in continuing to develop the business in the UK and internationally.</p>

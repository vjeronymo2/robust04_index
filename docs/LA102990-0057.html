			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Nudes Unveiled: Officials have relented and have allowed the removal of fig  leaves covering three nude figurines displayed at Dallas City Hall after the  artist accused the city of censorship. Last Monday, park officials ordered the  "Getting Better Ain't Always Easy" exhibit by Lubbock artist Future Atkins  covered, fearing the 7 1/2-inch pieces would offend visitors. By Thursday, they  had changed their minds and removed the makeshift leaves. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

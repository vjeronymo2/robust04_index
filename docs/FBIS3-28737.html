			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Work Out Reputable Tax System Reform Plans"] </F>   [Text] The tax issue, over which political turmoil has  continued ever since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced  his "national welfare tax" plan, has finally been settled for  the time being.    However, the agreement among coalition leaders -- setting  aside the amount of tax cuts -- leaves us with a strong  impression that the scattered manner in which tax cuts are to be  made and how a source of revenue to make up for them is to be  ensured are merely stop-gap measures. We deeply regret this.    Granted, it could not be helped considering the impending  situation regarding the political timetable, including the  implementation of pump-priming measures, compilation of the  draft budget for the next fiscal year, and the upcoming  Japan-U.S. summit meeting. However, the problem has merely been  shelved, as the issue of financial insurance for tax cuts has  now been left completely up to discussions among the ruling  coalition parties.    The greatest concern is that there is no real guarantee that  an agreement on the source of revenue to make up for tax cuts  will be reached by a consultative body made up of members from  the ruling coalition parties.    According to the statement of accord among coalition  leaders,  legislation on a source of revenue is to be enacted during a  Diet session by the year end. However, there is a precondition  that this can only be done "under agreement among the ruling  coalition parties." If the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ], which is the largest contingent among the ruling  coalition parties, should decide to voice opposition to a tax  hike, threatening once again to "break away from the coalition  government," there is no guarantee the tax issue will not be  shelved again.    Moreover, unified local elections are to be held in the  spring of 1995, and an upper house election is to be held the  following summer. Depending on the political situation, there  may even be a lower house election. As the time for elections  get closer and closer, election-motivated opposition to tax  hikes will inevitably grow stronger.    Meanwhile, coalition leaders have also agreed to implement a  6-trillion-yen tax cut plan (which includes 5.5 trillion yen in  income and residence tax cuts) retroactive to 1 January, for  which the legislation is to be effective for one year only.    This means that if legislation for securing a revenue source  for tax cuts should not be enacted by the year end, the tax cut  plan will be cut off thereafter. In that case, the pump-priming  effects of the 15-trillion yen economic stimulus package will go  to waste.    Furthermore, the planned tax cuts rely heavily on  deficit-covering bonds as a revenue source. The ruling  coalition parties should make a thorough review of these matters  and strive to come up with a responsible decision.    The responsibility mentioned here does not simply mean that  the ruling coalition parties should look from a short-term  viewpoint to study the issue of finding a revenue source for tax  cuts. It also means they should look from a medium- to  long-term viewpoint to study the issue of how the tax system  ought to be in preparation for the coming of an aging society;  and particularly, the issue of drastic tax system reform which  includes rectifying the balance between direct and indirect  taxes.    This is why we have basically supported the "Hosokawa plan,"  despite such faults as the abrupt manner in which it was  announced, the sudden changing of the consumption tax name, and  the nontransparent decisionmaking process.    Although the "Hosokawa plan" has basically been brought back  to the drawing board, it still bears significance for bringing  problems out into the open. Clearly, the current tax system  which leans heavily toward direct taxation centered on income  taxes will eventually collapse as the society rapidly progresses  to a state in which one out of every four Japanese will be over  65 years old.    There may be divided views on whether a 7-percent tax rate  is  reasonable. However, it is impossible to shift the strain of  the burden of rapidly rising pension, medical, and nursing costs  to workers in the prime of their lives. Regardless of name,  indirect taxes -- particularly the consumption tax -- must be  raised, and it is inevitable.    It is the politician's duty to continue striving to gain  public approval by sharing the pain with the people, while  taking such future prospects into consideration. It is  desirable that a reputable plan on tax system reform be worked  out and presented to the people as soon as possible. Sweet  promises should not be made merely to put off the issue.</p>

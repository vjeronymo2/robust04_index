			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Equity Markets: Strategists' menus suggest further gains - London After last week's spectacular performance it may seem churlish to ask for more, but the tone of the London stock market suggests that more is indeed expected, at least on the menus put together by the equity strategists. Base rate cuts - the market now prefers the plural version - are more than ever in prospect for the new year, with or without the encouragement of the Bundesbank. The chancellor's commitment to promoting economic recovery has re-focused attention on the January round of company results; the market has been through this exercise before, but expectations that recovery will show itself in corporate profits have to be satisfied soon. The effects of the Budget speech showed themselves in a number of special factors last week. Derivatives markets again demonstrated the power over underlying equities imposed by the impressive liquidity and flexibility of the futures markets. 'If a fund manager wants to put, say Pounds 50m into UK equities, then the stock market will be moving against him long before he secures the stock. But he can put Pounds 50m into the stock index future in half an hour,' said one futures trader as the December stock index contract raced to premiums of around 30 points against cash last Wednesday. The premium dipped at one time but by the close of business on Friday it had returned to around 29 points against cash - Fair Value, the estimated premium allowing for dividend and carrying costs, is virtually zero at this stage of the contract's life. The premium still offers a powerful lead ahead of its expiry in just over a week, when the contract and the FT-SE 100 Index must be in line. However, last week's futures frenzy may not be repeated, since it was also linked to frantic attempts by a UK investment bank to put into equities Pounds 100m cash taken in by the new Lloyds investment funds. The stock market estimates that more than Pounds 500m of these Lloyds funds are earmarked for UK equities. With the Budget out of the way, there will be less pressure on fund managers to get the money into the market. One hurdle still to be faced could be the market's more considered response to the Budget proposals on Foreign Income Dividends. The stock market has identified nearly 40 companies, mostly FT-SE listed, which could be serious FID candidates, although the companies themselves still seem unsure of their dividend policy. The stock market has been surprisingly slow in taking on board the implications of the Budget FID plans, perhaps because analysts have seen them as share-specific rather than significant for the market as a whole. The implications of Ladbroke's decision to take advantage of FID rules has been masked by the many other factors affecting the shares. The same applies to BP, Lasmo and Rank Organisation, all three spotted by the market as stocks with a surplus ACT problem. The search for other FID candidates will no doubt be taken further this week.</p>

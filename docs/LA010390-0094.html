			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Anabolic steroids may have a greater effect on the mind than the body of  athletes, a British television documentary says.  </P> <P> "QED: The Steroid Myth" presents evidence from the United States, Britain and  Italy challenging the view that the physical effects of steroids can turn good  athletes into world champions.  </P> <P> "The idea that steroids enhance performance may be another damaging myth," the  program, scheduled for airing today on British Broadcasting Corporation,  concludes.  </P> <P> To support this point, the program cites evidence at the University of New  Mexico at Albuquerque, where a group of male athletes were tested for nine  weeks.  </P> <P> All were injected with a variety of treatments, including steroids and placebos  -- substances that have no medical effect and are used merely as a testing  device.  </P> <P> According to the university's Dr. Douglas Crist, there was "no statistical  significant change in body fat . . . no statistical significant change in  muscular power."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the athletes reported that they felt stronger.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BRADLEY, COELHO TARGETS OF U.S. CRIMINAL PROBE  </P> <P> Preliminary criminal investigations of both Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and  House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) have been opened by the Justice  Department in Washington in connection with their financial dealings with  Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Although details of the investigations are not known, a central question being  examined is whether Bradley and Coelho, who have acknowledged that they made  investment deals through Drexel Burnham, illegally received preferential  treatment. The inquiry is also expected to examine whether investment  opportunities may have been made available to the two Democratic officeholders  with the hope or expectation of favored treatment from them in return.  </P> <P> The decision to open a preliminary investigation of Bradley represents a  significant step beyond the decision last week by the U.S. attorney's office in  Manhattan to subpoena records of the mayor's transactions with Drexel Burnham.  </P> <P> That subpoena was issued in connection with a "broad-based" inquiry into the  investment firm's dealings with politicians. Launching a preliminary  investigation, by contrast, is the first official step in the Justice  Department's formal procedure for deciding whether the facts warrant no further  action or instead justify launching a full-scale grand jury investigation  leading to possible criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> Because of the sensitivity of even preliminary investigations of political  figures, they normally are authorized only after a thorough study and after the  attorney general gives his approval. The Justice Department treats such  investigations with utmost secrecy.  </P> <P> The preliminary investigations of Bradley and Coelho are especially sensitive  since they involve a Republican Administration examining the conduct of two of  the nation's more prominent Democratic officials.  </P> <P> The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter.  </P> <P> Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that "the mayor has no knowledge of any  such investigation." Bradley has regularly refused to discuss specifics of his  holdings until the investigations into his conduct are completed.  </P> <P> Coehlo was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman, Fred Hatfield, said that  the congressman is certain he is not the subject of a preliminary  investigation.  </P> <P> Whatever the outcome of the preliminary investigations, the decision to launch  them is another political blow to both men, whose financial dealings have come  under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks.  </P> <P> The investigations are being conducted in Washington by the Justice  Department's Public Integrity Section against the backdrop of an unusual  disagreement between U.S. attorneys' offices in Los Angeles and New York over  whether facts in the case warrant such serious action, sources said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, U.S. Atty. Robert Bonner reportedly concluded that the  available facts did not warrant preliminary inquiries.  </P> <P> However, sources said that in New York, Acting U.S. Atty. Benito Romano  concluded that facts developed in his office's long-running investigation of  Drexel Burnham warranted inquiries into transactions with the investment firm  by both Bradley and Coelho. But Romano's office lacked venue to pursue the  investigations because the transactions involving the two Democrats took place  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> To resolve the issue, sources told The Times, the Public Integrity Section -- a  Justice Department unit responsible for looking into allegations of corruption  against judges and other political figures -- studied the two cases and  concluded that it should take jurisdiction and conduct preliminary  investigations.  </P> <P> Regardless of the outcome of these investigations, both Bradley and Coelho face  other official inquiries involving their investments and public disclosure  requirements that could cause political and legal problems.  </P> <P> Bradley, who last month won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of Los  Angeles, faces several investigations.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission has reviewed records that indicate that  the mayor may have received favored treatment on at least one occasion in 1986,  when he invested in Worlds of Wonder, a Fremont-based toy firm whose stock  jumped 50% on the first day it was sold to the public in June, 1986.  </P> <P> An inquiry into the allegations against Bradley by City Atty. James K. Hahn  revolves around tens of thousands of dollars in fees that Bradley collected for  serving on the boards of Far East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings  &amp; Loan Assn., both of which had dealings with the city.  </P> <P> Bradley, as well as Coelho, also may face questions about financial dealings  involving Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., a Beverly Hills firm being  investigated in connection with Drexel's indicted "junk bond" king, Michael  Milken, a friend of Coelho's.  </P> <P> A source close to the mayor has said that the office of Columbia Vice Chairman  Abraham Spiegel served as a conduit of information between Bradley and one of  his stockbrokers.  </P> <P> Spiegel's son, Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel, a close associate of Milken,  has acknowledged assisting Coelho by recommending -- and then helping finance  -- a highly unusual purchase of a $100,000 junk bond issued by Drexel Burnham.  </P> <P> Coelho has admitted that he bought the junk bond with the help of a $50,000  loan from Columbia that he failed to disclose as required by law.  </P></p>

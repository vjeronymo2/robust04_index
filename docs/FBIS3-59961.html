			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga has stated  that drug trafficking has been getting worse because the  traffickers use high technology and have effective means of  communications, which make it difficult to catch any of them  during interdiction operations.    He added, ``Nevertheless, our Special Antinarcotics Force  (FELCN) is a source of pride for our country, because it has  shown enough results to prove that it is the best of the  continent despite its technological limitations.''    Quiroga explained that there are some signs that the Cali  cartel and other Colombian cartels are branching into Bolivia  because of the pressure they are under in their own country.    ``Because of the severe pressure they are under in Colombia,  the cartels are moving into certain areas of the Chapare region.  Bolivian intelligence services are evaluating this situation,''  the minister said.    Quiroga added that the two large drug rings discovered in  Bolivia this year, namely the Gutierrez affair in Santa Cruz and  the Ferreira family in Cochabamba, indicate that there are  connections with Colombian drug cartels.    ``We hope that these people do not actually come down here,  and if it does happen we will try to stop them,'' Quiroga added.    According to Minister Quiroga the Chapare region in  Cochabamba is divided into five areas which are full of coca  plantations, way above the amount allowed for supplying the  traditional use of coca leaves. In view of this Bolivia has  made it clear to Edward Casey, U.S. assistant secretary of state  for South American affairs, that it proposes to implement a  policy of eradication taking into account the economic aspect of  the issue.    ``Unless we are able to find an economic solution to the  resulting loss of income for the coca farmers there is very  little we can do to move forward. Therefore, an aggressive  policy of industrialization must be devised to foster crop  substitution in the region,'' Quiroga said.    He reiterated that approximately 90 percent of Chapare coca  plantations are used to supply drug traffickers.    Minister Quiroga stated that alternative development  projects  have made significant headway because otherwise coca cultivation  would have experienced an impressive growth.    ``Initial steps have been taken, and within the framework of  the reorganization of the executive branch and of the rules and  regulations on the duties of each ministry, the Alternative  Development Fund has been restructured, establishing a board  which has representatives from Chapare and Yungas,'' he added.    The idea is to work together with this fund in order to  implement eradication policies together with alternative  development projects, an approach which is different from  interdiction.</p>

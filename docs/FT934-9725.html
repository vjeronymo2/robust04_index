			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC stands firm on cow hormone ban THE European Commission said yesterday that approval for the milk-boosting dairy hormone bovine somatotrophin (BST) in the US would not affect its plans to extend its ban on the drug. The Food and Drug Administration in Washington last week approved the BST drug, Sometribove, manufactured by Monsanto, which will be marketed under the name Posilac. Monsanto has spent Dollars 500m developing the drug, which increases milk output by 6-20 per cent by supplementing the cow's natural BST hormone. A spokesman for the Commission said there was 'no reason to change' its plans to extend a four-year ban on BST for a further seven years. The Commission proposed the extension in the summer on socio-economic and environmental grounds, saying that use of BST would concentrate milk production on larger farms, driving smaller producers out of business. It would encourage the sort of overproduction that the Common Agricultural Policy reforms were designed to cut, increasing slaughterings of dairy cows. Commission surveys had shown it would also encounter resistance from consumers. The spokesman said the ban was unlikely to lead to the sort of trade war with the US that was triggered by the EC ban on hormones in beef production since 'we don't import dairy products from there'. The entry of BST on to the US market is expected to cost the US government Dollars 15m in payments to buy up excess supplies of milk from dairy farmers. The FDA said milk from treated cows had been found to have the same nutritional value and composition as milk from untreated cows. 'The public can be confident that milk and meat from BST-treated cows is safe to consume,' said FDA commissioner David Kessler. The agency said Monsanto had agreed to monitor BST residues and carry out tests on milk produced in 21 leading dairy states for the next two years.</p>

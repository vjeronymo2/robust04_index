			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Call for new police units SIR Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, last night called for the setting up of two new national police units to fight terrorism and serious crime. Delivering the Police Foundation lecture in London, he said there was an urgent need for such units, with a remit outside the jurisdiction of police authorities. The national anti-terrorist unit he proposed would provide a single police and intelligence focal point for liaison with the RUC, police in the Irish Republic and forces and intelligence services in Europe and North America.</p>

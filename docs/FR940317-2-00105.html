Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397 (c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Double Decker Bus Company of Denver, Colorado (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;93&hyph;015) has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses are eligible for importation into the United States. The petitioner contends that these vehicles are eligible for importation under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 15 US.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), because they have safety features that comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the petitioner claims that 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses have safety features that comply with Standard Nos. 102  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transmission Shift Lever Sequence .&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Caricom supports Haiti invasion Neighbours of Haiti yesterday agreed to support a US-led invasion of the Caribbean republic, saying the refusal of the military leaders there to step down had closed the door to a negotiated settlement of the country's political crisis. Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, and Mr John Deutch, US deputy defence secretary, yesterday attended a meeting of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) in Jamaica, to agree on the Caribbean nations' role in an invasion. Mr Paul Robertson, Jamaica's foreign minister, said yesterday that Caricom troops would not take part in an invasion, but would be involved in a 'holding operation' before the deployment of a UN mission in Haiti. Caricom's decision was a 'watershed', which indicated 'a sense of increasing urgency' in dealing with Haiti, said Mr Talbott. Caribbean countries have been reluctant to get involved in Haiti militarily, fearing domestic opposition to entanglement in a problem seen as intractable, as well as to a possible flood of refugees. But they see a holding operation as a way to address these fears. About 300 Caribbean troops would be involved, their task being to maintain law and order before, and perhaps after, the return to Haiti from exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said a Caricom official. Caricom is made up of 13 English speaking-members, but only those with standing armies - Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago - will be involved. 'As this has been done by some of their closest neighbours, albeit some without military might, the Haitian leaders must now know that foreign military intervention is imminent unless they step down in a few days,' said a Caricom spokesman. Military staff officers from the Caribbean countries will join their US, British and Argentine counterparts to 'finalise and co-ordinate arrangements' for the military intervention in Haiti, said Mr Erskine Sandiford, prime minister of Barbados and Caricom chairman. The Caribbean contingent will be trained at a US naval base in eastern Puerto Rico. US and Caribbean officials refused to be drawn on the timing of an invasion of Haiti. But Caribbean military sources said the plans were in place and only awaited President Bill Clinton's authorisation. They expected that US forces, led by special groups such as naval Seals, would infiltrate Haiti under the cover of darkness and disable strategic targets, including command and control centres of the Haitian military. Some Haitian junior officers, according to Caribbean military sources, have been holding clandestine meetings with representatives of foreign intelligence agencies, mainly the US, and have committed themselves to support the invasion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal" by the chairmanship of the House of </F> Representatives to the Armed and Security Forces; date not given  -- read by announcer]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Praised be God who said: And hold fast, all together, by the  rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among  yourselves. God also said: And fear the trial which affecteth  not in particular only those of you who do wrong [Koranic  verses]. God's peace and blessings be upon the honest messenger  and his relatives and companions. Following the military  developments and ensuing tensions, the House of Representatives  chairmanship expresses extreme regret over the continued  developments, deeming them an execution of the wishes of the  enemies of unity and democracy. Thus, the House chairmanship  appeals to all the personnel, noncommissioned officers, and  officers of the Armed and Security Forces--Yemen's great  (?shield)--throughout all camps and positions in the Republic of  Yemen to show wisdom and self-restraint and to reject any  conspiracy calling for infighting. The House chairmanship  considers this a human, ethical, moral, and national  responsibility resting with the personnel of the Armed and  Security Forces. History will register for them this great  position, which calls for maintaining souls, property, and, most  importantly, the Yemeni unity--the crowning achievement of their  determined struggle.    The House chairmanship holds the brother chairman of the  Presidential Council and members of the Presidential Council  fully responsible for the bloodshed, destruction, and threats to  unity. We beseech God to guide our steps along the right path.</p>

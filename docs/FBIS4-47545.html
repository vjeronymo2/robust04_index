Mikhas, Rostov-na-Donu Antiplague  Scientific Research Institute; UDC 579.843.1:579.253].083.3]    [Abstract] The urgency of the cholera problem which was  heightened even further during the seventh pandemic outbreak  which affected Stavropol kray and Rostov and Odessa oblasts in  1990-91 and the attendant spread and long-term circulation of  Vibrio cholerae in surface reservoirs prompted a  renewed search for cholera strain identification methods. The  difficulty of species identification with the help of available  DNA probes because the vct genes are present in the genomes of  far from all Vibrio cholerae strains and have a high  homology with the Escherichia coli toxin genes  necessitated the development of a species-specific probe and  formulation of a new V. cholerae identification  method on the basis of DNA molecular hybridization. The findings  demonstrate that not only the intact 1.74 kD HindIII fragments  but their component segments are absolutely specific and have a  sensitivity of 10[.sup]6[/] microbial cells or 60 g of  purified total chromosomal DNA. The development of the  species-specific probe makes it possible reliably and quickly to  identify a large number of freshly separated V.  cholerae strains and determine their epidemic hazard. This  approach precludes an incorrect diagnosis for infections caused  by pathogenic E. coli strains containing elt genes in  their genome.

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: 20TH CENTURY PROFIT TRIPLES IN 1ST QUARTER  </P> <P> 20th Century Industries, a Woodland Hills insurance company, said its  first-quarter profit more than tripled from a year earlier, to $29.1 million  from $7.6 million.  </P> <P> In recent quarters the company had lost money on its core business of  underwriting auto and housing insurance, but had offset those losses with  investment income. In the latest quarter, however, 20th Century reported  operating income of $20.4 million compared with a year-earlier operating loss  of $4.5 million.  </P> <P> At the same time, 20th Century's investment income jumped 27% from a year ago,  to $15.6 million from $12.3 million, further boosting its overall profit.  </P> <P> 20th Century also noted that the latest results compared favorably to last year  because, in the year-earlier quarter, heavy rain and flooding in Southern  California -- where 20th Century does most of its business -- led to sharply  higher claims costs.  </P></p>

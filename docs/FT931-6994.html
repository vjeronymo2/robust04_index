			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Surrey Building rescue plan THIS YEAR'S first proposed rescue of a loss-making building society was announced yesterday when the Surrey Building Society unveiled plans to merge with the Northern Rock. The Surrey said it expected to declare a small pre-tax loss for 1992. With five branches in the south-east of England, it had been affected by the severe downturn in the housing market. A transfer of engagements to Northern Rock made 'a great deal of sense'. The Surrey will offer its 8,900 shareholders a bonus payment of 0.75 per cent gross on completion of the transfer. The proposal will be put to a special meeting to be held at the same time as its annual meeting in April. Northern Rock, which has assets of over Pounds 6bn compared with the Surrey's Pounds 79m, disclosed a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1992.</p>

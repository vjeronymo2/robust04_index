			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Two London bus companies sold Two of the larger London bus companies, East London and Selkent, were yesterday sold to Stagecoach Holdings for a total of Pounds 42m. This brings the number of bus companies sold to three with a further seven still to be sold. CentreWest was sold to its management for just over Pounds 25m last week. Two more companies are expected to be sold this month, and London Buses expects to complete the sale of all its operations by next year. The purchases by Stagecoach represent its first move in London and will give the Perth-based company a total share of about 11.5 per cent of the UK bus market. Stagecoach will pay Pounds 28m for East London and Pounds 14m for Selkent, which operates in south-east London. The two companies will account for 20 per cent of the group's increased turnover.</p>

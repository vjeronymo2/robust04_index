			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Stirling chief leaves after 'disagreement' Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman and chief executive of Stirling Group, the clothing manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer, has abruptly left the group. His departure followed 'a disagreement over the direction of the import division and his responsibilities within the group,' it said. However, Mr Sheldon said yesterday: 'I do not believe the (group's) statement represents the situation. The action happened so suddenly and without warning, I need time to consider my position and to take further advice. 'I do not differ with the board as to the direction the import division should be taking.' In the interim results to September 30, Stirling's profits fell to Pounds 223,000 (Pounds 1.37m), partly because of losses on the imports side. The division was affected adversely by three factors: the acquisition of Boftex, the UK importer with a Hong Kong-based sourcing operation, the loss of a large shirt importing contract and larger than expected reorganisation costs. It is thought the board was united over recent decision to strengthen the division by introducing new management. The board now believes that the division should concentrate on its core customers, such as C&amp;A and Burton. Mr Sheldon, 53, joined Stirling in April 1990, with a brief to sort out its problems. Mr Robert Coe, a non-executive director since 1989, has been appointed non-executive chairman. Mr Steven Bentwood is to be group chief executive.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: London Elec up 38% and stresses dividend growth LONDON Electricity yesterday reported a 38 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 142.5m for the year to March 31 and made the strongest dividend statement of any electricity company so far. 'We have always maintained the prudent policy of growth broadly in line with underlying earnings, and expect to see that sustained,' said Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive. The company increased its final dividend to 11.8p (10.45p) for a total of 16.8p (10.45p). This followed warnings by other companies that the bumper dividend increases of this year would be a one off. Underlying London's confidence are the best customer service and the lowest tariff increases this year of all 12 regional electricity companies. The core electricity distribution business accounted for most of the advance from the pro forma pre-tax figure of Pounds 103.3m. Earnings per share rose from 34.7p to 47.5p. About Pounds 39m of the increase in distribution operating profit to Pounds 158.3m was due to an extra increase in tariffs in April 1991, to compensate for undercharging the year before. The electricity supply business made Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 9.8m) after bad debts rose from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 12.6m. The City forecasts pre-tax profit of Pounds 162m-Pounds 183m this year, putting the company on a prospective p/e of between 6.5 and 7.5. The dividend is expected to be 18.5p-19p. COMMENT London is nothing if not upfront, and should be commended at least for attacking retail and contracting, where other companies have left them to vegetate. And publicly pouring money into restructuring suggests that it believes it can turn the businesses round. Roger Urwin inspires City confidence, and the company's direct approach means it is good at giving nitty gritty numbers. But - perhaps because of its directness - London has always been bad at marketing itself. Manweb, for example, has a similar strategy, but has won hearts by promoting itself as the company that 'sticks to the knitting.' Whether this bodes ill for London's retailing operation remains to be seen.</p>

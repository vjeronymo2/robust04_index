			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Aberforth Split Level for market ABERFORTH SPLIT Level Trust (Aslet) is joining the stock market via a placing and intermediaries offer which will raise Pounds 28.9m after expenses. This is the first new issue to use the combination of a placing and intermediaries offer. James Capel, the trust's sponsor, advertised the availability of the shares to intermediaries via the Stock Exchange. As a result, 35 per cent of the offer is being sold via intermediaries, mainly private client stockbrokers. The trust, which is managed by Aberforth Partners, will concentrate on smaller company investments. Up to 15m income and 15m capital shares are being issued at 100p each. Income shareholders are entitled to all the income of the company - a prospective gross dividend yield of 12 per cent - and a repayment of 10p per share (the par value) if the trust is wound up. Capital shareholders do not receive any income but are entitled to all the assets after the income shareholders are repaid. Aberforth established another smaller companies trust last year called Ascot, the shares of which have consistently traded at a premium to its net asset value. Dealings in the new trust's shares are expected to start on May 14.</p>

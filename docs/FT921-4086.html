			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / California insurance challenge dismissed A FEDERAL judge dismissed a constitutional challenge by insurance companies which are resisting state regulations that seek Dollars 2.5bn in rate rollbacks under California's Proposition 103, AP Dow Jones reports from San Francisco. Proposition 103, approved by voters in 1988, required all property-casualty rates to be cut 20 per cent below November 1987 levels. But the courts ruled that insurers are entitled to a fair profit. 'We are moving full speed ahead with fully implementing Proposition 103 and obtaining for policy-holders the refunds they deserve,' state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said of the latest ruling. The ruling did not resolve insurers' claims that Garamendi's rules violated their rights of property, due process of law and free speech.</p>

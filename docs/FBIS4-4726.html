			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Clouds of War Hovering Over Korean Peninsula"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Now, a touch-and-go  situation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula in which a war  may break out any moment.    As is known, U.S. President Bill Clinton revealed his  intention to stage "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and  ordered the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. And  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry cried for a dispatch of  additional troops and weapons to South Korea, and chairman of  the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn pushed home  the need to make "steady war preparations" to counter an  "attack".    The U.S. military has worked out an operational plan to hurl  600,000 troops, more than 200 warships and 1,600 aircraft and so  on from the U.S. mainland within 80 days in case of an  "emergency" on the Korean peninsula.    The "New Operation Plan 5027" for a surprise attack on the  DPRK by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South  Korean puppet army in the event of "contingency" on the Korean  peninsula has been made known to have been worked out between  the master and the servant.    On bellicose orders from the U.S. ruling quarters and under  their aggressive war plan, forty-eight U.S. missile [word  indistinct] and a more than 800-men Patriot missile unit are on  their way to South Korea at present. Overseas-based warplanes  of various types are flying into U.S. Air Force bases in South  Korea one on the heels of the other, and the airlifted aggressor  troops and lethal equipment are being deployed in operational  zones. And U.S. vessels including a nuclear aircraft carrier  are at so close a range that they can reach the coastal area of  Korea within 24 hours.    Meanwhile, the traitor Kim Yong-sam of South Korea shouted  to  army brasshats to establish a "thoroughgoing alert posture  against the North", and the puppet prime minister turned up at  puppet army frontline units and incited a war fever.    The South Korean puppet armed forces are on "an alert  posture" from March 23.    The United States keeps more than 40 major Army, Navy and  Air  Force bases, over 200 military installations and 40,000 troops  in South Korea. A large number of missiles and more than 1,000  pieces of nuclear weapons have been deployed at these bases.  Some 100 U.S. military bases and about 50,000 U.S. troops are  also in Japan to cope with an "emergency" on the Korean  peninsula.    The U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South Korean  puppets are staging various war exercises almost every day in  the sky, on the ground and in the sea, in areas near the  northern half of Korea.    The U.S. Secretary of Defense will reportedly visit South  Korea in April to [word indistinct] himself with the  preparations for a war.    Facts tell that the situation on the Korean peninsula  resembles that on the eve of the past Korean war. The U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets had rapidly reinforced  their aggression armed forces and committed armed provocations  threatening the North on more than 5,100 occasions for three  years and a half before unleashing the war on June 25, 1950.  Dulles, dispatched to South Korea as a special envoy of the  then U.S. President, had shown up at the 38th Parallel to  inspect the preparations for mobilization and examined and  ratified the plan of northward invasion on the spot. On the  basis of this, the U.S. imperialists finally made an invasion of  the DPRK on June 25, 1950, by instigating the Syngman Yi [Rhee]  clique.    Now the world peaceloving people express deep apprehensions  for the situation on the Korean peninsula and denounce the U.S.  imperialists' anti-DPRK campaign and are conducting vigorous  international movements to check and frustrate it.</p>

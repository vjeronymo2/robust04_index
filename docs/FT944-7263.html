			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Aid in time: The donors' blueprint is failing in Gaza Warnings that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process could collapse any day are forcing international donors to consider a radical overhaul of their aid strategies. It is now widely acknowledged that the aid programme in the Gaza Strip is failing. As donors prepare to meet in Brussels next week, Mr Terje Larsen, the United Nations under secretary-general for Palestinian territories, has warned that time is running out for peace in Gaza, as living standards fall and violence increases. 'We are at the very edge,' he said. Disbursing aid by traditional means has proved almost impossible in Gaza, with only Dollars 140m distributed of the Dollars 700m pledged for 1994 by international donors such as the World Bank, the UN and the European Union. One problem has been the difficulties donors have had dispersing money through the embryonic Palestinian administration. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has been criticised for refusing to delegate authority. He has even excluded officials of the Palestinian implementing agency, PECDAR, from the delegation to the Brussels conference. The Palestinian administration has also been slow to develop clear procedures for distributing aid. But according to Mr Samir Houleila, senior Palestinian aid official, 'donors have been considering us as a classical case, expecting us to have built all institutions and systems in six months . . . Without conceptual changes the peace process is in jeopardy.' In designing the aid programme, western donors assumed that the Palestinian administration would be able to collect sufficient revenue to function, and that long-term development projects, entailing pre-feasibility, feasibility and design studies over 18-24 months, would deliver economic gains sufficiently rapidly. Both these assumptions appear to have been flawed. The peace process is no longer on track: the Israeli transfer of the West Bank, with its greater revenue base, has been delayed. And Israel is refusing to change the agreement signed with the PLO to hand over the Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m a month it is collecting in customs duties in the West Bank, until Palestinian elections. The PLO claims that Israel has also paid only Shk20m of Shk180m in VAT payments due to the Palestinian treasury, although Israel denies this. Alone, Gaza-Jericho is not economically viable in terms of public finances, say donors, and it is suffering a serious shortfall in revenue. Total Palestinian revenue from taxes from October to the end of March is estimated at Dollars 76.9m, compared with total expenditure of Dollars 234.5m. Only Dollars 36.6m of financing is available to cover the shortfall of Dollars 124.9m. This lack of funds is making it increasingly difficult for Gaza to pay its police and civil servants, at a time when their morale and effectiveness is vital. The recent revival in Islamic extremism has put Mr Arafat under even greater pressure to contain violence, for which a properly paid police force is essential. Expenditure for the police for the six months to March 1995 is estimated at Dollars 42.9m. But efforts to get aid to help pay the police have so far met with limited success. Donors are traditionally reluctant to spend taxpayers' money financing a police force or the salaries of a finance ministry. At a meeting in Gaza on November 9, donors said they would pay salaries for no more than the 9,000 policemen agreed between Israel and the PLO at the time of the peace deal, although Gaza now has 10,800. Gaza's economic position has also been made harder by the Israeli closures of its borders, which have prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians travelling to their jobs inside Israel. Mr Savir strongly defends Israel's closure policy, despite the cost to the peace process, saying it has forced Mr Arafat seriously to address Israel's security concerns. But the closure has heightened the need for jobs to be created. In this area, too, the aid programme's inflexibility has been much in evidence. 'The situation in Gaza is more dangerous today than before the peace agreement was signed,' said Mr Larsen. 'The gap between expectations and delivery is so large, so critical and unless donors get together to deliver, the peace process will fail.' And this is the message that is being conveyed to donors in Brussels. A covering letter to the meeting signed by Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, Norwegian foreign minister, in his capacity of chairman of the donors committee, says: 'Time is of the essence if we are to deal with the budgetary shortfall of the Palestinian Authority so as to implement the process of long-term economic development and political stability.' Donors will be asked to make two strategic decisions. First to commit themselves to providing Dollars 120m-Dollars 125m until March 31 1995 to pay salaries and running costs for police and civil servants and to finance the budget deficit of the Palestinian Authority. Second, they are being asked to divert up to 20 per cent of the grants and loans for long-term projects into short-term employment generation, mainly small-scale public works. The World Bank and the UN are appealing for donors to fund Dollars 100m worth of public works projects that will create 20,000-40,000 jobs within the next six months. 'What we are asking for from Israel and the donors is peanuts in global terms,' said Mr Houleila, the senior Palestinian aid official. 'But without the money and faster implementation, the impact on our side and on the entire region will be massive. The tension is very high and the Palestinian Authority desperately needs to build its credibility by making visible economic changes.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 1 (XINHUA) -- South Korea said today  that the statement of the United Nations Security Council on  Pyongyang's nuclear issue is "an appropriate action".    Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement,  "the (South Korean) Government urges North Korea to take due  note of such concern and will of the international community and  come forth positively on the terms of the presidential  statement."    On Thursday, president of the U.N. Security Council  Jean-Bernard Merimee issued a statement in New York, urging the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to allow the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to complete its  inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities.    The 15-member U.N. Security Council adopted the statement by  consensus without a vote. The statement is not legally binding  and does not carry the same weight as a resolution which  requires a vote.    "The council has decided to remain actively interested in  the  matter and further Security Council consideration will take  place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of  the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement," the spokesman said.    He also said that South Korea "plans to continue with all  possible efforts for an early solution to the North Korean  nuclear issue through peaceful means in concert with all nations  seeking nuclear non-proliferation." The IAEA and the DPRK have  been engaged in a row recently over the inspection of the  latter's nuclear sites. The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that  Pyongyang rejected full inspection while the DPRK said that it  met the IAEA's demands.    On March 21, the IAEA's board of governors adopted a  resolution referring the DPRK's nuclear dispute to the U.N.  Security Council.</p>

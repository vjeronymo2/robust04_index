			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Defending the mark of a true Champagne  -Legal Briefs Champagne producers have never been slow to to protect their appellation against those who attempt to trade on its reputation. The latest in a long line of legal cases to be heard by the English High Court started yesterday. It concerns 'Elderflower Champagne', a non-alcoholic cordial with added carbonated water, sold in green, Champagne-shaped bottles with wired mushroom corks, by Thorncroft Vineyard. At issue will be whether the consumer is likely to be misled into believing this is real Champagne. While Thorncroft will argue that no one could possibly make that mistake, the Champagne producers believe they have ample evidence to show that people will be misled. Although its reputation is well known, few people know what Champagne really is - a unique sparkling wine produced only in the Champagne region of France, they say. There is also a principle at stake. If Thorncroft is allowed to market its product unchallenged, others will follow and pretty soon the mark, Champagne, will have been destroyed, passing into the vernacular like other well-known marks before it, such as Gramophone, Hoover, Go-kart and Aspirin. The hearing is expected to last five days.</p>

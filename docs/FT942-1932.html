			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Gooda underwriter 'hid from facts' A former underwriter of the loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates failed to measure adequately his exposure to potential loss, it was alleged yesterday in the High Court. The criticism came in the 20th day of a civil action by 3,095 Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose wealth supports the insurance market, who are suing their agents to recover losses of more than Pounds 600m. Their syndicates were swamped by losses from disasters between 1988 and 1990, including the explosion aboard the Piper Alpha oil platform in the North Sea and Hurricane Hugo in the Caribbean. Mr Ulrich von Eicken, appearing as an expert witness for the Names, dismissed claims by Mr Stanley Andrews, underwriter for syndicate 298, that the scale of the Piper Alpha oil platform loss was unimaginable. He said this was 'simply hiding yourself from the facts'. Mr von Eicken is a former executive with Munich Re, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies. He told the court that Gooda Walker underwriters were wrong to base their business on the assumption that they would be hit by no catastrophic losses. 'If you are in the catastrophe business you can't possibly base your activities on there not being a catastrophe,' he said. Mr Andrews, whose syndicate lost heavily after the disaster, told the court last week that: 'We never honestly thought that the loss of Piper Alpha could actually ever occur.' Mr Andrews' system for measuring his aggregate exposures was 'thoroughly inadequate', added Mr von Eicken. Earlier Mr Jonathan Gaisman QC, cross examining Mr Andrews, said Lloyd's agents had alleged the underwriter 'did not have a clue about what he is underwriting' and 'did not inspire any confidence whatsoever'. Other documents cited by Mr Gaisman show that Mr Andrews believed his syndicate would break even in its 1988 account, months after the Piper loss. According to the documents, one agent, reporting a meeting with Mr Tony Gooda, chairman of the Gooda and Partners members' agency, said: 'I asked whether it was incompetence or the fact that he was pulling the wool over our eyes. Mr Gooda said regrettably that it was due to incompetence, and that he and the board were also partly to blame.' Another agent knew of the scale of Mr Andrews' Piper losses months in advance of the underwriter.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries fall ahead of Bush speech THE COMBINED might of President Bush and America's corporate treasurers has Wall Street's credit markets unsettled as the US enters a week of great political importance. Tomorrow Mr Bush delivers the President's annual state of the union address and will outline a package of measures to get the US economy moving again. There are fears in some sections of the credit markets that the resulting fiscal stimulus could boost inflation, and this has helped push Treasury bond prices down over the past week. Corporate treasurers, meanwhile, have continued over the past week with the avalanche of fixed income and equity new issues which hit the market at the start of the year. Since dealers often have to sell government securities to cover their positions in unsold corporate issues, this too has been exerting downward pressure on government bond prices. Add in nervousness over the weekend meeting in New York of G7 nations, and the result last week was a 1 3/16 drop in the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue, taking its yield back up to 7.71 per cent, compared to 7.61 a week ago and 7.51 four weeks ago. Long rates are back up around where they were in mid-December, before the Federal Reserve set in train a powerful rally with its one-point cut in the discount rate on December 20. Is this a temporary upward blip, as most Wall Street analysts seem to believe, or are long rates now past their trough for this economic cycle? Certainly, a slew of recent statistics suggesting the economy is more or less 'dead in the water' does not give the bond market too much to fear from inflation in the short-term. The Fed's latest 'beige book' of regional economic activity, released this week, described economic activity at the turn of the year as 'lacklustre'. That said, the past week has brought some signs of stirring in the housing market, which tends to be an important leading indicator. Housing starts were up 2.6 per cent in December, greater than expected, albeit from a low base. Banks, meanwhile, have reported a rush of homeowners wanting to remortgage properties at the lowest interest rates in years. That should eventually work through into greater consumer confidence and disposable income, giving a further fillip to the housing market and the wider economy. In short, the groundwork appears to be being laid for a gradual recovery which could start to gather momentum around the middle of the year. But the weakness of the recovery and the historic tendency for inflation to continue moderating in the early stages of a rebound, suggests that price pressures may remain weak for months to come. Nor will President Bush's economic package necessarily have the negative impact on inflation that the market fears. Inspired leaks over the past few weeks suggest it is unlikely to add horribly to the budget deficit and will favour investment rather than consumption - though over the coming months Congress may try to change that balance. The Fed's December easing move has certainly helped reduce the head of political steam for dramatic fiscal action, but where does all this now leave Fed policy? The line from the Fed over the past two weeks has been that the economy is starting a recovery that will become clear by the spring. Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, argued this week that he saw 'potential for a strong economic recovery . . . which may surprise us all.' So the bank might yet hold off the further 25 basis point easing in the Fed funds rate that much of Wall Street expects in the first half of February - after the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee meeting at the start of the month and chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress. The market's growing sense that the Fed may not ease again in the near future was given added force last Thursday, when surprisingly strong money supply growth figures were released for the week ending January 13. These, however, may simply be a seasonal aberration, since the underlying growth of M2 has been weak for months. All this helps explain the current rush of corporate borrowing. Even if the Fed does ease again, the effect will be much more powerful at the short end. The long end has too much to worry about. Long rates may not have bottomed, but cannot be far from it, making this a very attractive time to lock in fresh funding.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                            Last    1 week   4 wks   12-month  12-month                            Friday     ago     ago     High       Low Fed Funds (weekly average)  3.87     2.00     4.00    11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  3.90     3.86     3.93     8.29     3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.06     4.01     4.01     7.70     3.95 Three-month prime CDs       4.15     4.12     4.35     7.17     4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     4.00     3.98     5.00     7.12     3.98 90-day Commercial Paper     4.00     3.94     4.50     7.02     3.94  --------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                            Last     Change           1 week     4 wk.

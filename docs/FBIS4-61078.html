			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 4 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  newspaper front-pages a series of interviews with Moscow  citizens who told the newspaper about their cares and concerns.  Interviews were published under the general headline: "Politics  withdraws from streets. But it is too early to say that it  happened as a result of `St. George Agreement' (eds: the treaty  on social accord signed at the St. George's Hall in the  Kremlin), although its influence on public life is great".    According to the newspaper, even those who do not believe in  the sincerity of authorities and would like to have  "revolutionary" changes, "are forced to heed the unwillingness  of the popular masses to settle their problems in the streets".    Here is an opinion expressed by Moscow worker Aleksey  Dorokhin: "The leaders of the state should learn to think about  people. We support the government both in words and labour. I  believe that some forces are deliberately driving a wedge  between us. "The main thing now is not to fall for provocations  but to continue efficient work".    Writing about World Press Freedom Day which was marked on  Tuesday, the same newspaper singles out an extract from a  message to Russian journalists by UNESCO Director-General  Federico Mayor, saying: "Democratic changes in Russia would have  been impossible without bold and persistent activities of  journalists who believe in the freedom of expressing opinion and  who work for it".    The TRUD newspaper also discusses the above treaty in its  commentary under the following headline "Road to Accord Is Not  an Easy One, But It Should Be Covered".    In the newspaper's opinion, the essence of this agreement is  simple: "To put common interests above group, party, deparmental  and regional aspirations and to preclude a chance of settling  problems in society by force".    Putting the question of what attitude should be taken to the  treaty, the newspaper says that one should not overestimate it  and to sleep on laurels. Taking into account the fact that the  treaty was not signed by forces ready for any methods of  struggle, TRUD writes that "the danger of violence will loom  over society in some or other way".    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper writes about the agreement of  the heads of government of the Commonwealth of Independent  States on mutual recognition of privileges and guarantees for  veterans and invalids of the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945,  participants in combat operations in the territory of other  states and families of fallen servicemen as well as supplements  1 and 2 to the present agreement.    The same newspaper writes how the government settles  problems  of supplying the Armed Forces with foodstuffs in the conditions  when the cattle and poultry populations sharply dropped in the  country.    Noting that the Army now controls not 67 state farms which  remained after the collapse of the Soviet Union but many more,  the newspaper notes that these so-called military state farms  should become one of guaranteed sources for supplying the Army  and the Navy with foodstuffs.    The press devotes much space to materials describing how  residents of Moscow and other cities marked May Day. The  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper carries its report on this event  under the title "Well, we have marked May Day. Quietly. People  were not vociferous and did not frown much".    The newspaper quotes slogans voiced during a May Day  demonstration organised by Moscow trade unions: "Check  Industrial Slump. Bridle Inflation. Pay Wages in Time".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA notes that "the holiday passed in a  civilised way. There was no 'fistfighting'. There was no  references to "the great, omnipotent and united party".    Publishing detailed accounts of May Day celebrations, the  PRAVDA newspaper stresses words that "columns of Moscow workers  peacefully marched at places where blood had been shed last  year".    The newspaper quotes an opinion by Gennadiy Zyuganov,  chairman of the Russian Communist Party, that the May Day  demonstration became an action by "those who disagrees with  reforms of extremism and with an attempt at legalising  inequality and injustice with the help of the social treaty".    The same newspaper gives a summary of an interview by  President Boris Yeltsin to the French FIGARO newspaper. It  singles out his words that "the true danger (eds: for Russia)  will be the next president", since, Yeltsin said, "I do not see  a possible candidate. At least at present". According to the  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, it carries a sensational article  entitled "Russia's northern fleet is being killed slowly and  with relish". As a result of a shortage of funds appropriated  for the fleet's needs, "The number of the fleet's ships and  vessels dropped by 45 per cent since 1988".    "The utilisation of nuclear-powered submarines provokes  special concern", the newspaper stresses.</p>

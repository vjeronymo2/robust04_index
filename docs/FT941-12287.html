			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Vienna seeks airport deal in Bratislava Flughaven Wien, the Vienna airport company (VA), is negotiating with the Slovak government to take a 50 per cent stake in Bratislava airport, writes Patrick Blum. Talks between the Slovak and Austrian governments have revived the project first mooted two years ago. Bratislava airport would become a joint venture 50 per cent owned by VA, which would invest some Sch200m (Dollars 17m) to help modernise the airport, bring know-how, and provide training. Bratislava has spare capacity while Vienna, with 7.1m passengers last year and growing demand, will need extra capacity by the end of the century. The two airports are about 45 minutes drive apart.</p>

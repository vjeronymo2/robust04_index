			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Budget test for Pounds The UK Budget is expected to make an impact on the currency markets this week although analysts are divided as to how sterling will react, writes Emma Tucker. Many analysts have ruled out another UK base rate cut following comments from the Bank of England that it is concerned not to see sterling drop below its current level of around DM2.39. Nevertheless, if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announces severe fiscal tightening measures tomorrow, the foreign exchanges may react badly in anticipation of further monetary easing. In the longer term, however, a tight budget would improve prospects for the currency. With the economic recovery still fragile, it may be that the chancellor confines himself to outlining plans for reducing the public sector borrowing requirement in the medium term. The other big event for the currency markets this week is Thursday's regular Bundesbank council meeting. The German bank has eased the rates on its 14 and 28-day repo funds, but this is no guarantee that it will announce a cut in its discount and Lombard rates on Thursday. Mr Julian Jessop of Midland Global Markets believes the Bundesbank will not cut its discount rate until it is satisfied that the Solidarity Pact has been fully agreed. This will be of little comfort to the French, however, whose currency may suffer speculative pressure ahead of the first round of national assembly elections next weekend. French opposition parties, which are expected to win the vote, face the dilemma of wishing for a substantial cut in interest rates while at the same time maintaining the franc's link to the D-Mark. The peseta, the krone and the escudo may also come under attack. On Friday there was intense selling of the escudo as the markets reacted with hostility to apparent differences between the finance ministry and the Bank of Portugal.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Government set to ditch balanced budget strategy THE government is close to abandoning its commitment to balance the national budget over the economic cycle. Ministers are acknowledging that it will be impossible to eliminate the large and rising public sector deficit before the next general election. Despite the public insistence by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that there has been no shift in policy, his colleagues believe he will soon be forced to 'repackage' his long-term budget strategy around the less ambitious targets envisaged in the Maastricht accord on European monetary union. One suggestion is that a 'yes' vote for Maastricht in the French referendum next month would be followed by a recasting of British fiscal policy in the Treasury's autumn statement in November. It is being pointed out in Whitehall that the balanced budget doctrine - that deficits in times of recession should be matched by surpluses at the other end of the economic cycle - was framed when sterling was outside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The disciplines imposed by the ERM should allow for a more flexible approach to fiscal deficits. This would be designed primarily to stabilise over the medium term the ratio of public sector debt to national income. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is thought to share the view that while the government must not relax its grip on fiscal policy, there is no particular virtue in the present precise and unattainable medium-term commitment. The depth of the recession has led Whitehall officials to write off the forecast in the March Budget that the budget deficit will fall below 1 per cent of national income by 1996-97. They believe that, even on relatively optimistic assumptions, the figure could be more than double that. Last month's cabinet agreement to stick to next year's public spending target and to trim the cash totals for subsequent years is unlikely to make a significant dent in the underlying level of the deficit. Ministers accept that only a return to the economic boom conditions of the late 1980s would be sufficient to eliminate, and then replace with a large surplus, a budget shortfall expected next year to be about Pounds 40bn - or some 6 per cent of national income. Even if the government could engineer such a boom it would undercut Mr Major's central ambition of permanently low inflation. Mr Lamont has been reluctant to admit to colleagues that a balanced budget is out of reach. The chancellor is concerned that such an admission could undermine confidence on financial markets where sterling remains under pressure. But a return of confidence in the ERM following the hoped-for endorsement of Maastricht by the French electorate would provide the backdrop for a recasting of the Treasury's budget guidelines. The Maastricht accord envisages that deficits should not average more than 3 per cent of national income over the economic cycle, with larger shortfalls in times of recession being matched by smaller gaps when economies are growing.

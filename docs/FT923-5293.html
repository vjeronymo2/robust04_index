			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Japan pressed on tariffs JAPAN was urged yesterday by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, to accept tariffication (recalculating subsidies as tariffs) without exception, a reference to Tokyo's refusal to make a concession on rice imports. While Mr Dunkel encouraged Tokyo to work for a successful end to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Japanese officials said they were concerned about possible trade barriers raised by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), linking the US, Canada and Mexico. Mr Dunkel told Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and industry minister (both pictured right), that Gatt may review Nafta under the regular review mechanism. Japanese officials would like a special inquiry to clarify if Nafta is 'trade-creating' or not. Japan has cited the recent dispute with the US over the local content of Hondas produced in Canada as an example of potential pitfalls of the Nafta accord, and would like Gatt confirmation of Nafta regulations. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was relieved that delays in Uruguay Round negotiations let Japan keep its rice import ban; the party feared a concession would have hurt it in an upper house election in July. The LDP won the election easily, but the Tokyo government has not moved to allow rice imports; Mr Dunkel's assurances that tariffication is 'not liberalisation in the true sense' are unlikely to prompt a sudden policy change. He leaves for Seoul today.</p>

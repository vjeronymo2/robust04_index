			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Spare me bad news I expect that I will sound like a man from the Stone Age or Bronze Age if I live to Wilfred Thesiger's age - 83 - which I won't, not by a long chalk, given my habit of glaring at people, noisy people, rude people, sometimes almost any people, in a manner bound, according to Miss Lee, my executive assistant, to guarantee, one day, that somebody shoots my head off. As well as an anachronism, Thesiger is a famed traveller and romantic whose journeyings and writings have been honoured by medals, awards and fellowships. And here he still is, stranded, out of time, wishing that things could be as they were in the Stone Age or Bronze Age. Thesiger has written another book, My Kenya Days, in connection with which he was interviewed the other day. He said he regretted that some of the peoples among whom he had lived were culturally extinct. 'When I was among the Rashid in southern Arabia,' he said, 'the Bedu had no contact with western life. But two years after I left, the oil companies moved in, and now they all have cars and money. They have adapted, but it is not the same. There is no longer the dull ache of hunger, and this is a shame, for it produced a fine type.' Pity about the missing dull ache of hunger. And pity about the other things this man from the Stone Age or Bronze Age finds regrettable in modern life. Thesiger said he had been offered Kentucky fried chicken by the Dayak, and that he hated cars and aeroplanes for 'robbing the world of all diversity'. He resented virtually all the material manifestations of western civilisation. But then he said something with which I did agree. He was talking about television, which he considers a terrible intrusion. 'Why the hell,' he asked, 'should you want to know there's been a massacre in Rwanda one hour after it's happened?' A supremely good question. Why would we want to know there's been a massacre in Rwanda one hour after it's happened - unless it affected the gorillas, Rwanda's most important denizens, whose safety, were it threatened by human fighting, would trigger alarm among those concerned about stewardship of the planet. I thought about Thesiger's question for a long time. There is no answer  - no reason why we should want or need to know about a massacre in Rwanda one hour after it has happened. There is a great deal we do not need to know. But they tell us any way. My opinion is not a secret: in the good news/bad news debate, I stand with the good guys - those who believe that newspapers and television emphasise bad news at the expense of the good. Quite soon, the world's media magnates will wake to this simple truth: bad news is depressive, good news stimulative; bad news makes people fearful, good news makes them happy. Bad news is bad for business. So make them happy. This week I scrutinised the newspapers. The same old mixture - bad news, bad news, a spot of good news, bad news, bad news. That is not how it should be done. Soon, I predict, the media moguls will instruct their staffs to accentuate the positive and merely summarise the negative. Rwanda? We do not need to know the full and horrid details, the rapes and mutilations. Nor do we need photographs. Soon, this is what we will read, crafted by an expert summariser: 'There has been unpleasantness in Rwanda. But the country's famed gorillas are not affected.' John Major? 'The prime minister took to the hustings yesterday. Things did not go well.' Terrorism in Northern Ireland? 'There was a loud bang in Belfast yesterday.' Crime? 'Misbehaviour in certain areas is on the increase, said a police spokesman, but declining in others. He said this was to be expected.' Bosnian air-strikes? 'President Clinton said that United Nations safe havens in Bosnia were less safe than he wanted, and that some form of action was on the cards.' Wrangling over the anniversary of the second world war Normandy landings? 'Spin-merchant Sir Tim Bell confirmed yesterday that Spam fry-ins were his own mega-brainwave for celebrating D-Day's 50th anniversary, and said: 'Even when I worked in advertising, I was still proud of my common roots. I firmly believe that Spam fry-ins gave the allied forces a crucial edge when readying for the contretemps in Normandy all those years ago'.'</p>

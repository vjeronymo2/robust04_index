			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / East 'needs farm price stability' The European Union urgently needs to set up a system to help support stable farm prices in east and central Europe, and lay the foundations of an agricultural policy that will enable these post-Communist democracies to join the EU. This is the main conclusion of an independent report released yesterday, commissioned by Brussels from Mr Henri Nallet, a former French agriculture minister, and Mr Adrian van Stolk, a Dutch authority on trade and agriculture. Papers from a closed seminar on eastern Europe, which the Commission held in March, highlight the 30 per cent drop in farm output between 1988 and 1992 in Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics, Bulgaria and Romania. 'The risk is that agriculture will quickly become the central point of friction with our eastern partners,' according to the paper presented by Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner. 'By one means or another,' he says, 'a mechanism has to be found to sustain certain primary products at near world price levels.' The Nallet/van Stolk report warns that the fall in east European output, because of falling prices leading to lack of investment and access to credit, is too dangerous to ignore. The report calls for modest price supports to buttress production and eliminate the huge swings in food prices caused by speculators. It proposes an Ecu62 (Dollars 71.92) price support for wheat - from which other support prices would be derived - against the Ecu100 per tonne price the EU expects to reach in 1996.</p>

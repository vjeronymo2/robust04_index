			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Alberto Fujimori by unidentified </F> correspondent "in Santiago, during the Chilean presidential  inauguration"]    [Text] [ESTRATEGIA] You have said you favor signing a  complementary economic agreement with Chile. Will your  government promote the appropriate negotiations?    [Fujimori] I believe in the future of integration. We must  take concrete steps and not merely deliver speeches because this  time is over. There is rapprochement with Chile in every field,  and so it would also be a good step. We are ready.    [ESTRATEGIA] In what areas are Chile and Peru complementary?    [Fujimori] We must study the details, but I believe trade  relations could grow enormously, for example, in the  agro-industrial and mining-metallurgical areas.    [ESTRATEGIA] Will bilateral border problems influence the  political decision of promoting an agreement with Chile?    [Fujimori] Not at all. We must overcome all these relics.  We require a bit more communication and dialogue before we can  overcome the inactivity and the arms race which caused so much  damage. As I said at the Rio de Janeiro summit, Peru has taken  concrete steps to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and we  have removed entire battalions from the Chilean border. I do  not believe border problems will prevent development between the  two countries. The trauma is being overcome. In high schools,  a lot was taught about Tarapaca, but now Arica is being  mentioned.    [ESTRATEGIA] Will Peru seek entry into NAFTA?    [Fujimori] Yes, we are preparing for that. Compared with  other Latin American countries, our economy is quite open  because we have made huge progress. During the past two years,  our industries have been transforming at a speed never seen  before. We believe we will soon be ready to join and be fully  competitive with large blocs.    [ESTRATEGIA] Does your administration favor joining large  trade blocs like the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]?    [Fujimori] Unfortunately, there are various degrees of  progress in the economic field. Despite various years of  backwardness, I believe Peru has achieved rapid advancement in  the past two years. We have removed all subsidies. We have  imposed a 15 percent tariff and our economy is totally open. We  have surpassed some Andean Pact members and thus had to cancel  our participation temporarily. We have achieved bilateral  agreements with Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, and we also hope  to achieve one with Chile. I first want to consider Latin  America as a group, like Mercosur, and then join NAFTA.    [ESTRATEGIA] Chilean entrepreneurs have complained of some  problems in investing in Peru, specifically in the private  pensions area. What progress has been made to solve these  problems?    [Fujimori] We have profited from the Chilean experience and  have removed negative features. Nevertheless, there are some  differences involving the Peruvian AFP's [Pension Fund Managing  Companies] that we have been attempting to correct. One is the  difference between the percentage contributed by the state  social security and the percentage contributed by the AFP. The  difference involves about 7 percent of salaries. We are  studying this issue so that the AFP and the State Social  Security will be on the same level. It is obviously more  advantageous for a company whose workers are contributing to the  state social security to have them under such a state system  because its cost is 7 percent less. Nevertheless, I believe  there are ways to correct this situation.    There has been a delay in the entry of state workers into  the  AFP system. This has been overcome through a legal mechanism  and the reentry of state workers into the AFP has already been  allowed with the employer-state contributions delayed until May.  This situation, however, will not represent a problem for the  AFP.    There is another problem involving the jurisdiction of the  AFP. The problem involves its investments, which will be  overcome through the issuance of Treasury bonds.    [ESTRATEGIA] What is the current situation of labor unions  in Peru?    [Fujimori] They are certainly relevant, and we give them the  importance they deserve. The labor movement is currently  non-politicized. Most workers do not accept a political  affiliation. Of course there are movements that demand better  labor and salary conditions, but they do not maintain a  political stance. I can assure you we have a labor law that  guarantees investments and labor movement will not be  obstructive.    [ESTRATEGIA] Given a strong inflow of money as a result of  the privatizations, you have said your government will  reconsider its economic management but without changing the  current program. What changes will be made?    [Fujimori] Our economic program has certain macroeconomic  goals in the field of inflation, monetary expansion, and growth.  We foresaw an income of about $1 billion from the  privatizations, part of which would go to the national budget.  But the situation has changed suddenly and we will obtain more  than $3 billion. This probably means long- and medium-term  investments could be financed with funds from the Treasury  without resorting to costly bank loans. This is small change we  are introducing into the economic program.    But the rules of the game remain the same; we are  considering  ways to inject this inflow of dollars into our economy. One way  is through medium- and long-term investments in hydroelectric  plants or paved highways. We will seek investments with a  greater proportion of imported components because we do not want  a monetary mass that can exert inflationary pressures. We have  enough reserves as result of all these privatizations.    [ESTRATEGIA] Privatizations have been your main economic  accomplishment, but some criticize that they were carried out  too slowly and that sale prices were below the real value of the  assets.    [Fujimori] It is interesting that the government was right  when it established an agenda of privatizations. We were not  willing to privatize at the speed some economists demand because  we did not know the real value of our public companies. The  prices of our public companies are increasing so we will sell  them at the appropriate moment. I am sure that a year ago we  would have not obtained the price that was finally paid for CPT  [Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National  Telecommunications Enterprise]. We also have companies for  which no one would have paid anything, like Centromin-Peru  [Central Peru Mining Enterprise]. Several important groups now  want to buy it. I can tell you more: a cement factory, for  example, whose base price was $30 million was finally sold for  $67 million. Our public companies now have a real value, there  is interest, security, guarantees, and a legal framework to  guarantee investments. Above everything, there is an atmosphere  of total internal security.    [ESTRATEGIA] What economic results do you expect for 1994?    [Fujimori] We have established two important parameters:  Annual inflation will not be greater than 25 percent and  economic growth will be greater than 5 percent; we also expect  social investments to be 40 or 50 percent greater than in 1993,  that is, about $800 million. Economic growth was 7 percent last  year, the greatest in the American continent, and inflation was  below 40 percent. We almost complied with our goal which was  something like 35 percent.    [ESTRATEGIA] What other problems is the Peruvian economy  confronting?    [Fujimori] I believe we have overcome most of our problems,  although we are, certainly, still at a recessionary level,  because of the dollar being underrated -- not because of  economic problems, but because of drug trafficking -- and  because of the relatively high interest rates. We want to  uproot those problems. Concerning the exchange rate, we are  doing more efficient work, concentrating in antinarcotics  actions all the efforts that were previously made in the  antiterrorist fight. We hope to significantly stem the flow of  narcodollars. Some $1 billion might be currently entering Peru,  and this is far too much to be absorbed.    Concerning interest rates, we hope privatization of  Interbanc  and Continental Bank -- two sound enterprises -- will make  interest rates drop.    [ESTRATEGIA] What reforms do you expect to implement to  modernize the economy even further?    [Fujimori] Over the next few months there will be no major  measures. We will promote farming with measures aiming at  stabilizing farm product prices. This entails the adoption of  flexible tariffs, so that Peruvian food products like wheat,  rice, corn, and milk -- which are also the main imported food  items -- remain stable. We want farmers to capitalize. At the  same time, we will take care of pacification. Even though it is  true that no liberal policy has yet been enforced for the  agricultural area, we hope to design one in 1996.    [ESTRATEGIA] In a hypothetical case, if you do not run for  reelection, don't you think the economic program might be  endangered?    [Fujimori] (Smiles.) It would be difficult to go backward  after the progress we have made. Even though there are always  risks, all social sectors support the government policy --  especially the economic policy. The entire reform program that  we enforced over a record period has had massive support in the  poorer zones of the country. What the government should now do  is enforce a social program to end poverty, in order to  consolidate all the reforms. This will then guarantee that  people will not choose a president who will bring retrogression.    [ESTRATEGIA] Some analysts believe that your country is very  well, but they wonder: What will come after Fujimori?    [Fujimori] The best guarantee is the position of the  Peruvian  people, who will not agree to retrogression or to a populist or  paternalistic policy in the style of previous administrations.    [ESTRATEGIA] But if we consider the results of the previous  plebiscite, in which the government position won by a small  margin...    [Fujimori] There were distorting factors that did not  reflect  the support for the government work. For example, on the death  penalty there were negative votes, even if voters were  government supporters, or because there was a campaign that  distorted some concepts, and this reduced the difference of  votes. Yet all polls reveal a majority support, an average of  two-thirds, for the president's work, despite the fact that very  drastic measures have been enforced.    [ESTRATEGIA] Are you going to run in next year's  presidential elections?    [Fujimori] I have not made up my mind yet, even though the  Constitution and the people have called on me to do so. I  should make a decision at the beginning of October.    [ESTRATEGIA] Could you name your political heirs?    [Fujimori] I would rather not talk about heirs, but it is  possible to see a wide range of candidates on the political  scene, even though they are not yet fully consolidated. In all  likelihood the names of some candidates will be known in the  forthcoming months.    [ESTRATEGIA] There are those who have been mentioning the  name of one of your sons...    [Fujimori] (He breaks into a hearty laugh) For 2015; Kenji,  who is 14 years old, accompanies me on all my trips to the  interior and abroad. Some caricatures of him were done at one  time, calling him the deputy foreign minister. A public opinion  poll conducted by Apoyo among 1,000 entrepreneurs showed that  Kenji ranks seventh as the most influential person in the  country, followed by the chairman of the Council of Ministers.    [ESTRATEGIA] What are the advantages and drawbacks of your  administration?    [Fujimori] There are no drawbacks. The advantages are that I  have party values. There is a leadership, a clear direction;  there is no tug of war between political parties. We can thus  pursue our political, social, and economic policy without  encountering major setbacks. There is no such thing as the  typical attacks made by politicians. We can tackle problems  rationally, objectively, and in a strictly technical way. This  leads to better results, because political considerations do not  always prevail over technical ones. The nonexistence of a party  structure, therefore, expedites the decisionmaking process.    [ESTRATEGIA] What laws that have not been enacted would you  have liked Congress to pass?    [Fujimori] With regard to the previous Congress, the  economic  reform would not have prospered, because if it was not Congress,  it was the judiciary that kept changing it; or else, the  Constitutional Court did it. There is still much to be done at  Congress -- articles, laws, legal principles must be reviewed.    [ESTRATEGIA] To conclude, what message would you like to  send  to Chilean investors?    [Fujimori] Peru is a country with a future. It can be one of  the superstars in the next years. There are good guarantees for  making business; we have great natural resources, a growing  market that is unexplored. I think that it has enormous  possibilities. I would like to tell Chilean companies that our  government policy is at present trying to enhance productivity  conditions by improving infrastructure. My message is that they  become acquainted with our reality, that they embark on new  business ventures in Peru, including investments and tourism.  This is not just my personal opinion; it is a fact.</p>

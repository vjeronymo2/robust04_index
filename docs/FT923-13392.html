			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop breeders hail 'super cassava' - An advance in the fight against famine in Africa CROP BREEDERS are calling it 'super cassava'. A breakthrough in the breeding of Africa's most widely grown staple food, cassava, has led to the development of a high-yielding variety which could survive in drought conditions and be the continent's most important hope for overcoming famine. Cassava - which is known in some countries as manioc - is a root crop that produces a tuber resembling a large potato. It grows in poor soils, does not require chemical fertiliser and needs little rain. The plant's long roots tap soil moisture deep in the ground; when drought strikes, cassava has a 'defensive mechanism' which causes its leaves to drop while the tubers survive. This has led to the claim: 'Where there is cassava there is no hunger'. 'In times of drought, cassava will survive when other crops wither, says Mr Alfred Dixon, a crop breeder at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. The institute - which celebrates its 25th anniversary on July 24 - is one of 16 worldwide centres belonging to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. It is trying to increase the productivity of key African food crops, such as cassava, and to develop sustainable systems that replace 'slash and burn' techniques. Processed cassava is eaten daily by some 300m people in Africa, around two-thirds of the continent's population, and also in parts of Latin America and Asia - the largest producers are Nigeria, Brazil and Thailand. Although it grows extensively across west and central Africa, the crop only grows in small pockets in southern Africa, the region now affected by the worst drought for 50 years. About half of Africa's cassava is used for subsistence needs and half for commercial purposes. The crop has the advantage that it can be stored in the ground for over a year, giving farmers the freedom to eat or sell it when the need arises. Cassava's disadvantage is that while high in calorie content, it is low in protein. But its nutritional value can be increased by adding protein-rich crops such as soyabean. To try to develop high-yielding varieties of cassava, crop breeders at IITA crossed cultivated species with a wild species of the plants, and say they discovered spontaneous 'polyploids' with up to four times the normal number of chromosomes. The more chromosomes there are in a plant, the more chance of higher yields When breeders tested the new polyploids at research stations in different areas, they tried as far as possible to grow them in the conditions that exist on farmers' fields. The results exceeded expectations. Whereas the best existing variety of cassava - known as TMS 30572 - yields an average of 23 tonnes a hectare 'on station', the new varieties yielded between 50 to 70 tonnes per hectare. Cassava yields an average of 12 tonnes a hectare on African farms. The polyploids are now being tested on selected farms. Korean crop breeder Mr Sang-Ki Hahn, who leads IITA's cassava programme, is hopeful of yields up to 40 tonnes a hectare on farms, giving farmers two to three times more than their existing harvests. This would mean substantially more food being grown in Africa by Africans and would offer many countries the prospect of reducing food imports. 'The polyploids offer the potential for a very significant breakthrough,' believes Mr Lukas Brader, IITA's director general. For southern African countries the availability of 'super cassava' could lead to far-reaching changes in agriculture. Maize, the staple food across most of southern Africa, is highly vulnerable to drought, and researchers have been unable to develop maize varieties that can cope with drought. 'In southern Africa there is now tremendous interest in increasing cassava production,' says Mr Brader. An Eastern and Southern African Root Crops Network was set up in 1977 to help countries develop root crops. IITA officials say that Zimbabwe is trying to start a large-scale cassava programme and that Zambia is interested in extending its crop. In Uganda, a World Bank project is helping to expand the area under cassava. Like maize, a small proportion of cassava output is used for animal feed and for industrial purposes such as making beer, cosmetics and starches. 'Cassava could be used instead of maize for such purposes,' says Mr Dixon, 'leaving more maize for food.' IITA officials believe that the new varieties of cassava will make the crop highly attractive to farmers across Africa, both for their own food security and also as a profitable commercial crop. The continent's growing population is leading to increased demand for cassava, which is reflected in substantially higher prices in many areas. In Ibadan, it is fetching Naria 1,500 (Pounds 43) a tonne compared with N180 a year ago. An IITA survey of cassava in Africa found that in 275 villages (in six countries that had not experienced famine), cassava was grown as the main crop in half of them. The survey revealed that in villages where cassava was increasingly cultivated, 30 per cent of villagers said they were growing more of the crop as a security against hunger and famine, 25 per cent said it was because of growing population, while 20 per cent cited a good local market. Crop breeders are cautiously optimistic that the new varieties will give Africa a long-overdue breakthrough to higher food output. 'Africa shall survive,' believes Mr Hahn, 'because of polyploidy in cassava.'</p>

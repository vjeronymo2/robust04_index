			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Economists see German upturn: Five out of six leading institutes predict growth of 1.5 per cent Five of Germany's six leading economic institutes yesterday threw their weight behind the most optimistic forecasts of German economic recovery, while calling on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates by up to two more percentage points. The five - excluding the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) - predicted a 1 per cent recovery of the west German economy this year, and a 1.5 per cent overall growth rate, including east Germany. The report by the institutes coincided with a sharper than expected rise in the country's March money supply figures, with the broad money supply measure, M3, expanding by more than 15 per cent. Government bond prices firmed nonetheless, with news of good first-quarter Mercedes-Benz sales and profits from the Hoechst chemicals group lifting the economic mood. The institutes warned, however, that unemployment would continue to rise. They also called for firmer government action to deregulate the German economy, including measures to tackle the 'monopolies and cartels' among the energy utilities and the major private banks. The DIW, the one dissident voice in the institutes' spring survey of the German economy, suggested that the sharp reduction in real wages would squeeze consumer spending and outweigh the benefits of increased export orders, causing a renewed economic downturn in the summer. It forecast zero growth for west Germany, and 0.5 per cent for the whole economy. The latest Bundesbank money supply figures for March showed the broad M3 measure had dramatically overshot its target corridor for the fourth month running. M3 grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised rate of 15.2 per cent last month, down from still higher levels in January and February, but well outside the central bank's 4 to 6 per cent target range for the year. The Bundesbank blamed the high figure on a number of factors, the chief among them being the lack of 'monetary capital formation' in March as interest rate and bund market uncertainties encouraged investors to keep cash on short-term deposit rather than making long-term savings which shift assets out of the money stock. The figure was at the worse end of market expectations and seems likely to ensure that the M3 target for 1994 will not be met. Economists said the figure was unlikely to interfere with the Bundesbank's policy of making gradual cuts in interest rates. Perversely, German government bond prices gained half a point in volatile trading, despite the poor money supply data. Dealers said that a shortage of paper in the market helped buoy prices.

Manelis under the ``Signal Processing'' </F> rubric; received after rework Nov.11,1991; UDC  621.391.82:621.396.62]    [Abstract] The objective of the work was to study the  effect of an error of estimating parameters of narrow-band  Gaussian noise on the effectiveness of a detection algorithm and  to derive design formulas for detection characteristics for a  case of quasi-optimum processing. Results of calculations using  the derived formulas are presented. The detection algorithm is  extremely sensitive to the accuracy of estimates of spectral  parameters of the noise. The derived results make it possible to  formulate valid specifications for a noise situation meter in  order to ensure the required efficiency of detection. Figures 1,  references 4.</p>

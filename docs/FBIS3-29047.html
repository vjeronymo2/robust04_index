North Korea  has notified the United States of its wish to resume last-minute  talks with the IAEA as the Feb. 21 opening of the agency's  board meeting nears, the sources said, predicting a breakthrough  in the disagreement over nuclear inspections.    Previous talks went nowhere as North Korea flatly opposed  full-scale inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites while  insisting on limited inspection of the secretive reprocessing  facility and reactor at Yongbyon. The North Koreans may show  more flexibility on allowing inspections in this round of  negotiations, the sources said.    Pyongyang, informing Washington of its intention to resume  talks with the IAEA at a recent unofficial meeting, urged the  United States to keep its promise to hold a third round of  high-level negotiations to discuss suspension of the annual  military exercise "Team Spirit" with South Korea and improving  bilateral ties. The sources said Pyongyang and Washington have  narrowed their differences over nuclear inspections a great  deal, but did not elaborate.    There is a possibility that North Korea may accept  full-scale  nuclear inspections by attaching a number of conditions, but it  is uncertain whether it will use that card before the IAEA board  meeting or before the end of the month, when the North Korean  nuclear matter will likely be referred to the U.N. Security  Council if there is no progress on inspections.    After six rounds of unsuccessful talks, North Korea has  shunned the IAEA since Jan. 25, accusing the U.N. nuclear  watchdog of trying to force complete inspections.    It remains uncertain whether Pyongyang will resume talks  with  the IAEA and working-level contacts with the United States in  New York at the same time.</p>

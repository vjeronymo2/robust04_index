			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Capita advances 24% and sees further growth Capita Group increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.46m in the year to December 31. Turnover increased by 52 per cent to Pounds 50.2m, of which Pounds 2.14m came from acquisitions. Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman, said Capita had strengthened further its position as a leading provider of professional support services to the public and private sectors. He said: 'Our current order book in all three divisions is stronger than 12 months ago and we are continuing to bid for many business opportunities . . . I am optimistic that Capita will make further progress.' Net cashflow from operating activities rose from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 8.5m, of which Pounds 4.4m was invested in acquisitions and Pounds 3.5m in capital expenditure. The group's net cash balance dipped from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 8.4m. Capita said its restructuring into three divisions had been successfully completed. Outsourcing increased operating profits by 32 per cent to Pounds 2.55m, the advisory division was up 21 per cent at Pounds 1.28m and property services rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.64m. The outsourcing division's forward projected revenues up to the end of 1998 stood at Pounds 118m, a 55 per cent increase over the corresponding period. Mr Aldridge said the group had started 14 new local government outsourcing contracts during the year. 'We have won two significant contracts at the London boroughs of Westminster and Bexley worth Pounds 14.5m in aggregate, which start in April 1994. These contracts are to provide collection services for council tax and business rates. As a result, Capita is now responsible for the annual collection of Pounds 1.2bn of public money. We anticipate further contract wins by the half year.' The group said prospects were excellent for its advisory division, which had established a firm niche in well-paid work for central government. Earnings per share increased by 23 per cent to 7.9p (6.4p). A final dividend of 1.7p gives a total of 2.55p (2.1p), a rise of 21 per cent. COMMENT Capita has built an admired position in providing contracted services to local government by concentrating on high-margin activities such as revenue collection and computer services, rather than fiercely competitive cleaning and catering contracts. The group estimates more than 800 of its type of contract will come up over the next five years, so there remains plenty to go for. Market testing is proceeding more slowly in central government, so Capita's best chance there looks to be on the consultancy side. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.7m put the shares, up 5p to 220p, on a prospective multiple of 24. They cannot be classed a bargain at this level, but the premium rating looks justified both by the group's track record and prospects.</p>

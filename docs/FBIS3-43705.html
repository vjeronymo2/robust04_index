Mr. Mandela said the ANC had disciplined some SDU members  involved in violence. He was speaking after a meeting of  Patriotic Front members and responding to radio and newspaper  reports which quoted an East Rand SDU member as saying he killed  opponents as he would kill chickens. The SDU issue would be  raised at Friday's meeting of the ANC national executive  committee, Mr Mandela said. However, he said he wanted to  stress, without being protective of SDUs, that problems with the  units were the results of a government strategy.    "Their strategy is based on the fact that they will have  overwhelming suport among whites in the election. They are  confident of substantial support among coloreds and Indians, and  that the base of the ANC is the African community. The violence  is taking place only among Africans. By instigating and  conniving in the violence they will be able to cut down the  majority of the ANC."    The ANC, he said, did not condone the lack of discipline and  slaughter of innocent people. Mr Mandela said peace-keeping  proposals he discussed with State President F. W. de Klerk on  Monday dovetailed with the efforts of the Transitional Executive  Council. Mr Mandela said he would report to the ANC national  executive committee on his discussions with Mr de Klerk.</p>

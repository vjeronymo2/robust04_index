			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tran Quoc Khai: "How to Motivate Domestic </F> Capital: There Needs To Be an Appropriate Legal System"]    [Text] Our ancestors had the saying "To make paste, you  need flour" when they wanted to say that to do something, we  need the means. To do business, to carry out economic  activities, we also need the means, that is, capital. In a  symposium on economic development held in Ho Chi Minh City, a  Japanese specialist has said frankly: "You want to find business  partners? First of all you need to have money in your hand;  then you have to have business management knowledge and market  information, otherwise failure awaits you...".    It is true that if we do not have capital to the minimum of  40 percent of the total investment capital for a joint venture,  then we will be at a disadvantage. I was not surprised when I  visited Shanghai in China, where the eastern region development  project is being carried out. Foreign investment up to tens of  billions of dollars capitalizes it; however, the state of China  has also put in 130 billion yuan, or 50 percent of the total of  capital, for that gigantic project, which is creating the "head"  of the dragon for the whole east China region.    There are countless examples to prove that lack of capital  means disadvantages for the economic development of the world's  poor countries. The first victims were the African countries,  who have, due to the lack of capital, `voluntarily' used their  land and dirt-cheap labor to grow industrial plants as required  by capital lending countries. The results have been shortages  of food staples, exhausted soil, and an even more devastating  situation than before.    One of our directors recently exclaimed that, two years ago,  he had been too "enthusiastic" in searching for foreign partners  to set up joint ventures. For capital, he borrowed from them  half a million U.S. dollars, and they contributed another half a  million dollars with the condition that the joint venture should  import equipment chosen by them, and our director should take  care of the sale of the produce. In exchange our director  should agree to an export volume of agricultural products of  2,500 tonnes. As a result our director received a loan and a  bunch of obsolete equipment which had been newly-painted. Our  director is of course awaiting his trial in court, but, to be  fair, the state and people should shoulder this loss. He  claimed that he did not embezzle even a cent into his own  pocket; he was cheated and he had no capital to make a fair  deal. Cases like this are happening quite often these days in  our country.    Capital is essential for development in our country, a  country devastated by many years of war. Many projects have  been postponed just because funding was not available, and many  of these projects were construction of infrastructure requiring  large amounts of investment and a long capital recycling time.  But if we do not strive for strong development of the  infrastructure, we will not have conditions for economic  development. In a recent visit to Dien Bien Phu, the local  leaders told me that the local people supported the campaign to  substitute poppy with other industrial plants. But when the  people needed financial help, only about several hundred  thousand dong for each hectare of land, the authority could not  respond. Then the people told the leaders that they would  supply their own plant and livestock species, but that the  authorities should make more roads so they could barter their  products with other localities. The authorities faced another  stalemate since they had no funds to build more roads.    So where can we find the capital?    Some specialists estimate that there is about 20,000 billion  dong of idle capital still in the hands of the people. Others  say it is 40,000. In the last Tet Giap Tuat [New Year of The  Dog] event alone, our Vietnamese compatriots from the U.S.A.  brought home $36 million through Tan Son Nhat Airport (Ho Chi  Minh City). Most of this money did not go into saving funds and  state treasure, but was invested in land and real estate.  Investment in land and real estate brings no benefit to the  national economy. Some economic specialists have asserted that  the land prices in Vietnam are unrealistically high. In some  places the price was twice as expensive as compared with that in  other countries in the area, thus creating another difficulty in  the effort to attract foreign investment.    The success of the domestic capital motivation campaign is a  criteria to measure the trust of people in the state. If people  still do not trust [the state] and feel indecisive, it is almost  impossible to urge them to bank their money in the state  treasury, or to do joint business with the state. So the  primary task the state needs to do is to create trust in the  people so that they will be willing to put their money into  developing the economy and building the country. There will be  a thousand and one tasks to do, but the first thing we need is  an appropriate legal system that protects the rightful benefits  of the people. We should not repeat the situation in which the  people who have deposited money in saving funds have nowhere to  turn to when problems arise.    Secondly, we need to restructure our management to improve  economic efficiency, so that the money people put in will secure  a profit. We should not allow the current situation of many  loss- making enterprises with their directors and cadres still  earning enough to build new houses, buy new "late model" cars,  and live even more "luxuriously". It is impossible then to  persuade people to practice thrift for national construction.    We need to revise the following lesson: at the time when we  had just regained independence, our national treasury was almost  empty. President Ho Chi Minh urged all the people to save one  meal and use the rice to help people who suffered hunger at that  time, and he did it first as a model to others. Later when he  again urged people to contribute money and gold to buy guns for  national salvation, all the people gave their strong support.  We should never forget this lesson; it should be the model for  our activities.</p>

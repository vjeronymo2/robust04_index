			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Korean People's Army, Which Highly </F> Upholds the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the Supreme  Commander, is Ever-Victorious and Invincible"]    [Text] Today, our People's Army has grown to be an  ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary armed force under  the wise leadership of the respected and beloved supreme  commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, and is proudly displaying its  dignity.    Having an ever-victorious and invincible mighty  revolutionary  Army is one of the fundamental difficulties in pioneering the  nation's fate and future. The revolutionary Army is organized  and led by the party and the leader. We cannot think about the  revolutionary Army's existence and activities, and revolutionary  armed force building and its strengthening and development,  without the leadership of the party and the leader.    Since the leader [yongdoja] plays a decisive role in the  revolutionary armed force building, determining the might of an  organized Army is dependent on the greatness of the leader  [yongdoja] leading it. As history proves, an Army that fights  by highly upholding an outstanding leader [suryong] and leader  [yongdoja] has nothing to be afraid of, and it will always be  ever-victorious possessed with an invincible might.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: The  party's leadership toward the People's Army is a basic guarantee  in all victories of the People's Army.    It is the privilege of our People's Army today to highly  uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the top position  of the country's national defense capacity and the revolutionary  armed force, and it has become all the more strengthened and  developed and an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary  armed force under his wise leadership.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the supreme  commander, developed and completed the chuche-oriented military  ideology and theory, and strengthened and developed the People's  Army into a revolutionary Army of one-a-match-for-one-hundred.  He is a military commander of extraordinary caliber.    Most of all, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il formulated  the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory and war methods  through the brilliant ideological and theoretical activities by  linking it with the great leader's esteemed name. He also  developed and completed it with new ideological and theoretical  assets.    Scientifically formulating and intensifying and developing  the military theory put forth by the leader [suryong] is one of  the fundamental problems in the cause of founding the Army of  the working class and in developing the military ideology and  theory.    The military theory put forth by the leader [suryong] must  be  scientifically formulated, and its intrinsic content, structural  system, and fundamental characteristics must be clarified. With  this as a cornerstone, military building and military activities  can be successfully realized in accordance with the leader's  ideology and intention without the slightest deviation.    The chuche-oriented military science, systemized and  formulated by the dear comrade leader, is a perfected military  science that consists of military theory and system of war  methods elucidated by the man-centered military ideology and the  dear comrade leader.    What is especially important in the military ideology and  theory newly put forth by the dear comrade leader is the  ideology and theory of modeling the whole Army after the chuche  idea. The ideology and theory of modeling the whole Army after  the chuche idea is the highest program of military building in  which the People's Army must be firmly adhered to in  strengthening and developing the Army as the Army of the leader  and Army of the party. Here, the ultimate goal and direction,  struggle tasks, and methods of military building are wholly  synthesized.    The dear comrade leader also gave an overall scientific  elucidation in all theoretical and practical problems arising in  military building and activities, such as the ideology and  theory on the essence of the revolutionary war and the  inevitability of its victory; the characteristics of a modern  war and the theory of building the country's national defense  capacity; the method to deploy armed struggle and the  chuche-oriented war method; and the chuche-oriented system and  art of commanding the Army.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader  [yongdoja] who strengthened and developed our People's Army into  an Army of the party through extraordinary leadership.  Endlessly strengthening and developing the Army of the working  class into an Army of the leader and an Army of the party, is a  fundamental problem in defending the revolutionary character of  the Army and fulfill its historical mission and duty.    When the revolutionary Army is made through and through into  an Army of the party, the Army can become a peerless Army that  defends and safeguards the party's cause with arms. What is  most important in the respected and beloved comrade supreme  commander's leadership in making the People's Army an Army of  the party is to single-heartedly unite the whole Army based on  loyalty toward the party and the leader.    The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander  elucidated loyalty toward the party and the leader as being of  the utmost importance to the life of the army, and that we  cannot fathom the army's single-hearted unity and existence. He  made it so that the process of modeling the whole army after the  chuche idea is to firmly establish a revolutionary view of the  leader amid all the officers and men, and to bear in their  hearts, loyalty toward the party and the leader as a  revolutionary faith and integrity.    In particular, the respected and beloved comrade supreme  commander has brought forth a loyal slogan "Let Us Sacrifice Our  Lives for the Great Leader!" within the People's Army and has  led the People's Army to live and struggle in conformity with  such a demand. Thus, he has impregnably strengthened the  single-hearted unity of the entire army based on the loyalty  toward the party and the leader [suryong].    Thanks to the leadership of the dear comrade leader, the  single-hearted unity between the leader [suryong], the party,  and the Army have become a community of one fate bound together  with one life; a unified body of ideology and will held together  by hearts bursting with loyalty and filial duty; and one in body  and spirit upholding the comrade supreme commander with the  force of arms.    Firmly establishing the party's system of leadership within  the army is a fundamental demand to develop and enrich the  People's Army into the party's army.    The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has set  up the powerful revolutionary discipline by which the entire  army moves as one under the unitary leadership of the party  center. Likewise, he has taken steps for commanders, party  members, and the members of the League of Socialist Working  Youths of Korea [LSWYK] to endlessly strengthen the  organizational, ideological life with a high view of the  organization.    In doing so, the revolutionary work system and discipline  that can firmly guarantee the uniformity of the party's  leadership within the People's Army has been set up. The  steel-like revolutionary military ethos in which all the  officers and men move as one according to the party's order and  direction was also established.    In order to fully prepare our People's Army with the  qualities befitting the leader's [suryong] army, the party's  army, and the People's Army, the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander has paid much attention to the work to ensure  officer-men unity, army-people unity, and party members-LSWYK  members unity, and has wisely led the work. Thus, in our  country, commanders and soldiers, the army and the people, and  party members and LSWYK members are faithfully upholding the  party's cause with one mind and will.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander,  has firmly brought up our People's Army as indomitable ranks  possessed of the one-a-match-for-100 combat capacity. The  army's combat capacity can be assessed by the superiority of its  military technology and armed equipment, along with its  political, ideological superiority. A war is confrontation not  only of soldiers' political, ideological strength but also of  fighting means and armed equipment. Such being the case, in  order to prevail over the enemy, we need to endlessly promote  the quality and quantity of the army's arms supply.    With his insight into the role and importance of armed  equipment in a war, the respected and beloved comrade supreme  commander has wisely led the work to modernize the army with  modern weapons and combat and technical equipment. Thus, our  People's Army today has become brilliantly prepared with modern  combat and technical equipment necessary for an attack and  defense, and demonstrated its majestic appearance at the  military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the foundation  of the Korean People's Army.    Important issues arising in the work to strengthen the  combat  capacity of the People's Army is that of firmly preparing the  soldiers of the People's Army militarily and technically, and of  strengthening military training strategically and tactically.    Having set forth a revolutionary slogan "Training Is Also  Combat" to the People's Army, the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander has led the work of strengthening training  over all else.    Thanks to the leadership of the respected and beloved  comrade  supreme commander, our People's Army has been brought as an  invincible army of one-a-match-for-hundred firmly equipped with  modern weapons and combat and technical equipment of our style,  and possessed of high military technology and the  chuche-motivated war method. With those means, the People's  Army can resolutely smash any enemy and defend the chuche  revolutionary cause with the force of arms. Truly, our People's  Army has been all the more brought up as the invincible ranks  and traversed the path to glorious victory by upholding the wise  leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme  commander. There is no enemy that can match the might of our  People's Army that has been trained and tempered through arduous  and difficult flames of struggle with the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il at the head of the revolutionary armed forces.    Our people and People's Army, as in the past, will  vigorously  push ahead with the socialist construction and reliably defend  the party's cause and the nation's security by firmly uniting  around the party and the leader [suryong].</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays wanted The strongest performance in the UK banking sector came from Barclays, which benefited from bouts of switching from a number of other UK banks but notably from National Westminster. The latter dipped to 453p, mainly reflecting the switching, but rallied to end unchanged at 459p. Barclays, however, was well bid all day and settled 3 higher at 549p after good turnover of 4.7m shares. Sentiment was also driven by Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive who, while on a trip to Japan, delivered a bullish message on the bank's current and future performance. He said the bank's profitability was recovering strongly. Standard Chartered, the FT-SE 100's best performer last week and last month, following a series of broker buy recommendations and a forthcoming series of presentations to US institutions, attracted a minor flurry of profit-taking, closing 9 off at 266p with 17m shares traded. Two big trades in Standard shares at the close, a block of 9m and another of 5.2m shares, equivalent to 6 per cent of the company's issued capital, traded at 245p and were thought to have been bed and breakfast, or tax-related deals. SG Warburg was a notable weak spot in the merchant banking sector, sliding 11 to 729p, with the market still nervous about the bank's exposure to big swings in bonds and equities across Europe. In a recent note, Robert Fleming Securities said: 'Unless market sentiment turns dramatically, the potential downside to the Warburg share price is still substantial.' The broker's merchant banks analyst Mr Rupert Fleming said: 'Warburg's long term trend of greater reliance on proprietary trading and marketmaking has implications for valuation; we believe Warburg should be derated towards premium US investment house ratings of eight times historic earnings, indicating a price of about 605p.' An increase in the dividend and a positive results meeting helped traders discount the 2.4 per cent decline in profits from distribution group Christian Salvesen, which rose 8 to 255p. Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel gave up 18 to 324p on rumours that several institutional investors were unwilling to take on the stock from the group's recent Pounds 816m rights issue. One market watcher said: 'At this stage, it looks like SG Warburg (Eurotunnel's broker) will be left holding a large chunk of the issue.' The offer closes on June 22. Sentiment in the stock was further damaged by news of a breakdown of a test train in the tunnel last Saturday, due to an electrical short circuit. Swiss Bank Corporation issued 5m call warrants in a basket of pharmaceutical stocks. The basket represents three Glaxo, down 11 to 549 1/2 p, one, 5 1/2 cheaper at 589p, one Zeneca, 12 lower at 694p, and two SmithKline Beecham, off 3 1/2 at 398p. Swiss Bank said the underperformance of the sector in the past year, declining about 12 per cent against the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index, made it attractive. Conglomerate Williams Holdings hardened 2 to 353p in trade of 1.5m, with Kleinwort Benson reported to have recommended the stock. Magazine publisher EMAP slipped 2 to 407p after confirming that it was in discussions with radio group Trans World Communications for a recommended offer. Businessman Mr Owen Oyston, who owns 22 per cent of Trans World, has agreed to sell at 181p a share, a price which was well received by analysts. Chiltern Radio, which last week became the subject of an agreed bid of 242p a share from Luxembourg broadcaster CLT, firmed 3 to 243p. Rationalisation plans by Dixons involving the closure of 100 Currys stores were confirmed by the group. Although mooted in the market for some time, the news nevertheless hit the shares, which fell 6 to 187p. Among food manufacturers, yield considerations held up Hazlewood Foods, ahead 4 at 131p, and limited the damage to Dalgety, off a penny at 417p. Details of the well-flagged rights issue from Euro Disney were finally announced; the seven-for-two issue priced at FFr10 aims to raise FFr5.9bn. Euro Disney shares dropped 20 on the news but rallied to close just 3 down at 380p. Ladbroke shares were in demand, a combination of a rebound after recent weakness and featuring as part of a large programme trade. The group also announced the death of finance director and vice-chairman Mr Jerry O'Mahony. The stock added 2 at 161p in turnover of 5.5m shares.</p>

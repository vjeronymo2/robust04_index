			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Handbag side blamed for 8% fall to Pounds 6.6m at Peter Black A FALL in sales of handbags and luggage was the main drag on annual profits at Peter Black Holdings, the Marks and Spencer supplier and provider of distribution services. The pre-tax figure for the year to May 30 fell by just over 8 per cent from Pounds 6.62m (Pounds 7.23m) on turnover of Pounds 106.2m (Pounds 126m). Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said Pounds 17.5m of the turnover fall was accounted for by the disposal of the home furnishings business. Like-for-like sales were down by about 2 per cent, mainly in the Keighley-based soft footwear and accessories operation, which had proved vulnerable to reduced consumer spending. With operating profit down by 19 per cent to Pounds 8.35m (Pounds 10.31m), a cut in interest costs to Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 3.08m) helped the figures. Net debt fell to Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 13.4m), reducing gearing from 39 to 15 per cent. Stocks had been cut by Pounds 5.5m. Personal care contributed Pounds 3.2m to pre-tax profit on sales of Pounds 38.2m. A factory closure led to Pounds 200,000 exceptional costs. Mr Black said toiletries and the English Grains contract business improved, but cosmetics declined. Customers included J Sainsbury and Superdrug as well as M and S. Demand for branded herbal remedies, such as Natracalm and Red Kooga Ginseng, also held up well. Footwear and accessories made Pounds 2.6m on Pounds 55.9m sales, again after Pounds 200,000 of rationalisation costs. Turnover was 5 per cent down in spite of further progress in the Newbold fashion shoes operation. The service division produced Pounds 800,000 profit on Pounds 12.1m turnover. Mr Black said the group handled warehousing and distribution for 30 companies. While sales at its own factory shops were down, the Hornsea retail park  - based on a US concept where up-market branded goods are sold at a discount - was showing considerable promise. Earnings per share slipped to 8.21p (9.16p). An increased final dividend of 2.17p makes a total of 2.94p (2.84p). COMMENT Peter Black has honed its businesses down to a coherent collection and applied an even sharper knife to working capital. The only exception to the core-business ethic is the Hornsea park, an exciting concept in a bargain-hunting era but one that would require a great deal of investment to extend. It will be an interesting decision for the management whether to sell it or develop it. Discipline will also need to be applied to the fledgling distribution business, where the group is so far reaping the benefits of being a niche operator. All three legs of the business should make progress this year with the help of the largest customer M and S, although toiletries and bags have not proved as resilient as ladieswear. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.5m gives a prospective p/e of less than 12. The shares look far from expensive, but trade is thin because of the family holding of nearly 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- A restructured U.N.  Security Council [UNSC] with Japan as a permanent member should  reflect the world body's ability to resolve problems it will  face in the next century, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Don  McKinnon said Thursday [21 April].    McKinnon, whose country currently chairs the Security  Council, told a press conference in Tokyo that New Zealand  supports Japan's bid to become a permanent Council member, but  any decision on membership will have to wait at least two or  three years. McKinnon, who is concurrently minister of foreign  affairs and trade, said this is the time it will take for the  U.N. to conduct a thorough debate on the issue, initiated by  U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    "It is going to take a fair bit of tough debate," McKinnon  said. "But more importantly, that is to ensure that if the  changes do take place, they not only reflect 1994, 1995 and  1996, but hopefully through to the 21st century."    McKinnon also said New Zealand believes the power of veto is  "inappropriate" and any new permanent member should not be given  veto powers. The five permanent Security council members are  Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, which all  have veto power.    McKinnon said other countries being considered as candidates  for permanent membership on the Council are Brazil, Canada,  Germany, India, Nigeria and Turkey.    "From a purely Asian-Pacific viewpoint, I am very much aware  that of the permanent five members, four have Caucasian faces  and only one has an Asian face," McKinnon said. "And that  balance could easily be upset to the point where the Security  Council possibly begins to lose credibility."    "And the credibility of the Council is really the basis of  this whole exercise."    McKinnon said Japan's contribution to peacekeeping  operations  in Cambodia was "certainly a plus" in its bid for Council  membership.    The New Zealand deputy premier arrived in Japan on Tuesday  for a three-day stay. During his stay he met with Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, and International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai.    McKinnon leaves Japan on Thursday for Washington.</p>

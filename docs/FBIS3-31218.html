He was speaking after a meeting of the ambassadors to NATO  of  the 16 member countries, who fixed the deadline on February 9  after being asked by the United Nations to consider airstrikes  following the massacre of 68 people by a mortar bomb in a  Sarajevo market. The Bosnian Serbs have denied firing the bomb  and a UN commission of inquiry said in Zagreb Wednesday it had  failed to determine its origin.    In Sarajevo the handing over of heavy weapons to UN control  by both sides, an alternative to their withdrawal, has been  proceeding at a snail's pace.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Finance </F> Minister Hirohisa Fujii by YOMIURI SHIMBUN; place and date not  given; from the "Interviews With New Cabinet Members" column]    [Text] Interview With Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] You assumed the post of foreign minister  after breaking away from the Watanabe faction of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Have you ever been advised by  former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe?    [Kakizawa] He has encouraged me. He also has advised me to  work as hard as possible. He has warmly encouraged me. Even  now, Mr. Watanabe and I share the same aspirations.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  were broken off. How are you going to deal with them?    [Kakizawa] It is important for Japan to work out a  macroeconomic policy and relax bureaucratic regulations to open  up its markets. It is also important for Japan to flesh out the  term "objective criteria," the establishment of which the United  States has demanded. But Japan should not relent on its  principle of opposing any numerical targets.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with the issue of  North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons?    [Kakizawa] The coalition partners have agreed on a policy to  deal with the issue, but in a sense, the policy is ambiguous. It  can be said that with the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] breaking away from the coalition, its ambiguity can be  removed. Since our cabinet is a minority government, I intend to  deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons while seeking the understanding of other  political parties.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about legislation to  prepare Japan for emergencies?    [Kakizawa] If Japan is ahead of other nations in taking  domestic legislative initiatives, it would have an adverse  impact on Japan's relations with other nations. I intend to deal  with the issue while carefully examining what Japan should do to  resolve the issue.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to handle Japan's bid for  a permanent membership on the UN Security Council?    [Kakizawa] I will work more aggressively than ever to get  other nations to understand that Japan's affiliation with the UN  Security Council as a permanent member will serve to reform and  strengthen the United Nations instead of waging a campaign like  election campaign to win support from other nations.  <H5>  Interview With Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii </H5>   [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Now that the SDPJ has broken away from the  coalition, will it not be difficult for the Hata government to  draw a conclusion on the issue of reforming the current tax  system by the end of June?    [Fujii] The ruling coalition parties have set up the Tax  System Reform Council and the council has continued to study  ways to reform the current tax system. Many of the SDPJ members  share our view. The LDP has studied ways to raise the  consumption tax and the value added tax since 1968. The  coalition partners are examining the possibility of discussing  the issue with the SDPJ and the LDP.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The enactment of a budget bill for the  fiscal 1994 is being delayed. What is your opinion?    [Fujii] The delay in the enactment of the budget bill should  not adversely affect the people's lives. The only thing we can  do is to ask the Diet to begin deliberations of the budget bill.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  remain stalled. What measures are you contemplating to resume  the talks?    [Fujii] The Finance Ministry has announced that it would  voluntarily relax regulations in the insurance and monetary  sectors. I intend to work for their relaxation.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hosokawa government was criticized for  being led by the bureaucracy.    [Fujii] I cannot understand why the Hosokawa government was  criticized that way. I have continued to speak of the  inevitability to reform the current tax system. My conviction is  to reform the system. I believe that Finance Ministry officials  will act in tune with my conviction.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the issue  of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and  the issue of remittance by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North  Korea?    [Fujii] Japan's foreign policy honors decisions made by the  United Nations.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the current level of  interest rates?    [Fujii] Long-term interest rates have risen temporarily, but  they remain at a low level. The coordination of interest rates  is not the only policy to stimulate the economy. At the present  stage, we have to calmly watch how the economy is moving.</p>

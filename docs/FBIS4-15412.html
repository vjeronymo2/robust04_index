			<p>BFN     [Text] By its ordinance No. 273 of March 31 the Russian  government introduced an excise tax on gasoline. The excise  will be equal to 10 percent of the wholesale price.    An informed government expert told the Oil Information  Agency  that this step will result in an increase of retail prices of  gasoline because "any taxation deals a blow to the consumer."  For this reason numerous experts expect the wholesale prices to  increase by 15 to 20 percent.    Officials of the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry told the  Oil Information Agency that "an essentially new tax on oil  refining may affect both the refineries and the consumers."    The experts believe that the mechanism of collecting the tax  would probably be explained in a letter to be sent by the  Finance Ministry. They said that the decision to impose the  excise was dictated by a dramatic drop of demand for oil  products in Russia that was attributable to the payment crisis.    First Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Vavilov said that the  excise tax was one of the steps the government had to take to  increase the revenue. In an Interfax interview Thursday he  emphasized that this revenue had been allowed for in drafting  the 1994 budget.    "Direct taxes on manufacturing industries cannot be raised  any more. Consequently, indirect taxes have to be used. True,  they will hit the consumer, but they will encourage production."    Vavilov said that the excise would result in price rises. He  also said that the government had submitted to the State Duma a  package of steps designed to increase the budget revenue without  increasing taxation. Numerous ordinances had been adopted and  another set of proposals were under preparation.</p>

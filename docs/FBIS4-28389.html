			<p>BFN     [Text] The Thai consulate general in Johannesburg will be  upgraded into the Royal Thai Embassy in Victoria, the capital of  South Africa.    The Cabinet this week approved the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs' proposal to upgrade the Thai diplomatic representation  in South Africa in this fiscal year. The Ministry of Foreign  Affairs considers South Africa, after the non-racial elections,  a prime site for the country's diplomatic offensive in Africa.    South Africa is a large country with a population of 40.6  million and rich natural resources and huge economic potentials.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says Thailand can use South  Africa as the base to further develop relations and cooperation  with other African countries. The Thai Embassy in South Africa  will also look after Thailand's interests in Sawaziland,  Lesotho, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Angola, Zambia,  Mozambique, Madagascar, and Mauritius.</p>

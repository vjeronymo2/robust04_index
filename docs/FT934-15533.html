			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (14): Daunting task that faces exporters - Industry THE RECESSION that has jolted Finland over the past three years has, among its other effects, exposed the extent to which the country is now dependent on its export industries for a return to growth. 'Increasing merchandise exports and the continuation of structural changes in export production hold the key to the preservation of economic well-being,' concluded a recent paper on industrial strategy produced by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. An encouraging start has been made, with exports rising at an annual rate of some 13 per cent this year, thanks in large measure to the sharp decline in the value of the Finnish markka. The current account deficit has been slashed and should move to a small surplus next year. Finland's traditional mainstay - the forestry industry - has contributed to the export revival, despite the continued weak state of the world market for its products. The metal and engineering industries, which now make up the biggest part of manufacturing output, have also pushed up exports, with such companies as Nokia, the world's second largest mobile telephone maker, and Metra, a world leader in diesel engines, improving profits significantly this year. But the task is a daunting one. 'In order for Finland to start reducing its foreign indebtedness, the balance of trade must for several years run a surplus of FM30-40bn - about 30 per cent relative to export revenues. Only Japan and Germany have been able to sustain such sizeable surpluses,' commented the ministry in its strategy paper. 'In terms of export growth, this means an average rise in exports of 6-8 per cent per annum all through the 1990s.' Achieving such a target will require a marked expansion of manufacturing output - which fell as a proportion of GDP in the late 1980s from more than 25 per cent to less than 15 per cent - as well as greater diversification and greater adaptation to new technologies. But it will also require structural changes in areas such as labour market rigidities, privatisation and protection of local industries to maintain the competitive momentum already given by the devaluation of the markka. The government believes it has an important role to play in this process, but not through active promotion of new industries or direct channelling of resources to favoured sectors. 'There is a need for an industrial policy in Finland, but not in the way of the old days,' says Mr Matti Vuoria, the trade and industry ministry's top official. 'We don't want to enter a debate on which industrial branches Finland should be in - the market will make those decisions.' Instead, Mr Vuoria says, the intention is to concentrate on development of infrastructure - particularly transport links in a country distant from most of its export markets - technology and education and the removal of protection which in the 1980s sucked too much investment into the 'sheltered sector'. Finland, he says, has no inherent competitive industrial advantages and must therefore create them through, for example, the fostering of a highly educated workforce. Big changes have already been made in the area of foreign investment - an area in which Finland has historically ranked among the weakest of western countries. Legislation allowing foreign ownership of Finnish companies came into force this year, prompting a wave of foreign sharebuying. The dearth of local operations by foreign companies is still a feature of the Finnish economy. But this may also change. Norway's Kvaerner Group now runs the Masa shipbuilding yard, which this year won the country's biggest ever export order - a contract to build four liquid natural gas carriers for Abu Dhabi. Government action on the privatisation of the 20 per cent of industrial output that is in state hands has been slower. The state's holding in Tampella, a big metals group, has been reduced from 90 to 50 per cent. Other majority or wholly state-owned major companies slated for action include Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group, Kemira, a chemicals producer, Outokumpu, the mining and metals concern, and Valmet, the paper machinery and engineering company. But little has been done beyond the commissioning of privatisation studies. In the meantime, the main feature of development among private sector companies outside the forestry sector has been a trend to shift from diversified conglomerates to more tightly focused operations, with an increasing emphasis on overseas activities. Within this trend, the diversity of activity tends to bear out the industry ministry's analysis that there is no 'natural' sector for Finnish companies to concentrate on. Nokia is a prime example. Since a spree of acquisitions in the 1980s, it has restructured to concentrate on mobile and fixed telecommunications systems, an area in which Finland has no special tradition. Another group which has restructured since the 1980s is Huhtamaki, which now concentrates on confectionery, pharmaceuticals and food packaging. It is a collection which Mr Timo Peltola, the chief executive, cheerfully admits offers each other little in the way of synergies, but in which, he says, Huhtamaki has separately built up a store of expertise.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Unions angry at public-sector pay PUBLIC-SECTOR pay rises limited to about 1.5 per cent were confirmed yesterday, demonstrating the cabinet's determination to crack down on public spending. The prime minister's statement in the Commons came as the Treasury said inflation had dropped to 1.7 per cent, the lowest for 25 years. Doctors and dentists, nursing staff, midwives and health visitors, professions allied to medicine and the armed forces will receive 1.5 per cent from April 1. Most teachers will receive between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent over the full year from this April. The awards, in line with limits announced in November, were quickly portrayed as not a rise but a pay cut. There was anger among teachers - some of whom receive only 0.55 per cent initially - as well as nurses and other hospital workers, but the military felt there was little point in grumbling. Health union negotiators rejected the award for nurses, midwives and health visitors as 'totally unacceptable'. Ms Judith Carter, the unions' lead negotiator and national officer for Cohse, the public service union, said the award would simply lead to a deterioration in morale, cause difficulties implementing the Patient's Charter and lead to more staff leaving the health service. The awards mean a nursing assistant would have an average increase of Pounds 2.47 a week, increasing the salary to Pounds 8,699. A newly qualified nurse would have an increase of Pounds 3.12 a week, giving an annual salary of Pounds 13,449. Ward sisters would get an additional Pounds 4.31 a week, for a new annual salary of Pounds 15,184. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, the biggest teaching union, said the award was a 'disgraceful insult'. He added: 'Pay has not been at the top of the teachers' agenda but this derisory increase will push it high up their list of grievances.' All qualified teachers will receive a 0.55 per cent increase on April 1, and a one-off payment of Pounds 90 on May 1. On September 1, they will be transferred to a new pay scale, giving a further increase to most. Teachers are presently paid on a 10-point scale from Pounds 11,184 to Pounds 18,837, with five different incentive allowances - ranging from Pounds 1,296 to Pounds 7,692 - for those assuming extra responsibilities or demonstrating 'outstanding ability'. The allowances will be abolished from this September, and all teachers will be placed on an 18-point scale, ranging from Pounds 11,295 to Pounds 30,573. Head teachers and deputy heads will receive a 1 per cent increase on April 1. Overall, the package will cost an extra 1.5 per cent. Local education authorities, most of which are now spending at their capping ceiling, yesterday expressed concern at their ability to foot the bill without redundancies. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, said: 'It is unfair to expect vital people like nurses and teachers to accept a pay settlement less than the rate of inflation, a lot less then settlements outside, and less than what the government are likely to give the judges.' The top salaries review body did not report this year. In common with ministers and MPs, those in this group would receive no pay increase for this year, Mr Major said. The deferred second stage of the 1992 award of 2.9 per cent from April 1 would be honoured.</p>

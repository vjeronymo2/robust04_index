			<p>BFN     [Text] Denmark's defense forces chief, General (Jorgen  Maine), who visited (Pando) Post along the Line of Control [LOC]  in Azad Kashmir, was briefed on the situation in occupied  Kashmir and the increasing violations of the LOC by Indian  forces. He was accompanied by General Shamim Alam Khan,  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. The Danish  general was also apprised of the large-scale violation of human  rights at the hands of the Indian forces in occupied Kashmir.  He was told that infamous laws have been enforced in occupied  Kashmir, under which the Kashmiris have been deprived of their  basic rights. The Indian judiciary is not allowed to hear any  case relating to any crime committed by the Indian forces  against the Kashmiris. The Danish general was also informed  that India has deployed a large number of troops along the LOC  to prevent the helpless refugees from coming into Pakistan from  India. He was also told about the unprovoked violation of the  cease-fire, as a result of which civilians living along the LOC  are being killed.

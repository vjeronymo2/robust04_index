			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALER FOR NEWSPAPER RECYCLING  </P> <P> We're learning once again how important it is to recycle newspapers along with  glass, plastic and aluminum.  </P> <P> With every ton of newspapers that is recycled, more than a dozen trees are  saved! Here's a project that will make it easier for all of us to do our part,  an easy-to-build paper baler.  </P> <P> The baler holds about one month's accumulation of newspapers and is convenient  to use with a built-in string box as well as a covered razor blade to cut the  string or twine. Step-by-step directions and full-size traceable patterns make  this project simple enough for the amateur woodworker. Just trace the parts,  saw them out, and put them together!  </P></p>

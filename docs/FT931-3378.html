			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners raided by Cook THE BATTLE for control of Owners Abroad, the UK tour operator fighting a hostile Pounds 290m bid from its smaller rival, Airtours, took a new twist yesterday as Thomas Cook made an early raid in the market to capture an 8.4 per cent stake in Owners. The move by Thomas Cook, which is controlled by German travel group LTU, adds further spice to the bid battle which many in the market believe is now too close to call. The Airtours offer closes today at 1pm. Last week, Thomas Cook made a tender offer for 12.5 per cent of Owners at 150p a share conditional on the Airtours bid lapsing. Dealers suggested that Thomas Cook may have purchased its stake from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, paying 152 1/2 p a share for lines of 9m, 2.1m and 1.9m shares. However, leisure specialists said the fact that the institution was considered supportive of the present management meant that the dawn raid changed little in the complex arithmetic over who was likely to win. But there were also suggestions that Gartmore Investment Management had sold a 1.3 per cent share interest, part of its 7 per cent stake in Owners, to Thomas Cook. It was enough to unsettle some investors, worried that the German move implied a shift in favour of Owners' current shareholder supporters, who have so far been seen in the market as losing the public relations battle to Airtours. Owners closed 9 down at 138p after turnover of 28m. Airtours slipped a penny to 338p. Crucially, the Thomas Cook stake combined with the holdings of Owners' directors is now more than 10 per cent and will prevent Airtours from going over the 90 per cent required for full control, even if its offer succeeds today. It also sent analysts home speculating over Thomas Cook's strategy in the event of an Airtours victory, with some suggesting that it might attempt to buy some parts of Owners' operations.</p>

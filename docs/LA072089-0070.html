			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT UPHOLDS NEW BUS LINE'S RIGHT TO OPERATE  </P> <P> For the past year, backers of the fledgling Foothill Transit Zone have  contended with various legal and political roadblocks, including a trial over  whether it could even exist.  </P> <P> The hurdles have hampered the agency's plans to take over more than a third of  the San Gabriel Valley's bus service from the Southern California Rapid Transit  District.  </P> <P> But this week, Foothill Transit may have eluded its most serious threat when a  Los Angeles Superior Court judge upheld its right to operate, surmounting a  challenge by RTD drivers and mechanics.  </P> <P> "There is a tomorrow," said William P. Forsythe, Foothill Transit executive  vice president. The decision "is going to allow us to do what we set out to do  a long time ago -- provide a transit option for people out here instead of  driving a car."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow on Tuesday upheld Foothill  Transit's continued operation, which includes its plans to take over up to 20  of the RTD's 54 lines in the Foothill area by the middle of next year. Foothill  Transit, a partnership among 20 area cities and the county, contracts with  private bus companies to provide service.  </P> <P> "It's a clear victory for all the people of the San Gabriel Valley," said  Claremont Councilwoman Judy Wright, who is president of the transit zone and a  frequent critic of the RTD's San Gabriel Valley service. "I've been working on  this for 13 years . . . so I feel this is a culmination of that work."  </P> <P> During the monthlong trial that ended in June, union attorneys contended that  Foothill Transit threatened union jobs at RTD and was an illegal, "privatized"  competitor. Representatives of the United Transportation Union, which  represents drivers, and the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents  mechanics, charged that Foothill was an attempt to bust the unions. Foothill  officials deny that.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Chernow said much of the case was political and not under the  court's jurisdiction. He ruled that Foothill was legally created and that the  potential harm to the area's bus riders if Foothill were not allowed to take  over the lines outweighed the possible adverse impact on RTD workers.  </P> <P> Chernow's decision gives the unions 15 days to appeal. Neither union  representatives nor their attorneys could be reached about whether they will do  so.  </P> <P> "We will go forward and do whatever we have to do, and if an appeal is part of  it, then we'll be there," Wright said. "But I'm hoping that the decision is  strong enough to prevent that."  </P> <P> Foothill's vice president, Robert Bartlett, was more blunt: "When the decision  comes out so clearly one way or another, appeals tend not to look so bright."  </P> <P> Since December, Foothill has contracted with Embree Bus Lines to operate two  freeway express routes from Diamond Bar and Glendora to downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Foothill Transit's base fare is 85 cents, compared to the RTD's base fare of  $1.10. Forsythe has estimated that ridership has increased up to 20% on the  lines since Foothill took them over. There now are more than 2,660 riders on  the Foothill lines each day, he said.  </P> <P> Foothill plans to add five local lines in the mid-valley area in August,  bringing to seven the number of routes taken over from the RTD.  </P> <P> Forsythe said Foothill is negotiating with Cincinnati-based ATE Inc. to operate  the lines.  </P> <P> Foothill, having ordered 60 new buses, intends to take over two additional  express lines in late January from the Pomona Valley to Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Tunnelling change on Tube extension London Underground will revert to a more conventional tunnelling method at London Bridge on the Jubilee line extension rather than wait for the results of its investigation into the New Austrian Tunnelling Method. London Underground said its inquiry into the acceptability of the Austrian method would continue but sufficient tunnel segments were available from stock for traditional tunnelling work to restart at London Bridge. The decision to go ahead with the more conventional method means that further delays to construction work will be avoided.</p>

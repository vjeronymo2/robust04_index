			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: An Island on the Land By Carey McWilliams (Peregrine  Smith: $9.95). Southern California has been perceived as a place apart since it  was first explored by Europeans: Several attempts were made to divide  California along the line of the Tehachapis, and the U.S. Congress probably  would have approved the 1859 vote to partition the state if the Civil War  hadn't intervened.  </P> <P> Carey McWilliams' classic history traces the development of both the myth and  reality of the region. The popular image of Southern California has always  contained a large element of fantasy, beginning with the spurious picture of  the jolly life in the days of the Old Missions that ignored the wholesale  slaughter of the Indians. (In 1783, Governor Fages filed an official complaint  about Father Junipero Serra's cruelty to his new Christian converts.)  McWilliams devotes entertaining chapters to the cults, booms, busts and frauds  that brought people and water to the once desolate Southern California  chaparral. Although the text cries out for illustrations, McWilliams' book is  ideal reading for anyone interested in how L.A. got to be what it is. Charles  Solomon  </P></p>

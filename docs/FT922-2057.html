			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's predicts growth in German bonds THE NEED to raise funds for the development of eastern Germany is expected to lead to further growth in the German bond market, according to a report by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. However, this substantial public demand for financial funds may leave little room for an increase in domestic corporate bond issuance, adds the report. Moody's says public sector bonds currently account for 74 per cent of total domestic outstanding issues, and the proportion is likely to increase further as state budgets come under pressure over the next few years. As a result, there may be less scope for domestic corporate borrowers - many of whom have been encouraged by the recent lifting of regulations - to raise funds in the German market. Outstanding issues of D-Mark bonds amounted to about DM1,920bn at the end of 1991, with the domestic sector accounting for 87 per cent of the total outstanding amount, and making Germany the third largest bond market after the US and Japan. The US rating agency warns that factors such as regulation and the competitiveness of the other European bond markets could threaten the development of the D-Mark Eurobond market. In particular, Moody's points to possible changes in the taxation of interest income in Germany, and the recent emergence of the Ecu bond market. The Ecu bond market has recently taken a battering following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty, and is not expected to see much new issuance in the immediate future. However, Moody's report says the Ecu market 'could attract supranational and high-grade sovereign and corporate borrowers, some of which might reduce their DM Eurobond issuance levels. This could result in a lower average credit quality of outstanding DM Eurobonds.' *Moody's Special Report - The DM Bond Market: Structure, Credit Risk Profile and Perspectives.</p>

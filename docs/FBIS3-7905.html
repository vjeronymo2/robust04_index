He stressed that Poland has placed  Latvia and the other Baltic countries among top priorities of  the Polish eastern policy.    He disclosed that he and his Latvian counterpart Georgs  Andrejevs discussed the possibility of creating a promotion  centre for the three Baltic countries in Gdansk in the near  future. According to Olechowski, Polish-Latvian trade exchange  is insufficient at present, especially that Latvia has already  regulated its currency issues and there are no problems in  mutual payments.    Rear Admiral Romuald Waga, commander-in-chief of the Polish  Navy, told reporters that his talks with the defence minister of  Latvia focused on Polish technical assistance for Latvian Armed  Forces in organizing communications and trainings. He disclosed  that the sale of Polish arms to Latvia in exchange for the  overhaul of marine engines in Latvian shipyards is also being  considered. Reporters learned that Latvia was interested in the  purchase of naval guns.</p>

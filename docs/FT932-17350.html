			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Book Review: Voice of warning in Russia's power play THE STRUGGLE FOR RUSSIA Power and Change in the Democratic Revolution By Ruslan Khasbulatov, edited by Richard Sakwa Routledge, Pounds 19.99, 270 pages In the theatre of the absurd that passes for Russian politics these days, no actor cuts a figure as surreal or paradoxical as parliamentary speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. Stalwart defender of the constitutional order against totalitarian threats, or demagogic standard-bearer of the old communist guard? Dangerous reactionary bent on sabotaging reform and unseating the president, or pragmatic coalition-builder groping for a consensual way out of Russia's multiple crises? At various times during the session of the Congress of People's Deputies that ended in confusion on Monday, Khasbulatov was accused of playing all these roles. And while he emerged claiming victory over Yeltsin, this was only after the speaker had survived a serious attempt in Congress to dismiss him. This book - a mixture of personal memoir and political and economic musings put together over the past 18 months - is Khasbulatov's first attempt to explain himself to an English-speaking public. As such its publication could hardly be more timely. Stodgily written and sometimes less than clear, it does create a more rounded picture of the man than has hitherto been available. But it also serves to deepen the confusion surrounding the Moscow power struggle in which he has, for now at least, become a central player. Are he and the forces he claims to represent really the nub of President Yeltsin's political problem, to be wished away through a popular vote of confidence on April 25? Or are they likely to prove an essential part of any constitutional solution? The question has posed itself insistently in the 15 months since Khasbulatov's Congress started to challenge Yeltsin's government and its economic reforms. And it is one to which Yeltsin himself still appears unsure of the answer, even as he prepares to do open battle with parliament for public support. What does emerge clearly enough from these pages is that the image of Khasbulatov which Yeltsin and his supporters have painted in their more headstrong moments is a caricature. The parliament speaker may be a political opportunist but he is not exactly a Stalinist of the old school, yearning for restoration of the centralised Soviet state and actively plotting with other members of the nomenklatura to achieve it. True, he is a product of the communist career ladder: from his birth as an ethnic Chechen in the town of Grozny and his childhood in forced exile in Kazakhstan, making his way up through the Komsomol youth organisation and into academe before being elected - a communist like 80 per cent of his peers - a people's deputy in Russia's almost-democratic parliament in March 1990. But then Yeltsin himself occupied numerous powerful party positions before setting out on his own political trajectory. Indeed, for more than a year Yeltsin and Khasbulatov were comrades in arms. They served together as parliament speaker and deputy speaker respectively from May 1990. They both pushed the cause of economic reform as Gorbachev's central government vacillated with its 500-day plan and then drifted to the right. Most important, after Yeltsin had been elected Russian president and Khasbulatov had taken over as speaker, they both manned the barricades and drafted the decrees at Moscow's White House during the August 1991 coup - a lively if somewhat sketchy account of which forms the central section of this volume. Such close collaboration between the two men in the past makes their more recent falling-out seem especially bitter. Khasbulatov does not dwell on the personal aspect of their current struggle, but some of his asides betray pique at the fact that the solidarity they displayed during the coup did not long survive it. 'Unfortunately, we placed too much faith immediately after the suppression of the coup on the president and his team,' he writes ruefully. Behind his animus towards those he calls Yeltsin's 'latter-day courtiers', however, lies a multitude of real differences on subjects ranging from the pace of economic reform to the structure of government and the devolution of powers from the centre to Russia's regions. Khasbulatov, a lawyer and economics professor, presents at least a plausible diagnosis of Russia's problems. In the political as well as the economic sphere, he argues, the collapse of the old system means the executive has lost the capacity to govern. 'The pyramid of power controlled by the state party was a terrible thing,' he writes without obvious nostalgia. 'But one way or another it managed to govern. Having broken the hundred thousand or so links of this mechanism's chain, from the Central Committee to the district committee, from the factory to the collective farm, what did we put in its place?' For Khasbulatov, that question - what to put in its place - defines the battle for Russia's future. Yeltsin's reformers want to break the chain further, privatise faster, accelerate the disposal of state mono-liths to the point where a restoration of central control becomes inconceivable. The speaker would reply that this way chaos lies - the government cannot hope to impose reform without the co-operation of Russia's real centres of economic power such as state industry. That means seeking to involve the parliament, which represents such interests, not bypassing it - and creating a system of government with a proper separation and devolution of powers. Is Russia to have reform by diktat or reform by consent? More to the point, can either succeed while such fundamental political issues are in dispute? The dilemmas have been too frequently oversimplified of late as western governments have leapt unhesitatingly to Yeltsin's side. Khasbulatov's book is a useful, and pretty depressing, counterblast.</p>

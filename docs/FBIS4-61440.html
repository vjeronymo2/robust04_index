			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko for </F> TASS]    [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS -- We have entered another, more  positive stage of our cooperation, according to Nicholas Burns,  senior director of the U.S. National Security Council and an  adviser to President Bill Clinton.    Burns heads a U.S. economic delegation, which arrived in  Kiev  a few days ago for talks with Ukrainian officials on how to  apply $350 million in aid.    On Thursday, Burns met Ukrainian Parliament Chairman Ivan  Plyushch. The speaker informed the American guest about the  current situation in the former Soviet Republic. He described  the visit by such a representative delegation as another step  towards further development of mutually beneficial partnership  between the two countries. The United States can contribute  considerably to solution of problems currently facing Ukraine,  Plyushch stressed.    Burns said the present visit had been mostly focused on  exchange of opinions about economic cooperation between the  United States and Ukraine. This issue was tackled during  meetings with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and government  ministers.    According to the U.S. official, President Clinton believes  the two countries entered a new stage of bilateral relations.  The previous stage concentrated on dismantling of Ukraine's  nuclear weapons inherited from the former Soviet Union. At  present, the emphasis is laid on closer and more extensive  economic ties. "To the United States, Ukraine is seen as one of  the most important countries in Europe," Burns said.    He insisted the former Soviet republic speed up economic  reform if it wanted more aid in future. "The Ukrainian  Government and parliament and the society at large want to  achieve economic reform. But we believe the progress has  Gorbachev to go further. Much greater progress has to be made,"  Burns told a news conference.    The U.S. delegation head called on ministers to move more  quickly in implementing an ambitious privatization programme and  creating a better climate for trade.    "The United States would like to lead an international  effort  to provide help to Ukraine with its economic reform programme,"  he pointed out. The combined sum pledged by the U.S. to the  newly-independent state puts Ukraine behind only Israel, Egypt,  and Russia in terms of U.S. foreign aid.    Among other projects, the United States will print  privatization certificates to be issued to all Ukrainian  citizens in July and set up an enterprise fund to give loans to  small businesses.</p>

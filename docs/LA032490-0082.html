			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ESPERANZA SHOWS SIGNS OF RECOVERY  </P> <P> No one is ready to say that the Esperanza High School baseball program has  returned to glory. Not yet anyway.  </P> <P> But judging by Friday's performance, there are a few Empire League coaches who  might be concerned that the Aztecs are indeed back.  </P> <P> Esperanza defeated Loara, 12-1, behind a 15-hit attack at Loara.  </P> <P> "We're getting better every week," Esperanza Coach Mike Curran said. "But I  don't think you can compare us to the great teams we've had in the past."  </P> <P> Still, it's better than a year ago.  </P> <P> The Aztecs made three consecutive appearances in the Southern Section  championship game. They won the title in 1986 and finished second the following  two years.  </P> <P> But Esperanza slipped last season and kept slipping.  </P> <P> "I've blotted last season from my mind," Curran said.  </P> <P> The Aztecs finished 10-11-1 last season, 4-10-1 in league play. That was good  for fifth place, the team's worst showing under Curran.  </P> <P> But those days may be behind Esperanza, which returned three starters from the  1989 team. The Aztecs are 7-2, 3-0 in league play and tied for first with Los  Alamitos.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can judge anything by three games," Curran said. "But we  seem to be executing a lot better this season. We're doing the little things,  like moving runners over and hitting behind runners. We have some concerns  about the pitching, but today, we put everything together -- the hitting and  pitching."  </P> <P> The Saxons (2-8, 1-2) can testify to that.  </P> <P> Of course, Loara didn't help itself with five errors and four wild pitches.  However, Esperanza really didn't need the help.  </P> <P> Danny Redington led Esperanza with four hits. The Aztecs had four extra-base  hits, including a grand slam by Greg Hauser -- the No. 9 batter in the order.  </P> <P> The score was tied, 1-1, after two innings, but Esperanza scored two in the  third and two in the fourth. Redington singled and scored in the third, then  doubled home a run in the fourth.  </P> <P> Hauser had the big hit in a five-run fifth, driving a 2-2 pitch over the  354-foot sign in left-center field.  </P> <P> "This was by far our best showing offensively this season," Curran said. "We  seemed to get a hit every time we needed it."  </P> <P> Shade Summers (4-0) allowed six hits, three of which came in the second inning  when the Griffins scored their only run.  </P> <P> Redington went the final two innings, striking out three.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Katella 11, Cypress 8 -- Danny Allen had a grand slam and a double to lead  Katella (2-1, 7-3) at Cypress. Kevin Smith had three hits, including two  doubles, for Cypress (0-3, 1-9).  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 10, El Dorado 6 -- Anthony Napolitano had three hits, including a  triple and a double, and had three RBIs to lead Los Alamitos (4-5-1, 3-0) at  home.  </P></p>

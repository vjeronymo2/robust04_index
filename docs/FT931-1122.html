			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Potential corridor of power - Plans to redevelop land east of London 'The East Thames Corridor holds the prospect of a superb bridgehead into European markets. This . . . will revitalise large areas of east London and create major new development opportunities throughout the corridor. This was the optimistic forecast made by Mr Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, when launching a task force on Wednesday to draw up a planning framework for the East Thames Corridor, a 30-mile corridor stretching both sides of the Thames from Docklands to Tilbury and Sheerness. But behind the rhetoric, the government's proposals smacked of pragmatism, not vision. Far from imposing a new linear city or any other design blueprint on the corridor, the government did not put forward any concrete proposals. The talk was all of frameworks, strategy, flexibility, resolving conflicting aspirations, co-ordinated approaches and consultation. The modest expectations the government raised this week were in sharp contrast with those of 16 months ago when it commissioned a report into the corridor. At the time, Professor Peter Hall, the government's adviser, described the corridor's commercial potential as 'mindboggling'. Prof Hall described the scheme as potentially the biggest urban development scheme in British history. 'The impact could be truly historic: London's westward drift, which began four centuries ago, could be reversed,' he said. The reason for the dilution of these extravagant expectations were laid bare by a report by planning consultants Llewelyn Davies, which the government published on Wednesday. The report acknowledged the opportunity presented by the area. 'Today a large supply of development land and a newly-found locational advantage as the UK's gateway to Europe presents an opportunity for the East Thames Corridor to develop a new and very different role.' If the area were to enjoy high growth, there would be potential for 182,000 jobs and 128,000 houses by 2015, said the consultants' report. Under this projection there would be spectacular growth at Dartford based around a new international station, with high value, high density development also at the other main corridor sites. But the report summed up the obstacles thus: 'The East Thames Corridor is the place where London generates it power and dumps its rubbish. It has an environment to match.' It spelled out the psychological and environmental barriers to high-grade redevelopment of the area. Despite many places of natural beauty and historic interest, the area is scarred by smoke-stacks, pylons, power stations, industrial structures, stacks of containers, scrap-yards, hauliers' yards and lorry parks. Nearly a fifth of the land is contaminated. 'The enduring image is of an area whose environment has been ravaged by years of industrial use,' said the consultants. If the full potential of the East Thames Corridor were to be realised, it would have to break out of this self-perpetuating cycle of environmental decline. The corridor would have to adopt the same standards as the rest of London in burying power lines, landscaping roads and generally tidying up industrial sites. 'It is expensive but it is considered an appropriate price to pay for an acceptable quality of environment,' said the consultants. But the costs of upgrading the corridor's environment sufficiently to attract high levels of investment and growth are large. As well as decontamination work costing Pounds 200m-Pounds 385m, about Pounds 120m-Pounds 150m would need to be spent on environmental works and Pounds 40m-120m for rerouting power lines over 25 years. Another Pounds 970m for roads and Pounds 300m on rail would be called for, in addition to more than Pounds 4bn of road and rail improvements that are already earmarked for the region. But large amounts of new investment are not on the cards, according to the consultants. 'At this stage . . . it would be unrealistic to adopt a development strategy which is dependent on high volumes of additional private and public investment,' it said, citing the existing glut of office and business space. 'The government's preferred approach . . . is to cater for a moderate level of growth in the corridor. The market is likely to focus on the area's strengths, in particular its potential for waterside property and housing and the provision of large business sites close to London,' said the report. Those cherishing the grand vision of a linear city along the Thames would be disappointed by the tentative nature of the proposals unveiled this week. However, planners and local authorities were welcoming. In particular, they applauded the consultation, co-ordination, the planning framework and the integration of transport with land use, which were so badly lacking in the redevelopment of the Docklands. Yet without extra funds, good intentions are unlikely to be enough. The attention that has recently been focused on the East Thames Corridor illustrates the potential - and the enormity - of the task in realising it.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD REJECTS BAN ON ANIMAL SALES  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday rejected a motion that would have  prohibited the county Department of Animal Care and Control from selling  animals picked up in Altadena to researchers.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who recommended the ban, was not able to get a  second for his motion.  </P> <P> The 14-member town council of unincorporated Altadena, which is in Antonovich's  district, had unanimously approved a resolution supporting the ban March 21.  </P> <P> "It's like being hit with a lead balloon," Altadena resident Rita Bernier said  of the defeat. Bernier, a former volunteer at the county's Baldwin Park animal  shelter, had originally brought the issue to the town council.  </P> <P> Antonovich's press deputy Dawson Oppenheimer said the supervisor was  disappointed but not surprised because the board has rejected similar measures  in the past.  </P> <P> "I don't intend to give up," Bernier said, adding that she was considering  asking the town council, which has no jurisdiction over the animal control  operation, to continue to press the Board of Supervisors for a ban. She said it  was cruel to use animals for experiments and that researchers should use tissue  cultures or computer models instead.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Bernier persuaded the City Council of Bradbury, which is  served by the Baldwin Park shelter, to adopt a similar resolution.  </P> <P> Seventeen of the 35 cities that contract with the county for animal shelter  services have approved similar "pet-protection" measures within the past four  years, said Bruce Richards, assistant director of the county animal control  department.  </P> <P> Department employees check a computer after animals are brought in to determine  whether they were picked up in cities covered by a "pet-protection" resolution,  he said. Those animals are not sold for research.  </P> <P> "We hold animals for seven full days," during which time the animals can be  claimed by their owners or adopted, he said. After seven days, the animals not  sold for research are put to death.  </P> <P> Of the 95,000 animals the department takes in each year, 20,000 are adopted and  800 are sold to research centers such as the USC Medical School or the  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, he said. Department figures for 1987-88 show that  6,764 pets were claimed by their owners.  </P></p>

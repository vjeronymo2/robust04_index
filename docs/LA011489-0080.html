			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULL SPEED AHEAD;  </P> <P> EVEN WITHOUT KIMBLE, GATHERS STEPS UP FOR LOYOLA  </P> <P> Around Loyola Marymount University, they call Hank Gathers, "The Bank." The  reason is obvious. When a big basket is needed, Gathers has been like, well,  money in the bank.  </P> <P> It has been that way for the last 2 seasons, since Hank the Bank put his stock  in Coach Paul Westhead's running system. The investment has paid off handsomely  for both, Loyola setting scoring records on a slew of Bank shots.  </P> <P> This season, Gathers' game has risen to such a spectacular level, almost 35  points a game, that interest in the Bank is going up fast, which is the way  Gathers and Loyola like to score. Gathers will get his next opportunity this  morning, when the Lions (8-5) play DePaul (9-7) in a nationally televised game  at Rosemont Horizon.  </P> <P> "Coach Westhead says you can't be in the system at 95%. You've got to be in it  at 100%," Gathers said before a recent practice. "The wide-open system gives me  an opportunity to show what I can do. It also exposes what you can't do. You've  got to be fundamental.  </P> <P> "I think that's one reason our young guys are having trouble. Right now, our  young guys haven't totally bought into the system. They don't believe you can  go that extra 5 minutes at full speed. Once we break them in, they buy in.  </P> <P> "I've bought in."  </P> <P> Loyola teams have long had players who could score. Gathers follows in the  footsteps of Greg Goorjian, Forrest McKenzie, Keith Smith and Mike Yoest, all  of whom led the West Coast Athletic Conference in scoring this decade. But  Westhead has turned up the pace several notches, and Gathers may be the perfect  player for his system.  </P> <P> At 6 feet 7 inches, Gathers has to play the post as the Lions' best big man and  start the fast break with his rebounding. As the team's only real inside  scorer, he is also expected to finish off the break.  </P> <P> Blessed with a combination of strength, quickness, jumping ability and speed,  the seemingly tireless Gathers more often than not accomplishes that. After a  redshirt year, Gathers joined the lineup last season and finished second in the  conference in scoring, with an average of 22.5 points a game, and rebounding,  with 8.7 a game.  </P> <P> But that was just the beginning. If he remains at his current rate of  production -- 34.9 points and 15.1 rebounds a game -- Gathers will lead the  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I in both categories, joining  Xavier McDaniel, now a pro star, as the only players to have done so.  </P> <P> Moreover, Gathers is producing at a high level of consistency. His low game  this season is 27 points, and he has taken down fewer than 10 rebounds only  once. He has scored more than 30 points in 9 of 11 games, with a high of 49  against Nevada Reno, tying the school record. He has had rebounding totals of  26 and 23 and is shooting 64% from the floor.  </P> <P> "He has evolved as a very confident offensive player," Westhead said. "At this  moment, he's very difficult to stop.  </P> <P> "Now he has demonstrated he can do something that will be hard to take away. I  don't think the evolution is completed. I don't think he's nearly topped out."  </P> <P> For all of his physical skills, Gathers' main attribute may be his intense  desire on the court. His attitude goes well beyond blue-collar, closer to a  warrior, last-one-standing attitude.  </P> <P> "My first impressions were, he was very competitive and hard-working," Westhead  said. "If there are 100 possessions, he wants to be in on all 100. That  approach is what's gotten him where he is (while) he's been expanding his  offensive skills."  </P> <P> Gathers' game combines hard work, physical gifts and several years of honing a  short- to medium-range jump shot and one-on-one skills learned on the  playgrounds of his native Philadelphia.  </P> <P> As for motivation this season, Gathers has plenty.  </P> <P> He still is upset about the USC episode that resulted in George Raveling asking  him, Bo Kimble and Tom Lewis to leave USC.  </P> <P> Plus, John Thompson didn't invite Gathers to the Olympic trials.  </P> <P> And, North Carolina blew the Lions out of last year's NCAA tournament, and  Gathers felt he had a poor game against the Tar Heels, even though he scored 19  points.  </P> <P> Not being invited to the Olympic trials particularly irked Gathers, since his  good friend, UCLA guard Pooh Richardson, had been.  </P> <P> "Coach (Westhead) said, 'That shows they don't respect you. Show 'em this  year,' " Gathers said. "I'm showing 'em."  </P> <P> Another factor motivating the junior was that this would be his senior season  if he had stayed at USC. So he felt it was time to show he was physically ready  to play as well as the nation's top seniors.  </P> <P> "If I was at USC, I'd be shooting for the NBA," he said. "So I wanted to be  ready, see if I was prepared. Thus far, the answer is yes."  </P> <P> David Spencer, the assistant coach who recruited Gathers for USC, remains close  to him, even though Spencer is now on the coaching staff at Hawaii.  </P> <P> "I've always been able to motivate (Gathers)," Spencer said. "Hank scored a lot  last year, but he didn't rebound that well. I said, 'If you lead the nation in  rebounding the next 2 years, that's where you'll make your money. The pros will  be impressed.' "  </P> <P> Gathers lists leading the country in rebounding as his chief goal.  </P> <P> This was supposed to be another season of the long-running "Hank and Bo Show."  Gathers and Kimble have been on the same court together from the time they made  the Philadelphia Dobbins Tech junior varsity in ninth grade.  </P> <P> Kimble, a rainbow-shooting big guard who makes the game look effortless, was  the star. Gathers was raw, just learning. He remembers the first time he was  aware of Kimble, on a playground the summer after eighth grade. Kimble, fooling  around by himself, was dunking. Gathers was in awe.  </P> <P> Together they led Dobbins to 2 Philadelphia City titles -- they lost the title  in their junior year to Pooh Richardson's Ben Franklin High team. Together they  came to Los Angeles ready to put Stan Morrison on top of the Pacific 10  Conference. Together they were dismissed from USC by Raveling, the new coach,  at the end of their freshman year, and together they ended up helping put  Loyola on the map last season, leading the Lions to a 28-4 record, the best in  school history, and an NCAA tournament appearance.  </P> <P> But Kimble, a 6-5 junior who averaged 22 points last season, began suffering  recurring knee discomfort before this season opened, hobbled through a few  early games and had arthroscopic surgery in late December. He's not expected  back much before early February.  </P> <P> And Kimble's absence has probably speeded Gathers' emergence.  </P> <P> "In a way, me being out has raised him to this level," Kimble said. "He has to  play for Hank and Bo. There's nobody he relies on out there like we rely on  each other."  </P> <P> Said Gathers: "It gets tough down the stretch (without Kimble). We're used to  looking for each other. (His absence) makes me feel just a little  uncomfortable."  </P> <P> Kimble concurred: "We're used to fallin' (back) on each other in the last  minute of the game. Every place we've played together, one of us would (take  over). Without me in there, now it's like every shot he takes is the hardest  basket of his life.  </P> <P> "He's kind of in a groove. He's programmed himself. The funny thing is, if I  was playing he'd still be scoring, but he wouldn't be leading the country. I've  never seen Hank play like he's playing this year. Right now he's in a class by  himself. And I've seen where he's come from."  </P> <P> Gathers and Kimble grew up in the projects of North Philadelphia. They shaped  their games in Philadelphia's Sonny Hill summer leagues. Kimble idolized  Philadelphia 76ers star Julius Erving. Gathers, a boxing fan who grew up across  from the gym that spawned Joe Frazier, learned to shake and bake and break down  his opponent.  </P> <P> Spencer, also from the Philadelphia area, targeted them for recruiting.  </P> <P> "They had a great team," he said. "They just dominated the Philadelphia  schools. Had we stayed at SC, I had hopes of having all four (blue-chip  players) from their high school team. Hank committed first, then he helped me  recruit Bo."  </P> <P> Spencer added: "They came out of such a tough neighborhood. It's amazing what  they came out of. Their world has exploded by getting out of Philly."  </P> <P> As freshmen, they joined Lewis and Rich Grande as part of Morrison's  outstanding Four Freshmen class. Kimble started 18 games and averaged 12  points. Gathers started 12 times and averaged 8 points.  </P> <P> Gathers liked it at USC.  </P> <P> But after the season, USC eased out Morrison. The Four Freshmen demanded a  voice in hiring a new coach and threatened to transfer en masse to another  school if they did not approve of the choice.  </P> <P> When Raveling was hired, he set a deadline for the freshmen to decide if they  wanted to stay at USC. Only Grande told the coach he wanted to stay.  </P> <P> Kimble decided to leave. Gathers wanted to stay, and tried to talk Kimble out  of leaving.  </P> <P> But the deadline has passed and they weren't granted an extension.  </P> <P> And as they were debating, they -- and Lewis -- got letters from Raveling,  telling them their scholarships would not be renewed.  </P> <P> "I thought we could have been a very good team," Gathers said. "I felt I'd play  under Raveling. The word was he wanted to bring in some of his own players. I  figured I'd move somebody out. I told Bo, 'Somebody's gonna have to sit 'cause  I'm not sitting.'  </P> <P> "Then I received the letter in the training room. I was kind of hurt. I laughed  it off, but Bo had that look on his face like, 'I told you so.' "  </P> <P> There is speculation that Raveling was leery of keeping Gathers and Kimble  because of possible NCAA violations involving them. The Pacific 10 last month  reprimanded USC because two players -- unnamed, but thought to be Gathers and  Kimble -- received airplane tickets and long-distance phone calls from a  booster during the 1985-86 season, without the knowledge of Morrison or his  staff.  </P> <P> Both Gathers and Kimble say they got airline tickets to return to Philadelphia  over Christmas vacation, but that they later paid for the tickets. The school  received no sanctions.  </P> <P> At any rate, when Gathers and Kimble looked around for a new school, Westhead's  Philadelphia connections kicked in. Westhead grew up there, played at St.  Joseph's and coached at LaSalle. A Philly friend suggested that Gathers and  Kimble check out Loyola, where Westhead had just completed his first season.  </P> <P> Gathers and Kimble joined UCLA transfer Corey Gaines. In their redshirt year,  they regularly pounded the starting five.  </P> <P> Gathers was a bit taken aback by the difference in facilities, but he liked the  idea of building a new tradition at Loyola.  </P> <P> "At SC, we had one of the best weight rooms in the nation . . . like you were  working out in luxury," he said. "It was so nice in there it didn't look like  you should work out in there. Here (Loyola) we had a hell hole. I thought maybe  it would motivate me."  </P> <P> (Loyola has since installed new weight machines for its athletic program.)  </P> <P> By midseason last year, the Lions were leading the country in scoring, filling  up 4,150-seat Gersten Pavilion, and the players -- with Gathers as one of the  vocal and emotional linchpins -- were feeling like pioneers.  </P> <P> He said it was the intention of him and Kimble to turn the school into a  college basketball powerhouse.  </P> <P> "Our record in that is pretty good," Gathers said. "Our high school hadn't won  a championship in 39 years. It felt real good to have a sellout crowd here. It  was no fun to draw 3,000 people at the Sports Arena (with USC). Coming over  here, things just worked out. I guess it was God's will. I've got to look back  and say, 'God, I'm glad I got out of there.' For my basketball career, this was  my best move."  </P> <P> The players found themselves welcomed on campus, though Gathers said that for  the first year, "It was 'Hank and Bo, the two guys from SC.' You rarely hear  that anymore."  </P> <P> As last season progressed, Gathers and Kimble were in often in demand by  reporters, who found them to be charming and colorful interviews -- a line the  outgoing Gathers hopes to develop someday as a sports commentator.  </P> <P> If Gathers' numbers remain so lofty through conference play, he may start  getting attention from the pro scouts. For now, he says he hasn't considered  leaving early, and both he and Westhead say there are still some tricks to be  learned.  </P> <P> Said Westhead: "For us, his task is a difficult one. For all his scoring, we  still need a hard-working, running, rebounding, defensive player, and he's been  doing this. I think the future of Hank is, he'll become a much more poised  player, which we're already seeing. Then he'll become really lethal."  </P> <P> Westhead is banking on it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO  </P> <P> San Diego police are investigating the slaying Monday night of an unidentified  youth in San Ysidro.  </P> <P> The body of a male Latino was found along the southern levee of a flood-control  channel along the Tijuana River, said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San  Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> He said U. S. Border Patrol officers heard a gunshot about 11:15 p.m. and found  the young man at the levee.  </P> <P> Homicide division Sgt. Frank Martinez said police believe the youth was about  15 or 16 years old. He had no identification on him.  </P> <P> "We believe he is from the other side," Martinez said, adding, "We have nothing  on him. We have nowhere to go unless somebody comes forward and identifies  him."  </P> <P> Police will take fingerprints in an attempt to identify the victim, Martinez  said. The youth was wearing tennis shoes, blue jeans, a dark jacket and a  light-colored shirt, he said. Deputy Coroner Jack Larkie said the boy was  5-foot-5 and weighed 108 pounds.  </P> <P> Martinez said the youth was shot once in the head and was found about 150 feet  north of the border.  </P> <P> Robinson said the area is the site of "almost weekly reports of assaults and  robberies . . . committed against people who have just crossed the border  illegally."  </P></p>

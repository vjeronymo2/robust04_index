The Food Agency earlier this  week ordered rice sellers to mix domestically and foreign-grown  rice for retail sale, to avoid any hoarding of domestic rice.    The agency originally set the supply proportions for  domestic, Thai, and U.S. and Chinese rice at 30 percent, 20  percent, and 50 percent, respectively. But the delay in imports  of Chinese rice so far has forced the agency to change the  proportions to 50 percent, 25 percent and 25 percent,  respectively.    Blended rice will likely be put on the market as early as  next week despite much opposition from consumers and rice  sellers. Some rice wholesalers said they will sell a set of  foreign and domestic rice instead of blended rice, a choice the  agency has tolerated.    A Tokyo-based wholesaler said, "consumers desire a  domestic-foreign rice set, not blended rice. I think the  proportion of Thai rice in the rice set will be approximately  the same as that of blended rice."</p>

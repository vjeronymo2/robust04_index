			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Major's magic moments Everything seems to be going right for Mr John Major. The prime minister should not be begrudged his magic moments. He has earned them. Indeed, they may last longer than the fates usually allow, for since his return to Downing Street on April 10 he has performed with the confident touch of a man whose hold on his job has at last been legitimised. Just over four weeks ago he led the Conservatives to their fourth general election victory in a row. The fact that this was unexpected made the achievement seem all the more remarkable. Yet there was none of the triumphalism of June 1987 in last week's Queen's Speech, or in the prime minister's presentation of it in the commons. With Mrs Margaret Thatcher in charge, a majority of 100-plus, and the opposition in disarray, the Tories of 1987-88 strutted about as if they were politically immortal; with Mr Major in charge, a majority down to 21, and the opposition in apparently worse shape than ever, the Conservatives of May 1992 are conducting themselves with moderation and courtesy. It would be uncharitable, and incorrect, to ascribe the government's restrained demeanour entirely to the narrowness of its majority, or even to the nasty premonitions of defeat that afflicted most of them during the campaign. The matter-of-fact personality and emollient style of the prime minister have also had something to do with it. If the Tories go on like this they will end up more popular than they were during the Thatcher years. The apparent rush of support for Conservatives in last week's local elections is partly the consequence of Labour's demoralisation, but its significance should not be discounted. After 13 years of continuous rule what seems like an entirely new government has emerged. The prime minister's political stature has been enhanced, not only in its own right, but also when set against the diminishing public images of the German chancellor and the presidents of France and the US. The Conservatives are benefiting most of all from a perception that the British economy is in better shape than those of its continental competitors. People are beginning to get carried away on a wave of exaggerated optimism. Some indicators suggest that the recession has bottomed out, others that we have to wait. This is beside the point. Recovery may be slow but there can be no doubt that it is on the way. We are all bulls now - all, that is, except the unemployed, sellers of houses, and retailers waiting for consumers to get the message. The mood in the City has been transformed. The stock market has advanced to record highs. Sterling is strong, and rising, in spite of a cut in bank base rates by half a point to the lowest level for four years. Now the talk is of British interest rates falling below Germany's, a notion that could not be seriously entertained before polling day. There are many technical explanations for this turnaround, but the simplest is the most compelling: the markets are showing confidence in Mr Major's government. Democrats may not savour the prospect of decades of one-party rule; markets are more sanguine. The opposition is in abeyance. It is easy to sustain the fancy that it may not return to power this century. Mr Major acknowledges that mistakes were made during the recent campaign, but he has vowed that they will not be repeated. His appointment of Sir Norman Fowler to rebuild the Conservative party is one means to that end. Mr Fowler is a smooth operator. Given four years in which to do the job his administrative overhaul could make the difference in a score or more of marginals. The work of the constit-uency boundary commission, generally thought to be worth between 15 and 20 extra seats to the Tories, will have been completed before there is a chance to vote again. In these circumstances the size of the task facing both Labour and the Liberal Democrats is greater than perhaps either party has yet realised. Mr Paddy Ashdown's weekend call for a working relationship between the Lib-Dems and Labour, 'to assemble the ideas around which a non-socialist alternative to the Conservatives can be constructed' reaches to the nub of the matter. Yet even when, as they surely must, both sides prove willing to talk that will be only the beginning. The ideas they assemble must have relevance to the needs of the future, not the past. Old Labour-Liberal rivalries must be set aside. To be certain of an election victory the two parties must unite, or one must swallow the other. Neither is yet ready to allow either cataclysm to take place. This leaves Mr Major facing the only hostile opposition he needs to fear: the devastating force of unforeseen events. We cannot know when this monster will show itself, or what form it will take. We can, however, be sure that it will come. Events always overthrow governments in the end. For Mr Major that experience may lie many years in the future.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Minister tells SIB to 'inject fear' MR ANTHONY Nelson, econ-omic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday advised the Securities and Investments Board, to 'conduct their activities in a way to inject a little more fear into the system'. Mr Nelson, the minister responsible for overseeing financial services regulation, also said SIB should take over the duties of self-regulatory organisations in the financial services industry which do not supervise their members adequately. He made his remarks under questioning by members of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee. 'The SROs are responsible for authorising, supervising and fining their members,' he said. 'When the SIB feels an SRO is unable to do that it must take those duties on itself.' Mr Nelson added that SIB had to take a more aggressive approach with the self-regulatory bodies. The threat that SIB would directly assume regulation of retail financial services was implied recently in a letter sent by its chairman Mr Andrew Large to members of a committee drafting rules for the proposed self-regulatory organisation to be known as the Personal Investment Authority. Mr Large said that if the planned organisation failed to improve investor protection and raise standards for members it would not be allowed to operate. Mr Nelson, questioned by MPs about the letter, declined to be drawn on whether he supported its message. He said, however: 'The SIB is right and entitled to seek to define for the guidance of the board the minimum principles of compliance that they would like to see . . . The PIA cannot just be what it wants to be.' Mr Nelson has ordered Mr Large to conduct a review of the way self-regulatory organisations are supervised and to make recommendations designed to improve investor protection. He told MPs he believed it would not be necessary to rewrite the Financial Services Act to achieve better investor protection. Standards could be raised if SIB simply exercised all of its existing powers.</p>

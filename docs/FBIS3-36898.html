			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Giorgiy Chanturiya, leader of the </F> National-Democratic Party, by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent  Beso Tskhoragueli; place and date not given: "The View of the  National-Democrats"]    [Text] Giorgiy Chanturiya, leader of the  National-Democratic Party, delivered a statement on the  necessity of launching a partisan war in Abkhazia. Our  correspondent asked him to comment further on this.    [Chanturiya] We have lost the war. This is a fact.  Moreover, Georgia is not in a position today to wage a  full-scale war. We will be ready to do this only when we have a  full-fledged state and, as a consequence of this, a real  battleworthy army. The only thing that we can really do is to  wage a partisan war. We should not allow our enemies to relax  for a minute. Otherwise, in a year or two, we will be faced  with new realities with which we will have to come to terms and  then Abkhazia will also be lost from the legal point of view.    [Tskhoragueli] What about the peace talks, the peacekeeping  forces, the return of the refugees...?    [Chanturiya] I am not against peace talks so long as they  enable us to win time.    As for peacekeeping forces, this is a tall story with which  they are trying to console us. There will be no UN troops  there. The role of peacekeepers will be fulfilled by the same  forces that were there before.    Only those people who agree to register themselves as  Abkhazians can return to Abkhazia today.... If we want to lose  Abkhazia forever and accelerate the process of the Abkhazation  of Georgians and, finally, legalize the results of the war, we  should agree to the introduction of Russian troops into  Abkhazia. If not, I once more repeat that the only way out,  proceeding from current realities, is a partisan war.    [Tskhoragueli] You spoke of antigovernment actions that are  being prepared. Do you have grounds for making such a statement  or is this just supposition?    [Chanturiya] The new government is repeating many of the  mistakes that Gamsakhurdia made. The mass media has again been  monopolized.    The population is on the brink of a social explosion and  there already exist specific forces that are ready to take  advantage of this. Our party is opposed to any kind of  confrontations since this would be the final blow for Georgia.  However, events are developing precisely in this direction.  "Dark" forces are just waiting for the right climatic  conditions.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY RULE OUT A PLEA BARGAIN?;  </P> <P>  BE SMART, NOT VINDICTIVE, WITH EXXON: FEDS COULD LOSE  </P> <P> Just what will it take to compensate Alaska for all that crude oil that fouled  the state's pristine shoreline last March? What punishment of Exxon is  appropriate for the Exxon Valdez spill? And what, if anything, can repair the  damage to the Alaskan psyche and the wrenching of Alaskan social cohesion?  </P> <P> Some of these questions presumably will be answered in the trial of a  five-count criminal indictment returned against Exxon after the U.S. Justice  Department gave up attempts to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. There was  considerable criticism of the Justice Department for seeming to rush to an  agreement that was acceptable to Exxon but not to Alaska.  </P> <P> A plea bargain should not be ruled out, though, just because the case has now  moved into the courtroom. This will be a tough one for the government to win.  Even if it prevails, there is no assurance that Exxon will be fined as much as  the firm was willing to settle for without a trial. But if negotiations are  reopened, the key element is to bring the state of Alaska to the table as a  full partner. The crude oil may have spilled in federal waters, but the real  damage was sustained by Alaskans and Alaskan natural resources.  </P> <P> Not to be overlooked are the social and economic consequences of the spill.  Much has been made of the estimated $2 billion Exxon spent with such elan on  the cleanup. A boon to the economy, some said. But another view is that Exxon  showered southern Alaska with money partly to offset the public- relations  beating the firm was taking. And this windfall of currency -- workers bolted  their $5-an-hour local jobs to get $16 from Exxon -- caused severe disruption  of the economy and even the social fabric. Bitterness, reminiscent of the  raucous pipeline-construction days in the 1970s, erupted between those who took  Exxon money and those who refused; those who were, or became, "pro-oil" and  those who were "anti-oil."  </P> <P> Back in the '70s, Alaskans yielded to oil-industry soothings and their own  greed in discounting the warnings of danger, Terry Carr, an Anchorage Daily  News editorial writer, recalled recently in Newsweek. "Alaskans rationalized  that we could have the best of both worlds: the incredible riches the oil  wrought and the incredible beauty of the land," he said.  </P> <P> The bubble burst and now the penalty must be exacted from Exxon. It should be  fair, not vindictive. But it also must be done in such a way that Alaskans feel  that they retain some control over their own destiny.  </P></p>

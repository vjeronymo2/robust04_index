			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADA ARMY TOLD TO CLEAR MOHAWK BARRICADES AT OKA  </P> <P> Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa revived his order Thursday night to have the  Canadian army clear the Mohawk barricades at the town of Oka after last-ditch  talks aimed at a peaceful settlement broke off.  </P> <P> The announcement shattered beliefs that the seven-week conflict was on the  verge of being resolved after other Mohawks at a reservation south of Montreal  agreed Wednesday to help soldiers dismantle a blockade of a commuter bridge.  </P> <P> Bourassa said the negotiators from the Iroquois Confederation, which includes  the Mohawk tribe, pulled out of the talks.  </P> <P> "It's impossible for the government of Quebec to pursue any discussions without  these negotiators," he said.  </P> <P> Adding to the confusion, Mohawk negotiators who arrived for scheduled talks  were informed of the provincial government's decision by reporters.  </P> <P> "We're not aware," said Chief Billy Two-Rivers of the Kahnawake reservation.  </P> <P> It was not clear when the army would move on the barricades at Oka, the resort  20 miles west of Montreal where the conflict began in July when a Quebec  policeman was killed during a shoot-out.  </P> <P> The agreement struck between the Mohawks at the Kahnawake reservation and an  army commander Wednesday afternoon took the Mohawks at Oka by surprise.  </P> <P> The standoff began July 11, when policemen stormed a blockade erected by  Mohawks to stop the town from extending a golf course onto land they regard as  sacred.  </P> <P> In sympathy with their tribal brethren, the Kahnawake Mohawks set up a  fortified blockade on the Mercier Bridge linking the island of Montreal to its  southern suburbs.  </P> <P> It was unclear whether the collapse of the negotiations regarding the Oka  barricades would affect the agreement to clear the bridge.  </P> <P> A solution to the impasse at Oka appeared imminent earlier Thursday. Quebec  Indian Affairs Minister John Ciaccia, who met with Indians for 20 hours,  reported some progress.  </P></p>

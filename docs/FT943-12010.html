			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: American Express down 14% Net profits at American Express fell 14 per cent in the second quarter of 1994. It blamed lower profits at Lehman Brothers, the investment bank spun off during the period. Excluding Lehman, the financial services group's earnings would have risen 19 per cent to Dollars 359m, on the back of higher spending on charge cards and other products. Lehman, which last week revealed its second-quarter results had suffered from poor trading conditions in financial markets, was accounted for as a discontinued item. American Express reported net income of Dollars 357m, or 69 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 416m, or 83 cents, on revenues of Dollars 3.3bn a year before. The growth in earnings from continuing operations was driven by a 12 per cent rise in spending billed to the company's cards to Dollars 34.6bn. The total number of cards was 5 per cent higher than a year before. Card fees fell slightly to Dollars 431m, reflecting competition between issuers, but revenues from fees charged to merchants, which have been under pressure in recent periods, rose 9 per cent to Dollars 983m. American Express also reported continued profit growth at its IDS Financial Services subsidiary, up 21 per cent to Dollars 109m. For the first six months, net income was Dollars 710m against Dollars 659m the year before.</p>

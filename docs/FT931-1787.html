			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Turtle toy maker slumps 59% - Hong Kong Results PLAYMATES International, the toy distribution company that launched the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, recorded a 59 per cent drop in net profits to HKDollars 363m (USDollars 47m) in 1992, due to dwindling demand for the US's top-selling action figure toys. The company retains HKDollars 872m in cash reaped from the Turtle phenomenon and is continuing to search for alternative revenue sources, expanding into new toy lines and into property development. The directors slashed the dividend with a final payout of 13 cents, making a total of 20 cents for the year, compared with 80 cents in 1991. Playmates, the world's most profitable toy company in 1991, saw turnover fall to HKDollars 1.58bn from HKDollars 3.07bn, but management claimed Turtle sales had now reached a sustainable level as a 'classic toy line'. Mr Thomas Chan, managing director, said: '1992 represented a challenging transitional year for the group. Playmates took a decision to put into place and implement new initiatives in both toy and non-toy sectors specifically designed to support future growth.' This year, the company is banking on the third Turtle film to sustain interest. Its products based on characters from the film Star Trek: The Next Generation have recorded strong early sales. The company purchased in August a 37.5 per cent stake in Ideal Loisir, France's leading toy maker, for HKDollars 232m. It hopes to use this both to expand sales in Europe and broaden its product range. Playmates has also invested in property developments in China and Hong Kong. But performance remains unpredictable, and the stock market reacted to the results, with a 25 cent fall in the share price to HKDollars 2.70.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikha'el Tuchfeld] </F>   [Text] PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat delivered an address at a  Johannesburg mosque after the Mandela inauguration on 10 May.  The occasion was closed to the media, but a tape of the speech  reached the local Jewish community, which sent it on to Israel.    'Arafat's speech revolved primarily around the issue of  Jerusalem. He said that the Cairo agreement was merely the  first step and that the liberation of Jerusalem is the Muslims'  main objective. He called on the Palestinian people to launch a  jihad in a bid to liberate Jerusalem. 'Arafat's bombshell, with  or without quotation marks, was his revelation that when the  Cairo agreement was signed, he received an Israeli letter  confirming that Jerusalem is one of the issues on the  negotiations agenda and that the discussion on Jerusalem will  begin within three years. Let us hear him:    [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English] The jihad will  continue. And Jerusalem is not for the Palestinian people; it is  for all the Muslim ummah [nation]. You are responsible for  Palestine and for Jerusalem before me. You have to understand  our meaning: Battle is not to get how much we can achieve from  them here or there. Our main battle is Jerusalem: Jerusalem,  the first shrine of the Muslims. This has to be understood for  everybody. And for this I was insisting, before signing, to  have a letter from them, from the Israelis, that Jerusalem is  one of the items which has to be under discussion. And not this  state, the permanent state of Israel. No! It's the permanent  state of Palestine! Yes, it is a permanent state of Palestine.    And in this letter -- it is very important for everybody to  know -- I insist to mention, and they had written it, and I have  this letter. I didn't declare, I didn't publish it till now.  In this letter, we are responsible for all the Christian and  the Muslim and the Islamic holy sacred places.    You have to come and to fight and to start the jihad to  liberate Jerusalem, your first shrine. And this is very  important, and for this in the agreement, I insist -- with my  colleagues, with my brothers -- to mention that not exceeding  the beginning of the third year and directly after the signing  of the Cairo agreement, to start discussing the future of  Jerusalem; the future of Jerusalem.    And, you saw me in the TV while I was hesitating. You  remember this thing? You remember the picture? Because I was  insisting to mention Jerusalem. And I said: Okay, I don't want  only from Rabin this promise. No, I want this promise from the  cosponsors Christopher and Kozyrev and the witness, President  Mubarak. And this had been done, which is very important for  you.    The Samarians in Nabulus and the Neturey Karta  [ultra-Orthodox community] in Jerusalem, they are refusing to  recognize the State of Israel, and they are considering  themselves as Palestinians. I am saying this to give the proof  that what they are saying that it is their capital -- no, it is  not their capital! It is our capital; it is your capital! It  is the first shrine of the Islam and of the Muslims. [end  recording]</p>

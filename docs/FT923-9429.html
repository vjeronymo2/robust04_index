			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UN call to probe Bosnia detention camps THE United Nations Security Council last night demanded that the Red Cross and other neutral bodies be allowed to inspect detention camps in the former Yugoslavia, especially in the war-torn republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, agencies report from New York. The UN also announced it was suspending humanitarian aid flights into Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, for three days because of heavy shelling. The Security Council held closed-door consultations about detention camps, because of allegations that Serbian forces were running 'death' camps in Bosnia. On Monday, the US State Department appeared to confirm media reports of detention centres in which civilians were tortured and murdered. But the US said yesterday it could not confirm the reports. A Security Council statement warned that anyone committing or ordering grave breaches of international humanitarian law was individually responsible. Mourners at the funeral of two children killed by snipers while being evacuated by bus from Sarajevo fled in terror yesterday after two mortar bombs exploded within 100 metres of the graves. The grandmother of one of the children was wounded. Sarajevo's central Lion Cemetery, where the burial took place, has been in the middle of heavy fighting, but the proximity of the hits seemed to indicate the shelling was intentional. 'My daughter is dead, and now they've injured my mother,' said Mrs Svetlana Glavas, mother of one of the children, after her mother Ruza was wounded in the arm.</p>

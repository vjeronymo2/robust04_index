			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (4): Political passions stirred - Sweden and the European Union Rarely have political passions been so stirred in Sweden than in the debate that preceded the referendum vote on Sunday November 13 to join the European Union. Rarely has the country been so deeply split, geographically, demographically and politically on a national issue. The depth of feeling on the losing side after the 52.2 - 46.9 per cent result in favour of membership - 0.9 per cent of voters cast blank ballots - was graphically illustrated the following day in a radio confrontation between Mr Carl Bildt, the pro-EU former prime minister, and Mr Per Gahrton, Environment Party member of parliament and one of the leading figures in the No campaign. Mr Gahrton, asked if it was now time quietly to accept defeat, exploded into a tirade against what he called 'the insults and idiotic arguments' the Yes side 'spewed over us'. Turning on Mr Bildt, he declared: 'I represent more kommunes (municipal districts) in this country than you. I represent more workers than you. I represent many more of the people who will be losers out of this.' At least on two points, Mr Gahrton was right. The map of Sweden the morning after the EU vote showed that the vast majority - geographically - of the country had voted No, with the Yes vote being carried thanks only to heavy Yes results in the areas around the three main cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo. Out of 263 kommunes nationwide, only 83 voted Yes. On the No side, the main stalwart groups were trade unionists, young people and women. Most worryingly for the newly-formed Social Democratic government, almost half of all Social Democratic supporters voted No. The core of the No argument was the perception that membership would undermine Sweden's independence, compromise its military neutrality, threaten its cherished welfare system and entrench high unemployment because of the EU's preference for free-market economics. The Yes campaign, meanwhile, spearheaded by the political elite and business leaders, argued that Sweden must be a full participant in the EU's evolving political and economic structures to cement its own strategic and economic future. The key question now is whether the deep divisions which the debate exposed will persist or whether, over time, a general acceptance of the nation's participation in the EU will grow. Some signs already suggest the latter. A poll late last month showed most No voters were reconciled to the Yes result - notwithstanding the reaction of senior No campaigners such as Mr Gahrton. In the most northern county of Norrbotten, where some districts voted 80 per cent against membership, Mr Sven Persson, a senior official in the county council, commented: 'Many people up here already regard Stockholm rule as almost colonial rule. Now they see power moving even further away to Brussels. I think the day when we start to realise the benefits of EU regional funds for us, people will change their ideas - but it will take some years.' Still, there exists at least a risk that the strength of anti-EU feeling at large in Sweden will make the country forever an inherently Euro-sceptical EU member. Some No campaigners are already demanding another referendum if the EU goes further in its move towards common security policies and full monetary union. This is particularly true within the Social Democratic party, easily Sweden's biggest political movement. Walter Karpi, a professor of politics at Stockholm University, thinks the party faces a tough future over Europe. 'Once a party develops a serious split like this it is very difficult to overcome it,' he says. 'If the benefits promised by the Yes side - such as lower unemployment - are not forthcoming then there are likely to be long-term consequences (within the party).' However the very threat of such a long-term cleavage undoubtedly increases the incentive for Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, and his government to play an active role within the EU in the hope of gaining tangible results on the issues of most concern to them. Swedish officials stress their wish - in league with their fellow Nordic countries Denmark and Finland - to further the campaign for greater openness in the EU's decision-making processes, to increase environmental standards, to advance equality between the sexes, to accelerate the integration of eastern and central European nations (including the three Baltic states), to cement free trade agreements and, above all, to combat unemployment. The rejection of membership by Norway has weakened the potential 'Nordic bloc' within the EU which would have been united in championing these issues  -a matter of real regret in Stockholm. But Swedish ministers say they will actively seek to build alliances with other like-minded EU members to form influential fronts on these issues. Mr Mats Hellstrom, minister for European affairs, says it is a big mistake to think that because the anti-EU camp was so strong in Sweden that Stockholm will not be a full-hearted member. 'That view misunderstands Sweden,' he says. 'When we enter an international organisation, it is always our intention to see that the organisation is strengthened, not watered down.' But he stresses there is no pre-ordained Swedish position on how the EU's structures should be shaped. The government, approaching the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference that will review the Maastricht Treaty, is being cautious. It is sticking by Swedish neutrality, reluctant to be drawn into taking a stance on a common EU security and defence policy whose shape is as yet far from clear. Likewise, Stockholm favours extending co-operation on economic and monetary policy, but is holding back from endorsing a single currency. 'We will ask how the Union can be effective in creating common policies to further progress in areas such as environmental and employment policy - then we will ask to what extent the institutions affect these. Our approach will be from the substance of politics, not from an ivory tower discussion about institutions,' says Mr Hellstrom.</p>

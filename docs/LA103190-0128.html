			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR ASKED TO ACT ON SCHABARUM'S STATUS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has asked Gov. George Deukmejian  to determine if retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum has violated requirements  that he live in the district he serves, and if so, to appoint Sarah Flores to  his seat.  </P> <P> A Deukmejian spokesman said the governor's office will review a county  counsel's opinion that the governor can remove Schabarum if he determines the  supervisor no longer resides in his district.  </P> <P> Schabarum refused on Tuesday to answer any questions about his residency,  saying he does not want to divert attention from the term limit initiative he  is backing on Tuesday's ballot.  </P> <P> "This is not the week for that," Schabarum said.  </P> <P> Schabarum recently moved out of his San Gabriel Valley district and now divides  most of his time between a condominium in downtown Los Angeles and a house in  the desert community of Indian Wells.  </P> <P> Although the condominium is within the boundaries of the new 1st District as  recently redrawn by federal Judge David Kenyon, Schabarum's residency is still  in question because the redistricting issue is now before a higher court.  </P> <P> Kenyon ruled in a Voting Rights Act lawsuit earlier this year that the county  discriminated against Latinos in 1981 in drawing up the current supervisorial  districts. That ruling, along with the redrawn 1st District, was put on hold by  the county's appeal. An appellate court decision is expected any day.  </P> <P> The 61-year-old supervisor was planning to retire when his term expires Dec. 3  but his stay on the board was extended indefinitely pending the appeals court  ruling.  </P> <P> Antonovich and Supervisor Deane Dana, who no longer get along with fellow  Republican Schabarum, have been pushing for Flores' appointment or election in  hopes of upsetting the voting rights lawsuit and preserving conservative  control of the board.  </P> <P> If appointed, Flores -- a Latina Republican and former deputy to Schabarum --  would enjoy the advantages of incumbency in an election and could ultimately  disprove claims that the supervisors denied Latinos representation on the  board.  </P> <P> Flores was to face Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien in the November  election, but the that race, also was indefinitely postponed pending a final  ruling on the court case.  </P> <P> Antonovich, a former state GOP chairman, said Tuesday that he spoke privately  with Deukmejian at a recent gubernatorial fund-raiser about appointing Flores  to Schabarum's seat. "He was looking forward to receiving the opinion," said  Antonovich of the county counsel's ruling that spelled out Deukmejian's  authority in the dispute.  </P> <P> "We have received the opinion, but as to what we will do and when, it is up in  the air," said Deukmejian spokesman Bob Gore.  </P> <P> Sal Russo, Deukmejian's former deputy chief of staff and now a political  consultant in Sacramento, said he believes the governor will leave the matter  to the federal judge presiding over the redistricting case.  </P> <P> "His tendency would be, this is in the hands of a federal judge and to leave it  there until the legal issues are resolved rather than acting precipitously,"  Russo said.  </P> <P> Richard Fajardo, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund, a plaintiff in the redistricting lawsuit, said, "As a  practical matter, I don't see anything happening" to remove Schabarum.  </P> <P> He said that any effort to force Schabarum out probably would end up in court  and not be decided until after the redistricting ruling.  </P> <P> However, Fajardo said, "We are prepared to take whatever legal action is  necessary to preserve an open seat election in the 1st District. . . . One of  the goals of the district court is to keep an open seat so everybody would have  an equal chance of running for that office."  </P> <P> In his legal opinion, County Counsel DeWitt Clinton did not offer a statement  on whether Schabarum has violated residency requirements.  </P> <P> A Schabarum spokesman recently said the supervisor is registered to vote at his  son's house in the existing 1st District.  </P> <P> "The courts have held that when the incumbent of a local office ceases to be a  resident of the district for which he was elected . . . the office becomes  vacant automatically," Clinton said in his opinion. He added that a supervisor  cannot re-establish residency by moving back into the district.  </P> <P> However, Clinton said, "the supervisor may continue to sit as a de facto member  of the board until he resigns, is removed or is replaced, and prior to any such  action his votes and any resulting actions taken by the board are valid."  </P></p>

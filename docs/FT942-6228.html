			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Japanese recession bottoming out: Decline has stopped but months of conflicting economic signals are predicted Further evidence that the Japanese recession has hit bottom emerged yesterday, with a slight easing in unemployment and an official forecast of an improvement in business conditions. Yet economic analysts warned that there were no signs yet of a clear recovery and that several months of conflicting economic signals could be expected as the economy bumps along the bottom. The state Economic Planning Agency's leading index of business conditions hit 90.09 in March, rising from 54.2 in February, the third month at which it has stayed above the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction. The index, designed as a barometer of business conditions up to six months ahead, has proved erratic in the past. Yet it was unusually consistent in March in that all but one of the index's 13 components improved, except for commercial property, where the market continues to weaken. 'It confirms that the decline has stopped, but it does not mean that the economy is going up. Capacity is still increasing faster than demand,' warned Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute. Mr Brian Rose, senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research, said: 'We hit the bottom in the fourth quarter of last year. Nothing since then has changed that view. The recovery is weak, so we won't yet see a series of figures clearly pointing upwards.' The EPA itself was even more cautious and warned that it was too early to say whether the worst was over. Japan's jobless rate fell to 2.8 per cent in April, from 2.9 per cent in the previous month, the Management and Co-ordination Agency announced yesterday. But again the improvement is fragile, in the light of the labour market's continued weakness. There were only 66 jobs available for every 100 applicants last month, the same as in March and only a small improvement from the low of 65 last December. Manufacturing industry is the hardest hit, where the workforce declined by 1.1 per cent from April 1993, for the sixth month running. Within this, there was one bright sector, construction, where the numbers employed rose by 3.2 per cent in April, propelled by a recovery in housing starts, up 11.6 per cent in the same month, according to the Construction Ministry yesterday. Housing starts dipped by 0.7 per cent in March. Overall, 65 per cent of Japanese companies reduced overtime last year because of the recession, according to a survey by the Leisure Development Centre, a state research body.</p>

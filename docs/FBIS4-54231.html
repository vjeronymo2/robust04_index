			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear friends: As previously reported, the party  Central Committee Secretariat held a conference in Hanoi from  21-23 May to review the implementation over the past two years  of the party Central Committee's third plenum resolution on  party renovation and rectification as well as some urgent issues  in our work relating to female cadres.    Comrade Le Phuoc Tho, member of the Political Bureau,  secretary of the party Central Committee, and head of the party  Central Committee's Organization Department, chaired the  conference, which was attended by nearly 500 delegates from 53  provinces and cities and various ministries and sectors.  Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and addressed the  conference.    We invite our friends to listen to this report by a Radio  Voice of Vietnam correspondent outlining the main points of the  conference:    [Begin recording] Dear friends: It has been two years since  the party Central Committee's third plenum resolution and nearly  10 years since the party Central Committee Secretariat's  directive on a number of urgent matters relating to female  cadres.    Le Huy Ngo, deputy head of the party Central Committee's  Organization Department, presented a report reviewing the  party's renovation and rectification over the past two years.  The report mentioned the situation regarding the deployment and  implementation of this resolution and pointed out that in  general the party's renovation and rectification efforts have  correctly met the everyone's aspirations because attention has  been given by the entire party, people, and Army.    Party activities in various establishments have attracted  participation by 80-90 percent of party members. These  activities reflect unanimity in policies and great effort in  activities. They have produced a number of initial yet  important results in certain respects and have won the sympathy  and support of the people. These results are:    1. Ideologically, we have been able to further consolidate  our unity of mind and improve the confidence of a large number  of party cadres and members and people regarding the party's  renovation stance. On this basis, we have improved the sense of  responsibility of party committee echelons and every party  member toward the implementation of the party's renovation line.    2. As for organizational rectification, we have paid  attention to: Complying with various principles and  stipulations in the party statutes, especially the principles on  democratic centralism, the system of collective leadership among  party committee echelons, and broadening democratic principles;  overcoming disunity; and improving criticism and self-criticism  activities. Over 50 percent of the grassroots party  organizations have already been able to establish correct  working procedures. In certain provinces, 100 percent of  grassroots party organizations have been able to establish new  working procedures. Various sectors and localities have kept in  mind on the need to focus on the grass roots in organizational  rectification. They have consolidated poorly performing  grassroots party organizations and have satisfactorily resolved  various flashpoints, such as such as those in Hai Hung, Hanoi,  Yen Bai, and Tay Ninh. According to reports from 28 provinces  and cities and from the party Central Committee Military  Commission, the average number of clean and steadfast party  organizations has increased 7.8 percent, while the average  number of poorly performing party organizations has dropped 2.5  percent. The number of poorly performing party organizations is  still high in the mountain regions, however.    3. Regarding work related to party members, analysis shows  that the number of qualified party members making good efforts  is usually 30-40 percent. The number of poor party members  accounts for only 5-10 percent, while the number of disqualified  party members constitutes only 1-5 percent of the total. Worthy  of note in the work relating to party members is that we have  not just analyzed the qualities of party members; we have also  dealt with poor performers. Party organizations have developed  programs and objectives for training party members so they can  strive to surge forward and perform their assigned missions. As  a result, some localities have assigned 60-70 percent of their  party members with specific duties.    In 1993 alone, the party as a whole took disciplinary action  against 48,499 party members, or 2.3 percent of the total number  of party members in the country. Many of these party members  held high positions. While resolutely removing disqualified  members from the party, party organizations have also stepped up  party development. That is why the number of new party members  has increased annually. In 1993, the number of new party members  increased 30 percent over 1992, with youths and intellectuals  making up a large part. This shows that along with the results  obtained from the renovation process, the party has really been  able to attract the younger generation and the intelligentsia.    4. Regarding the cadre-related and mass mobilization tasks,  our initial achievements have been encouraging, thus satisfying  the people's desire, promoting the unique characteristics of  regions inhabited by ethnic minorities, and strengthening female  cadres' activities.    In commending female cadres, we should consider their  political background and ethics, their efforts in observing  party discipline, their relations with the masses, and their  capability in carrying out tasks to meet the requirements of the  renovation process.    5. There must be further changes in the party leadership in  order to implement the main task of developing the socioeconomic  situation to strengthen the market economy.    It is necessary to mention here that we have attached  importance to the countryside and taken grass-roots party  organizations as a basis for implementing various party  resolutions and official lines and policies.    The report of Comrade Truong My Hoa, secretary of the  Central  Committee, stressed efforts to renovate and revamp the party  while presenting a general assessment on the causes of the  shortcomings experienced by female cadres in carrying out party  tasks and activities. This was due to less attention paid by  leaders of party committees to planning, training, and helping  female cadres to develop.    The conference discussed and made concrete proposals aimed  at  strengthening the renovation and rectification of the party,  while enhancing the role of female cadres to meet requirements  of the new situation, especially after the midterm national  party conference.    Regarding the efforts to continue revamping and renovating  the party, the conference established the following essential  tasks to be carried out during the next two years:    1. Efforts to make grass-roots party organizations a basis  for building pure and strong party units and efforts to  implement the socioeconomic development program from the central  to grass-roots levels. Only by satisfactorily developing the  party role at the grass-roots level, will we be able to  effectively implement party and state resolutions, lines, and  policies.    2. Regarding cadre-related tasks, we must strive to create  favorable conditions for each party member and organization to  take the lead in all tasks so as to encourage people to  participate in various activities. For female cadres, local  leaders must formulate better plans to recruit and train them to  increase their number and enhance their capabilities. The  quality of cadres rests with their background knowledge, ethics,  and capability in fulfilling assigned tasks. Various party  organizations may apply the transfer system to train and foster  responsible cadres and party members to enhance their skills and  capabilities.    3. Party members must pay attention to the mass mobilization  work, while participating in tasks to renovate the party  leadership and promote the market economy.    The conference also discussed and called for efforts to  concretize and resolve various issues. These include issues on  allowing party members to engage in economic activities,  restoring party affairs committees of various organizations, and  improving party organizations at state and private enterprises.  Efforts must also be made to perfect the echelons of party  committees and strengthen party building in almost 3,800 hamlets  where no party members have been admitted.    Dear friends, in his address to the conference, General  Secretary Do Muoi stressed the significant role of our party  line and policy on renovating and revamping the party. He said  that the people have placed firm confidence in our party and its  renovation policy. As a result, during the past several years  we have continued to overcome numerous difficulties and scored  encouraging achievements. We still face numerous acute ordeals,  however, and we must strive to continue to renovate and revamp  the party.    The comrade general secretary stressed: This is a major and  difficult task. To build a pure, firm, and strong party worthy  of the people's love and trust, we must firmly maintain and  strengthen the proletarian characteristics while eliminating all  forms and concepts of coercion and oppression. Our fundamental  party ideology rests with Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh  thought. Many party members during the past several years have  taken the lead and set a good example in implementing the  renovation process. Given the current requirements, however, we  must strive to renovate and revamp the party more vigorously  while effectively carrying out concrete tasks set by the midterm  national party conference for the next two years.    Comrade Do Muoi also analyzed the necessity to broaden  democracy within the party and the relations between democracy  and centralized leadership. He said that efforts must be made  to enhance the intelligence of each party committee echelon to  score achievements in the socioeconomic development program. We  must pay special attention to strengthening the party building  task at the grass-roots level, while maintaining close relations  with the people and motivating them to participate in various  revolutionary movements. This is the most basic task of our  party and state, through which we will score concrete  achievements in the socioeconomic development program and foil  the peaceful evolution schemes of the hostile forces.

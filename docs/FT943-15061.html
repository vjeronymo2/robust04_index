			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Khmer Rouge names ministers Khmer Rouge guerrillas, outlawed by the Cambodian government last week after the failure of peace talks, announced yesterday that they were establishing a rival government based in Preah Vihear province, a jungle area on the Thai border in the far north of the country, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. According to a guerrilla radio broadcast Mr Khieu Samphan, nominal Khmer Rouge chief, will be prime minister and defence minister in the 'provisional government of national union and national salvation'. But Pol Pot - who presided over the deaths of 1m Cambodians between 1975 and 1978 - is believed to remain as real leader of the organisation. The guerrillas control only about a tenth of Cambodian territory and depend heavily on selling gems and timber to Thailand, but they defeated government offensives earlier this year around Pailin in the west and Anlong Veng in the north.</p>

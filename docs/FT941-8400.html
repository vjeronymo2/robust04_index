			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Exemption from CGT I am out of work and receiving unemployment benefit plus a small occupational pension which, because I am under 55, is untaxed. I do, however, invest in both shares and traded options and am showing a reasonable profit at the moment. I realise that capital gains tax is levied at whatever rate of tax one pays on income, so could you confirm that, as a non-taxpayer, my earnings on shares and options are exempt? Someone whose income is too small to attract any income tax liability for the present 1993-94 tax year is liable to pay capital gains tax on the following scale: No CGT on the first Pounds 5,800; 20 per cent on the next Pounds 2,500; 25 per cent on the next Pounds 21,200; 40 per cent on the rest. Ask your tax office for the free introductory booklet to capital gains tax, CGT14. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / This Week: Sport SNOOKER: November 11 to 27, Royal Liver Assurance UK Championships, Guild Hall, Preston. The fight for the British title gets into full swing this week with the bookmakers making Scotland's Stephen Hendry 2-1 favourite to take the Pounds 70,000 first prize. Ronnie O'Sullivan won the title last year, to become the youngest-ever winner of a world-ranking event. At 5-1, he is second favourite this time round and reckons the bookies have things about right. In October, Ronnie, now 18, was voted Player of the Year, but says: 'Stephen Hendry probably deserved it as much as me. He is still the one to beat.' FOOTBALL: November 16, England v Nigeria, Wembley. European Championship qualifying matches include: Northern Ireland v Republic of Ireland; Georgia v Wales and Scotland v Russia. When it comes to the football side of life, the biggest problem facing England manager Terry Venables is finding good-quality opposition to test his side in preparation for the 1996 European Championship finals. Romania was a tough game, the USA a cakewalk and Nigeria should fit in somewhere between those two. Still no place for Pounds 5m Chris Sutton up front, and the Sutton v Collymore v Cole v Fowler debate rages on. Scotland manager Craig Brown has named uncapped players John Spencer (Chelsea's Lion of Vienna), Gerry Creaney (Portsmouth) and Darren Jackson (Hibernian) in his squad to face Russia. RUGBY UNION: Scotland v South Africa, November 19, Murrayfield At Twickenham in 1969 everyone lost their heads. The demonstrators lost their's, enraged by the regime that the touring South Africans represented. And the Springboks lost their's, for in those days 'losing your head' was the term used to describe the first defeat of the tour. Oxford won that day and so, in the end, did the anti-apartheid movement. Now, on the first South African rugby tour to Britain for 25 years, heads have again been lost all round: first in the bloodbath at Neath, and then (in the traditional sense) last Wednesday, when the Boks went down 17-15 in injury time to Scotland A. That will have given the Scottish first team a confidence boost. But the tourists are still very clear favourites. RUGBY LEAGUE: Great Britain v Australia, November 20, the 3rd John Smith's Test, Elland Road, Leeds. The third and final Test of the series is one that the Kangaroos should and probably will win, following their surprise defeat at Wembley and an easy victory over the Lions at Old Trafford.</p>

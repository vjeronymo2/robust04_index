			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG USE IN CHEECH MARIN'S EARLIER FILMS  </P> <P> I hope Cheech Marin's new film, "The Shrimp on the Barbie," becomes the  box-office flop of the decade.  </P> <P> Cheech, and his partner in crime, Thomas Chong, made a fortune by glamorizing  drug use.  </P> <P> Marin is as guilty as the Colombian drug lords for propelling untold thousands  of young Americans into the horror of drug addiction.  </P> <P> The popular Cheech and Chong movies were nothing but propaganda and free  advertising for drug deals, persuading the naive that the lies they had been  told about that "Weed From Hell -- Marijuana" were the same lies being told  about other "harmless drugs" such as uppers, downers, cocaine and LSD.  </P> <P> With acid rock and slapstick humor, these two movie doper heroes put on a  convincing act of Better Partying Through Chemistry with a "Far out, man!"  philosophy.  </P> <P> As a result of Cheech and Chong's irresponsible portrayal of having fun by  getting high, I wonder, how many people began a descent into hell while using  "harmless drugs"? I did, and it's taken me over 13 years to crawl back.  </P> <P> D.J. NOFFSINGER  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOLDAVIANS DEBATE LANGUAGE MEASURE;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS EXPECTED TO DEFY KREMLIN, PASS LAW; STRIKES SPREAD  </P> <P> The legislature of the Soviet republic of Moldavia, which is expected to defy  the Kremlin and pass a controversial language law, met Tuesday amid spreading  strikes by ethnic Russians who oppose the proposed legislation.  </P> <P> People in Kishinev, the republic's capital, clustered around portable radios on  street corners to follow the live broadcast of the legislative proceedings and  took part in an informal vigil in a square across from the Opera Theater, where  the legislature was in session.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the pro-independence popular front movements of the Baltic states of  Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia announced that they will have a special joint  meeting Thursday in the Latvian capital, Riga, to work out a common response to  a tough warning issued Saturday by the Communist Party Central Committee, which  labeled them dangerous extremists.  </P> <P> The Latvian Popular Front, speaking out in advance of the meeting, denounced  the Central Committee statement. It said in a statement published in the  newspaper Izvestia that "the right to self-determination for the Baltic people  is under threat." The declaration from Moscow, it said, was "incorrect and  imperialistic."  </P> <P> Also Tuesday, the Soviet Foreign Ministry dismissed as baseless speculation  that the Central Committee statement had been written by conservatives without  approval from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is currently vacationing on  the Black Sea coast.  </P> <P> The committee's statement, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told  a news conference in Moscow, "was worked out with the participation of all  members of the Politburo, and this includes the general secretary of the  Communist Party (Gorbachev)."  </P> <P> In Moldavia, the president of the republic, Mircha I. Snegur, opened the debate  in the legislature by urging quick approval of the proposed law. A vote was  expected before the end of the week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Extremely Gloomy'  </P> <P> "The mood among Russians in the city is extremely gloomy," Yuri P. Tishenko,  managing editor of the daily Sovietskaya Moldavia, said by telephone from  Kishinev. "They expect this law will be passed, probably tomorrow (Wednesday)."  </P> <P> A spokesman at the office of the Moldavian Popular Front expressed elation.  </P> <P> "We are following every minute of the debate and hoping for victory," he said.  </P> <P> As the legislature met, about 2,000 people gathered in the square across the  street, some waving the red, blue and yellow flag of Moldavia as they waited to  hear the outcome of the debate.  </P> <P> The spokesman at Popular Front headquarters said work in most offices had come  to a standstill as people gathered around television sets and radios.  </P> <P> The proposed law would make Moldavian, a Romanian dialect, the official  language of the Soviet Union's smallest republic. It would also require a  return to the Roman alphabet, by 1995, instead of the Cyrillic now in use. Use  of Moldavian would be required in all state and business communications in the  republic.  </P> <P> Similar language laws were passed this year in the Baltic states, but  consideration of the Moldavian law comes as the Kremlin has broken with its  previous policy of tolerance and launched a campaign against growing  nationalism in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The Communist Party daily Pravda printed another article Tuesday lashing out at  Moldavian nationalists.  </P> <P> "Ethnic intolerance," it said, "has now appeared in Moldavia, fueling  bitterness, mutual hostility and suspicion among people of various  nationalities."  </P> <P> The strike by ethnic Russians in Moldavia spread Tuesday, according to editor  Tishenko. He said work had stopped at more than 100 enterprises. President  Snegur said 80,000 workers are on strike.  </P> <P> Ethnic Russians and other non-Moldavians, who make up about 35% of the  republic's population of 4.2 million, consider the proposed legislation  discriminatory.  </P> <P> The official news agency Tass, criticizing the proposed law, said, "Are the  million and a half non-Moldavians who consider Moldavia their motherland not  part of the people?"  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SILVER LINING: What's the good news about the Middle East crisis? . . . For  Newport Beach, it's the rise in crude oil prices. Newport is the only city in  California to own and operate oil wells, and since the invasion of Kuwait,  revenue has increased by about $65,000 compared to the same period last year. .  . . Says Bob Dixon, who manages the city wells, "If this held up for a year --  and, of course, we hope that it won't" -- the city could pocket an extra  $442,000.

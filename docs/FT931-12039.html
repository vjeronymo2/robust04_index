			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lenders will not pass on full rate cut LIKE HERDED sheep, banks and building societies were quick this week to follow the 7.99 per cent mortgage rate set by Halifax, the largest lender. The society said it had given 'special consideration' to its savers in setting the new rate, which represents a cut of only 0.56 of a percentage point compared with the base rate drop of 1 point. It applies immediately for new borrowers and from March 1 for existing mortgage-holders. Those with a Pounds 50,000 mortgage, and paying 8.55 per cent, will see their monthly payments drop from Pounds 355.41 a month to Pounds 340.08 if they have a repayment mortgage. A 29-year-old non-smoker with an endowment mortgage will see his payments fall from Pounds 364.81. to Pounds 344.98. The cut has had a noticeable impact on what can be afforded, according to figures compiled by the FT. Assuming a mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent, then a loan on an average-priced house (according to Halifax's index) now costs 17.8 per cent of average income - down from 19.11 per cent after the last base rate cut in November. This is almost down to the level of 17.35 per cent recorded in 1972. The only institution so far to have passed on the full 1 point base rate cut is UCB, the UK subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire, a French financial services group. But UCB previously was charging 8.99 per cent, well above the market rate, and existing customers will have to wait until April 1 for the new rate of 7.99. Other banks and building societies to have announced a 7.99 rate are Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Barclays, Britannia, Chelsea, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Coventry, Leeds Permanent, Lloyds Bank, Midland, National &amp; Provincial, Nationwide, Northern Rock, Nottingham, Royal Bank of Scotland, Staffordshire, Stroud &amp; Swindon, TSB and Woolwich. The rates apply from March 1 for existing borrowers, with some exceptions. Lloyds' new rate will apply to both new and existing borrowers from February 26. Chelsea, Northern Rock, National &amp; Provincial have not yet decided on a date for existing customers. There has been some variation in the rates. Household Mortgage Corporation, a centralised lender, has announced that its new figure will be 7.69 per cent from April 1 for new and existing borrowers. Its mortgage-holders now are paying 9.95 per cent, which will be reduced to 8.45 per cent from March 1. Firstdirect goes to 7.95 per cent, a drop of 0.54 of a point. Existing borrowers benefit from March 1. Manchester building society has cut by 0.56 of a point to 7.89 per cent with immediate effect for new borrowers and from March for existing customers. Rates at National Home Loans, another centralised lender, continue to lag behind. The new figure is 9.99 per cent from April 1; borrowers on the present standard variable rate are paying 10.8. There are some variations on the standard rate depending on the size and/or the proportion of the house's value you borrow. The new rate for those borrowing over Pounds 100,000 from Abbey National is 7.7 per cent, while those borrowing less than 80 per cent of the value of the home at Woolwich will pay 7.65 per cent. First-time buyers are being courted actively while new fixed rates continue to be launched. Many are tied to endowment or pension mortgages, restricting the choice to those wanting a repayment mortgage. Stroud &amp; Swindon has a two-year, 6.95 per cent fixed-rate mortgage available in both repayment and endowment modes. The fee is Pounds 150 and the early redemption penalty is three months. Staffordshire also has a 6.49 fixed-rate offer until March 31 1995 for a fee of Pounds 195, available on repayments and endowment mortgages. Neither society requires customers to buy insurance-related products.</p>

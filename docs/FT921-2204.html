			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / GRE cuts payout 41% as losses rise GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the fourth of the UK's five leading composite insurers to report 1991 results, yesterday cut its dividend by 41 per cent after announcing a 33 per cent increase in pre-tax losses to Pounds 210m. However, the City reacted positively to the results. The size of the loss was less than feared and investors were reassured by signs that underwriting results are improving and costs under control. The shares were marked up by 13 1/2 p on the day to close at 128p. Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive, said the 41 per cent cut in the dividend would 'enable GRE to participate more fully in the emerging business upturn'. The final dividend was 2.6p making a total of 7.0p for the year. Losses per share were 21.2p compared with 22p. The group is to merge its Australian subsidiary with that of Zurich Insurance, one of Europe's biggest insurers. GRE will obtain 25 per cent in Zurich Australian Holdings. It has an option to sell its holding in ZAH to Zurich for ADollars 110m (Pounds 48.4m) in three years. Worldwide underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 491m against Pounds 445m, life profits were Pounds 23m compared with Pounds 25m, investment income was Pounds 268m against Pounds 267m with merged operations producing a loss of Pounds 10m. As with its competitors, UK underwriting losses dominated the results amounting to Pounds 332m, up from Pounds 250m. However, a combination of rate increases of around 30 per cent and much more selective underwriting reduced losses on the private motor account to Pounds 65.9m from Pounds 77.4m. GRE reduced its exposures by 23 per cent and now insures some 675,000 motorists compared with 878,000 a year ago. Commercial insurance losses increased marginally from Pounds 185m to Pounds 186.5m in spite of a rise in liability claims from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 73.6m with increasing numbers of negligence awards against surveyors identified as one reason. GRE also reduced costs in its UK operations and has reduced staff numbers by 1,100 over the past 14 months. General expenses at GRE (UK) were cut 9.6 per cent to Pounds 78.6m. The dividend cut has also protected solvency. The solvency margin (the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) amounted to 43 per cent at the end of 1991.

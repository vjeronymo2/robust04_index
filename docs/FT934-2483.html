			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Budget 'likely to halve growth in construction' One of the construction industry's foremost leading forecasting bodies has halved its projections for growth next year, blaming measures announced in the Budget last month. The National Council of Building Material Producers, which represents more than 2,000 companies, yesterday forecast that construction output would rise by only 0.5 per cent next year after falling this year. Before the Budget the council had been forecasting a 1 per cent rise. Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the forecasting panel, said growth would slow as a result of reductions in government spending on housing associations and roads. He said: 'The chancellor's Budget was not one for the construction industry in the short term.' He was also concerned that government attempts to encourage greater private-sector investment in toll roads, railways and other infrastruc-ture would not come through quickly enough to offset public spending cuts elsewhere. He said: 'It is essential the private finance initiative is kept at the top of the political agenda and more projects are seen to come to fruition.' The council has not altered its forecast that output will fall by 2 per cent this year. This would mean that the value of output in constant 1985 prices has fallen by almost 17 per cent since 1990. The council expects the pace of recovery will accelerate in 1995 when it expects output to rise by 2 per cent. It says that the slower rate of growth forecast for next year was because of a Pounds 900m cut in the Housing Corporation development programme. It expects this will reduce the number of homes started by the public sector next year from 42,000 to 36,000, falling to 33,000 in 1995. Central government spending on roads was expected to fall by 7 per cent while tough spending constraints on councils would affect investment in local roads and council house repair and maintenance, the council said. But it did not expect phased reductions in mortgage tax relief, also announced in the Budget, to inhibit the recovery in the housing market. It expects the number of private-sector starts to rise from 140,000 to 150,000 next year, increasing to 160,000 in 1995. Factory and warehouse building was forecast to rise by 5 per cent next year. The rate of decline in commercial construction, mainly offices and shops, was expected to fall from 20 per cent to 5 per cent next year. Commercial output, however, was forecast to rise by 5 per cent in 1995.</p>

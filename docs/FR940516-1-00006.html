By Advisory 27&hyph;92 (June 3, 1992), the Division gave notice that it had no objection to the use of a two-part disclosure document of the nature described above by other CPOs, subject to the conditions set forth in the foregoing letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (1990&hyph;1992 Transfer Binder), Comm.

Moreover, the staff indicated that it is always willing to address specific requests for relief and has done so in appropriate circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ., CFTC Advisory 87&hyph;2, (1986&hyph;1987 Transfer Binder) Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;23,624 (June 2, 1987), defining the term ``beginning net asset value'' for purposes of computing rate of return; CFTC Advisory dated February 27, 1991 (1990&hyph;1992 Transfer Binder) Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;25,005, permitting CPOs and CTAs to use alternative rate of return computation methods to more accurately reflect the return on funds available for trading during the period; and CFTC Advisory 93&hyph;13, (Current Transfer Binder) Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) &para;25,554 (February 12, 1993), permitting the use of an alternative method for computing CTAs' rates of return. The use of this method may result in fewer and simplified performance tables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing this proposal, the Commission has taken into account its experience in administering the current regulatory framework, reviewing disclosure documents and responding to requests for relief from registrants. The Commission has also taken into consideration the evolution of the industry, the views of the public and of market participants and the disclosure implications of recently developed trading structures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also has had the benefit of the work of a Special Committee for the Review of CPO/CTA Disclosure Issues established by the National Futures Association (``NFA'') <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  to review and make recommendations concerning CPO and CTA disclosure documents. The Special Committee's recommendations were presented to NFA's Board of Directors in February 1994. On March 15, 1994, the NFA submitted to the Commission proposed amendments to, and interpretations of, its Compliance Rules which were based upon the Special Committee's recommendations. NFA's rule submission consists of several parts. Proposed revisions of NFA Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13(a) would require CPOs to comply, not only with specified Commission rules applicable to CPOs' and CTAs' activities and disclosures, but also with interpretations of those rules issued by NFA's Board of Directors and approved by the Commission. Separately, new paragraph (b) would be added to Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 to require CPO disclosure documents to include a ``break-even'' analysis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a computation of the trading profit that a pool must realize in its first year for a participant to recoup its initial investment, presented in the manner prescribed by the NFA's Board of Directors, including a tabular presentation of fees and expenses. NFA is also proposing interpretations of proposed Compliance Rule 2&hyph;13 relating to disclosure of past performance information, the computation and presentation of the break-even analysis, the use of pro forma and extracted results in past performance presentations and other topics addressed by this proposal, including the disclosure of business backgrounds of CPO and CTA principals, material litigation against FCMs and other past performance issues. In addition, NFA is proposing to replace paragraph (b)(4) of NFA Rule 2&hyph;29 with a new, more detailed, paragraph (c) concerning the use of hypothetical trading results. References to the NFA proposal are made in appropriate sections of this release. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Certain portions of that proposal are being published for comment contemporaneously with this release. The NFA submission is available from the Commission's Office of the Secretariat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NFA is presently the only futures association registered with the Commission pursuant to section 17 of the Act.

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Virgin-Delta airline pact blocked by US disapproval A planned transatlantic alliance between Virgin Atlantic Airways of the UK and Delta Air Lines of the US was yesterday effectively shelved following a decision by the US Department of Transportation to withhold its approval. The deal was supposed to come into effect on November 1, but Delta and Virgin said they had postponed implementation indefinitely because the department was not prepared to act in advance of negotiations on a fresh aviation treaty between the US and the UK. Under the existing aviation treaty, only two US airlines - United and American - are allowed to fly into London Heathrow airport, the world's largest. The US has been pushing the UK to give all US airlines access to Heathrow. The agreement between Delta and Virgin would have given Delta a different form of access to Heathrow by allowing it to book blocks of 15 to 20 per cent of the seats on Virgin's flights to London from New York, Newark, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Orlando and Boston. Delta would have independently sold tickets for these seats as though they were tickets for its own flights, using Delta flight codes. Both airlines hoped to benefit from the deal through big increases in passenger numbers. The UK government was in favour of the pact and approved it at the end of May. The US Justice Department approved it a month later. But the US Department of Transportation has been unimpressed by UK offers to improve access to UK regional airports and London Stansted as part of a liberalisation package, and is demanding bigger concessions. Delta and Virgin said they still hoped to go ahead with the deal eventually, and they still planned to implement those parts of it that did not require government approval. This means the two will share frequent-flyer programmes, and Virgin will start using Delta's ground facilities at US airports. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said both airlines were 'deeply disappointed' that the code-sharing agreement had been delayed. He could not see the logic of approving an earlier code-sharing deal between USAir and British Airways while delaying a decision over the Virgin/Delta pact.</p>

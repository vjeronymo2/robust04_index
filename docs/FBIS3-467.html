With the elections due next  month, the battle has shifted from national level to city and  town councils in a groundswell described as "extremely  dangerous" by local government officials.    Transvaal Boerekommando [Boer Commando] members have started  barricading municipal offices with razor-wire and sandbags.  They have declared open war on the Local Government Transition  Act, which allows for the replacement of all-white councils by  appointed non-racial councils.    The Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front] is  ready to play its final trump card to thwart the transition  constitution -- by hijacking town and city councils in all four  provinces. The four provincial administrations are readying  themselves to clamp down on far-right resistance to the new  constitution.    A senior Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] official  said: "The town councils issue is clearly just an excuse for  whipping up emotions to mobilise their people.    "The ultimate aim is to force political concessions on the  national level, and get the idea of a volkstaat [homeland]  accepted. The broader aim makes their actions on the ground  extremely dangerous."    Open confrontation seems inevitable. The AVF and other  groups have been warned by the authorities that attempts to take  over control of councils would be "unconstitutional and  unlawful". Transvaal Local Government MEC [Member of Executive  Committee] Burger Lategan has said the full force of the law  will be used to counter these attempts. A TPA spokesman said  yesterday that May 2 would be the cut-off date for the  implementation of "local transitional councils", he said.    But the AVF has also made clear its intention to use its  power at local government level to thwart agreements reached at  the Local Government Negotiating Forum last year, allowing for  non-racial city councils during the transition. A list of 283  cities and towns declared as "volkstaat territory" was given to  the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN by Conservative Party [CP] organising  secretary Wouter Hoffman. The AVF is establishing burgerrade in  these towns, poised to take over their administration when  non-racial councils come into being.    Hoffman claimed the towns -- stretching from Richards Bay in  Natal, through the Transvaal and [Orange] Free State to the Cape  Province and as far north as Namaqualand -- had indicated their  intention to become part of an Afrikaner volkstaat.    The CP determines majority support for a volkstaat by  council  decisions, opinion surveys and a clear "trend" among whites. A  senior CP member in Natal said his party believed existing  councils had no legitimacy after the postponement of the 1993  municipal elections and the appointment of councillors by  administrators. Elected councillors enjoy greater protection in  terms of the law. If appointed, they become employees and may be  fired. "We expect councillors to be fired any time from now.  That is why we have instituted our own burgerrade, which will  function when they lose their positions."    In parliament this week, President F W de Klerk slammed the  idea of a volkstaat in Pretoria. The city's economy would be  destroyed, said Pretoria Mayor Nico Stofberg.    In Akasia, National Party councillow Hannes van Schoor  resigned in protest this week after a council decision to break  ties with the Rosslyn Industrialists' Association and to donate  R20,000 [rand] to Radio Pretoria. The decision could lead to a  loss in income of R85-million a year.    A recent decision by the CP-controlled Transvaal Municipal  Association not to participate in forums for a new local  government dispensation sparked a government warning that local  councils may be dissolved.</p>

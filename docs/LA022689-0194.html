			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> IRVINE SURPRISES PASADENA  </P> <P> Coach Steve Keith, who led Glendale High to two titles before leaving the  school last season, masterminded another trip to a Southern Section boys'  basketball championship as Irvine shocked top-seeded Pasadena, 67-60, in the  5-A division semifinals Saturday night before 1,800 fans at Christ College of  Irvine.  </P> <P> Irvine (24-5) will meet South Coast League rival Capistrano Valley (23-4) in  the championship game at 6:15 p.m. Saturday at the Sports Arena. Capistrano  Valley defeated Irvine twice in league play, but Keith isn't discounting his  team's chances.  </P> <P> "If you're good enough to get there (the championship game), you're good enough  to win," Keith said. "You're so happy to be there, you don't care if it's the  Lakers you're playing."  </P> <P> Irvine advanced to its first championship game by making 10 of 13 free throws  in the final quarter and getting a critical 12-foot jump shot from sophomore  John Molle with 1:06 remaining to push Irvine ahead, 62-58.  </P> <P> Irvine made six free throws in the final 38 seconds to snap Pasadena's 15-game  win streak.  </P> <P> Pasadena (23-3) had won 19 games by 10 or more points, but the Bulldogs wilted  down the stretch with Steve Dunmeyer dogging guard Idris Jones, who led  Pasadena with 18 points.  </P> <P> Jones failed to get a field goal in the last quarter as Pasadena made only 2 of  10 shots.  </P> <P> Irvine guard Bryan Allred scored nine of his game-high 22 points in the fourth  quarter.  </P></p>

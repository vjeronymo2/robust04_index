			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: MAI covers the Angles MAI's agreed bid for Anglia further stirs the pot about the value of media assets, given the full price being paid. The minimum offer price of 637p is 32 per cent higher than Anglia's previous close and more than three times its 1992 low. It represents an exit multiple of about 37 times Anglia's forecast 1993 earnings. Even so, MAI does not expect the deal to dilute earnings in its first full year. From the outside, it is difficult to judge whether that is realistic. Anglia does have cash on its balance sheet and has valuable investments in radio, BSB loan stock and the Village Roadshow. Once those are excluded, the earnings multiple drops to a plain expensive 27 times. MAI can achieve unspecified cost savings by part-merging Anglia with its majority-owned Meridian franchise. The two stations can wave at each other across the Thames estuary, which should yield savings in regional programming and transmission. But those potential savings may prove less than the margin for error in forecast revenues. The rhetoric used to justify the price sounds worryingly reminiscent of that used in the 1980s to explain the value of advertising agencies. Still, Lord Hollick has a well-deserved reputation for corporate miserliness and has had a chance to scour Anglia's books. Part funding the deal with convertible preference shares also lends greater financial flexibility. The bid must reflect on Granada's tussle with LWT. It strengthens Granada's arguments about industry consolidation. But it also raises expectations that it will have to pay a touch more.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Foreign securities firms to join Shanghai exchange The Shanghai Securities Exchange is planning to let foreign securities firms become members, under a reform that would eliminate the need for them to trade through Chinese brokers. The reform, planned for this year, would mark a further step in the liberalisation of China's financial markets, and boost Shanghai's effort to grow into one of the world's leading financial centres. Foreign investment banks have been rushing to set up offices in the city to take advantage of the boom in joint ventures between overseas companies and Chinese enterprises, as well as the flow of new equity listings. Twenty-one foreign securities houses have seats on the exchange and can trade so-called B shares in Chinese companies to foreign investors, but they are not allowed to be members of the exchange. This means that they must pay about 20 per cent of their share trading commissions to seven local brokers which act as partners. Investors buying B shares pay about 0.7 per cent of the value of trades in commissions. However, officials of the Shanghai exchange are planning to create a new category of 'special' membership that would allow foreign firms to operate freely, although without voting rights. Ms Li Qian, a director of the exchange's international department, said that some local brokers were unhappy about the plan, but the exchange believed it was a necessary step in the market's liberalisation. 'The local brokers do not agree, but we have to take the long-term view for the development of the exchange,' she said. Barings, the British merchant bank, opened an office in Shanghai last week and other UK securities houses are following their lead. American banks have been increasing their strength in the city. Foreign brokers have been pressing for the unification of the B shares with the A shares that only Chinese investors can buy. Foreign companies have also expressed interest in secondary listings on the Shanghai exchange. The exchange has grown rapidly in the past two years, reaching a total market capitalisation of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27.3bn) last year. The exchange estimates that about 5m people now hold share accounts at the Shanghai exchange.</p>

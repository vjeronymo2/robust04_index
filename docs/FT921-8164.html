			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: UK PSBR Yesterday's public sector borrowing requirement also suggests Mr Lamont's room for budgetary manoeuvre has grown. After December's awful figures, it looked as if recession was hitting receipts so badly that it would undermine the gilts market and limit the government's scope for an election-winning fiscal package. In the event, January's Pounds 3.6bn surplus shows the notoriously volatile corporation tax receipts holding up well at Pounds 5.6bn. Income tax receipts showed some signs of falling off through the effects of lower wage settlements and rising unemployment, but that trend will only be clearly visible in the next financial year. This year's PSBR should now come in at around Pounds 12bn, a figure discounted by the market at the time of the Autumn statement. Meanwhile, helped by sterling's strength, it has absorbed a fairly heavy funding programme. If Mr Lamont is preparing for tax cuts, there is not much to stop him being hung for a sheep as a lamb and opting for an easing of Pounds 3bn or more. The market should have no difficulty with a projected PSBR for 1992-93 of up to Pounds 25bn provided it does not think the government risks over-stimulating the economy in the short term. The danger is that it might thereby limit the fall in inflation further out, a factor the gilts market appears to have overlooked. With perhaps Pounds 2.5bn gross monthly issuance expected next year whichever political party is in power, gilt traders will have a wary eye on inflation.</p>

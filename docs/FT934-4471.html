			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Shake-up cuts profit 31% at GrandMet Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, saw pre-tax profits fall 31 per cent to Pounds 630m in the year to September after Pounds 286m charges. The costs include: Pounds 175m for restructuring, largely in US food and retailing; Pounds 66m provisions for money owed by Brent Walker on the William Hill betting shops, plus Pounds 20m to cover costs; a Pounds 50m write-down of UK property assets. But for the exceptionals, pre-tax profits would have been 6.6 per cent ahead at Pounds 916m. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman, said: 'Recoveries in the US and UK did not produce significant benefits and many European economies remained in recession.' Operating profits from continuing businesses rose 18.6 per cent to Pounds 958m on turnover up from Pounds 6.58bn to Pounds 7.64bn. Profits of IDV, the drinks division, increased 14 per cent to Pounds 561m, and by 4 per cent excluding currency effects. Total sales of wines and spirits exceeded 100m cases for the first time. The leading brands - Smirnoff vodka, J &amp; B Scotch whisky and Baileys liqueur - gained volume, and Russia became the fifth biggest market for Smirnoff. North American food operations lifted profits 29 per cent to Pounds 212m, or by 9 per cent in local currency terms. But European food profits fell from Pounds 22m to Pounds 15m. Burger King's profits rose 29 per cent to Pounds 170m, also boosted by currency moves. Another 540 stores were opened, bringing the total to 7,121. GrandMet's share of losses at Inntrepreneur, the UK pub joint venture with Fosters Brewing, fell from Pounds 14m to Pounds 9m. The business is expected to break even this year, but each partner has had to inject Pounds 84.5m into it since September to ensure compliance with financial covenants. The group spent nearly Pounds 900m on advertising and marketing during the year. Sterling devaluation added Pounds 674m to net borrowings, lifting the total to Pounds 2.8bn and gearing to 75 per cent. The sale of Chef &amp; Brewer pubs in October is expected to reduce debt by Pounds 700m and gearing to 60 per cent. Earnings per share, before exceptionals, rose 4.6 per cent to 29.7p; after the charges they fell from 30.3p to 20p. A final dividend of 8.15p lifts the total 5.7 per cent to 13p.

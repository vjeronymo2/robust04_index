			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Attali proposes shake-up at EBRD MR Jacques Attali, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is proposing to create three new senior posts at the bank and radically change the functions of a fourth, in a far-reaching management reorganisation. His most radical proposal, contained in a paper submitted to the bank's board earlier this week, is that the development and merchant banking departments should be merged and then split into three 'operations departments', covering north central Europe, south central Europe and the former Soviet Union. It would be supported by an operations services group which would deal with co-operation funds and technical co-operation, co-financing, loan syndication, education and training and the environmental appraisal group. Each operations department would report to a new senior vice-president, who would also have the title of chief operating officer. On Monday Mr Attali told the 23 directors representing the 54 countries and agencies which own the bank that Mr Ernest Stern, the World Bank's number two, had 'agreed in principle' to be chief operating officer. At present the EBRD's merchant banking arm concentrates on financing private sector projects, while the development banking department deals with improving the infrastructure of central and eastern Europe. However, a review recently commissioned by Mr Attali complained that there was overlap between the two departments and that too little attention is paid to the needs of each country in EBRD assessments of projects. Mr Attali also wants to create a second senior vice-presidency in charge of the budget process, personnel and administration. This would probably be filled by Mr Mario Sarcinelli, vice-president in charge of development banking. The vice-president in charge of finance, Mr Anders Ljungh, would thus lose responsibility for the budget and policy planning activities but retain the treasury, credit and financial control functions. Mr Attali also wants to create a new vice-presidency for external and economic relations in an attempt to 'improve the bank's image and create a favourable and supportive climate of political and public opinion'. Mr Stern was asked whether he would become EBRD chief operating officer by the senior finance officials from the G7 leading industrial countries. The directors representing the European members of the G7, France, Germany and the UK, argued on Monday that the reorganisation should be pushed through as quickly as possible. However, most other directors resent what they see as the G7's high-handed intervention. They believe any decision should be delayed until after July 15, when the bank's audit committee reports to the board of directors on charges that the bank failed to control expenditure on furnishing its London headquarters, the use of private aircraft and other items. Many directors are also concerned, in the words of one, that the EBRD will 'evolve into the European arm of the World Bank'.</p>

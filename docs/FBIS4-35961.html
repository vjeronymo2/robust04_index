			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Jalal Talabani, secretary general of the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], announced last night,  Friday, through the PUK television and radio stations in the  region of Kurdistan a unilateral peaceful PUK initiative which  aims to end the current crisis and to normalize the situation in  the region.    This initiative aims to strengthen the spirit of brotherhood  and cordiality among the sons of Kurdistan and to continue the  reconstruction of what has been destroyed by the Iraqi regime's  aggressive and [word indistinct] policies. The initiative also  aims to consolidate the spirit of democratic freedoms and human  rights in Kurdistan and to enable the region's government and  elected parliament to exercise their work in the service of the  sons of Kurdistan.    The initiative stressed the need to strengthen the alliance  between the members of the Kurdistan Front, especially between  the PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP], so as to  proceed with the unification of all resources and capabilities  on solid bases and to direct them against our people's enemies  and the dictatorial regime in order to bring it down and  establish a democratic, federal, and pluralistic regime in Iraq.    Brother Talabani said in his announcement: To achieve these  noble and legitimate objectives, the PUK has, on its part,  decided the following:    1. To stop the fighting immediately and unconditionally, to  withdraw all the PUK forces from the areas of (?fighting), and  to return these forces to their former bases under the  supervision of the Kurdistan Front and the Unified Iraqi  National Congress [UINC].    2. To release all persons detained and arrested by the PUK.    3. To stop all forms of media campaign and not to reply to  media campaigns.    4. To let all government employees affiliated with the PUK  return to their departments immediately so as to extend their  services to the citizens.    The brother secretary general expressed his thanks and  gratitude to all the sons of Irbil for their noble feelings and  sincere efforts to calm and normalize the situation. He also  sincerely thanked the sons of al-Sulaymaniyah for their goodwill  efforts for that purpose. Brother Jalal expressed his gratitude  to all the officials and leaders of the parties in the Kurdistan  Front, the UNIC, the KDP, the PUK, and other Kurdish political  forces for their sincere efforts to put an end to the  extraordinary situation and normalize the situation as quickly  as possible. He also thanked the Kurdish and Iraqi parties,  especially the Assyrian and Turkmen ones, and also the  professional and mass organizations for their serious and great  efforts to tackle the problem, for their desire to uphold the  atmosphere of brotherhood, love, and cordiality, and for  presenting peaceful solutions to all the differences.    Brother Jalal Talabani called on all our people in Kurdistan  to act and to take the following facts into account:    1. To take care of the spirit of brotherhood and peace  between us in view of its positive effects at the domestic and  foreign level.    2. To achieve a comprehensive and general reconciliation  that will include all the parties in Kurdistan.    3. To condemn the violations of human rights and deviations  from Kurdish, revolutionary, and Islamic values and norms.    4. Not to squander the foreign support and backing by  speeding up the efforts to tackle problems, reorganize  ourselves, and let the region's government and parliament  perform their normal duties.    Brother Talabani referred to: the need to consolidate  security and to maintain the brotherly ties and the atmosphere  of cordiality and rapport in the region of Kurdistan; the need  to unite all the forces and efforts in order to confront the  plots of our people's enemies who want to thwart this  experiment, pour oil on fire, and sow sedition and conflict.    Brother Jalal called on all to rally and cooperate to entomb  these vile plots being hatched by our people's enemies and to  stand together in one trench against the enemies instead of  standing in opposing trenches.    He demanded the immediate and rapid implementation of the  clauses mentioned in the initiative.    Concluding his initiative, brother Jalal Talabani called on  the struggling masses of Kurdistan, all their political forces,  and all the faithful sons of our people to work together toward  consolidating law and order, strengthening democracy and human  rights, protecting our people's gains without being selfish, and  working together toward having a Kurdistan where we all enjoy  freedom, democratic, and human rights.</p>

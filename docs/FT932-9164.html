			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE RETURN of a more cautious mood due in part to uncertainty in European currency markets, and a sizeable selling order, sent stock index futures into decline, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 2,877, the same level as its previous close, and moved swiftly ahead. Within half-an-hour it was trading at 2,881, at which point it was showing a strong premium to the cash market. Sentiment was at this stage boosted by the reduction in French interest rates. A more cautious mood took hold at mid-morning which started the sporadic selling, and this gained strength as uncertainty in the cur-rency markets took hold. However, traders looked to Wall Street to lift sentiment in London. Weak US bond markets, due to the disappointing US inflation figures, caused a poor early performance on Wall Street which led to a further decline in London. The June contract fell further when a fairly big sell order from a leading US house was executed, and it touched a low for the day of 2,855. June closed at 2,860, just three points ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5. Turnover was poor at 7,095 contracts. In the traded options, volume continued to be healthy, reaching a total of 35,039 lots. The FT-SE 100 option saw 8,584 contracts dealt.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Bulmer declines to Pounds 3.9m - Loss on disposal of pectin side and UK provisions total Pounds 17.6m HP Bulmer, the Hereford cider maker which recently announced further restructuring plans including a withdrawal from the soft drinks market, yesterday reported a sharp decline in full-year pre-tax profits reflecting exceptional write-offs. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 3.88m in the year to April 29. The latest pre-tax figure was struck after the group recorded a Pounds 9.76m loss on the disposal of its pectin manufacturing interests, announced in November, and took a Pounds 7.84m provision to cover the fundamental restructuring of its UK operations, announced in May. However, profits before exceptional items increased by 9.8 per cent to Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 19.6m) reflecting the strength of the group's brands in the UK, Australia and Belgium, markets which have all faced increased competition and pressure on margins. In spite of these pressures operating margins from drinks activities continued to improve from 9.5 per cent to 10.4 per cent. Turnover edged up by 1 per cent to Pounds 254.6m (Pounds 251.8m) including Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 12.5m) from discontinued operations. The modest rise in turnover masked strong growth from the group's cider business which compensated for a decline in soft drinks following the termination of the Perrier/Buxton mineral water distribution agreement in March. After a reduced tax charge there were losses per share of 0.89p compared with earnings of 22.89p. In spite of this, the directors are recommending an increased 6.8p (6.4p) final dividend making a total for the year of 10.8p (10.15p). The shares closed 1p lower at 364p. Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said the results were 'a satisfactory performance in a competitive market.' He noted that the group's share of the important draught cider market in the UK continued to grow, reaching 55 per cent last year. Bulmer's on-trade volumes expanded by 3 per cent while buoyant Strongbow sales in the off-trade helped the group to boost volumes by 6 per cent in spite of strong growth at the economy end of the market. In the premium sector, Scrumpy Jack's 40 per cent year-on-year growth substantially outstripped sector growth of 12 per cent. Bulmer's beer portfolio volumes increased modestly within a market that continues to be highly competitive. Operating profits from the Australian business rose 25 per cent to Pounds 2.97m, while in its first full year Cidrerie Stassen in Belgium produced operating profits of Pounds 1.34m. COMMENT Bulmer's decision in May to restructure its business with the loss of up to 300 jobs is a sensible response to the competitive pressures in the domestic cider market which nevertheless is continuing to grow. The move will eventually take about Pounds 6.5m out of annual costs - funds which are expected to be reinvested at least in part in the group's solid brand portfolio. Overseas activities, including export sales from Hereford, now represent 21 per cent of group operating profits and the company is looking to increase this further. This year Bulmer's pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 24m producing earnings of 29p. The shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 12.55 and look fairly priced.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 0055 GMT on 10 March begins live coverage  of the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC] from the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.    Video opens with a close shot of a red-and-gold NPC emblem  hanging in front of backstage curtains on the rostrum; the  emblem is flanked by five red flags on each side. As the camera  slowly backs up to show the entire rostrum, an unidentified  female announcer introduces the broadcast as live coverage of  the opening of the NPC session. While she reviews the  achievements scored by the Chinese people over the past year  under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the leadership of the  CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, the camera  pans the spacious hall, where several thousand seats on the  first, second, and third floors are already filled.

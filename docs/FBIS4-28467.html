			<p>BFN     [Text] Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for  international trade, who is currently visiting Japan to  participate in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, granted an  interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN on 8 June. He indicated that he  plans to urge Japanese trade officials during future  negotiations to promptly implement deregulation measures,  saying: "The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton gives  solid support to deregulation efforts which have been undertaken  by the administrations of both former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and incumbent Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. We hope  that concrete progress can be made in one way or another within  the next few months."    Regarding the outlook on the resumed framework trade talks,  Garten said: "We expect tough negotiations. At the moment, I  cannot say whether the United States and Japan can reach a  satisfactory agreement." Thus, the U.S. official made reference  to the issue of deregulation, while indicating a cautious stance  on the prospects of the trade talks.    Garten also pointed out the problem of the gap in prices of  commodities in Japan and abroad, saying: "Prices in Japan are 80  percent higher than the average prices in other OECD member  nations. This is because there is a problem with the  distribution system in Japan."    Garten then said: "Deregulation is very important. It will  enable Japanese consumers to buy foreign products at lower  prices. It will also encourage personal spending, thereby  helping boost the Japanese economy all the more."</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> STUART'S MOTHER TO TESTIFY, PAPERS SAY  </P> <P> The mother of suspected wife killer Charles Stuart reportedly will testify this  week before the special grand jury trying to shed more light on the murder  case. Dorothy Stuart may also be asked to waive the attorney-client privilege  that prevents her son's lawyer from speaking out on the case, according to  reports in the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.  </P> <P> First Assistant Dist. Atty. Paul K. Leary told the Globe it appears the right  to waive the attorney-client privilege may be transferred from the client to  the client's legal representative after the client's death. Charles Stuart  committed suicide by leaping from a bridge Jan. 4 as police sought to arrest  him. The Suffolk County grand jury is investigating the shooting death of Carol  Stuart, a pregnant attorney, and subsequent revelations that her husband was  the likely culprit.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] As you know, the official visit to  the United States of America by Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's  president, took place from 3-7 March. Our special correspondent  Anatoliy Tabachenko reports. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] After the documents were signed a joint news  conference began, at which both presidents made statements.  Leonid Kravchuk said in particular:    [Begin Kravchuk recording] Ladies and gentlemen. We have  just put our signatures to a number of extremely important  bilateral documents, which create a legal basis for our  cooperation in the sphere of the economy, trade, and other  spheres. What one may without exaggeration call a historic  moment in relations between our states took place before your  own eyes a few minutes ago. Today we have in fact turned the  page in the still short history of our bilateral relations,  which seemed to connect us forever with the complex problem,  colossal in scale, of the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine  from the former [Soviet] Union. Although this problem remains  complex now, we have managed to bring it essentially and  substantially nearer to a (?successful resolution) by joint  efforts.    The new dislocation of forces on the political map of the  world has particularly demonstrated the necessity of creating a  global system of security, which would work in accordance with  new principles. We are aware that the complex processes of  international security and peace are interconnected and failures  or a vacuum in some or other part of the world cannot be  permitted, especially on the European continent.    For this very reason, I and President Bill Clinton agreed  that the political and economic security of Ukraine, which plays  an important and stabilizing role in its region, and this is not  just our opinion, is of equally exceptional significance both  for the people of Ukraine and for all of humanity, and (?for  Americans) too. Proceeding from this key idea, we understand  that relations between Ukraine and the United States of America  should be constructed as relations between friendly states,  which should have many more joint interests than differences.    During the talks with President Clinton, we were convinced  that the American side understands our problems and expresses  concern at the serious economic condition of Ukraine. We saw  that the U.S. Administration does not only hail the Ukrainian  Government's measures to overcome the economic crisis, but also  expresses readiness to render Ukraine the necessary assistance  in many directions of an economic orientation, as the President  has just said.    Today we signed a package of economic agreements and  accords,  which I hope will help Ukraine to considerably ease and  accelerate the movement to a market, remove the tension in the  economy, and (?also) in the daily life of our people. We have  been convinced that in America we have a friend, whom we need  and at the right time too. Today Ukraine is a friend, as they  say, in need, but a friend indeed, as your well-known American  saying goes. But I believe that the day will come when we will  truly recall these times as the era of the birth and  establishment of true friendship between the two peoples and  states of Ukraine and the United States of America. I thank you  for your attention. [applause]. [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] We used to smelt half of the former Soviet  Union's  cast iron and steel. [We have] great chemistry, Donbass, and  nuclear power engineering. All this creates preconditions which  require large resources, primarily energy resources, while these  energy resources are concentrated outside Ukraine, mainly in  Russia. In the last year and a half the prices for these  resources has risen a thousand-fold and more. [Words indistinct]  it is surprising how our economy could withstand it when energy  carrier prices have gone up by a thousand to fifteen hundred  times within such a short period. This is an important  objective cause of (?our difficulties).    We also have Chernobyl, with over 12 percent of the budget  spent on (?eliminating) the Chernobyl aftermath.  (?Historically), we (?inherited from) the Soviet Union immense  armed forces with over a million people. They have to be  reformed and reduced so that these people are provided [word  indistinct] socially and supplied with houses and so on and so  forth.    We now have another problem relating to the elimination of  nuclear weapons. There also is a problem of providing social  security for a great many people, to speak nothing of other  problems of our economy -- the links that were formed with the  former Soviet Union. Ukraine's economy was only a segment of  that great economy and this segment served as an assembly plant  in the Soviet Union or as a provider of part of the collective  deliveries that were mainly consummated in (?production) in  Russia.    All this now needs to be redone and reformed. The structure  of industry needs to be changed. This requires much expenditure  and will take some time. Our human, natural, technological and  scientific resources, however, are extraordinarily great.    We have not yet done everything as far as our legislation is  concerned, no. We have not managed to put everything into  practice to create preconditions for, shall we say, the economy  and the free movement of the workforce, capital and money to  develop jointly. The banking, financial and credit system has  not yet been worked out entirely. All this is now being  elaborated, detailed and reformed.    Clearly, this will be done quicker with the aid of  experienced people who are in this hall today and in the United  States of America in general, who will come to Ukraine and help  implement it and assist us by sharing their experience. We are  totally aware that nobody will pull Ukraine out of the economic  crisis except for its own self and its people. We, however,  also know that how quickly this can be done depends on whether  Ukraine has real financial, economic and investment aid or is  left face to face with its problems and grave consequences of  the past.    Politically, I am convinced Ukraine can and will play a  stabilizing part in Europe. It can become a state where  democracy, liberty, reforms, markets and transformations will  lead the way. All this is a must in our future. I am also  convinced Ukraine's future lies in its ties with European and  world financial and economic structures.    We also realize that the proportion of these ties today is  not determined in the Ukrainian economy. It is there, however,  where the future lies, because the development of society,  technological changes, scientific and technological  transformations are only possible on the basis of close ties  with advanced technologies, market and financial structures of  Europe, the world, the United States of America and other  countries that have much experience and great possibilities in  this respect.    Today, however, we also orient our economy toward the CIS  market because we know this market is a real one for the  economies of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and others. In other  words, all this has to happen gradually, by way of gathering  experience, accumulating capital and restructuring, shall we  say, industrial enterprises on a large scale through the  conversion of our military industrial complex. So I appeal to  you to understand the situation in Ukraine and realize its role,  its possibilities, and its potential. Politically, our visit to  the United States of America is exactly about expressly and  clearly determining the political attitude, including by the  United States of America, to Ukraine as a European state with a  great future. This great future much depends on how and what  emphasis is placed politically and economically by the great  world state of the United States of America.    I thank the people present here for their attention and can  answer your questions. [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] I (?want) to say that when meeting at the  Pentagon  in particular, and other places too, we did not just discuss the  volume of assistance, but the mechanisms for making use of it  too. For example, we agreed with the U.S. minister of defense  [as heard] that a considerable part of the assistance will go  toward housing for and the social protection of officers who  will be made redundant. Specific figures and time periods have  even been determined -- that is, the talk is now about the value  of the assistance and ways of making use of it, and so it was  with every route for this assistance.

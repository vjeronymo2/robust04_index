			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (2): Mr Zhu walks an economic tightrope - The government has eased monetary policy but inflation is still worryingly high Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier in charge of China's economy, has taken two large gambles since he assumed control of the central bank in July. First, he enforced a tough austerity programme in the full knowledge that it would make him a number of enemies within the government and in the provinces and make it harder to force through the structural economic reforms. Then, having taken the heat out of the inflationary boom, Mr Zhu bowed to pressure and eased monetary policy earlier than international lending institutions like the the World Bank would have preferred. This risks a resurgence of inflation and an eventual hard landing. The inflationary pressures which became evident in the first half of this year suggested then that a hard landing might be necessary. Last year's economic performance was impressive: economic growth of 12.8 per cent, inflation under 5 per cent and a current account surplus. But prices for raw materials such as steel and cement showed sharp gains partly because of a boom in the real estate market as banks lent heavily, and often illegally, to property companies. Economic growth was 14 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year before. In the same period, investment in fixed assets rose 62 per cent and inflation accelerated to 14 per cent nationwide and 21 per cent in the larger cities. The government's 16 point plan, announced in July following a first, modest increase in interest rates in May, aimed to take the heat out of a growing speculative property boom. Many measures enforced government regulation which local central bank branches and provincial governments had ignored. Up to 1,000 new development zones were closed by the middle of August. The biggest economic shock came not from the further rise in interest rates, but an administrative order from the central bank in Beijing that illegal inter-bank loans should be repaid to state banks. 'The only way to tighten credit was to pull the firewood out of the stove,' says Mr Lu Baifu, director of the State Council's Development Research Centre. But, unable to liquidate their real-estate lending, banks clamped down on lending to state enterprises, who receive 70 per cent of state banks loans and rely on credit for working capital. Enterprise deposits at the banks fell by Yn28bn in June, Yn34bn in July and Yn10.6bn in August. Broad money supply contracted in the summer months, and the swap market exchange rate appreciated from its summer low. The measures have restored some sort of order. Fixed asset investment, which grew by 68.5 per cent in the first eight months, actually fell by 10.4 per cent in August from July. Growth of industrial output slowed in September to 19.1 per cent compared with the same month of 1992, compared with 22.6 per cent growth in the entire third quarter over the samer quarter of 1992. Annual-rate inflation in the 35 big cities was 20.7 per cent in September, down from 23.3 per cent in July, while prices of key commodities are falling - steel prices fell 34 per cent in the third quarter. The effect of the credit squeeze was felt most severely by state enterprises, many of whom found themselves unable to pay wages and complained bitterly to regional and national officials that they were being unfairly treated. The result was strong political pressure on the central bank to ease credit. An example of this view came from Mr Dong Fureng, a member of the standing committee of the National People's Congress. 'Personally, I think Zhu Rongji's macro control measures should be more flexible,' he said last month. 'Banks should quicken steps to provide loans to troubled enterprises.' Policy has, in fact, been eased progressively since the summer, as Mr Li Lanqing, vice premier, confirmed recently: 'There is no disagreement in the Chinese leadership,' he said. 'We are going to loosen credit a little for profitable state enterprises and the agricultural sector.' Moreover, Mr Zhou Zhengqing, central bank deputy governor, told a Beijing newspaper in October that the central bank had increased the supply of base money by Yn10bn in August and September, compared with Yn1.46bn in the same period last year. 'This should permit the banks to increase loans during the fourth quarter,' he said, although credits would flow initially to profitable enterprises. Inefficient enterprises would first have to demonstrate that they had taken steps to reduce reliance on credit. But the risk remains that Mr Zhu has eased too early. Urban inflation is more than 20 per cent while demand pressures persist. The trade deficit rose to Dollars 6.97bn in the first nine months, with import volumes up 29.9 per cent compared with export growth of just 6.6 per cent. The World Bank estimates that China can sustain growth of 8 per cent a year without overheating, but the government is still expecting 12 per cent growth this year. In short, the underlying inflationary momentum has probably been suppressed rather than cured. The government claims that illegal interbank borrowing has stopped and that half of the illegal loans have been recovered. But Mr Lu Baifu of the Development Research Centre is less sure. 'The fundamental problem has not been solved. Money growth is still too high, the demand for investment is still too high, and inflation is still too high,' he said. Mr Zhu has, of course, a wider reform agenda to pursue which would be jeopardised by too tough a stance on inflation. One western official in Beijing says: 'Zhu Rongji never talks of stabilisation, only of a re-adjustment of the structure of lending. The government does not want a draconian contraction, just a modest tightening.' Mr Zhu is walking a tightrope, risking being seen to be too tough and too soft at the same time. It is too early to tell whether he will remain sufficiently popular to see his reforms passed - and yet remain tough enough to keep the lid on inflation. But Mr Zhu is still walking.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A RACT analysis has been performed for the limit of 2.6 lb VOC emissions/1,000 pounds of dry organic resin produced set for Monsanto and has been found to be comparable to a RACT limit set for a similar Monsanto facility in Massachusetts and is therefore approvable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 631(6) seems ambiguous as to what information is necessary to determine compliance because of the presence of the wording ``information may include.'' The State has provided EPA with all of the compliance orders for all of the facilities affected by this rule and they have been reviewed to determine if sufficient information is included to determine compliance with this rule. EPA has found all of the compliance orders to contain sufficient information to determine compliance. All facilities are required to keep sufficient records for determination of compliance with this rule. Rule 702(d), described later in this package, requires new sources which could fall under this category to meet the same emission limits as existing sources in this category. The State has also written a letter, dated July 13, 1994, that clarifies the intent of this rule is to require new sources to meet not only the same emission limits as existing sources but also to meet the same recordkeeping and reporting requirements as existing sources as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> O. Rule 632&blank;(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Automobile, Truck, and Business Machine Plastic Part Coating Lines)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has expanded the geographic limits of these rules to cover all of the moderate nonattainment counties in the State. The cross-line averaging provisions of this rule have been removed. Recordkeeping requirements have been changed to be more stringent than previously required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> P. Rule 702&blank;(General Provisions for new Sources of Volatile Organic Compound Missions)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has added a provision stating that new sources of VOCs shall be limited to the lowest emission rate listed in the following: (1) The maximum allowable emission rate listed by a commission on its own initiative or based upon the application of the best available control technology; (2) the maximum allowable emission rate specified by a new source performance standard promulgated by the EPA; (3) the maximum allowable emission rate specified as a condition of a permit to install or a permit to operate; or (4) the limit for this source category as is listed in the rules for existing sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Q. R 336.2004&blank;Appendix A; Reference Test Methods; Adoption of Federal Reference Test Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this appendix, the State has added the following Federal Reference Test Methods to the list of those already adopted by reference:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Method 1A_Sample and velocity traverses for stationary sources with small stacks or ducts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Method 2A_Direct measurement of gas volume through pipes and small ducts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Method 2C_Determination of stack gas velocity and volumetric flow rate in small stacks and ducts (standard pitot tube).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Method 2D_Measurement of gas volumetric flow rates in small pipes and ducts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Method 10B_Determination of carbon monoxide from stationary sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> R.

Appropriate methods are described for the various coating lines whose emission limits may be expressed differently from one another depending on the method of compliance being used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State requires that for sources subject to emission limits expressed as pounds of VOCs per gallon of coating, minus water, as applied, the phrase ``minus water'' shall also include compounds which are used as organic solvents and which are excluded from the definition of volatile organic compound.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For calculations required by this rule, the State requires the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Not less than 5 significant digits shall be carried in intermediate calculations. Rounding shall occur after final calculations and emission numbers will be rounded to not less than 2 but not more than 3 significant figures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The calculations for a coating line shall include all of the coatings which are in the same coating category and which are used during the averaging period as specified in the applicable limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In most cases, the calculations for a graphic arts line shall include all of the inks and coatings that are used during the averaging period as specified in the applicable emission limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State describes the methods by which the VOC content of inks and coatings, and the weight of VOCs used during an averaging period shall be determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> U.

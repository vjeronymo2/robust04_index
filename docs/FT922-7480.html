			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Not third Sir, John Willman's article on local government ('Lifting the lid on a Pandora's box', May 14) was most interesting. However, I would like to draw attention to one point. He refers to the Conservative party's 'third position in Scottish politics'. In the recent general election the Conservatives won the second largest number of seats in Scotland and also took the second largest share of the vote in Scotland. That was also the case in the 1987 general election. The Conservative party is therefore clearly in second place in Scottish politics.

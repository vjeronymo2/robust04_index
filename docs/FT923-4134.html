			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Lib Dems demand schools reform ABOLITION of England's local education authorities was proposed yesterday by the Liberal Democrats, making theirs the first opposition party to accept the end of the structure under which the schools system has been managed since 1902. The Liberal Democrats wish to see elected 'education departments' with closely circumscribed responsibilities for monitoring standards, promoting quality and strategic planning - and for arbitrating in disputes between head teachers and school governors. However, the party rejects the government's plan for a single national education quango to oversee grant-maintained schools. Its departments would be elected and based on local communities. Mr Don Foster, the party's education spokesman, said: 'we want to increase the independence of all schools, so that each can develop its own distinctive ethos and style, liberated from the strictures of local education authority control.' The Liberal Democrats also advocate the replacement of A-levels with an 'English baccalaureate' bringing vocational and academic subjects together in a single structure. Students at the post-16 level would study a compulsory 'core' of English, maths, a science and a modern language. Employers would be obliged to give all employees up to the age of 19 at least two days a week off to study for national vocational qualifications. A general teaching council would be established to promote the professional status of teachers, oversee standards and advise the government. The party calls for the school teachers' pay review body to assess 'realistically' the need for improved salaries, but rejects proposals to link teacher appraisal to pay as the government proposes. The party makes a commitment to increasing student numbers to 2m by the year 2000 while abolishing the student loans scheme. Although it pledges to 'match the expansion with additional resources', the funding implications of an increase of that order are not discussed in detail.

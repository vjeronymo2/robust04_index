			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BET OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> RAIN IN A STICK  </P> <P> THE GROUND IS PARCHED, but the lush, tropical sound of rain splashing to the  ground is luxuriously elongated. It stops, it starts, it rushes and then it  lingers.  </P> <P> An instrument native to South America, the rain stick is the source of this  water music. Locally, it is the product of instrument maker Gino Zenobia and  comes in varying sizes: from 3 1/2-foot bamboo stalks to dramatic seven-foot  lengths ($60 to $125 without exterior adornment; carved and painted, the price  can run up to $250). "We hammer in inch- to 1 1/2-long pegs," Zenobia explains,  "then we cap one end and fill it with seashells, rocks and beans. Not  everything will sound like rain."  </P> <P> Zenobia, a drummer fascinated with African and other ethnic rhythms, started by  modifying instruments and building those he couldn't find. Today he produces  about 50 types of percussion instruments, among them the Brazilian berimbau,  African slit drums, African talking drums and the Australian didjeridu, a long  tube that makes buzzing, humming sounds -- "a prehistoric, primeval sound,"  Zenobia says.  </P> <P>  Zenobia Music, by appointment only; (714) 494-7636.  </P> <P> LORETTA K.PARAGUASSU  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Medical insurance tax relief costs soar The cost to the government of giving tax relief on private medical insurance for the over-60s is still rising rapidly in spite of moves in last year's Budget to limit the rate of the relief to 25 per cent. A written answer last week by Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, put the cost of the relief in 1994-95 at Pounds 95m - up from Pounds 80m in 1993-94. Last November, the Inland Revenue said the cost in 1994-95 was expected to be 'around Pounds 85m'. The Revenue yesterday said that the premiums charged by private-sector insurers had gone up much more than expected. Sir George's answer - in response to a written question by Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York - also revealed that the annual cost of providing the relief has more than doubled since its introduction in April 1990.</p>

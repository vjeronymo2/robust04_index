			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Interagra applies to court for bankruptcy protection INTERAGRA, the French farming products business which was one of the most prominent western suppliers of grain and food to eastern Europe during the cold war, yesterday filed for bankruptcy protection. The company, founded in 1955 by the late Jean-Baptiste Doumeng, known as le milliardaire rouge, the red billionaire, has applied to the Paris commercial court for protection. The court will announce its judgment on Tuesday. In its heyday Interagra made annual sales of up to FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) by selling the European Community's 'food mountain' - surplus supplies of subsidised grain, meat, dairy products and powdered milk - to communist countries. Mr Doumeng built up the business by exploiting his personal connections with eastern bloc leaders. He was one of the handful of western businessmen, alongside Mr Armand Hammer, the US-based oil trader, and Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced British media tycoon, to operate successfully in the old communist bloc. But Interagra has floundered since Mr Doumeng's death in 1987. His sons, Michel and Jean-Baptiste, who took over the business, did not have the advantage of their father's contacts. The final blows were the collapse of the Soviet Union and the UN embargo on trading with Iraq during the Gulf war, which sealed off one of its main markets for wheat and meat. Interagra's annual sales have fallen to just FFr5bn a year and its debts have risen rapidly to the present level of FFr500m. The management has for some months been in discussion with its banks, which include the Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the French state-controlled banks, in an unsuccessful attempt to secure new finance. Four of the old Doumeng businesses, including the Seav Interagra tractor company and Silos du Sud-Oest farm machinery maker, are already under court administration. Sepromec, the Interagra parent company, and SCIII, one of its trading subsidiaries, have also applied for bankruptcy protection.</p>

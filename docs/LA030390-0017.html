			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITS IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Before I read Arkatov's interview, I was planning to see Margolyes' one-woman  show. Now I'm not, and I'm grateful that Margolyes herself warned me off.  </P> <P> I'm one of those rare (according to her) Americans with an attention span  longer than 20 minutes, one of those nearly nonexistent Americans who knows who  Charles Dickens is.  </P> <P> During my 20 years in New York City, I got to see plenty of bad, much-praised  British theater, dumbed-down and condescendingly performing, the actors  flirting with the supposed transoceanic yokels in the audience instead of  serving the text and playing to each other.  </P> <P> I hope someone made a tape of "Wooman" in England; I'll wait for the real thing  on PBS or Bravo or A&amp;E.  </P> <P> FRANK DWYER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

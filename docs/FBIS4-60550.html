			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dan Avidan] </F>   [Text] Middle East expert, Professor Shim'on Shamir, said  yesterday that to completely resolve the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict, the Israeli Government must make several gestures to  the Palestinians in the context of the permanent arrangement.    Shamir said these gestures should primarily include Israeli  sanction of some sort of Palestinian national foothold in East  Jerusalem. "I do not believe the Palestinians can be brought to  end the conflict with us entirely unless they have a collective  foothold in East Jerusalem," Shamir said.    He added that the foothold could be in the form of national  institutions, a functional partition of the united city, or the  like. Unless the Palestinians are given some foothold in East  Jerusalem, the Muslim world will declare a holy war (jihad) for  the liberation of Israeli-held holy Muslim sites in Jerusalem,  Prof. Shamir warned.    He argued that granting the Palestinians some kind of  dominion in East Jerusalem is one of the steps the Israeli  Government must take to give the Palestinians a sense of having  achieved a just arrangement attaining at least some of their  national goals. Otherwise, the agreements which the Israeli  Government and the Palestinians have signed or are expected to  sign will be unstable and short lived.    In the framework of these steps, Prof. Shamir said, the  Government of Israel will have to accede to several other  Palestinian demands: to withdraw from most of the West Bank and  Gaza without leaving large settlement enclaves behind; to  recognize in principle the diaspora Palestinians' right of  return to the West Bank and Gaza territories in which a  Palestinian entity will be eventually established; to permit the  Palestinians to enjoy a sense of temporary sovereignty in the  West Bank and Gaza before they forge a confederative alliance  with Jordan.    Prof. Shamir said that these terms are difficult for Israel,  but unless they are met, the conflict between us and the  Palestinians will continue and become more extreme because in  the meantime, the Palestinians will have acquired a political  foothold in the territories, including security forces and a  police, as well as international recognition as an "incipient  state."    Prof. Shamir said that in general, the present time offers  Israel, the Arab states, and the Palestinians a genuine  opportunity to reach peace agreements. The opportunity stems  from the changes the Arab world has undergone in the last  decade, the most prominent of which is the supportive approach  of new technocratic pro-West elites, which seek to end the  Israeli-Arab conflict in a bid to build a stable Middle East in  which economic activities can be safely conducted. Yet the  prospects of turning this opportunity into reality largely  depends on the parties' willingness to pay the necessary price.    Reserve Major General Shlomo Gazit said in his lecture that  in his opinion, nuclear weapons will be introduced to the Arab  Middle East in the near future. He asserted that a new  strategic environment has emerged in the Middle East  facilitating political negotiations and the attainment of peace  accords between Israel and the Arabs. This situation evolved in  the wake of several global and regional changes over the past  few years, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union and the  end of the era of pan-Arab ideology in the region.    He argued that the sides -- Israel and the Arabs -- should  hurry to achieve peace arrangements lest the congenial strategic  environment change again. Unless political arrangements are  achieved soon, the militant Islamic stream may grow and possibly  come to power and form the leadership of some Arab countries and  in the Palestinian public. If that happens, the conflict will  evolve into confrontation between Judaism and Islam and become  far more radical.    Gazit warned that a recurrence of the Hebron massacre at  holy  Muslim sites in East Jerusalem would provoke a jihad against  Israel. According to him, the peace accords will on the one hand  lower the Arabs' motivation to launch war, but on the other  hand, the Arabs may be tempted to launch a surprise attack in  the wake of the expected Israeli withdrawal from a considerable  part of the territories. Gazit maintained that such a threat  can be thwarted by reliable security arrangements that will  strengthen, rather than weaken Israel following withdrawal.    Prof. Shamir and Gen. Gazit made these observations during  the annual symposium held by the Jaffee Center for Strategic  Studies at Tel Aviv University in memory of former Chief of  Staff David El'azar.</p>

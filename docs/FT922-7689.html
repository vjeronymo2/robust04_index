			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Makers ride the recession - Industry continues to tick over nicely / Marketing THE WORLD'S watchmakers are coping well with the recession. No big company has gone out of business and global production rose in 1991. Attitudes have changed considerably. In most western countries, consumers take much more trouble over the choice of their watches than they did. The arrival of the Swiss plastic Swatch 10 years ago (100m had been produced by last month) provided the catalyst for change and led to watches attracting much more attention than ever before. Indeed, Swatch marked a turning point in the fortunes of the Swiss industry, which had suffered from Japanese domination of quartz watch production in the 1970s. There were suggestions at the end of the 1980s that the popularity of the Swatch had peaked. But sales have continued to rise and it has become a cult product. Industry insiders tell the story about one American dealer who took a gamble two years ago and agreed to exchange an 18ct Patek Philippe rose gold watch for a Swatch Jellyfish. Today, the dealer and his customer from Italy joke about the remarkable state of affairs in which the plastic Jellyfish has a higher auction value than the gold Patek. This bizarre deal highlights the two most interesting sections of the watch market. The Swatch has become highly sought-after by collectors: even some of those who traditionally have been attracted to some of the finest watches ever made collect the modern plastic watch, too. In Italy, some Swatch models are in such demand that a black market has developed. But it is elusive almost everywhere. This unlikely obsession with inexpensive Swatches has not hurt the rest of the trade. Top-quality gold watches have ridden out the recession more successfully than most fashion items, and some manufacturers have waiting lists of years, rather than weeks or months, for their most prized pieces. Swiss and Japanese manufacturers each have concentrated on clearly-defined market goals. Citizen and Seiko have put their efforts into developing technically-advanced quartz movements which can be produced in vast numbers. Nobody could fault the quality of these or the cases, and they offer good value for money. Although both companies would like to break into the luxury end of the market, they have failed to make as much progress as they would like. But they have put much effort into broadening their appeal and selling more watches at prices up to about Pounds 500. Their technically-advanced movements have played a big part in this drive. While the Swiss have had phenomenal success with Swatch, they also reign supreme in finest gold watches through a comnbination of styling and the excellence of their quartz and mechanical movements. Ironically, the Japanese market is very important for many top-line Swiss brands. One Swiss company, Tagheuer, has made particularly strong progress. In the past seven years, its turnover has increased sevenfold. The decisive factors in its success have been demand in the sports market - which is its speciality - and the ability to define a clear and precise marketing strategy, as well as developing a strong product line. Its links with the McLaren motor-racing team helped it gain publicity and it is now the official timekeeper for Formula 1. Hong Kong has produced huge numbers of watches over the past 10 or 15 years but these mainly have been digital - and the market for those is shrinking. Earlier this month a British company, Time Products, announced it had closed Remex, its Hong Kong watch subsidiary, because it was no longer competitive against the Swiss and Japanese. A potential new watch giant is, however, starting to flex its muscles - not in Europe, Hong Kong or Taiwan, but in India. Titan Watch, a division of the country's largest company, decided in 1985 to open a watch factory. Two years later it was in full production, using machinery supplied by France Ebauches and Citizen. By the end of 1991, Titan had well over 60 per cent of the Indian quartz watch market. It plans to enter the UK and French markets at the beginning of 1993, placing a strong emphasis on design, market research, advertising and all the other ingredients which are vital to the establishment of a new brand. Already, the factory in Tamil Nadu employs 2,000 people and is one of the best-equipped and most modern in the world. When Titan comes to Europe, it will do so not with cheap watches but with a range designed by some of Europe's top designers. Titan is now beginning to produce its first prototypes in gold.</p>

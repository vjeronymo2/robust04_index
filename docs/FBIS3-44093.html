Only one of them is in this body.    Mr. Kobus Beyers, MP for Virginia, is the only senior member  from the OFS. The rest are from the Transvaal.    All the significant right-wing leaders, including AWB  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche,  constitute part of the right-wing transitional cabinet. CP  [Conservative Party] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg will be the  "president".    HNP [Reformed National Party] leader Jaap Marais is the only  right-wing leader not serving in the transitional authority.    Our correspondent in Bloemfontein reports that the OFS  right-wing contingent, who complained yesterday, were  particularly perturbed about the omission of OFS members such as  Parys's MP Pieter Gous and OFS CP leader Abrie Ooosthuizen. It  was disclosed to BEELD that Brakpan MP and the party's former  parliamentary chief whip, Frank le Roux, is the speaker of the  transitional authority.    The two deputy chairmen are Mr. Casper Uys, MP for  Barberton,  and Reverend Mossie van den Berg, chairman of Radio Pretoria.    MP for Brits, Mr. Andrew Gerber, is the chief whip.    The other whips are Mr. Karel Schoeman, MP for Nigel; Mr.  Daan du Plessis, MP for Roodeplaat; and Mr. Beyers.    BEELD has also been told that the AVF's [Afrikaner National  Front] Executive Committee, composed of 12 members, will form  the cabinet with the four members of the Directorate of Generals  of the AVF.    The Executive Committee consists of Dr. Hartzenberg --  chairman; Dr. Willie Snyman, CP deputy leader; Mr. Fanie van der  Westhuizen of Pretoria as treasurer; Mr. Jurg Prinsloo, MP for  Roodepoort; Mr. Jan Hoon, MP for Kuruman; Mr. Dries Bruwer, MP  for Lydenburg and chairman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union;  Mr. Cor de Jager of the Mine Workers' Union; Mr. Nic Celliers,  director of the Iron and Steel Trade Union; Mr. Terreblanche;  Prof. Ben van Rensburg, president of the Transvaal Municipal  Association; Dr. Wally Grant; and Mr. Douw Steyn of Nelspruit.    The directorate consists of General Constand Viljoen who is  chairman, Lieut. General Kobus Visser; and Major General Tienie  Groenewald.    Closer cooperation regarding the "cabinet" and the  "ministers'" portfolios will be announced at a rally on 27  January in Pretoria. Representatives from about 200 city  councils, who have already expressed their approval for an  Afrikaner homeland, will also be present.</p>

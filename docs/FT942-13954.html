			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Have I Got News For You (10.00 BBC2) returns: the satirical news quiz in which, unforgettably, Paul Merton nominated a tub of lard to be his team mate when Roy Hattersley withdrew at the last minute. Harry Thompson, the programme's producer, has said that it is almost impossible to persuade anyone in the government to take part. Oh, dear, what can the matter be? Guests joining Paul Merton and Ian Hislop in the new series will include - I hope - Alan Clark, he of the diaries and the actualite. A new series of May to December (8.30 BBC1) begins with the shocking news that Hilary, dishy-dizzy secretary to solicitors Callender and Callender, has left her job 'to spend more time with my Derek' on the Isle of Wight. (Derek's present address is Parkhurst.) Hilary will be much missed by viewers not always charmed to the bone by this wholesome saga of second-time-around Alec and his much younger Zoe. Doctor Finlay's Casebook (9.00 ITV) is awash with a wedding at Tannochbrae - and Delia Smith's Summer Collection (BBC2 7.15) assures us that 'All the world loves an ice-cream'.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A JAMES HARRELL AND PAUL ARMSTRONG: GOING TO MARKET IN EAST BLOC;  </P> <P> POLITICAL CHANGES CAN MEAN PROFITS FOR WESTERN BUSINESS  </P> <P> As the Iron Curtain has crumbled over the past several months, local  businessmen James Harrell and Paul Armstrong have been devouring all the news  they can about the fast-paced changes sweeping the Soviet Union and the rest of  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> During the past year, both Harrell and Armstrong have formed separate companies  with the idea of tapping the potential created by the extraordinary political  and economic changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The two fledgling companies have yet to strike up any major business deals in  Eastern Europe. But both men believe they are getting in on the ground floor of  a market that could offer significant potential during this decade.  </P> <P> Harrell, 37, is one of three local founders of Intertrade, an international  marketing and management firm in Laguna Niguel. The other founders are Kim  Martello and Robert Ludovise.  </P> <P> Until now, Intertrade's primary activity has been in the area of commodities  trading. The company organized a $2.1-million transaction that involved  shipping manure from the Soviet Union to Brazil.  </P> <P> Intertrade currently is involved in negotiating several joint venture deals in  Poland, none of which has been completed. Among the projects in the works are  deals to establish a small medical clinic at a Polish hospital in cooperation  with the Polish government, and another that involves setting up a biomedical  research center. The firm also hopes to complete a nonprofit venture to donate  a large number of typewriters to Romania.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is that there are plenty of opportunities for companies right in  our own back yard (in Orange County) to deal with Eastern Europe," Harrell  said.  </P> <P> A native of Huntington Beach, Harrell also runs a one-man consulting company  specializing in cross-cultural management. Harrell is a former executive with  World Vision who has set up relief projects in Cambodia for the Monrovia,  Calif.-based international development agency. He formerly worked for the  Defense Department as a Flemish interpreter in Belgium.  </P> <P> Armstrong, 31, is a founder of RHA Group, a business services firm specializing  in the Soviet Union. In October, RHA opened an office in Moscow headed by  Andrei Lefebvre, a Moscow native who formerly headed a public relations and  marketing company in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Before founding RHA in July, Armstrong helped organize a recent effort by  Irvine-based American PC to sell personal computers to the Soviet Union. He  left the company before the deal was announced in September by Phoenix Group  International, an Irvine firm that owns a majority interest in American PC.  </P> <P> RHA's first project in the Soviet Union involves organizing weeklong,  industry-specific tours for Western business people.  </P> <P> In a recent interview with Times staff writer David Olmos, Harrell and  Armstrong discussed the topic of doing business in the Soviet Union and Eastern  Europe and offered some suggestions for companies interested in getting  involved in those countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. After last year's events in Eastern Europe, many people are talking about  doing business there these days. How do you view the opportunities for doing  business over there?  </P> <P> A. Harrell: I think that we make the common mistake in this country when we  lump lots of nations together. We do it when we refer to Asia. It's similar to  referring to someone as Caucasian. Eastern Europe is a mix of lots of different  economies. They have been under alliance economically as the Warsaw Pact. But  that started dissolving eight to 10 years ago. In some nations, there is  tremendous opportunity immediately. In other nations, the opportunity is there  but the infrastructure for developing a trading base isn't in place. Ask  yourself what it would be like if for most of your life you had not been  allowed to trade freely -- to apply your energy to making a profit for  yourself, your company or your family -- and then suddenly the restrictions  were removed and you could trade freely. That's the potential for Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> Q. We hear a lot about how difficult it is for Western business people to do  business in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from an everyday standpoint.  How difficult is it?  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: In the Soviet Union, there is a lack of structure and a lack of  business knowledge of things we take for granted, such as letters of credit,  the cost of money, interest rates and ownership. These simple matters can turn  into difficult and complex problems. But this is all part of what we consider a  long-term approach. We're hoping the people we deal with in those countries  learn these business concepts and the structures we need in order to do  business successfully. I was in the Soviet Union for a week in December. Just  getting out of the hotel and finding a taxi was a nightmare. It took a  half-hour to flag down a taxi. Getting a document faxed or photocopied can turn  into a two-hour ordeal. And once you find a copier or fax, there's the question  of whether the machine works. If you want to make a phone call to the United  States from Moscow, you usually have to order the call a day in advance.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: There are very limited lines of access. In Poland, for example, of  149 phone lines into the country, there are only 37 outgoing lines. This is  because of decades of conditioning where people have not been encouraged to be  productive. It was not in your best interest to be productive or  entrepreneurial because your actions might be suspect. This is a mentality that  has to change. With our company, we find we are providing primarily financial  and managerial expertise. In Poland they have some of the most skilled  professionals in Eastern Europe because they trained in the West. But they got  back to Poland and did hard labor work because you made more money. There was  no motivation to be a doctor or other professional.  </P> <P> Q. Don't these everyday problems related to doing business in Eastern Europe --  for example, the poor phone service or shortage of business equipment -- also  create opportunities for American companies?  </P> <P> A. Harrell: There is a tremendous shortage of hotel rooms in the Soviet Union  and all over Eastern Europe. Intertrade was recently negotiating with an agency  that was given sole rights for the city of Moscow to develop a 500- to 700-acre  site for a hotel and business center. At this point, there is no real place for  international business people to come and have conferences and learn about  markets and prepare for doing business. We are having similar negotiations for  a hotel and conference center in Warsaw.  </P> <P> Q. What about the potential for supplying consumer products to the Soviet Union  or Eastern Europe?  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: There is lots of potential, but the question is, what are the  high-priority items? Is a television or a VCR a high-priority item compared to  feeding people? Nevertheless, every now and then there is a huge order from  these countries for consumer items such as razor blades or stockings or things  like that.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: Look at what the East Germans were buying in the West after the  Berlin Wall came down. They were buying fresh fruit like bananas and oranges.  The Western mind often confuses luxury items versus necessity items. Our life  style is such that having a TV is virtually a necessity to us. Obviously, to  people of a different life style, that's the last thing they'd consider.  Necessity items are those things that will either feed them today or feed them  tomorrow.  </P> <P> Q. There are a lot of computer, biomedical and biotechnology companies in  Orange County. Based on your experiences in Eastern Europe, do you see these as  areas of opportunity for local companies?  </P> <P> A. Harrell: I think there is great potential in Orange County in those areas.  But here are two main issues companies must face. One is that the technology  must be appropriate to the country. Some of our technology might be more  advanced than what the lesser-developed countries of Eastern Europe actually  need. The second issue is that most high-tech goods will have to be paid for in  hard currency. Very few computer companies are willing to trade computers for  steer manure. That's where companies such as Intertrade can step in, by  bartering commodities that allow these countries to obtain the hard currency.  Also, Orange County firms will have to make sure their products are  competitively priced on the world market, because the Japanese and others will  be trying to sell there too.  </P> <P> Q. If you were going to give some specific tips to business people for doing  business in Eastern Europe, what would you tell them?  </P> <P> A. Harrell: More than just selling a specific product, Orange County  entrepreneurs will make a foothold in Moscow or Warsaw or Prague if they're  able to go in knowing the culture, being sensitive to the business practices  and being flexible in negotiations.  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: When you go into these markets, you cannot expect to come out  with a deal. A company must go in and anticipate that it will take a year or 18  months to get a contract, big or small. You have to cultivate business and  personal relationships. You need to get to the point where these people are  comfortable with you and don't think you're going to leave them high and dry.  </P> <P> Q. So the factor of trust between the negotiating parties is more important in  these countries?  </P> <P> A. Harrell: Culturally, countries such as the Soviet Union or the cultures of  Asia and Latin America base their relationships on trust. A written contract is  icing on the cake. Putting something in writing means much less than having a  trust relationship develop. From our Western linear perspective, our culture  wants to have something in writing to verify an agreement. If you're going to  do business in Moscow or Warsaw, the tendency will be that the negotiation will  be ongoing. What you get on paper might look to a Western investor as something  that is non-negotiable. It will look very rudimentary and very unsophisticated.  But it's what's behind the piece of paper in the negotiations that's important.  If you just keep that frame of mind, you can be successful.  </P> <P> Q. Any other tips you have to offer? What about the importance of having a  representative in the country where you're doing business?  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: You have to follow up on your business deals. It's important to  have your own office or a representative over there who can knock on doors. You  need to have someone who is oriented toward Western concepts of business, that  time is money.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: It's absolutely essential to have some point of contact. It isn't  like going shopping at the local mall. You really have to know through your  contact the atmosphere, the awareness within the business environment and the  necessary officials. The conditions are changing so rapidly within the last  five or six months. Not only is it changing in each country, but it's also  changing regionally because of global attitudes that have changed during the  past few months.  </P> <P> Q. How about the facilities that exist?  </P> <P> A. Harrell: I think there is something analogous in Eastern Europe to what  happened after World War II in Western Europe. Basically, an infrastructure  doesn't exist. Everything that now is available will be new. They will have new  modern technology in the new facilities that will house joint ventures or  manufacturing plants because they don't really have existing buildings to be  used. They don't have car dealerships; they need cars. They don't have things  that we take for granted. Anything now going into Eastern Europe now is  relatively new. So as their structures are put into place, they will be far  superior to most of those in the rest of Europe. What you're looking at are  societies and economies that have been without structure from the standpoint of  privatization. They have not been private. So, the slate is clean and it's time  now to help build structures in those countries.  </P> <P> Q. Are there differences between opportunities in Soviet Union and Eastern  Europe?  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: In Poland and Hungary, they've had this economic evolution of  being closer to the West for 10 or 20 years. In the Soviet Union, which has  been so isolated, one of the problems we have now is that they don't have a  clue. It's going to take five to 10 years just to shift the bureaucracy. We all  know how difficult it is to change these huge bureaucracies and how they have  their own inertia.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: I think the Soviet Union in that way is a very different picture  from most of the smaller nations in Eastern Europe. The structure that does  exist is so big that getting that to change will not be as easy -- nor will it  happen so quickly -- as it has in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Q. No one really predicted that the political and economic changes in Eastern  Europe would happen so quickly. Using last year's crackdown on the  pro-democracy movement in China as an example of how a situation can quickly  reverse directions, is there some concern that a similar thing could occur in  Eastern Europe?  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: People feel a strong tie toward Western Europe and toward the  West in general. They see what the West has done economically, and many people  want something similar. They see themselves as nations that have stagnated  economically for 40 years and now there is time to be like everyone else. In  China, you don't have the telecommunications, you don't have the Western  European television, you don't have the influx of Western Europeans into the  country.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: It's a historical and cultural issue. There is absolutely no  similarity between what happened in China and what happened in Eastern Europe.  I believe that what has happened to date will not stop, depending on the nation  involved. There are large numbers of ex-patriots who have been waiting for  these days. At our company, we have a lot of people coming to us who are from  Romania, Hungary or Poland asking how they can help. There's much more than  just business and wanting to make a profit. There's a loyalty and allegiance to  give something back to their country. The approximately 9 million Poles who  live outside their country go back regularly. Their families still live there,  their money goes there, they go back to visit regularly.  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: You have these colonies of immigrants outside of the East Bloc  that have established business communities that will help establish ties with  these countries.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: I think one of the biggest potential limitations for U.S. and  Southern California business involves the right attitude to have for doing  business in Eastern Europe. The business and the trade are there. The  relationships that are there must be for the long term, not just the short  term. And there is no deal to get. The real thing you're doing is developing a  trust relationship for years to come. For the most part, there is not a  negative attitude of American business versus Japanese business or any other  kind. There are negative attitudes toward a lack of trust. We feel Southern  California could really go to the forefront in terms of foreign investment in  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: In Eastern Europe, business is very difficult and I don't think  any company can do it all by itself. I think a team approach is essential for  success. It's self-defeating to think you can go in and do it all by yourself.  </P> <P> Q. I would imagine that you would probably favor some U.S. government moves to  ease trade restrictions for Eastern European countries?  </P> <P> A. Armstrong: We really hope the U.S. government sees fit to give  most-favored-nation status to all the East Bloc countries and the Soviet Union.  I believe that would help stabilize the economic situation there. It would  allow us to import basic consumer items such as clothing or basic machinery.  Now we're faced with bringing these products in with 50% or 90% tariffs. It  just blows us out of the water.  </P> <P> A. Harrell: On the export side, I think the trade rules between the United  States and Eastern Europe. It will change when American businesses petition and  say we should have the right to sell in the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mexico link for Hiram Walker Hiram Walker, the spirits and wine division of Allied-Lyons, has signed a long-term agreement for the distribution of Ballantine's Scotch whisky in Mexico through Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks company. Domecq's Mexican subsidiary is the country's leading spirits company. Its Presidente brandy alone accounts for about a fifth of the total spirits market, the second largest in Latin America. 'The Scotch whisky sector is currently quite small but we believe it will grow very rapidly,' said Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive. Domecq already distributes Hiram Walker's main brands through a joint venture in Spain where Ballantine's is the leading Scotch with annual sales of more than 1m cases. Last year Allied cemented the partnership by increasing its stake in Domecq to an effective 32 per cent.</p>

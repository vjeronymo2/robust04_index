			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / US group urges action on piracy A COALITION representing 1,500 US companies yesterday called for action in Latin America to combat the piracy of American movies, music and audio recordings, computer software and books. Appearing before a Senate judiciary sub-committee, Mr Eric Smith, executive director of the International Intellectual Property alliance, released a report detailing an estimated Dollars 660m in annual losses in Central and South America. The report estimated losses to US industry of Dollars 200m a year from displaced sales through Paraguay's export of pirated audiotapes. It claims that El Salvador is the Central American base of audio piracy with a manufacturing capacity estimated at 100,000 units per month - nearly twice the legitimate sales of the record industry in the Central American region. The alliance released a second study concluding that the copyright-based US industries are among the largest and fastest growing sectors of the national economy.</p>

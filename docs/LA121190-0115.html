			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> KEEPING WATCH: The surveillance cameras going up on the San Diego Freeway in  Irvine will be watching for car-pool lane violations, but no one's going to get  a ticket, says Caltrans. It's to test the experimental design of the car-pool  lanes between Jeffrey Road and Irvine Center Drive. . . . Along that stretch, a  "buffer lane" allows motorists to ease between the car-pool and regular lanes.  It's the only such design in the nation so far. Eric Bailey and Jeffrey A.  Perlman  </P></p>

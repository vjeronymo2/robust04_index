			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Aziz Filho] </F>   [Excerpt] Ex-mayor Luiza Erundina, who yesterday afternoon  attended the final developments of the convention that nominated  Lula as presidential candidate of the PT [Workers Party], was  not involved in any of the negotiations over the controversial  issues of the program of government. The absence of Erundina,  who held the highest public post the PT has ever achieved -- the  post of mayor of Sao Paulo -- is another symptom of the great  dilemma of the PT: The leaders of ideological groups, who define  the course to be followed by the party, are not the ones who are  tested by the ballot boxes and who are connected with society.    People like Sao Paulo Senator Eduardo Suplicy or former  Santos Mayor Telma de Souza, who stand at the party's forefront  in electoral confrontations, were consulted even less. Their  opinions awaken much less interest than the views of movement  leaders like State Deputy Rui Falcao of the Leftist Option  group, who should assume the presidency of the party, or  economist Marcos Sokol of the PT Struggle faction, which  represents the most radical trend.    Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino, who has become increasingly  isolated as leader of the ultra-moderate Radical Democracy  group, believes this lack of equivalence between internal power  and social power will be resolved only with a membership  campaign. "We must bring as many people as we can to the  party," Genoino said. [passage omitted]</p>

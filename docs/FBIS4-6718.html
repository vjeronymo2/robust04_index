			<p>BFN     [Text] In Hanoi on the morning of 13 April, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working session with the core  leaders of Quang Tri Province to discuss a number of  socioeconomic issues of the province.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed special concern on the  socioeconomic programs that Quang Tri going to carry out in the  period to come. He recommended that for the hilly areas of the  province, the local authority should work out a comprehensive  plan to cover with greenery and other industrial plants for over  20,000 hectares of bare hills and empty lands, in conjunction  with plans to reallocate the population and resolve its  infrastructure issues.    The prime minister urged the leaders to consider thoroughly  and select wisely the plants to grow on suitable land, to create  rich forest with high-industrial-value plants and trees, thus  efficiently utilizing the assistance of the government in forms  of capital, plant species, and purchase of products.    Apart from the local labor force, provincial leaders should  motivate the contributions from the immigrants who came to  resettle in the province, so that the uplands areas would grow  quickly out of poverty and hunger, and the plains areas would  also see their residents' living standards improve.    The settled life and settled farming program for mountain  areas should be completed quickly according to a detailed plan  with concrete objectives and fixed time schedule, so that the  bad practice of slash-and-burn farming could be eliminated in  parallel with an improvement in living standards of minority  ethnic people.    For the people living along the coast, in addition to  development of the catch, rearing, and processing of aquatic  products, the local authority should set up concrete economic  development plans for every village located in the area of  30,000 hectares of sandy land along the coast, to ensure an  ever-improving life for both the people fishing offshore and  those who work inland.    In plain areas, the leaders should strive to bring  production  opportunity to each family living in safe and stable areas. To  the areas where production activities are not stable, alternate  species planting should be considered as a measure to avoid  harsh weather conditions.    In terms of industry, the prime minister maintained that the  leaders should firmly grasp contents of the industrialization  process for Quang Tri Province so that the process would be  carried out steadily and suitably, thus creating conditions for  the transformation from the present agro-forestry to the  agro-industry economic structure in a near future. The province  should strive to develop early its industry, especially  processing industry and construction material production at  small and medium scales, utilizing modern technology obtained  with assistance of foreign partners.    The prime minister also reminded leaders of Quang Tri to  strive for better implementation of reallocation plans for  people in Dong Ha and Khe Sanh Route No. 9 so that the locations  would be able to become commercial and tourist attractions of  the province. The task of developing cultural, social, medical,  and education activities should also receive appropriate concern  and care from leaders. Families of war dead and social pension  recipients should be cared for since the people of Quang Tri are  those who suffer the most heavy consequences in all aspects of  the war.</p>

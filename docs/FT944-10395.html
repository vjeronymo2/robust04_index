			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico The bolsa shed some of its earlier gains after market expectations of an alliance between AT&amp;T and Telmex were broken when AT&amp;T said it was setting up a Dollars 1bn telecommunications venture with Grupo Industrial Alfa. Traders said the market was buying Telmex ahead of AT&amp;T's announcement but guessed wrong. 'The announcement that the alliance was with Alfa halted the demand for Telmex and that moderated the market's advance,' one said. But the news boosted Alfa, which advanced 5 per cent. Telmex 'L' series shares - those available to foreign investors - were off 1.02 per cent at 9.74 new pesos. The IPC index closed only 7.0 points up at 2,618.94 after a high of 2,632. Volume was 1.12bn new pesos on 80.8m shares traded.</p>

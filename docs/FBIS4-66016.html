			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan has  declared that in addition to the civilian sectors, the National  Defense Ministry and the Chief of the General Staff's Office are  seriously applying measures to curb expenditures. Golhan  returned to Turkey after attending the NATO Defense Planning  Committee and the Nuclear Planning Group spring meetings held in  Brussels.    In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Golhan reported  that, just like Turkey, almost all countries in the world are  experiencing economic difficulties this year and consequently  defense budgets are being cut. Golhan remarked that after  improving its economy, Turkey can easily purchase the weapons  and equipment it needs without grants or military aid.    Commenting on the Defense Planning Committee meetings,  Golhan  explained that the agreements reached regarding the  implementation of the decisions adopted during the NATO summit  last January as well as the situation in the former Yugoslavia  were reviewed and the NATO force goals for 1994 were approved.  The work to be done to prevent the proliferation of mass  destruction weapons was also assessed, Golhan reported.    [Begin Golhan recording] The subject was extremely important  for Turkey, because there are countries in our geographic region  that want to buy these mass destruction weapons and even wish to  possess the means to launch them. Therefore, this matter is  being pursued with sensitivity.    In my speech, I mentioned these issues and declared that we  will always make constructive contributions to the work on the  subject. [end recording]    The defense minister remarked that the Nuclear Planning  Group  meeting focused on controlling the nuclear weapons in the world  and removing their warheads.</p>

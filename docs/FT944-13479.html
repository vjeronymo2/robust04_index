			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New issues defy ailing image - The more robust view from an FT survey Just how sick is the new issues market? The recent spate of profit warnings, share price slumps and executive departures would seem to indicate something terminal. However, a survey by the Financial Times reveals a far more robust picture. In fact, more than half of the industrial and commercial companies which have come to the market this year have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, while many of the underperformers have achieved parity or scored better than their sector indices. The survey covered 85 issues made since the start of January to the end of September - excluding investment trusts, investment companies, demergers and non-UK businesses. It shows the All-Share was outperformed by 0.8 per cent. Thus for every high profile share price slide - such as Aerostructures Hamble, down 74 per cent since issue; MDIS, down 60 per cent; Coda Group off 65 per cent; and DRS Data down 68 per cent - there have been several over-achievers. Shares in Waste Recycling Group, for example, have outperformed the market by 47 per cent, Domnick Hunter Group by 41 per cent and Inspec Group by 40 per cent. The performance of various newly quoted companies against their sector indices is also revealing, with 58 per cent outperforming the field. For example, construction group Amey Holdings only outperformed the All-Share by 4 per cent, yet achieved a near 19 per cent score against the FT-SE-A building and construction sector. Likewise, Keller turned a deficit of 12.4 per cent into a gain against the same index of nearly 7 per cent. There is also a divide between the first four months of the year and the latter period. Flotations since May have outperformed the All-Share by more than 5 per cent (up to Monday's closing price). But those joining the market in the previous four months - the index peaked at the end of January - have underperformed by nearly 6 per cent. This partly reflects the volatile market conditions, which have led to a general decline since the start of the year. 'A big proportion of companies were coming to the market and being priced at a time when optimism was high and the index was at a record,' says Mr Sandy Muirhead, managing director at Charterhouse Tilney, the merchant bank. Lower interest rates and investment trust sales in the last quarter of 1993 coincided with increased institutional demand for equity, in particular that of smaller companies. There had also been a high number of management buy-outs in the previous two to three years, and venture capitalists were keen to exit. 'A huge arbitrage gap opened up at the time between floating and trade sales,' said one corporate financier, 'and there were many eager takers'. This meant that the supply of companies was swollen by those which under different circumstances might not have floated - for instance high-technology companies with a limited track record and high cash needs because of research. But institutional demand was soon exhausted by the flood of issues, particularly against a backdrop of the falling equity market. About one fifth of this year's floats have an electronic/high-tech background, sectors which have been hardest hit by the downturn in the equity market. 'The lack of demand for stock from the institutions has had an exaggerated effect on the shares for a number of new issues,' says Lord McGowan, head of corporate finance at Panmure Gordon. He adds that the situation has been made worse by the lack of liquidity associated with some new issues, which often involve placing a relatively small proportion of the shares. Mr David Manning, director of UK equities at Legal &amp; General, says the problem with this year's new issues has been one of numbers, rather than any other sort of failing. 'The more new issues there are, the more the likelihood of some unsuitable candidates coming to the market. Successfully-run MBOs do not alway make successful PLCs - particularly where a single product, or single major customer is involved.' Mr Andrew Parry, head of UK equities at Barings, the UK fund management group, is more critical. 'There were just too many issues and I think the quality control on the corporate finance side slipped. There were quite a lot of companies that should not have come to the market.' But the corporate finance industry has been quick to reject recent criticism. 'Any merchant bank knows that its reputation is at stake in bringing a company to the market,' says Mr Muirhead. 'If the float goes badly, everyone suffers, not just the investor,' said one financier. 'I don't believe for a moment there has been a lowering of standards. The whole situation has been exaggerated because of the Hamble shambles.' Another corporate financier concluded: 'Some investors are feeling a bit sore and are showing an unwillingness to participate in new issues. But there are as many who are satisfied. These things go in cycles. A big privatisation will probably settle things down.' In other words, a comfortable profit would soon sweeten shareholders' memories.

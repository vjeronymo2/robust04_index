			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Management (In A Nutshell): New lease of life for used cars Companies which make staff redundant are often at a loss to know what to do with the contract hire cars which have been returned by former employees. Early termination of the contract agreement can incur heavy penalties. One way out is to find another company willing to take on the rest of the contract, says the Contract Exchange Company,* which negotiates such deals. The advantage to the company which takes on the contracts is that it can often obtain cars at favourable rates. Tel 0635 551010.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov] An increase in  military expenditure, according to Sergey Yushenkov, the  chairman of the Duma's Defense Committee, has practically been  agreed with the president and the government and the Security  Council. The additional 18 trillion [currency not specified],  if they are approved by parliament, will be used for social  provisions for servicemen and purchasing weaponry. At the same  time, it is thought that the deficit in the state budget will  not change by a ruble. The first 5 trillion rubles, the Defense  Committee believes, can be obtained, for example, by removing  privileges for foreign economic activities. The Defense  Ministry has painstakingly substantiated its demands. Sergey  Yushenkov described them with an artistic figure of speech.    [Begin Yushenkov recording] The situation is forming in such  a way that the cuts in defense expenditure are going beyond a  certain physiological frontier beyond which begins collapse.  [end recording]    [Gerasimov] At the same time, it can be claimed that the  original demands from the military for 87 trillion rubles were  deliberately high. According to one version, the Defense  Ministry was acting in accordance with the old Russian  tradition--the more you ask for, the more you will be given. A  second--put forward by Andrey Kokoshin, the first deputy defense  minister--says that their experts were counting on higher  inflation.    [Begin Kokoshin recording] Of course we would have preferred  there to have been higher estimates of military expenditure, but  taking into account the changes that are rapidly taking place in  our economy, of course this level is closer to what is genuinely  needed today to ensure the country's security. [end recording]    [Gerasimov] One way or the other, the military it seems are  close to repeating the achievements of the agro-industrial  complex-- they are receiving what they have demanded. What  effect this will have on the economy or on the military itself  will become clear after the budget is finally adopted by the  State Duma. But now it is already obvious how badly thought  through was a budget inside of which 18 trillions can be moved  from one area to another.

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CELEBRITIES CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN ACT AT LE CIRQUE  </P> <P> NEW YORK'S Le Cirque shows no sign of the impending recession. For two days  last week, Le Cirque provided not only bread (fine French bread) but sent in  the clowns and stars so all three rings could continue for celebrity-watchers.  </P> <P> One night, Johnny and Alex Carson came in to dine. They found the former Mrs.  Carson, the beautiful brunette Joanna, on the premises. Johnny went to Joanna's  table and gave her a sweet kiss.  </P> <P> This is the woman he has made thousands of finance-divorce-alimony jokes about  over the years.  </P> <P> The next noon, Marla Maples was the cynosure of all eyes, sitting at a table  against the back wall with TV producer Gary Pudney, her press agent, Chuck  Jones, and her mother, Ann Ogletree.  </P> <P> Pudney, whom I've known since he was in knee pants, came over to ask me to meet  Marla.  </P> <P> We had a brief but cordial chat, and I told Mrs. Ogletree what everyone in Le  Cirque was saying about her -- that she must be "a plant" since she looked too  young to be anyone's mama.  </P> <P> Marla chirped up that her mother "has never had any plastic surgery." (Well,  some of us aren't as lucky as others.)  </P> <P> PRODUCER PUDNEY has known Marla for three years, since back when he was still  the Veep in charge of ABC talent and specials.  </P> <P> He says, "She impressed our casting department and was screen-tested to very  positive response."  </P> <P> Now Pudney's company, Paradigm Entertainment, wants to put Marla into a TV  movie.  </P> <P> Gary says Marla will seek "supporting comic or dramatic roles and continue  studying acting. She realizes she must spend more time in Los Angeles where  most of the TV opportunities are.  </P> <P> "She is a terrific girl, devoted to her family, and I am very fond of her. I  hope to help her achieve her goals."  </P> <P> This was Marla's first visit to Le Cirque, a spot often frequented by Ivana  Trump.  </P> <P> Owner Sirio Macchioni sent Marla four different desserts to try.  </P> <P> And, nearby, it is said man-about-town Dennis Stein and the world-famous,  world-class actor Sidney Poitier, lunching together, changed tables to get a  better look at Marla.  </P></p>

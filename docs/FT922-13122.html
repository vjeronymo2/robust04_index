			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: USX may sell shares in Delhi Group USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday said it might sell shares in its Delhi Group, including the Delhi gas pipeline and other related companies, as part of its efforts to realise shareholder value. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company said it would propose issuing a new class of common stock, called USX-Delhi Group, at its annual shareholders meeting on May 4. The Delhi Group, currently part of USX's Marathon gas operations, had sales of Dollars 442m, operating income of Dollars 33m and assets of Dollars 598m in 1991. The new stock offering is just one of several options being considered by USX. The company may also sell assets or create a master limited partnership, which would not require shareholder approval. This latest effort to realise additional value for the Marathon Group follows USX's novel stock split last year when the company bowed to pressure from Mr Carl Icahn, the New York financier, and agreed to issue a new class of stock to reflect the performance of its steel and diversified businesses. Mr Icahn, who started to acquire USX stock in 1986 and had claimed that the company should float its less-profitable steel business separately from its Marathon oil and gas operations, sold his entire stake at the time of the stock split.</p>

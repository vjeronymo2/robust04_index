			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Increase in trade gap alarms City Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world widened in March as the UK economic recovery pulled in imports faster than it boosted exports. But measured over a quarterly basis, Britain's trade position improved slightly with the underlying trend pointing to a slow rise in exports, largely as a result of the economic improvement in continental Europe. The UK's deficit with the rest of the world was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.2bn in March, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. This was sharply higher than February's deficit of Pounds 880m, and the figures provoked some disappointment in the City, which had expected a deficit of about Pounds 950m. Although monthly figures are notoriously volatile, analysts warned that if the trade gap continued to grow in the coming months it would revive fears that the UK economic recovery might fuel a balance of payments problem, if UK manufacturers were unable to cope with rising demand. The Treasury yesterday played down these concerns and stressed that the quarterly trend showed exports were improving. Calculated over a three-month period, the UK trade deficit fell during the first quarter of this year to Pounds 3.1bn, down from Pounds 3.6bn in the last quarter of 1993. This occurred even though the CSO yesterday announced upward revisions to February and January's trade deficit of some Pounds 300m. Meanwhile, export volumes in the first quarter of this year rose to record levels, running 4 per cent higher than during the final quarter of 1993. This growth was being helped, the Treasury pointed out, by improved economic conditions in Europe. UK exports to the rest of the European Union rose by 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, while imports fell 0.5 per cent. The Treasury said: 'This is consistent with recent surveys from the Confederation of British Industry, which say that export orders are improving - this is probably reflecting an improvement in demand in Europe.' The UK almost halved its trade deficit with France during the first quarter of this year to Pounds 398m, and ran a Pounds 154m surplus with the Benelux countries. However, the trade deficit with Germany widened to Pounds 1.1bn, its highest level since the third quarter of 1990. Elsewhere, the recent rise in world commodity prices pushed raw material import prices 10 per cent higher during the first quarter of the year - the fastest quarterly growth since 1976. Although this rise has added to inflationary concerns in some City quarters, analysts yesterday said the rise was unlikely to feed through to factory prices rapidly. Mr Paul Turnbull, chief economist with broker Smith New Court, said: 'Raw-material costs are only a small part of manufacturers' total costs. It is much more important to look at wage costs.'</p>

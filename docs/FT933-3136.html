			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Losses at acquisition put Magellan Inds in red SEASONAL LOSSES at Vaga, the lingerie offshoot acquired last year, left Magellan Industries with pre-tax losses of Pounds 174,000 in the half year ended June 30. In the same period last year the Marks and Spencer supplier, formerly known as Celestion Industries, recorded losses of Pounds 93,000, restated for FRS 3. However, the company said the figures were not comparable because of the number of changes. Two companies had been discontinued and one acquired. Continuing businesses recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 739,000 last time. Turnover this year was Pounds 17.1m and the pre-tax figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 222,000 and an exceptional charge of Pounds 496,000, relating to provisions against the holding in Dunkeld and losses following the sale of the Slix brand. Turnover last time was Pounds 17.6m, of which Pounds 5.86m related to discontinued businesses, and the interest charge was Pounds 230,000, discontinued businesses Pounds 118,000. Losses per share came out unchanged at 0.4p. Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said progress was being made and order books were higher than a year ago.</p>

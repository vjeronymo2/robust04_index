			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / BA counter-sues Virgin BRITISH AIRWAYS is counter-suing its rival Virgin Atlantic, and its chairman Mr Richard Branson, for libel over allegations that BA had used 'dirty tricks' to win custom. The move comes three weeks after Virgin began an action against BA for alleged defamation. BA had asserted that the dirty tricks allegations were a publicity stunt. Explaining the decision to counter-sue, Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's legal director, said: 'Virgin and Mr Branson have chosen to continue their campaign against us by commencing legal proceedings. They have left us no other choice.' BA's decision followed within hours of Virgin's application for its case to be listed for trial. Mr Justice Drake said the listing should be on June 15, a decision which each side claimed as a victory. 'Virgin failed in its application for a speedy trial,' said BA. Virgin replied: 'That's not true. We applied for the earliest possible date which was June 15.' Both sides seem entrenched in their positions. BA is not prepared to withdraw unless Virgin does so first. Virgin said that it needed an apology and a recantation of alleged actions to damage Virgin. BA said it had conducted an internal review to check whether 'some corner of the company' could be to blame for any orchestrated campaign against Virgin. This review found nothing. It then decided to go ahead with the counter suit, which claims that a letter dated December 11 and circulated to some BA directors and the press was defamatory.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Private funds could build nuclear plant says report It may be possible to build a nuclear power station in the UK entirely with private-sector finance, according to a report by NM Rothschild, the City merchant bank. The report, commissioned by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility, will be submitted to the government's nuclear review which closes at the end of this month. It will also be made public. In its submission to the review earlier this summer NE said that a new nuclear power station could not be built without a measure of government financial backing. Mr Michael Kirwan, NE's finance director, told the FT conference on nuclear power yesterday that Rothschild's conclusions depended on a number of conditions. One was that a station could not be built as a stand-alone project, but would have to be linked with Nuclear Electric's operations. The report suggests that a privatised nuclear industry would be more successful in raising private-sector finance than one backed by government and liable to political influence. Nuclear Electric, which wants to be privatised, hopes that the review will result in approval for a third Sizewell nuclear plant costing Pounds 3.5bn. Mr Roger Hayes, director-general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, the nuclear trade group, said that the government would have to 'shake up' the way the capital markets work if they did not have the vision to invest in a long-term nuclear industry.</p>

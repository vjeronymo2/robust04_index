			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / President Clinton's economic Jeeves It may seem absurd to compare Mr Robert Rubin, the director of the White House National Economic Council, with Bertie Wooster's fictional manservant Jeeves. Yet in a town over-populated with brash, assertive personalities, his self-effacing, low-key demeanour really does bring the omniscient Jeeves to mind. Gleefully playing up Mr Rubin's deferential style, the Washington Post recently reported his habit of prefacing his rare interjections in White House meetings with the words 'in my humble opinion.' One can almost imagine him presenting economic options to Mr Clinton on a silver platter; although he knows 10 times as much about finance as the president, he apparently hesitates to indicate a strong preference for one policy over another. Mr Rubin's apparent lack of ego is seen as especially puzzling given that he has spent his working life on Wall Street. One of the most successful arbitrageurs of his generation, he ended up as a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. Last year he reported earnings of Dollars 26.5m (Pounds 17.6m), making him unusually wealthy, even by the standards of Mr Clinton's well-heeled Cabinet. During a 40-minute interview in his panelled office in the west wing of the White House, Mr Rubin stuck resolutely to his type-casting. I could not get him to express a really strong opinion about anything, even off the record. When asked for his personal views, he tended to reply by deftly outlining the president's policies on the topic in question. Yet as director of the NEC, Mr Rubin is potentially the most powerful economic official in Washington. He co-ordinates the activities of all the other economic agencies and enjoys daily access to the president; more than anybody else, he is the prism through which Mr Clinton views the economic world. Yet he rejects flatly any suggestion that he has a specially important role. He is certainly not Mr Clinton's economic chief of staff, he says, because that would imply the heads of other agencies report to him, which they do not. Does he accept the common criticism that he is too reluctant to express his own views on policy issues? 'People say that. I really think it's not correct. What you have to do in this job is to perform your co-ordinating function with real intellectual integrity so that everybody feels their views are laid out fully and fairly. Then, separately, you can express your own personal views. . .I don't thump tables but I don't feel any reticence about coming forward with my views.' Whatever he says, it is hard to believe that Mr Rubin does harbour strong personal views on economic policy. What really seems to excite him is teamwork and the process of brokering agreements. In helping devise the US's new hard-nosed trade policy towards Japan, for example, Mr Rubin got 'seven, eight, maybe 10 agencies around the table.' The marathon debate that ensued was apparently unprecedented in that policies towards Japan have usually been fashioned independently in particular agencies, such as the treasury, state or commerce departments. Yet it was typical of Mr Rubin's mission at the NEC, which is to bring to economic policy-making the kind of coherence and co-ordination that has long characterised foreign and diplomatic policy. The NEC is thus consciously modelled on the National Security Council and Mr Rubin regards his role as precisely analogous to that of Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. Mr Rubin's council has undoubtedly played an important role in formulating budgetary and trade policy. But quite how far its influence will ultimately stretch remains unclear. During the election campaign, there was speculation that a Clinton administration would move beyond traditional macroeconomic policies and take an active interest in the performance of individual industries, especially in high-tech sectors. Does Mr Rubin personally have faith in 'industrial policy.' I expected - and got - an equivocal response. 'Industrial policy is a funny word,' he says. 'To 100 people it will mean 200 different things - everybody has at least two different definitions in mind.' However, he believes there may be 'externalities' that could justify a more active government role in some areas. He will not elaborate because he does not want to prejudge the outcome of the few sectoral studies currently under way. Characteristically, all he can promise is that a premium will be placed on inter-departmental co-operation. 'There will be Laura (Tyson), Bob Reich, Lloyd Bentsen, Leon (Panetta) and myself - and others - sitting at the table and working it out together as opposed to something happening in one agency that others don't agree with.' Mr Rubin is urbane, courteous and, above all, non-ideological. His self-effacing style is a breath of fresh air in Washington and has gone down well with more overtly ambitious colleagues. He deserves credit for striving to create a more rational and co-operative policy making apparatus. But whether his committee system, which gives a voice to all interested parties in the federal government, will produce effective policies remains an open question. Unless the NEC's able director provides a stronger sense of direction, some observers worry it will end up producing camels.</p>

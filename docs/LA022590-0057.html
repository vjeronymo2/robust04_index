			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PART OF WASHINGTON BLVD. TO BE RENAMED;  </P> <P> VENICE: A COMMITTEE APPROVES CHANGING THE NAME OF A CONFUSING STRETCH OF  ROADWAY. THE NEW NAME HONORS VENICE FOUNDER ABBOT KINNEY.  </P> <P> Venice founder Abbot Kinney nudged U.S. founding father George Washington off a  local street sign when a Los Angeles City Council committee voted last week to  rename a stretch of Washington Boulevard for the man who built the Venice  canals.  </P> <P> But first the chairman of the Public Works Committee had to have a mini-lesson  in history. "Who's Abbot Kinney?" asked Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky at the  outset of a public hearing Wednesday.  </P> <P> Kinney was the man who envisioned replicating Venice, Italy, in Los Angeles,  complete with waterways, gondolas and a larger-than-life entertainment center,  a sort of turn-of-the century Disneyland.  </P> <P> Committee members were asked by opponents of the name change not to forsake the  country's first President on the eve of his birthday. But practicality at the  edge of the Pacific held sway over nostalgia for the guy who lived on the banks  of the Potomac.  </P> <P> Personal experience weighed in too. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores and  Yaroslavsky both said they had been baffled by the numerous roadways in and  near Venice named for the first President. In addition to Washington Boulevard,  there's Washington Way, Washington Street and Washington Place.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said he has lived on the Westside since he was 7 and is "still not  comfortable finding my way around Washington Street and Washington Boulevard. I  go down there a lot to train for my marathons, and I still get confused," he  said.  </P> <P> The opponents of the name change, most of whom live or own businesses on the  street, did not concede without a battle. The opponents outnumbered the Kinney  supporters at the meeting, but the council members appeared to be persuaded by  accounts of lost emergency vehicles and complaints about confusion stemming  from all the similar street names.  </P> <P> The segment to be renamed is a 1 1/2-mile stretch between Lincoln Boulevard and  Main Street. The Lincoln Boulevard intersection is where westbound Washington  Boulevard inexplicably makes a sharp turn to the right; what seems like it  should still be Washington Boulevard suddenly becomes Washington Street, ending  at Venice Pier.  </P> <P> Adding to the confusion, the segment to be renamed is known as West Washington  Boulevard to local businesses and residents, who use that name on their  stationery even though the city street signs read either "Washington South" or  just plain "Washington."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes Venice, became a key  supporter of the name change. Her aides insist her support is predicated on  helping emergency services keep the names straight, not granting a more upscale  image to the gentrifying street.  </P> <P> The full council must affirm the Public Works Committee's decision before the  change takes effect.  </P> <P> A neighborhood survey found that 52% of the property owners, residents and  business people who live or work along the 1 1/2-mile strip were against the  name change. But there was a sharp contrast of opinion among owners as compared  to commercial and residential tenants; 72% of the property owners, most of whom  do not live there, were in favor of the change to Abbot Kinney Boulevard, but  88% of the tenants were opposed.  </P> <P> The move to change the street name was spearheaded by J. Kevin Brunk, who owns  two commercial properties on the street that he had already named for Kinney in  expectation that the street name would follow. The West Washington Boulevard  Merchants Assn., for which Brunk serves as president, changed its name to Abbot  Kinney Boulevard Merchants Assn. Plans had been made to rename the street  during the Venice Summer Arts and Crafts Festival last summer with the  blessings of leading Venice community organizations, a rare showing of  unanimity.  </P> <P> The campaign was stalled, however, by a retired aerospace science consultant in  his first foray into grass-roots politics. Walter Woods, a longtime resident of  Washington Boulevard, held the name change up for six months by calling into  question the validity of the signatures gathered by the pro-Kinney forces.  Galanter withdrew her initial endorsement of the change while city engineers  restudied the matter.  </P> <P> According to a report issued this month by City Engineer Robert Horii, the  department found "no clear overall mandate on either side" and did not make a  recommendation to the council committee.  </P> <P> Woods testified at the public hearing, telling the committee, "The people of  the boulevard are the ones who count and the ones who don't want the change."  </P> <P> But a parade of Venice community activists testified in favor of the change.  "It's a matter of pride," said Susan Bell, president of the Venice Chamber of  Commerce.  </P> <P> Over the years, the street segment to be named for Abbot Kinney has contained  an eclectic mix of artists' studios, funky boutiques, antique stores,  restaurants and residences.  </P> <P> In the last decade, however, the street had perhaps been best known around the  city as the scene of two tragedies. Journalist Sarai Ribicoff, the niece of  former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, was murdered as she was leaving a  restaurant there. A few years later, actress Eileen Brennan was seriously  injured in a hit-and-run accident while crossing the street.  </P> <P> Opponents of the street name change included business owners who complained of  the cost of reprinting stationery, business cards and other forms. Architect  Lise Matthews reeled off 15 separate forms she will have to change.  </P> <P> Others said it would not allay confusion, only require further explanation and  "make things even crazier." As one merchant put it, she would now have to say.  "I'm on the street that used to be West Washington but is now Abbot Kinney  Boulevard."  </P> <P> Some merchants, however, favored the change, citing the thousands of calls they  field from lost customers.  </P> <P> Though they expressed sympathy for the expense to the small-business owners,  Flores and Yaroslavsky said they voted for what they believed was the greater  public good. At Yaroslavsky's suggestion, the committee voted to give the  boulevard designation to the stretch of Washington Street that most people  think of as Washington Boulevard already.  </P> <P> "We haven't done away with West Washington Boulevard," said Jim Bickhart,  planning director for Gelanter, after the hearing. "We've just moved it back to  where it belongs." To ease the transition, Galanter aide Joan Cory said the  city's Department of Transportation has agreed to post signs for both  Washington Boulevard and Abbot Kinney Boulevard until confusion subsides.  </P> <P> And arrangements are in the works with the post office to honor both names  until 1992. That's when Venice is scheduled to receive a new area code -- so  businesses and residents on the street will have to get new stationery anyway.  </P></p>

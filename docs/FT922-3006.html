			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Drink: Aussies stir the French - Jancis Robinson visits Languedoc's most expensive hole in the ground I AM hurtling round a roundabout on the outskirts of Narbonne one morning in James Herrick's Alfa Romeo when his car phone bleeps. 'Allo? g'day, mate, what are you doing up so late?' (Pause.) 'What are the Baumes at? Good. Great stuff. You'd better go and get some sleep.' One business partner reporting on the ripeness of some jointly owned vineyard to another, except that Robert Hesketh was speaking from south Australia while Herrick was driving me towards their new winery in the Languedoc. La Motte is an old vin ordinaire farm on canalside flatlands just north of Narbonne. No self-respecting Frenchman would dream of trying to produce world-class wine there; it is outside any of France's zealously-guarded zones for Appellation Controlee wines. But, as I reported in the Weekend FT early in 1990, Global Vineyards' policy is to apply the snazzy techniques and unfettered philosophy of the New World to the relatively cheap vineyard land of southern France. I thought it would be interesting to spend a day with Herrick this spring, as the first of their 175 hectares (385 acres) of French Chardonnay were just starting to bear fruit, and I was right. The Australians moved in by stealth over Christmas 1989, but now the Languedoc is abuzz with rumour and fact concerning outside investment. Chateau Ricardelle, a prominent property just south of Narbonne, is now being revitalised by a Swiss-Italian group. Peter Sichel and Bernadette Villars are just two of the Bordeaux proprietors who have already bought in Corbieres (AC, of course) and a Belgo-Bordeaux group has moved into La Clape. On the way to Narbonne, Herrick had pointed out another rather handsome Corbieres property, which apparently would have been snapped up by another Bordelais if it had not been for the financial depredations of the past year's frosts. We arrived at La Motte to a vineyard quite unlike its unkempt neighbours, with their gnarled little straggly vine bushes dotting the bare earth. Here were carefully manicured rows of Chardonnay vines three grassy metres apart, the juicy leaves sprouting obediently and exclusively along shoulder height wires, machine-tightened between posts that looked like cabers, unlike anything I had seen in any other French vineyard. 'It's a system of moveable trellis wires designed to produce eight tonnes per acre, but here we're not allowed to make more than five,' Herrick explained in the tone of indulgent exasperation he uses for France and the French. (When talking French to the French he uses no perceptible accent and a lot of self-deprecating grunts.) Outside the old farm buildings, swarming with workmen and Radio Narbonne, was a British car, and a truck carrying a warning against bushfires in the state of Victoria. English - or at least, 'Strine' - is the first language of most key employees here. Inside, 60 year-old concrete wine vats, through which a sea of once-profitable light red ordinaire has washed, are being sandblasted and re-lined, ready to meet, late this summer, the requirements of an array of technically exacting New World winemakers. Yalumba, the south Australia winery, will be sending a winemaker to see what he makes of French fruit; in the southern hemisphere he would be twiddling his thumbs at this time of year. Jacques and Francois Lurton, young brothers raised in Bordeaux but oenologically schooled in Australia, will also be making wine here. And Global Vineyards plans to sell the first crop off its Chardonnay vines, spread over three different, unusually large domaines, to the huge Skalli operation in Sete, and to Hardy's, fellow Australians who bought a large winery outside Beziers two years ago. As we leave, we almost bump into a truck which is delivering the first consignment of this year's purchase of millions of metres of wire, an essential ingredient in imposing nurture rather than nature on the vines. We pass a pretty farmhouse, apparently being turned into gites by an English couple ('probably a far more sensible use of vineyard land' sighs Herrick). Next comes the miserable sight of acres of ancient vines being properly ripped out, including all possible associated pests and diseases, by a team under Global Vineyards management. This is work for a neighbour who has been impressed by what les Australiens have done, and plans to substitute modish Chardonnay vines for his old Carignan and Cinsault stumps. Current EC subsidies ensure that it is more profitable to rip out a lacklustre old vineyard than to produce lacklustre wine for the local co-op from it. 'But this guy actually wants to bottle the wine himself - a major step forward,' says Herrick. 'The trouble is,' he adds, 'that this vine pulling programme is artificially inflating the price of land here so that only the brave, foolish or wealthy can afford to invest in it.' We spend the rest of the day touring the properties of these brave, foolish or wealthy creatures. Jacques Ribourel is certainly the last of these - one of France's more successful real estate tycoons, who seems perfectly happy to throw his millions into a large hole in the ground. He has heard that underground wineries are a good idea, and so he has had a huge 20-ft crater quarried out of the rock of La Clape mountain, between Narbonne and the sea, at an estimated cost of FFr2m for the hole alone. His Domaine de l'Hospitalet covers 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), but he does not like the shape of some of them, so they are being remodelled too. Jeremie, his son, climbs down from his Paris-registered Range Rover to explain that eventually there will 22 vine varieties planted, plus a collection of local plants, a couple of outdoor theatres and lots, lots more  -provided they can persuade plants to grow in the moonscape that is l'Hospitalet at present. Next stop is at an established wine domain recently bought by someone who certainly qualifies as brave. Its size, and its output in the bad old days of quantity above quality, is indicated by the length of the winery building: at least a quarter of a mile of wine vats. Driving up an abandoned avenue towards the other buildings, which once included chapel, forge, workshops and school, James Herrick makes disapproving noises about the dilapidated state of the vineyards. Local gossip has it that the new owner, a Champenois, paid for this 200 hectare property by selling two hectares of champagne vineyard. As we dot about the rest of the region (eliciting in each village another rumour about incoming investment), the temperature drops, the sky darkens and so does Herrick's brow. There are still three more weeks during which those juicy little Chardonnay sprouts could be hit by frost, and the less worldly locals, who can't understand why the Australians are planting such an outlandish vine on low-lying land anyway, could be proved right. As things turn out, it looks as though Global Vineyards (France) will at last have an entry on the credit side of the books this year. But it is undoubtedly operating in Europe's hottest viticultural melting pot.</p>

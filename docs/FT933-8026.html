			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Grant schools are audited properly Sir, Your article 'Funds at risk in opt-out schools' (August 12) outlined the criticisms of Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the Audit Commission, over the audit arrangements for grant-maintained schools. My company has been involved in the grant-maintained schools sector from early on and we currently act as auditors to a number of such schools. In every case, we have gone through the rigorous selection procedure set down by the Department of Education. Once appointed, our terms of engagement are definitively set out in a letter of engagement detailing the respective roles and responsibilities of the auditors and the governing body. We are appointed not by school staff but by the governing body of the school. I believe that this provides the independence that Sir David claims does not exist. I also take issue with Sir David's claim that personnel within grant-maintained schools are unfamiliar with handling public finances. Invariably the schools have a history of setting and operating their budgets and controlling and recording income and expenditure within their local education authority's management scheme. On incorporation, grant-maintained schools are funded directly by the Department of Education; it seems that Sir David considers local authority funds to be less 'public' than those of central government. The work of the independent registered auditors is also subject to monitoring by their regulatory bodies. I object to Sir David's implication that the Audit Commission is more likely to detect misuse or misappropriation of funds than the independent sector. Finally, if Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, had taken the time to familiarise herself with the audit requirements issued by the Department of Education to all grant-maintained schools she would have known that they are indeed answerable to statutory audit procedures.

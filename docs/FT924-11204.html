			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Observer: Not amused Inspired by Observer's efforts on the limerick front, the muse descended upon John Mackenzie-Green, managing director of Lloyd's brokers CE Heath, on the 6.28 am from Basingstoke yesterday. Heath Insured, the yacht his company is sponsoring in Chay Blyth's British Steel round-the-world challenge was last night expected to come into Rio, on the first leg of the race, in third place. So Mackenzie-Green ditched the telegram he had planned in favour of some doggerel for the skipper Adrian Donovan. I thought I'd explained that the worst You could do on leg one was come first. And I gave you my word If you only came third That I'd want Chay's full fee reimbursed] Perhaps if you master the knack Of threatening the crew with the sack Then your megalomania On the way to Tasmania Will give them th'incentive they lack. There then follows, from the comfort of BR, another verse of hearty congratulations. He had penned it all by Woking.</p>

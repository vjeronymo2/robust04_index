The U.S. Administration termed very regretable the exiled  president's rejection of the plan to settle the crisis presented  by Haitian legislators. Rothschild Francois reports:    [Francois] It is very regrettable that President Aristide  rejected the offer of cooperation that the UN secretary general  made to him -- said U.S. State Department spokesperson Christine  Shelly.    The plan, actively backed by the United States and approved  last week by the Chamber of Deputies in Port-au-Prince, provides  for a new prime minister to take office following an early  retirement by General Cedras but does not set a date for  President Aristide's return to Port-au-Prince. The president was  very firm on Saturday [5 March] in refusing this plan, because  of what he called a lack of will and political cynicism on the  part of the big western nations toward his return to power. He  placed particular blame on the United States, whose policy of  ambiguity toward him he denounced.    According to Mr. Aristide, there is no solution possible  outside of the framework of the Governors Island agreement,  signed in New York last July. This agreement provided for the  overthrown president to return on 30 October 1993 and for the  military authors of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat to step  down before that date.    The State Department spokesperson added: Our viewpoint is  that the plan includes the key elements that are part of the  agreement and of the Governors Island accord process. We are  aware of President Aristide's criticism but we continue to think  that the plan offers the best possibilities for ending the  crisis in Haiti.</p>

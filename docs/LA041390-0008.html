			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING  </P> <P> Since 1950, American farmers have produced enough food so that the United  States can export about a third of each year's production. That year marked the  beginning of widespread availability of synthetic pest control products.  </P> <P> It took 130 years, starting in 1820, to raise the number of people fed per  American farmer from 4.1 to 15.5. Only 38 years later, that number had risen to  114, according to 1987 statistics from the Agriculture Council of America. Ag  chemicals have contributed to this increase in productivity by providing every  farmer protection against loss due to weeds, insects or disease.  </P> <P> Nobel Prize winner Norman Borlaug estimates that, without modern pest control  technology, crop losses worldwide would escalate to about 50% of current  production. For Americans, the result of more efficient crop production has  been the availability of a high-quality diet at an ever-lower cost. It's  estimated an average family of four spends the 1989 equivalent of $50 per week  less on food than in 1950.  </P> <P> Americans are not the only ones who stand to benefit from our vast production  potential. Every day the world has 200,000 more mouths to feed and by the year  2000 the world's population will exceed 6 billion people. Although hunger is  endemic in less fortunate parts of the world, only modern crop management has  enabled us to make any headway against this pressing human problem.  </P> <P> What would happen if the United States and other countries could not produce  food for overseas export? Not only would more people go hungry, but the  environmental impact could be devastating.  </P> <P> ELEANOR LEAHY  </P> <P> Administrative Assistant  </P> <P> California Citrus Mutual  </P> <P> Visalia  </P></p>

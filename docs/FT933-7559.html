			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dawsongroup shares jump 60p SHARES IN Dawsongroup , the Milton Keynes-based commercial vehicle hire and distribution company, surged 60p to 303p yesterday on news of a jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 3.55m. Mr Peter Dawson, the chairman and chief executive who holds almost 75 per cent of the shares, said the result represented 'an exceptional performance in what is still a fragile market.' The 80 per cent rise in profits for the six months to June 30 was achieved on the back of a 13 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 24.8m. Earnings per share rose to 7.7p (4.5p) and the interim dividend is doubled to 1.5p. The group has two main divisions - truck and trailer rentals and a large Volvo truck dealership. Mr Dawson said the rental side, which includes both short-term and contract hire as well as portable cold stores, continued to be the cornerstone of the group's recovery. Activity in the new and used truck market had increased - but from a very low base. Margins had also been under further pressure on the service and parts side of the truck dealership. Turnover from the rentals division was 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 17m, while pre-tax profits were 86 per cent up at Pounds 3.36m. That was achieved via a 10 per cent increase in rental revenues per unit, better utilisation of a smaller fleet and quality vehicles which could command higher prices. In contrast, the commercial vehicle division's turnover was up 34 per cent, with sales to third parties of Pounds 7.73m (Pounds 5.77m) and intra-group sales of Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 2.13m), but pre-tax profits were only 12 per cent ahead at Pounds 191,000. Mr Clive Gear, finance director, said the company's financial position remained strong, with gearing almost unchanged at 119 per cent. 'The gearing may sound high, but in our industry it's exceptionally low.' Net borrowings were Pounds 38.2m (Pounds 31.7m) and net interest payable was virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.05m. The rentals division plans to add at least one location to the current 29, and to replace more of the fleet. It believes it has a solid base of contract hire at 46 per cent of revenues, and points out that the portable cold store sector, now three years old, has doubled both size and turnover in the first half.</p>

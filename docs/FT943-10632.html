			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Beijing faces tax revenue shortfall China's revenues are likely to fall short of budget forecasts this year, suggesting a larger than expected deficit and making it harder for the government to ease tight credit restrictions. Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, said that while a new tax regime was functioning well, tax revenues had not met expectations. 'Despite the high revenue growth, the income collected during the first six months of the year was less than the projected amount,' he told a meeting in Beijing on finance and taxation. China's new tax regime, which came into effect at the beginning of the year, provides for fresh sharing arrangements between the centre and the provinces. It also included a new value added tax (VAT). Western economists in Beijing said the complex tax reforms were highly ambitious and it seemed the authorities were encountering difficulties in implementing them. One official noted government revenues, which grew by 22.6 per cent in the first six months, were barely keeping up with inflation. China reported that cost of living increases in 35 main cities were up by 22.7 per cent in June compared with the same month last year. Retail inflation was about 20 per cent. Mr Liu told China's parliament, the National People's Congress, in March that China's budget deficit this year would reach Yuan66.9bn (Pounds 5bn) but total obligations, including debt service, would exceed Yuan100bn. Mr Liu disclosed that national monthly revenue averaged Yuan33bn in the six months to June, well below budget forecasts. An average of Yuan46.4bn would be required for the rest of the year to enable the government to meet its revenue targets. 'This would be very difficult to achieve since the highest monthly average had been Yuan39.1bn in June,' Mr Liu said. He also noted that pressure on expenditures was 'building', with salary increases for government employees coming into effect in the second half of the year. He blamed 'tax evasion' and 'delayed tax payment' for some of the government's budgetary difficulties. By the end of June unpaid taxes amounted to Yuan16.3bn, 71.5 per cent more than the same period last year. This indicates that state enterprises, the main source of government revenues, are facing difficulties meeting their tax obligations. Many of these enterprises are struggling to keep afloat and have been hard hit by the government credit squeeze aimed at calming an overheating economy. Total national revenues in the six months to June reached Yuan197.9bn, against expenditures of Yuan197.3bn. Expenditures grew faster than revenues. Mr Liu vowed the authorities would crack down harder on tax avoiders. The State Administration of Taxation would give priority to retrieving overdue tax payments during the second half of the year. 'Public spending must be curbed,' he said 'and expenditure breaches not allowed whenever possible during the remaining months of the year.'</p>

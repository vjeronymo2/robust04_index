			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Pragmatist Communists </F> Drifting Toward Social Democracy"]    [Text] The energy and activeness demonstrated by the  Russian president throughout the past week -- the visit to  Spain, the talks with the CIS heads of state in Moscow -- showed  that B. Yeltsin is in splendid physical shape and has a firm  grip on the helm of state. All these factors naturally affect  the domestic political situation in Russia.    It is rather hard to recall another occasion when the  Russian  parliament has worked as calmly and constructively as during the  past week. Yet the week was packed with events every one of  which, judging by past experience, could have turned the supreme  legislative body into a furious political debating society.  However, as we have seen, the Duma adopted a very  well-considered decree in connection with the bombing of Serbian  targets in Bosnia by NATO aircraft, quite reasonably left it to  the president to resolve the problem of the recent Black Sea  Fleet incidents (which did much to promote the attainment of  encouraging accords), and, last, for the first time in the  three-year history of Russia's existence as an autonomous state,  began intelligently, in close contact with the government, to  discuss the draft state budget.    There was an impression that even the "intransigent  opposition" was affected by the general mood and moderated its  ardor to a significant degree -- the NSF [National Salvation  Front] leaders declared that they will refrain from holding May  Day demonstrations, while "Working Russia" leader V. Anpilov  promised to do everything to ensure that the May Day march by  his supporters is exclusively peaceful, announcing that to this  end he is even prepared to enter into contact with the  authorities.    A familiar phenomenon was demonstrated yet again in the past  week: As soon as the president becomes active and energetic,  the country enters a period of relative political stability and  political groupings converge from the extreme flanks toward the  center. And, every time, this notional center becomes more  attractive to an increasingly wide range of politicians.    On the one hand, Ye. Gaydar declares the need to create a  socially oriented market economy, and on the other, I. Rybkin,  former leader of the "Communists of Russia" faction and chairman  of the State Duma, talks frankly of his social democratic  sympathies in a TV interview. The program documents of the CPRF  [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] and the Agrarian  Party recognize private ownership and market relations. The  conclusion that springs to mind is that we are today observing  the formation of a broad social democratic movement in Russia,  of which the former communist nomenklatura could form the basis.    One of the main factors that sharply accelerated the  pragmatist communists' progress toward social democracy was  October 1993. After this, the classical Leninist plan to seize  power had suffered a crushing defeat and a line was thereby  finally drawn under a stage of the political struggle in which  the objective was to seize absolute power, or rather to restore  that power to the former nomenklatura.    During the period of reforms a large part of the  nomenklatura  has adapted quite well to the new economic conditions, not only  becoming reconciled to the market, but becoming part of it,  since its primary aim had always been the pursuit of its own  personal goals. The nomenklatura associated with state  ownership gained particularly by the transition to the market.    As a result the communist nomenklatura has become a part of  the Russian establishment, and recent trips by I. Rybkin to the  United States and by G. Zyuganov to France and the United States  showed that it has quite high hopes of becoming part of the  international establishment too. All that remained, basically,  was to change the labels a little.    Today's criticism of the actions of the president and  government by the CPRF and the Agrarian Party, as can be seen  from the Duma debates, is not directed toward institutional  postulates of any kind, but deals only with the means and  methods of overcoming the economic crisis. Which proves that  the parliamentary communists are abandoning revolutionary  methods of struggle not just in words, but in deed.    The active participation of today's "legal Marxists" in the  December elections and their official dissociation from  nonparliamentary forms of the struggle mark, basically, the  renunciation of Leninism and the beginning of the transformation  of the communist party into a party of the parliamentary, social  democratic type. The choice is rather brutal -- either go  underground, or become a respectable party.    Another important factor in the transformation of the  communists that can now be observed is their relative victory in  the December elections and the relative defeat of the supporters  of liberalism. It turns out that power can easily be obtained by  legal, civilized means.    In general the changes taking place on the Russian political  scene indicate that the country is embarking increasingly surely  on the path of market transformations. Taking the objective  view, social democracy for Russia is a great step forward --  toward the market, and that means toward liberalism.    At the same time it would obviously be a mistake to be  deluded by the fact that today it seems that virtually the  entire nomenklatura and a vast number of political parties and  movements are raising the banners of social democracy. The  nomenklatura, as has been said before, is pragmatic and hence  apolitical, and will raise whatever banners it needs, depending  on contingencies. The anticipated start of a period of  bankruptcies and increasing unemployment creates the  preconditions for another surge of politicians away from the  center and toward the extreme flanks. Thus it would be premature  to assume that with the strengthening of social democratic  trends in Russian domestic policy a period of stability has set  in. An apparently more accurate thesis is that the current  political season in Russia is an interim stage in the progress  from the ideology of liberalism to social democracy.    The socioeconomic base of social democracy is only just  being  formed. It must be founded first and foremost on those sectors  of the economy that can realistically exist in market  conditions. Primarily joint-stock and privatized enterprises.  The regional nomenklatura also fits in here, having already  succeeded in converting power into ownership. The bulwark of  social democracy is the property owners. How durable and broad  it is able to become, depends on the speed of Russia's emergence  from the economic crisis.</p>

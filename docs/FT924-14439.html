			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Opposition challenge to government on economy THE OPPOSITION parties were quick to highlight what they saw as the weakened government commitment on inflation in Mr Norman Lamont's speech, but then used the chancellor's explanation of the new strategy as an occasion for reviving their own economic remedies. Labour then challenged Mr John Major to use his conference speech today to announce a national recovery programme, comprising moves to restore business confidence, to stimulate the housing market, and to remove the fear of unemployment. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said that none of Mr Lamont's targets was new 'except his clear abandonment of zero inflation', while Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, accused the chancellor of being vague both about inflation and about interest rates. 'Mr Lamont's chancellorship is so bankrupt that the only alternative he can offer to the policy that has failed is an earlier policy that has also failed,' Mr Brown said. 'There was not one mention of the unemployed, of bankruptcies or repossessions in a speech from Mr Lamont that was more intent on saving his job than saving the jobs of others,' Mr Brown said, condemning Mr Lamont for failing to chart a way out of the recession. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Beith attacked Mr Lamont for not replacing sterling's membership of the ERM with anti-recession measures and the announcement that the Bank of England would be independent. Labour also attacked Mr Lamont over public spending, warning that the tough spending round would both delay recovery and increase unemployment. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the government of using the sterling crisis as an excuse for public spending cuts. He wrote to the prime minister, demanding he make public more details about the events leading up to the pound's suspension from the ERM, since that was a 'scapegoat' for abandoning Tory election pledges.</p>

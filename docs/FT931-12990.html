			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Reports may show bill payments soon LARGE COMPANIES could be required to disclose how quickly they pay their bills from as soon as the end of the year. Under the preferred option in a Department of Trade and Industry consultative document issued yesterday, companies' annual reports would publish the ratio of trade creditors at the end of the financial year to average purchases during the year. Baroness Denton, the minister for small firms, is seeking responses by March 27 with a view to applying the regulations as soon as possible. This could lead to the change being implemented in time for the next annual report of companies with December year-ends.</p>

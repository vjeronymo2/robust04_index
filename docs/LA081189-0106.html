			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO MAY OK FREEZE ON BUILDING NEAR HARBOR  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach City Council is expected to impose a 90-day moratorium  Tuesday on development in the North Catalina Avenue Corridor, while a  comprehensive plan is prepared for the area at the entrance to King Harbor.  </P> <P> City officials said the move is necessary to forestall development that could  conflict with longstanding plans to convert the run-down, triangular-shaped  site into a modern commercial center that would cater to harbor visitors.  </P> <P> The moratorium would block current plans by developers to build a sprawling,  self-storage warehouse, office buildings and various stores in the  15-square-block harbor gateway area of North Catalina Avenue between Pacific  Coast Highway and Beryl Street. Old businesses and dilapidated houses now  dominate much of the area, particularly the stretch south of Gertruda Avenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planning for Visitors  </P> <P> Douglas N. McIsaac, a senior planner in the city's Community Development  Department, said a plan drawn up in 1987 proposed using the Catalina corridor  for arts and crafts shops, seafood markets, clothing and sports equipment  stores, convention facilities, restaurants, nightclubs, outlets for clothing  and sports equipment, and other visitor-oriented businesses.  </P> <P> For the past decade, McIsaac said in a report to the council this week, the  Catalina corridor "has been recognized for its potential, with proper planning,  (as) a specialized commercial area that would be a highly positive asset to the  city."  </P> <P> He said the corridor is a major entry route to the Redondo Pier and other  harbor locations and, through a "commercial transformation," could provide an  "attractive and inviting environment" that would enhance the city's image and  boost business in the harbor area.  </P> <P> At a meeting Tuesday, the council authorized a study of the Catalina corridor  by Envicom Inc. at a cost of $34,720. The firm, which is also the city's  General Plan consultant, will review the short- and long-term development  issues and come up with an interim control ordinance by the end of the  moratorium.  </P> <P> If the ordinance is adopted by the council, McIsaac said, its provisions will  be incorporated into the General Plan, which is expected to be completed by the  end of next year.  </P> <P> Several council members were reluctant to block corridor development plans that  are already in the works and in conformance with the area's current zoning and  other requirements.  </P> <P> But the council heeded what planners termed a need for "interim measures to  protect long-term planning interests" and voted unanimously for the 90-day  study by Envicom. The emergency building moratorium to be voted on Tuesday  would maintain the status quo until the study is completed.  </P> <P> One of the proposed development projects on the west side of Catalina, between  Francisca Avenue and Broadway, would utilize part of the Santa Fe Railway's  right-of-way. The council instructed planners to look into the possibility of  the city acquiring that portion of the strip for public use.  </P></p>

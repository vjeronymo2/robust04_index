			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Motoring: Bumper forecast for new models AS I peered into the bottom of the Waterford tumbler that serves as my crystal ball, what did I see for motoring in 1993? A brighter prospect than last year's - and I do not think my optimism had anything to do with a warming dram of Islay malt. It is going to be a bumper year for new models. Without wishing to sound like a government minister trying to keep up his spirits, car registrations did soar unexpectedly in December and the flood of new models is bound to stir the market. Among the most important of 1993's new model crop is Ford's front-wheel driven Sierra replacement, the Mondeo. It takes its bow at the Geneva show in March. So will a deadly rival, the Citroen Xantia. A month before that, the Peugeot 309's replacement will have been unveiled at the Amsterdam show. Earlier still, British buyers of small cars and multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) will have been tempted into showrooms by two new Nissans. They are the British-built Micra (European Car of the Year 1993) and the Spanish-built, though in many cases British engined, Serena. I used both cars as transport over the holiday and was impressed; more of them in this column soon. Prices will be announced next week. The Toyota Carina E saloons and hatchbacks rolling off the assembly line at Burnaston, Derbyshire, are powered by engines made in north Wales. The Carina E has been criticised (not by me) for offering so much silence, efficiency and promised reliability as to be tedious. That kind of boredom appeals to real-world buyers, if not to writers in magazines which persist in treating everyday motoring as a sporting activity. Mercedes-Benz sales, higher in the UK last year than in 1991, will be boosted by the arrival of the new 190 (another Geneva debutante). Quality car sales have been generally healthy in Britain in recent months. There may be fields full of unsold Mercedes in Germany, where the recession is only just staring to bite, but there are none in the UK. Honda's British-made Accord (and Montego-replacing Rover 600 version) will sharpen competition in the middle-management business car sector. Fiat, a marque I suspect will at last be coming in from the cold in Britain in 1993, will put its dinkily attractive Cinquecento before buyers here in late spring. Towards the end of the year, the replacement for the best-selling Uno is expected. Hot hatchback sales will be further depressed in 1993 as they become harder and yet more costly to insure. Frustrated hot hatch drivers will continue to switch to recreational four-wheel drives. There will be a major upset in this recession-resistant sector with the arrival of Chrysler Jeeps later this month. Jeep Wranglers will appeal to the young; family men will go for the Cherokee. This very civilised five-seat estate car takes to the road like a Volvo, and goes across country like, well, a real Jeep. At a little more than Pounds 20,000 with a four-litre, six-cylinder engine, automatic transmission, leather seats, wood veneer trim, air conditioning, ABS brakes, cruise control, power windows and six-speaker stereo, it makes nearly all its competitors look expensive. Diesels made up 16 per cent of registrations at the end of 1992 compared with only one per cent a decade ago. (Modesty alone prevents my saying I told you so.) Their popularity will grow and by the end of 1993, one new British-registered car in five could well be a diesel. Seeing no reason to break the habit of 14 years, I am driving into 1993 in yet another diesel - a Citroen XMtd estate with automatic transmission. I shall shortly be reporting on our first few thousand miles together. Headlines this year will continue to blame multiple motorway pile-ups on fog, frost and snow instead of on mindless and inattentive drivers failing to maintain sensible speeds and observe proper braking distances. Footpaths will be used as parking places by car and commercial vehicle drivers, too idle to walk a few yards and who do not give a damn for the safety and convenience of pedestrians, especially the old and the blind. Tougher MoT tests should result in old, rusting heaps going to the knackers yard where they belong. But with an estimated up to 10 per cent of all cars being neither taxed nor insured, I am not optimistic that all unsafe old bangers will be caught in the MoT net.</p>

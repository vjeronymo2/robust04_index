			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Moslems have been  fiercely attacking from mortars and all arms all along the Bihac  front in northwestern Bosnia since morning, Bosnian Serb army  sources said on Tuesday.    The local Serb army command reported Moslem troop movements  along most lines of separation, which is another proof that  forces loyal to Moslem hardliner Alija Izetbegovic do not care  for a ceasefire.    In the northeast, Moslem troops are keeping up a continuous  stream of attacks on the serb positions near Doboj and on Mt  Ozren in violation of the latest truce, which came into effect  on June 10.    Moslem commander Rasim Delic said last week that his troops  were waging an offensive war, prompting Bosnian Serb President  Radovan Karadzic to warn on Saturday that the Serbs would launch  a counter-offensive if the Moslem attacks continued.    "I am alarmed that this upsurge in fighting threatens the  prospects for reaching a comprehensive cessation of hostilities  and undermines efforts already under way to broker an overall  political settlement," U.N. Special Envoy to Former Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi said in Sarajevo before leaving for a meeting at  NATO headquarters in Brussels.    U.N. commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Sir Michael  Rose, said before leaving for Brussels on Tuesday that the  Moslem side "is the one that has been most hostile to the peace  process and constantly breaching the ceasefire."    "The danger is that they will provoke a massive Serb  response," Rose added.    Akashi and Rose will discuss with NATO leaders possibilities  for coordinated U.N. and NATO action in case of both acceptance  and refusal of an international peace offer by the Bosnian  belligerents, Reuters said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 20 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister  Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said here today that international  tours "enables the government to open possibilities but it is up  to the private sector to follow them up."    Aranibar Quiroga today ends his three-day visit to the  Belgian capital. Aranibar met with high-ranking European  Commission [EC] officials and held bilateral talks with Belgian  ministers and public and private sector representatives.    Aranibar held a news conference. He said that during his  meetings with EC Vice President Manuel Marin and Juan Prat, the  North-South relations general director, they reviewed the  three-year EU program with Bolivia.    The program will be signed in May during Juan Prat's visit  to  La Paz. Aranibar said the program "represents an effort to  achieve an encompassing vision" to "optimize our cooperation."    The basic guidelines of future EC cooperation with Bolivia  include the struggle against poverty, state modernization,  environmental problems, sustainable development, and regional  integration.    The minister insisted on the importance of renewing and  extending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with the  Andean Pact. "There is a commitment to extend and broaden it.  That is a reason for our presence here," Aranibar said.    The Bolivian minister said Bolivia has taken little  advantage  of the GSP. He said he wants "to make our agroindustrial trade  to be more dynamic."    During his meetings with Belgian authorities he talked about  "our basic government plans to maintain democratic and economic  stability" and "the search for economic growth with social  democracy."    "We want peaceful solutions for all Bolivian society's  problems," said Aranibar after receiving Belgium's guarantee "to  continue its cooperation effort, despite the economic  difficulties facing European countries."    Aranibar said that in the next few months a small evaluating  team will travel to Bolivia to review the work of the Mixed  Commission which controls cooperation.    The minister said his meeting with his Belgian counterpart  Willy Claes included "a very important exchange of information  on our government's basic plans" and on the Bolivian offer to  become "the point of contact and integration bridge with  everyone in Latin America."    Aranibar said: "We support American hemispheric integration"  and NAFTA (signed between Mexico, the United States, and Canada).    Aranibar travelled to Belgium with a small entrepreneurial  mission. During meetings with Belgian entrepreneurs he insisted  that the areas of oil, energy, telecommunications, airlines, and  steel mills "offer opportunities to foreign investors. The idea  has been received with a lot of interest here."    "We seek trade more than cooperation," Aranibar said. The  Bolivian minister handed Willy Claes an official invitation for  Belgian King Albert II, asking him to visit Bolivia "whenever he  deems it convenient."    Aranibar Quiroga will travel to Sao Paulo on 21 April to  participate in the Rio Group meeting with the European Unity  (EU). He will then visit Germany and Spain.</p>

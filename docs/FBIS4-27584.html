			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Beijing-based correspondent Mun Il-hyon: "China </F> Begins To Doubt North Korea--Why is China's Attitude on North  Korea Stiffening?"]    [Text] Many recent indications show that China has changed  its attitude on the North Korean nuclear problem.    When the UN Security Council adopted a presidential  statement  on 30 May, China promptly kept step with other Standing  Committee member states and openly stated that its position is  the same as that of the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA]. This has not been observed in the past.    The current Chinese position on the North Korean nuclear  problem is to support the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula and to resolve the problem through dialogue between  the parties concerned. China has not retreated even a step from  these two principles since North Korea declared its withdrawal  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].    This being the case, the fact that China agreed, "without  any  hesitation," with the presidential statement of the Security  Council containing a warning message against North Korea clearly  shocked North Korea, which claims to be an ally with blood ties.    In a statement by its representative to the United Nations,  China called for prompt resumption of negotiations with the IAEA  and clearly expressed its official position for the first time  that China is opposed to any act counter to the NPT. Thus, this  can be interpreted as "direct pressure" on North Korea.    In the wake of the adoption of the presidential statement by  the Security Council, China contacted the North Korean side many  times and informed it of the view of the Standing Committee  member states on the nuclear issue.    In addition, diplomatic sources in Beijing revealed that  China urged North Korea to allow future measurement of fuel rods  by stressing that sanctions would be inevitable in the event  that North Korea does not accept the demand of the Security  Council.    Such changes in the Chinese attitude was prompted by the  fact  that China's basic perception of the North Korean nuclear  problem has changed.    When the first presidential statement of the Security  Council  was adopted on 31 March calling on North Korea to allow IAEA  additional inspections, China expressed its firm conviction that  North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons.    Because of North Korea's doubtful attitude, including the  abrupt independent replacement of fuel rods in the five-megawatt  reactor, China began to suspect that North Korea may be  attempting to conceal its nuclear weapons development.  Nevertheless, it is too early to believe that China will join  the UN Security Council when its adopts sanctions against North  Korea.    This is because Chinese participation in sanctions against  North Korea will not only shake its relations with North Korea  by their roots, but will also cause a great change in the  balance of power in Northeast Asia.    This being the case, China must consider its relations with  Western countries, including the United States, which extended  China's most-favored-nation status. In particular, if China, an  NPT member state, supports North Korea, which violates the NPT  regulations, China will not only be inconsistent, but also will  have to suffer serious confrontation with the United States,  which is regarded as the "eldest brother" in the NPT system.</p>

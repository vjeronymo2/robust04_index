			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Government set to delay nuclear industry review TERMS FOR the long-awaited government review of the UK nuclear industry are unlikely to be published before November and may be delayed until the end of the year. Publication is being held up partly because of Whitehall fears that it could complicate public consultation on the future of the Thorp and Sizewell B nuclear plants. In addition, the review's terms of reference are being debated by at least three government departments. The Department of Trade and Industry's early preference for a narrow review has caused concern in both the Department of Environment and the Treasury. The DTI had hoped to concentrate on whether the private sector would finance a new nuclear station. It has also argued that the nuclear review could be relatively quick because the coal review, conducted earlier this year, covered some of the ground when it decided against early closure of the Magnox nuclear power stations. But the Treasury wants a thorough examination of the government's future liabilities and of whether privatisation is feasible. Some at the Department of Environment want the review to consider environmental factors fully. Reconciling these differing interests is likely to push publication of the terms of reference beyond the end of the public consultation on Thorp, which ends on October 4, and on Sizewell B, which ends four days later. Whitehall officials have been concerned that a nuclear review would be handicapped if the future of Thorp and Sizewell B was still uncertain. Originally the review was scheduled to take place in 1994, but was brought forward on the advice of the Commons trade and industry committee.</p>

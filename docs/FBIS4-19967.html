			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Get out of Gorazde! NATO has once again given  an ultimatum to the Serbs. [passage omitted] Listen to the  reaction of Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in Nancy  yesterday, speaking to Olivier Schneid:    [Begin recording] [Juppe] Last night's decisions by the UN  Security Council following the French initiative asking the  Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde, should be followed by actions.  When persuasion fails, force should be used. I think,  therefore, it is logical that NATO should provide the United  Nations with the means it requested in order to enforce  international law. I would also like to say that we should not  reduce our diplomatic efforts.    [Shneid] Isn't this ultimatum a bit late?    [Juppe] You can always say that but it is here today. Now we  will have to implement it. We should be aware of the risks  involved, however, including risks to ourselves and to our  soldiers. [end recording]</p>

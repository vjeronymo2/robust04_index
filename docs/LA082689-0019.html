			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL SAYS UNITS BILLED AS CONDOS MAY BE RENTED  </P> <P> The developer of what was advertised as a luxury condominium complex under  construction in Warner Center apparently can legally rent the units as  apartments instead of selling them, a Los Angeles city building and safety  official said Friday.  </P> <P> Richard Holquin, chief of structural plan check for the Building and Safety  Department, said a preliminary examination of the 760-unit Summit project  showed that the developer, G. H. Palmer, could alter the status of the  development to apartment units, even though the complex had been approved as a  condominium project.  </P> <P> Holquin said a more detailed examination by the city would have to be completed  before a definitive determination was made. "But on the face of it, it looks  like there's nothing to keep him from turning them into apartments," he said.  </P> <P> The decision appeared to be a blow to homeowners in Woodland Hills who oppose  changing the condominiums to apartments. They said renters would bring  additional traffic and noise and would lower the area's property values.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joy Picus had asked city officials to examine the project, saying  the change in status raised questions about whether its approval should be  withdrawn.  </P> <P> Picus questioned whether the developer had addressed traffic and parking  impacts and other issues.  </P> <P> Palmer executives announced two weeks ago that economics and an analysis of  real estate conditions indicated that it was impractical to sell the units,  even though they had been advertised for sale as luxury townhouses. Palmer  spokesmen said the firm never promised to sell the units.  </P></p>

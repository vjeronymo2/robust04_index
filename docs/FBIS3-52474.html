These consultations are also aimed at  exploring the possibilities for activating the stalled  negotiations in light of the full and fair partner role that the  United States has pledged to play.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed these  preliminary consultations as part of other measures designed to  end the stalemate in the peace process. It is noteworthy that  even before the ink on the Oslo agreement dried, Israel  announced that it was not presently interested in promoting the  peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Israel also  said that peace was achieved in the region in the wake of the  Oslo agreement, and that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can wait.    The Israeli deception did not last long because this  agreement remained mere ink on paper. Moreover, the  contradictions of this agreement soon surfaced, and Syria once  again occupies a prominent position. Syria's role will continue  to be a central one because it is essential to both the peace  process and the Middle East region.    The United States acknowledged Syria's basic role when it  sent its secretary of state to the region in order to discuss  rescuing the peace process, and also when it arranged for the  upcoming summit in Geneva between President Hafiz al-Asad and  U.S. President Bill Clinton.    It is natural for the Israelis to cast doubt on the  Syrian-U.S. summit, just as they usually do. The Israelis are  looking forward to encircling and belittling the Syrian role and  undermining the possibility of a deep Syrian-U.S. understanding  on the aspired Middle East peace and on the need to establish it  on firm bases, so it would stand fast in the face of various  events and developments.    The Israelis widely publicized the Gaza-Jericho agreement.  However, the events that followed this agreement have shown that  this agreement is a group of ambiguous principles and that  reaching further agreements on these principles would need  months of painstaking negotiations. Events have also shown that  the peace process has retreated several steps backward instead  of moving one step forward, and that there is no alternative to  the return to the bases of the Madrid conference, the Washington  talks, and the formula of a just and comprehensive peace on all  tracks of the conflict, based on both the Security Council  resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace.    As the Gaza-Jericho agreement faces a real impasse, the  Israelis have appealed to the United States to intercede with  Syria in order to render this agreement a success. It is to be  recalled that this agreement has carried the seeds of failure  since the very beginning because it is a separate deal, which  conflicts with the objective of a just and comprehensive peace,  and it does not achieve the Palestinian people's rights.  Moreover, Israel has shown great intransigence and arrogance,  thus increasing the conviction that it does not want to withdraw  from the occupied territories and that it is using the agreement  to strike at the intifadah -- with Palestinian hands if possible.    Thus, the demonstrated Israeli desire for Syrian flexibility  are no more than deception. Israel was the party that lured the  Palestinian side into concluding a separate deal. Israel is  also the party that imposes its condition on the Palestinian  side and refuses to show any flexibility. As was the case two  years ago, Israel stands as an obstacle to the opportunities of  a just and comprehensive peace in the region.    Syria, along with other Arabs, has called on Israel to  achieve a just, comprehensive, and honorable solution based on a  principle on which the world was unanimous; namely, the exchange  of land for peace. In return for Israeli withdrawal from all  occupied territories, Israel would reap the fruit of peace on  all tracks without exception. Contrary to its allegations,  Israel's withdrawal does not entitle it to concessions because  the occupied territories are Arab lands, and because the  Security Council resolutions provide for withdrawal and frankly  reject occupation, annexation, and the building of settlements.    Since the Washington talks began, however, Israel has  undermined all the opportunities for a real peace, rejected  various offers and proposals, and insisted on the policy of  separate deals. This policy can make neither peace nor even a  truce. Hence, both the resumption of the Washington talks and  the activation of the march toward a comprehensive Middle East  peace depend on Israel.    Neither Syria nor Lebanon will listen to Israel to conclude  separate deals. Israel, however, will receive a favorable  response if it really seeks an honorable, comprehensive, and  just peace. We do not believe that any world state, including  the United States, differs with Syrian opinion on the need to  establish a just and comprehensive peace. All parties now agree  that there will be no peace if it is not a just and  comprehensive one. This is the significance of both the  preliminary talks in Washington and the upcoming Syrian-U.S.  summit. As has been the case since the convening of the Madrid  conference, the ball remains solely in the Israeli court.</p>

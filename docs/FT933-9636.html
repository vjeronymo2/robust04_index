			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / PSBR figure is challenged THE PUBLIC sector borrowing requirement may not be as big as the government maintains, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday. Pointing to last week's official revision of last year's balance of payments figures which showed the current account deficit was nearly Pounds 3bn smaller than the government originally estimated, Mr Dobson said the present Pounds 50bn PSBR estimate might be 'artificially high'. He said it would 'suit' ministers to overstate the scale of the public spending problem and would 'soften up the public to accept as inevitable the Tory attack on the welfare state'.</p>

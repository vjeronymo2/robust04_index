			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ACTIVITY in the derivatives market disappointed yesterday, writes Steve Thompson. The weakness of Wall Street overnight, at anxiety about the US budget deficit and Iraq, saw the March contract on the FT-SE index open about 15 points lower at 3,827 and trade in a narrow range early. However, activity picked up at lunchtime, with the future rallying to 2,840 on hopes of a better than expected opening on Wall Street. In the event, the US market opened lower and soon showed a fall of around 30 points, taking the UK market with it and driving the future to the day's low of 2,817. At the close, the future was trading at 2,823, a premium of around 10 points to fair value estimated at around 14 points. A big buyer of Barclays March 330 puts left the contract as the most active traded option. Turnover in Barclays options totalled 1,931. Overall traded options turnover was 26.206, well down on Thursday's 37,711 contracts.</p>

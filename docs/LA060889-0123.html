			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Israeli army blew up the Gaza Strip home of a family of 13 in a punishment  staged before foreign journalists to gain maximum publicity. The explosion in  Beit Lahiya destroyed the modest cinderblock and corrugated-iron home where  Bassam Makussi lived with his parents, grandmother and nine brothers and  sisters. Makussi, 19, headed a small group that the army says was responsible  for half a dozen gasoline bomb attacks against Israeli troops near Gaza. He is  awaiting trial and has confessed to the attacks, which caused no casualties,  the army said. Meanwhile, Israeli troops in the occupied territories shot and  wounded at least seven Arab demonstrators, and the body of a Palestinian  suspected of collaborating with Israel was discovered in Nablus.  </P></p>

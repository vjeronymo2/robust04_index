			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROCKWELL CANCELS FINAL NUCLEAR TEST AT ITS  LAB  </P> <P> In a surprise announcement Wednesday, Rockwell International called off plans  to carry out a final nuclear experiment at the hot lab of its Santa Susana  Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth, a victory for anti-nuclear activists.  </P> <P> Rockwell said it has contracted for the work to be done instead at the  University of Missouri.  </P> <P> The announcement ended a long-running battle with anti-nuclear and homeowner  activists opposed to Rockwell's request to renew a nuclear materials license so  the experiment, known as the TRUMP-S, could be done before the lab is  decommissioned.  </P> <P> Administrative Law Judge Peter B. Bloch said Rockwell asked Wednesday to  withdraw its license application, and that he promptly dismissed the case.  </P> <P> Rockwell no longer is authorized by NRC to handle nuclear materials in the hot  lab, except as part of decontamination and decommissioning work, Bloch said.  </P></p>

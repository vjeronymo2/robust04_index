			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / A share of South Africa's spoils: The government and the ANC are putting stability before democracy It is not considered polite to say so, but the African National Congress and the ruling National party have decided that South Africa is not ready for democracy. Today, officials from the two sides will meet to discuss just what political system will suit the new South Africa as it matures towards democracy. But they have already resolved that power should be shared between black and white for the foreseeable future, even after eventual multiracial elections. It is a solution which may promise political stability - but can scarcely be described as democratic. Over time, the new government may succeed in building democracy by instalments. But in the near term, South Africans will have to content themselves with rule by a coalition of convenience between the ANC and the government (and perhaps some of their opponents) - by a multiracial oligarchy, more or less benevolent, more or less authoritarian. Such a solution was probably inevitable for a nation which made ethnic division its raison d'etre for 350 years. No less an authority than the American founding father James Madison recognised the problem of plural societies 200 years ago. In The Federalist Papers, he wrote: 'It is of great importance . . . not only to guard the society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice of the other part.' Now the ANC has accepted that principle and agreed to power-sharing, not just in a short-lived interim government, but for an indefinite period under the first permanent multiracial constitution. The next few months will tell whether the ANC intends to erect just a facade of power-sharing, while retaining all important powers for itself, and whether the government still clings, unrealistically, to an effective white veto. But the principle is agreed that there will be a coalition cabinet - even if the ANC wins a dominant share of the vote, not only in elections for an interim government which could take place early next year, but also in an eventual poll held under a new constitution. So the two sides have decided that neither can govern alone: Pretoria lacks the legitimacy, and the ANC lacks the skills. They belong together, in an arrangement which Lawrence Schlemmer, a South African political scientist, describes as government either from 'separate bedrooms', or from 'separate beds' - marriage is on the cards. In the short term, this arrangement will be good for each of the parties, and for stability - but not for democracy. For with the ANC and government snug in coalition together, South Africa would effectively be a one-party state: the ANC/NP - with 75 per cent or more of the vote (around 50 per cent for the ANC, 25 per cent for the Nationalists) - would drive a wedge between opposition on the left and right, leaving only splinter groups on either side. The one wild card is the Inkatha Freedom Party, which has a strong regional base among Zulus and whites in Natal province. Some polls put its support as high as 10 or 11 per cent nationwide. The priority, according to ANC and government officials, is to bring Inkatha into the governing coalition as a junior partner. But both have made clear that, if necessary, they will rule without Inkatha. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader, may well reject this subordinate status. His reaction will do most to determine the character of the new power-sharing government. If he can be enticed to join, there would be a chance of benevolent rule by consensus. If he stays out then Mr F W de Klerk, leader of the National Party, and Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC, might have no option but to crack down on the violence which would ensue. Civil liberties, rediscovered after decades of apartheid repression, could be a casualty. So South Africa may revert to some form of authoritarian rule, whether by the white minority or by a multiracial majority. But both the ANC and government seem genuinely to believe that more democracy is inevitable - eventually. Constitutional talks between the two sides are already focusing on just this issue: should power-sharing be enforced or voluntary? Should regions have autonomous powers? In short, what constitutional model is both more or less democratic, and workable? On the face of it, federalism, the devolution of power to the regions, might seem an obvious solution. As Mr R W Johnson, a political scientist at Oxford University, points out: 'Nowhere else in the world has the democratic government of so large and various a population even been attempted without resort to federalism.' And it would have the advantage of accommodating Chief Buthelezi, who poses the gravest threat to long-term stability. Unfortunately for those who favour federalism - the government, the IFP, the liberal Democratic Party - the concept has been discredited by decades of apartheid, which was itself a distorted version of federalism. The guiding principle of apartheid was that each of South Africa's peoples - white, coloured, Indian, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Swazi,  - should be granted the right of self-determination in their own nation state. Given that background, it is scarcely surprising that the ANC views the government's plans for a federal South Africa as a renewed attempt to 'divide and rule'. In a sense, they are right. For the government sees the devolution of power to regional level as the best means of preventing domination by a black government ruling from Pretoria. Mr Tony Leon, the Democratic Party's constitutional expert, quotes South African novelist Olive Schreiner to illustrate this point: 'The walls of each (federal) state are so many barricades, each of which must be broken down before any oppressive domination can absolutely succeed.' Federalism takes pressure off a nascent democracy. If ethnic and tribal minorities feel they could never win power, they would have little time for democracy; if they can exercise power at regional level - with all the patronage which that implies - they would be less likely to revolt. But the ANC is suspicious of this argument, for its goal is to create a non-racial South Africa where tribal divisions are subsumed by a single nationhood. To accept autonomous tribal political units in a future South Africa - many of the government's proposed federal provinces would be dominated by a single tribe - would be to abandon this goal. The ANC does not dismiss devolution of power out of hand. Delegations have visited Germany and the US to study their federal systems, and ANC constitutional experts say they favour the German model of strong state governments. But ANC officials make clear that the goal of their regional policy is developmental, not political. They want to redistribute resources from rich regions to poor ones, and insist that central government must have the power to achieve this. The debate will rage for months. In the end, Mr Leon believes: 'Federalism represents the most likely compromise between a specific system of racial checks and balances on the one hand and the demand for majority rule on the other.' But the National Party is not content with regional devolution alone. The government favours a form of 'consociational democracy', a political system which involves not only devolution of power but power-sharing among various groups at the executive level and special majorities in parliament for certain legislation. One advocate, Mr Arend Lijphart, a political scientist, argues that in a divided country such as South Africa (with 30m blacks, 5m whites, 3m coloureds and 1m Indians) consociational democracy is the only option. He points out that majority rule violates democracy by excluding losing groups from participation, and where demography guarantees there will be permanent losers, democracy cannot survive. Mr Ken Owen, editor of the Sunday Times, one of South Africa's largest newspapers, sums up the country's dilemma: 'The idea that a minority can thwart the will of the majority . . . is not merely unacceptable but dangerous.' But neither is majority rule the answer. 'Neither majority nor minority can exercise any powers for which it fails to win general consent,' he concludes. Whatever its faults, power sharing may be the only answer.</p>

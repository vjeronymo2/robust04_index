After completing the Tula Mechanical  Institute in 1950, he worked at the Central Scientific-Research  Institute of Precision Machine Building (city of Podolsk in  Moscow Oblast). He was named the chief, and chief designer, of  the Design Bureau of Instrument Building (KBP) in the city of  Tula in 1962. He has been General Designer since 1983. A number  of weapons prototypes that have entered service with the ground,  air and naval forces were developed at the KBP under the  scientific supervision of Arkadiy Georgiyevich, and with his  direct participation.    The principal ones are the Fagot, Konkurs and Metis  antitank systems, the Kastet, Shepena, Bastion and Refleks tank  guided weapons systems, weapons systems for the BMP-2, BMP-3 and  BMD-2 infantry fighting and assault vehicles, the Krasnopol  guided artillery weapons systems, the Tunguska and Kortik  automatic aircraft cannons and the GSh-30, GSh-30-1 and GSh-6-30  automatic cannons.    Arkadiy Georgiyevich has been awarded the title of Hero  of Socialist Labor for his great contribution to the creation of  domestic weapons. He has been awarded four orders of the USSR,  and has received the titles of Laureate of the Lenin and State  prizes.    Arkadiy Georgiyevich is a doctor of technical sciences  and a professor; he was elected a corresponding member of the  USSR Academy of Sciences in 1984, and a full member in 1991.    [VPK] Arkadiy Georgiyevich, the design bureau that you head  develops weaponry for the ground forces, PVO [air-defense]  troops and air and naval forces. How do you evaluate the level  of that weaponry?    [Shipunov] I would like to preface my answer with a small  introduction. A re-organization of the Design Bureau for  Instrument Building [KBP] was carried out in 1958-62, and its  specialization--antitank missiles--was defined. That narrow  specialization, in my opinion, limits the creative opportunities  of the design collective. I have thus tried since the very  beginning of my work at the KBP to expand the spectrum of  armaments being developed, which fosters competition that  provides an impetus for the developers and forces them to seek  out better engineering ideas. This makes it possible to have  high scientific, engineering and technological levels. The areas  of tank guided and air-defense weapons, armaments for infantry  fighting vehicles (BMPs) and guided artillery shells and systems  have thus been appearing gradually at the KBP. An "old"  area--automatic cannons--has also been restored.    It should be noted, in recalling the past, that the turn to  missile technology was the correct one, but exaggerations  started immediately, as usual. Many of the artillery KBPs were  shut down, and the scientific, design and engineering personnel  were sent off to other work. Four or five years passed, however,  and it became clear that an army cannot exist without artillery.  The artillery areas were "restored" by decrees and the  corresponding orders, but the personnel had been lost and the  collectives had dissipated.    It is easy to destroy scientific collectives, but difficult  to create them. The artillery personnel were able to be retained  at our design bureau. Much credit for that belongs to Vasiliy  Petrovich Gryazev, who was the most major designer in the world  of automatic weapons.    The deliberate and inadvertant destruction of the country's  military-industrial complex (VPK) is also underway today. It  will be impossible to restore the VPK if we pass a certain point  in its destruction. And if there is no VPK, there will not be a  modern army in Russia either.    Several stages in the development of the armaments being  created by the KBP can be delineated.    The first is the creation of a standardized family of guided  weaponry for tanks, antitank weaponry and BMPs.

There are as yet no missiles in the armies of other  countries  that are guided by laser beam.    The high level of standardization ensures the relatively low  cost of production of the guided missiles.    The second development stage is the set of weaponry for the  BMP-3. The work has proceeded with some difficulty, since  changes in the tactics for waging battles were required therein.  The new type of BMP can operate as an independent entity without  tanks and artillery, since the 100mm gun with relatively low  ballistics fulfills the role of close-support artillery, the  30mm cannon and machineguns together with the assault force  perform the role of the classical BMP, and the guided missile  launched through the cannon barrel is a guided weapons system.  The BMP-3, combining the qualities of artillery, tanks and BMPs,  thereby satisfies the requirements for mobile operations and,  consequently, those of the newly created mobile forces, to the  greatest extent. To this should be added the fact that the  combat vehicle should possess certain qualities of  command-and-control vehicles, so as to reduce the percentage of  purely supporting military hardware in a group of forces. This  is very important for the VDV [airborne assault forces] and for  the mobile forces as a whole. Comparative testing was conducted  in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of infantry fighting vehicles  from all the developer countries. The BMP-3 was the winner. A  major contract has been signed with the UAE.    The third area is the creation of close-support air-defense  systems for the ground and naval forces. It is completely  obvious that these systems should be created according to an  ideology that is different from that of medium- and long-range  air-defense systems. The intention has arisen at the KBP, for  the first time in the world, to create autonomous air-defense  systems that would combine surface-to-air missiles and  anti-aircraft artillery with target acquisition and control  equipment.    Ten years ago, in the face of colossal opposition from  extremely influential individuals, the Tunguska system was  created; it was highly regarded by specialists from foreign  countries, including the United States.    The Tunguska system was developed both in the direction of  its own intrinsic improvement, and for its employment in various  branches of the armed forces. The Kortik air-defense system, for  instance, was created on the basis of it for the Navy.    The fourth development area at the KBP is automatic cannons.  These are part of air-defense systems, and are in service with  the Air Forces. Our 23mm and 30mm automatic cannons, including  the twin- and six-barrel GSh-6-23 and GSh-6-30 cannons, have  been installed in domestic combat aircraft.    I would like to note, taking advantage of the situation, the  invaluable assistance that was been rendered to me and our  design bureau in the creation of new types of weaponry by GRAU  Chief Marshal of Artillery P.N. Kuleshov, Commander-in-Chief of  the Ground Forces Marshal of the Soviet Union V.I. Petrov and  artillery commander Marshal of Artillery V.M. Mikhalkin, as well  as the military scientists from the NIU [Scientific-Research  Directorate] of the Ministry of Defense.

[Shipunov] The development of weaponry, as is well known,  depends on views on the waging of war. A tilt has occurred today  toward the waging of war with the use of conventional weaponry  and the widespread use of mobile forces. The problem of arming  the mobile forces arises therein. The ideology of arming the  mobile forces, in my opinion, should be founded on the choice of  a uniform and light mobile base. The weaponry itself should be  relatively light, and not require additional supply trains for  ammunition. This could be achieved via the widespread  incorporation of high-precision weaponry. The range of types of  combat vehicles should be cut back at the same time, not by  means of directives but rather because they can perform a larger  number of various firepower tasks.    In mobile troop units it is necessary to use technical  solutions to reduce to a minimum the number of support units;  that is, a large percentage of the equipment should consist of  weapons systems.    [VPK] What is the status of your enterprise today? What are  you doing to ensure its viability?    [Shipunov] We are currently living badly, since we remain a  state enterprise, but the state has virtually no concern for our  existence. We do not know what our prospects are for the near  future, we do not know what our financing will be. We are living  under conditions of uncertainty.

Credits for conversion are given only to the  manufacturing plants. What has been accumulated at our  enterprises has never existed, since the rules that prevailed  before did not permit it. Now we are being forced take the  capitalist road in the absence of the initial accumulation.  Again a "decree on conversion from socialism to capitalism."  Orders from the Ministry of Defense of Russia are providing only  30 percent of the level required by the KBP today.    Scientific research has effectively halted, and experimental  design is based on past work. The amount of scientific research  should be 30-40 percent of experimental design, but that is in  all of the developed countries; here it is in single-digit  percentages. Orders from the Ministry of Defense of the Russian  Federation should be increased to 40-45 percent of enterprise  capacity in order to preserve our KBP, its field and its work in  progress. At a lower level, it is to the firm's disadvantage to  maintain specialized laboratories and testing and auxiliary  services. We are thus looking for new customers. We have signed  a contract with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.    A biocenter is being built at the KBP and medical apparatus  is being developed, in particular based on the CO[.sub]2[/]  laser. The design bureau has designed top-notch prototypes of  excellent sewing machines that are in no way inferior to  Japanese models. We are also trying to obtain credits for the  creation of large-series production.    [VPK] What difficulties are being encountered by the KBP in  gaining access to the international market?    [Shipunov] This is a complex issue. We do not yet have a law  pertaining to intellectual property. The developer thus receives  a very small portion from the producer and seller of a weapon in  the international market. It is quite difficult to make money  from the weapons trade in general, anyway. The system for  selling weapons today is too cumbersome and slow. It should be  simplified.    The protection of the interests of the state in the sale of  weaponry should be dome through an annually renewable list of  models that are permitted for sale, and a determination of the  list of nations where the sale of those models is prohibited.  The list should be authorization for the owner of a good to  conclude contracts, which should be concluded in the name of the  enterprise.    We are ready to bring existing governmental structures in  first and foremost as intermediaries, to find buyers and  conclude contracts on terms advantageous to the enterprise.    The last three or four years of inaction have led to sharp  cutbacks in the markets for the sale of weaponry.    The design bureau is also limited in the sale of licenses,  since there are a host of obstacles everywhere, and science  itself is in a grievous state. It is generally known that a  series-produced weapon does not pose any particular secrets.  What still exists in the heads of the scientists, engineers and  designers must be preserved.    We would be investors and buyers ourselves if we were not  being held back. We have prepared a large program with China for  the performance of joint development. The assistance of the  government is required for its realization.    The KBP is taking active part in international exhibitions.  We showed the Tunguska ZPRK [air-defense missile system] at the  Mosaeroshow-92 exhibition. Many models were presented at the  exhibition in Abu Dhabi.    [VPK] What can you say with regard to conversion?    [Shipunov] Our country has a wealth of experience in the  pursuit of the conversion of military industry--first after the  end of the war, and then during the times of N.S. Khrushchev.  The conversion was well planned by the state in both instances.  The process of conversion took three or four years and had an  enormous economic impact, while there were no drops in  production, price rises or worsening of the standard of living  of the population. The planned pursuit of conversion is needed  today as well.    There could be difficulties at individual enterprises, but  not in all of industry.    There should be clarity in relation to military orders,  mobilization capacity and sources of financing for military  industry, including through the sale of arms, an orientation  toward the product ranges and volume of the output of civilian  products, and the organization of cooperation in the output of  consumer goods.

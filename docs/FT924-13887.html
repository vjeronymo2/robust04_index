			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Australians may bid for parts of RHM GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group which unsuccessfully offered Pounds 1.7bn for Ranks Hovis McDougall in 1988, yesterday said it might bid for RHM's continental European baking and milling activities if a hostile Pounds 780m takeover by Hanson succeeds. Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, said some of RHM's continental businesses 'could be of interest to us, and we will keep watching that particular situation.' He did not divulge which businesses interested GFW, or how much it would be prepared to pay. RHM's continental European business had net assets of Pounds 16.9m in the August 1991 balance sheet and achieved trading profits of Pounds 2.6m on sales of Pounds 73.6m in the 1990-91 year, down from Pounds 4.7m and Pounds 75.8m previously. They comprise three milling and one bakery company in the Netherlands, and a bakery group in France. GFW's European foods division generated sales of ADollars 750.5m, a fifth of the group total, in the year to June 30, and the group has made no secret of its plans to acquire further businesses. European activities centre on milling and baking businesses in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany, where Mr Nugent believes long term European growth will be strongest. Earlier this year the group merged its Melvin and Bakkerij Hendriks baking businesses in the Netherlands into a single business under the name Quality Bakers Europe. It described the ADollars 14m acquisition of Limburgse Molens, a privately-owned Belgian flour miller, as a step towards building 'critical mass' in milling and baking. GFW disposed of its 29.9 per cent holding in RHM after its bid failed, and was later the target of a failed ADollars 3.1bn counter offer from RHM. Last week it sold its Wattie Foods business in New Zealand for ADollars 428m and paid ADollars 330m for the Uncle Toby's food and snack group.</p>

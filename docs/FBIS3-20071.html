Even so prospects  are not bad, as is made clear in the report from Nacho  Hernandez, who has been attending the meeting for Radio Exterior  de Espana.    [Hernandez] This meeting in Ioannina closes with the  rudiments of a compromise on the institutional reform of the  European Union. Any formula will have to be first approved by  the governments of the member countries. If that happens the  agreement will come next Wednesday [30 March]. It would be a  political declaration giving every guarantee that negotiations  on a question will continue, that all necessary efforts will be  made, for a reasonable period of time in a case where three  countries representing a total of 23 votes are opposed. This is  the formula which, as Foreign Minister Javier Solana recalled,  our country has defended:    [Begin Solana recording] I see some reactions from some of  the people who have spoken that are very negative toward our  position and toward the potential text, and I believe it shows  the effort we are making. I believe it is a symptom that the  text is in the right direction for us [as heard]. [end  recording]    [Hernandez] Spain believes the final agreement will come  about next Wednesday. We ended this meeting, Minister Solana  said, in the spirit of finding a formula that will enable us to  get along together. The difficulties, he added, may now come  from countries which have maintained an unflexible stance --  that would be Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.  [passage omitted]</p>

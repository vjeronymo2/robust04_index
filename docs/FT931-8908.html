			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Bowater to fund US purchase with Pounds 295m rights issue BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films group, said yesterday it was buying Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings company, for Dollars 434m (Pounds 305m), increasing its strength in the coated films and papers market. The deal is being funded by a Pounds 295m one-for-six rights issue - Bowater's second in less than a year - but was welcomed by the stock market. Its shares gained 8p to 493p, compared with the issue price of 400p. Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said the business offered 'real complementarity. It is a huge strategic gain for us.' He said the acquisition was expected to enhance earnings this year, and would increase Bowater's annual sales of coated films and papers to Pounds 500m, or 25 per cent of annual group turnover. SCI was formerly part of James River, the US paper group, but was acquired in a leveraged buy-out by a group of New York investors in 1991. It specialises in precision coatings of specialist films and paper for the imaging, graphic and computer industries. The rights issue will be in two stages, as the deal is conditional on US approval under anti-trust legislation. The unconditional first stage will raise Pounds 95m, while the second instalment is due to be issued between March 23 and November 10, depending on US approval. Bowater raised Pounds 333.5m from a rights issue last March to fund the acquisition of the packaging businesses DRG Packaging and Cope Allman. News of yesterday's deal was accompanied by better than expected estimated results for 1992, showing an unaudited Pounds 147m pre-tax profit - an 48.5 per cent increase on 1991. Turnover is estimated to have risen from Pounds 1.27bn to Pounds 1.57bn, while earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, rose from 18.5p to 25.1p. Bowater is forecasting a final dividend of 6.65p, making a total of 11.5p, an increase of 11.1 per cent. The company said trading in the fourth quarter had been 'rather ahead' of expectations, and the performance had been maintained in January. Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, said it was too early to talk of recovery: 'We have seen a lot of false dawns.' Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 20; Observer, Page 17; People, Page 14</p>

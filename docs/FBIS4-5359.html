			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Hawks in U.S. Take Upperhand Touting Military Option in </F> Korea" -- YONHAP headline]    [Text] Washington, April 10 (YONHAP) -- As U.S. Secretary  of Defense William Perry prepares to visit South Korea,  attention is being focused on stepped-up efforts by "the hawks"  to picture the North Korean nuclear issue as a military crisis  on the peninsula.    One sign underscoring the move is a special report to be  submitted Monday to Congress by its research arm, the General  Accounting Office [GAO], on military options available to  Washington and Seoul in the nuclear dispute with Pyongyang.    Another indication is an unconfirmed report that the  Pentagon  was trying to secure military manpower that could be deployed to  the Korean peninsula in case of another war.    In addition, rumor had it that a U.S. intelligence support  team might be formed in South Korea, as hinted earlier by  Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director James Woolsey, and  that a state-of-the-art ground facility capable of analyzing  intelligence collected by satellite could be set up here soon.    Against this backdrop, American analysts specializing in  Korean affairs say there are two main aspects to the situation.    The hard-liners (the hawks) in Washington want to prepare  for  a military solution to the Korean nuclear row if the UN Security  Council fails to break the impasse.    At the same time, they wish to sway American public opinion  in favor of the military option, according to the analysts.    The GAO report carries the caveat that it was only  spotlighting possible solution of the nuclear issue through  options that could be exercised by Washington and Seoul -- and  by Pyongyang.    The report offers options that include the use of nuclear  weapons.    There is the shocking possibility, it says, that North Korea  could explode one or two nuclear bombs hidden in tunnels near  the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and allow radioactive particles to  drift Southward.    This horrifying possibility does not end there.    As a result of the nuclear explosions in the DMZ, South  Korean and U.S. troops would be dealt a crippling blow as the  blasts knocked out ultra-modern military equipment. Taking  advantage of this initial blow, North Korea would send its  powerful conventional forces sweeping down into the South.    The accuracy of the GAO report's military logistics remains  unclear, but it has nevertheless drawn keen interest because the  GAO is recognized throughout the country as authoritative,  independent and trustworthy.    Informed sources also note that the GAO report was issued as  Perry, who is regarded as one of the hawks, was preparing to  visit Seoul.    The report may have been meant not only for domestic  consumption but also for leaders in South Korea and Japan, they  say.    Further raising eyebrows in Washington was a proposal on the  possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.    Quoting the Center for Defense Intelligence (CDI), a private  analysis organization, the GAO report pointed to a plan that  calls for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from South  Korea if the North abandons its nuclear program.    The possibility of a U.S. troop withdrawal is obviously  being  raised in light of concern for the safety of American soldiers  in Korea. It also indicates that if war breaks out on the  Korean peninsula, the U.S. military could concentrate on air and  naval support.    In other words, America is considering changing the role of  its troops in South Korea in a new security arrangement between  Washington and Seoul, analysts say.    In any event, a recent series of moves by American  hard-liners is aimed at strenthening and sharpening U.S. public  opinion on the North Korean nuclear issue.    Various opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans  oppose U.S. intervention in Korea if another war breaks out on  the peninsula.    The hawks obviously feel they must change this attitude --  and soon -- because North Korea is not listening to the White  House, they said.</p>

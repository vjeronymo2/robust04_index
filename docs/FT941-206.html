			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Cardoso quits as finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso yesterday resigned as Brazil's finance minister, as expected, in order to run in October's presidential elections. His replacement is Mr Rubens Ricupero, a former ambassador in Washington, who is due to take up his new post soon after Easter. Mr Cardoso said his departure would not endanger the anti-inflation package he has negotiated through Congress. 'If there was a risk the plan would be altered, I wouldn't consider leaving,' he said. 'The programme's complete, there's nothing left to do.' Mr Ricupero says he fully supports the plan and will keep Mr Cardoso's team of advisers. The biggest doubt about the implementation of the final stage of the plan, a new currency, stems from President Itamar Franco. Although he allowed Mr Cardoso to run economic policy, even where it contradicted the president's populist instincts, it is not clear whether Mr Ricupero will have the same freedom. Inflation is not likely to fall until a new currency is introduced later this year. According to some indicators, inflation has increased sharply in recent weeks to over 40 per cent a month. If prices continue to rise, there is a risk Mr Franco will demand urgent, unorthodox action. Today is the last effective day for candidates to resign from office before the constitutionally imposed deadline. Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left wing Workers' Party leads the opinion polls. Other main candidates are Mr Orestes Quercia, who has the backing of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, the country's largest political party. Mr Paulo Maluf, right-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, surprised analysts by announcing he would not run. He is thought to have been dissuaded because the Liberal Front party, his natuaral ally, appears keener on an alliance with Mr Cardoso.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] A military, technical, and defense industry  cooperation agreement was signed between Turkey and Russia in  Moscow today. The agreement was signed by Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev and National Defense Minister Mehmet  Golhan. Both ministers noted that the agreement, which was  signed at the end of talks between the two countries'  delegations, bases bilateral relations on a sound foundation.  During the talks, Russia once again expressed the changes it  wants to introduce with regard to the implementation of the CFE  agreement and briefed Golhan on NATO's Partnership for Peace  plan and the sharing of the Black Sea fleet with Ukraine.    After the signing ceremony, the two ministers replied to  questions by reporters. Grachev declared that Russia received  approval from Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan concerning the  bases it wants to establish in the Caucasus, but the  installation in Azerbaijan will be an early-warning station,  rather than a base. Pointing out that his country wants to  deploy Russian troops in bases in the CIS countries with the  approval of the relevant governments, Grachev added that this  must also be ratified by the legislative organs of these  countries.    Golhan, in response to a question on Bosnia-Herzegovina,  declared that from the beginning Turkey has been exerting  efforts to put an end to the clashes, stressing that the status  of the Turkish troops to be sent to Bosnia should be approached  within the framework of these peaceful efforts.</p>

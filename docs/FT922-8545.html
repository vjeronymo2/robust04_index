			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / California riots focus minds on welfare reform: The governor of the state claims unrest in Los Angeles is proof of the need for change ON the Friday morning when the burning and looting in Los Angeles stopped, thousands of poor residents of the city's South-Central district had a more pressing need than protesting. They were standing in long lines waiting to collect their weekly welfare cheques at the few post offices still operating in the riot-stricken area. The queues demonstrated the dependency on social benefits of large portions of the population in the economically depressed inner city. Yet Los Angeles' 1.3m welfare recipients, and 2.3m throughout California, now face the possibility of swingeing cuts in payments. Mr Pete Wilson, California's Republican governor, plans to place proposals for welfare reform on the state ballot in November when he will ask voters to approve an immediate 10 per cent cut in welfare benefits. After six months, payments would be reduced by an additional 15 per cent to families that include an able-bodied adult. The governor says his proposed Taxpayers Protection Act is designed to 'encourage personal responsibility and independence while discouraging welfare dependency,' which he believes has contributed to the breakdown of social values he recently linked to violence in Los Angeles. 'Generous' welfare payments have become a disincentive to work, he maintains. A person working full time on a minimum wage may be little better off than another on welfare under the current system, although both must struggle to make ends meet. The governor's initiative would allow welfare recipients to earn more before payments are withdrawn. It would also create a new Dollars 34m (Pounds 19.2m) job training scheme and a programme designed to encourage teenage parents to stay in school. However, the primary thrust of the reform is directed towards the growing problem of single, unsupported mothers who represent 87 per cent of the state's welfare case load. Only 6 per cent of single-parent families that go on public assistance do so because the parent becomes unemployed, according to state statistics. 'The overwhelming majority go on welfare because of divorce or separation from the income-earning spouse, or because a non-working single woman gives birth to a child,' says Mr Russell Gould, secretary of the California Health and Welfare Agency. Although the problem affects all segments of the population, it is particularly acute in the black community. While blacks make up only 7 per cent of California's population, they represent almost 25 per cent of welfare recipients. All but a small fraction of these are single mothers. Under the governor's proposals mothers would get no extra benefits if they give birth to additional children while on welfare, and benefits for first-time mothers would be eliminated. Payments to teenage mothers would also restricted, forcing them to live with parents if they are to receive welfare. Critics charge that the proposed cuts would lead to increased homelessness and poverty. Children's rights advocates are incensed. Yet by presenting welfare cuts as an alternative to reductions in state spending on education, Mr Wilson has effectively pitted the interests of middle-class Californians against those of the underprivileged and, to a large degree, whites against minorities. The governor maintains 'tough times require tough choices' between 'runaway' welfare costs and the needs of California's growing school-age population. Few would deny that California faces a welfare spending crisis. In the current fiscal year the state expects to pay Dollars 2.8bn in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the primary welfare programme. Without any changes, AFDC costs are projected to rise to Dollars 3.1bn next year, a 54 per cent increase over expenditures in the 1988-89 fiscal year. Before the Los Angeles riots, Mr Wilson dismissed as 'partisan twaddle' the charges of some democratic legislators that his proposals were an attack on poor minorities that could incite 'class warfare'. Today the potential for a violent reaction to welfare cuts is not so remote and some political analysts expect voters to reject the 'reforms' rather than risk more social unrest and racial tension. Others fear a backlash as voters associate welfare families with the looting, arson and murder that swept through Los Angeles. Mr Wilson says voters will view the Los Angeles riots as proof that the welfare system needs to be reformed. 'If people think about what causes people to go out and. . . engage in brutality. . . they're going to conclude that it reflects a total absence of real values. 'And, unfortunately, a lot of it comes back to the fact that we've got kids, through no fault of their own, being neglected from early childhood.'</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Greycoat Pounds 40m in the red and calls for Pounds 47m Greycoat, the property developer rescued from the brink of collapse last November, has launched a Pounds 47m rights issue to purchase and refinance the remaining 50 per cent of 123/151 Buckingham Palace Road, London, which has been valued at Pounds 159m. It is paying Pounds 18.2m for Sir Robert McAlpine Group's half of the 386,600 sq ft office and retail property. Greycoat also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 40m (Pounds 167m) for the year to end-March. However, the company returned to profitability in the second half with Pounds 3.5m pre-tax. Losses per share were 10.5p (92.5p). Mr Richard Guignard, joint managing director, described the latest transaction as 'a housekeeping exercise'. A Pounds 125m loan attached to the property was due for repayment next January, giving Greycoat the choice between buying the remaining half, or selling the property. The loan will be replaced with a Pounds 82.5m facility from Hypo Bank, and the remaining Pounds 42.5m will be covered by the rights proceeds and internal resources. The cash call will allow Greycoat to progress beyond mere survival, but the stock market reacted unenthusiastically to the deal. The shares fell 1 1/2 p to 15 1/2 p. Some analysts expressed concern over the proximity to last November's restructuring by Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, the South African investors who enabled the company to avoid receivership. Mr Treger said: 'It is a one-off opportunity to consolidate the portfolio, as part of the ongoing restructuring of Greycoat.' The offer is on a 3-for-8 basis at 13p, a discount of 24 per cent to the previous closing price. The issue is underwritten by NM Rothschild and Samuel Montagu. The rights will dilute net asset value from 17.4p, as of March, to 15.9p, but it is sufficiently above the rights price to encourage support for the issue. Gearing will fall from 152 per cent to 137 per cent. Greycoat will emerge with 100 per cent ownership of two significant properties, and an option on a third. Britannic House, in London's Finsbury Circus, was effectively ring-fenced to protect Greycoat, but the company can repurchase it up to 2002, at a price which reflects the obligations of the debtors rather than the value of the property. Once the property value, currently Pounds 133m, exceeds the Pounds 150m value of debt, virtually all additional valuation increase would accrue to shareholders, Mr Guignard said. In addition, Greycoat revealed that it planned to proceed with the controversial Pounds 350m development of Paternoster Square in early 1995, subject to securing development financing. It owns 21 per cent of the City project, which last August received planning consents. Its Pounds 15m investment has been written down to nothing, and Mr Guignard was adamant that Greycoat would not invest further capital into development projects. However, Greycoat's project management role could leave it with a carrying stake in the largest new development in the City. Following the rights issue, the company is proposing a 1-for-10 share consolidation. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cordoba -- Governor Eduardo Angeloz has been invited  to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton during the course of  this year, on a date that has yet to be determined. The U.S.  President sent him the invitation with Howard Glicken, who  arrived in Cordoba on 26 April aboard a private plane to meet  with Angeloz.    Glicken, a U.S. Democratic Party leader, played a major role  in the organization of Clinton's presidential election campaign.  The invitation was extended by the U.S. politician during a  luncheon Angeloz gave at his home of Las Tejas. After this  meeting, Glicken returned to Buenos Aires City aboard his plane.    The presence of the U.S. visitor was much discussed in the  corridors of power in Cordoba. The invitation was interpreted  as stemming from Angeloz's position as the possible Radical  Civic Union presidential candidate for the 1995 elections, and  also as an acknowledgement of his leadership within his province.</p>

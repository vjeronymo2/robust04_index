			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik met  editors in chief of Slovak newspapers and directors of the  electronic media. Under discussion were current political  problems, on which the prime minister replied to numerous  questions from representatives of the press. After the meeting,  reporter Lydia Mrazova asked Jozef Moravcik for an interview.    [Begin recording] [Mrazova] Today is 77 days since you  became  prime minister in this government, and during this short time --  you could describe it as such -- the opposition has tried to  dismiss Roman Kovac and Minister Janicina. Do you think will  there yet be another?    [Moravcik] The tactics of the present opposition suggest  that  it will probably not stop playing this game, this destructive  game, and that it will try to continue with it. I do not have  any concrete information about who it might be.    [Mrazova] And what about fears?    [Moravcik] No fears, because until now the means of  presentation tended to harm those presenting proposals for  dismissal.    [Mrazova] According to what you said, although the coalition  was formed with partners of differing orientations, the  coalition is functioning well. During the vote of confidence  vote in the minister for the administration and privatization it  transpired that even deputies from the coalition parties  contributed several votes in favor if his dismissal. Some  expressed the view in the lobby that although they will not be  voting for his dismissal they consider him to be the weakest  point in the government. I do not expect you to criticize your  minister, but how would you characterize this post?    [Moravcik] I have already said many times that privatization  is a meeting point for a large number of conflicting interests  and various organizations which exert various kinds of  influence. What we call lobbies today are very strong. A  minister in this position has to have a very firm character and  also sound nerves because to manage all that, to resist all the  pressures, and to organize and carry out privatization in such a  way that it supports the government's policy is very demanding.  It really is a very demanding position and I am satisfied with  how the work is being carried out. So far, we have managed to  overcome all the differences that have appeared, the different  views that have appeared, which are entirely natural. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

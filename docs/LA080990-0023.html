			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERIM CITY MANAGER NAMED  </P> <P> Retired Huntington Beach City Manager Charles Thompson has been appointed  interim city manager of Lawndale.  </P> <P> Thompson, 62, will replace James Arnold, who was ousted last month shortly  after he pleaded not guilty to 17 misdemeanor charges stemming from the  demolition of three city buildings containing asbestos.  </P> <P> Thompson, who will serve as the city's fourth manager in less than three years,  was appointed to the job Monday with the unanimous support of the council.  </P> <P> He will start next Monday and is expected to continue in the position until  Dec. 1. He will be paid $6,000 a month plus an estimated $9,000 in overtime and  expenses for helping to recruit a permanent city manager.  </P> <P> Thompson, who has about 35 years of experience in city management, was  Huntington Beach's city manager from 1981 to October, 1987, before he retired  to work on his own consulting business. Previously, he was Downey's city  manager from 1970 to 1981. He lives in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Carol Norman, a critic of Arnold, described Thompson as a  professional who "has a reputation for being strong, but fair" and who is noted  for being a "good, take-charge type of a person."  </P> <P> Mayor Harold Hofmann, who cast the sole vote against removing Arnold, also  expressed confidence in Thompson. "He is a knowledgeable city manager, has a  lot of experience, and comes to us with good credentials," Hofmann said. "I am  very impressed with him."  </P></p>

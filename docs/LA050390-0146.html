			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINES SET FOR FAILING TO SAVE WATER;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA: THOSE RESIDENTS WHO DON'T REPLACE WATER-GUZZLING PLUMBING WITH  LOW-FLOW FIXTURES FACE A PENALTY OF $1 A MONTH.  </P> <P> Santa Monica residents soon will have a new incentive to conserve water:  They'll be charged a monthly fine if they don't.  </P> <P> On a 5-2 vote, the City Council Tuesday night approved the fines -- or  "conservation incentive fees," as city officials prefer to call them -- as part  of its five-year, $2.9-million program to conserve water by replacing  water-guzzling plumbing fixtures with low-flow fixtures.  </P> <P> State water officials said they believe the law, which takes effect July 1,  would make Santa Monica the first California city to require the installation  of water-saving fixtures in existing residences.  </P> <P> The law calls for residents and landlords to replace old toilets with new ones  that use a maximum of 1.6 gallons per flush, and to install shower heads that  limit flow to 3 gallons or less per minute.  </P> <P> After July 1, owners of single-family residences who have not complied will  have $1 a month added to their water bills, and owners of multifamily buildings  will be charged 65 cents each month per unit. Commercial properties are not  affected.  </P> <P> All residents will be charged the fine through their water bill until the new  fixtures are inspected and verified by city officials.  </P> <P> Low-flow toilets cost from $99 to $250, according to city officials. They  estimate that single-family homeowners can recoup their costs through lower  water bills in 9 1/2 to 21 months, depending on whether they install the  fixtures themselves or hire a plumber. For apartment owners, the pay-back  period ranges from 11 months to two years.  </P> <P> Santa Monica already requires low-flow toilets and shower heads in all new  construction. Similar laws are in effect in Los Angeles and many other  California cities.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and several other cities also require retrofitting of existing  homes whenever they are sold. But a spokesman at the State Department of Water  Resources' drought center said Santa Monica's new monthly charge on existing  residences was unprecedented.  </P> <P> To encourage residents to retrofit, Santa Monica is giving away 1,000 new  toilets to residents on a first-come, first-served basis. Cash rebates of $100  per bathroom will also be given to residents who retrofit.  </P> <P> Santa Monica's conservation coordinator, Atossa Soltani, said about 1,300 new  toilets have been installed so far in the city. About 700 of the free toilets  and about $41,000 in rebates have been distributed so far to property owners.  </P> <P> The city has set a goal of retrofitting 25% of the city's 11,400 single-family  homes and 36,500 units of multifamily housing within the next five years. If  that goal is reached, at the end of the five years about 936 acre-feet of water  could be saved annually, or about 835,200 gallons per day.  </P> <P> But so far the city is behind schedule. To achieve its goal, about 4,000  toilets would have to be installed each year, according to Soltani. At the  current rate, less than 3,000 new toilets would be installed by the end of the  year.  </P> <P> According to Metropolitan Water District estimates, 45% of all water used in a  household is flushed down toilets. About 30% of the water is used for bathing.  </P></p>

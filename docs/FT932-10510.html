			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Ice-cream market to be probed COMPETITION in the Pounds 800m-a-year ice-cream market is to be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Office of Fair Trading announced yesterday. The commission will examine the widespread practice among manufacturers of supplying freezer cabinets free of charge to small retail outlets, on condition that the cabinets are not used to stock competitors' products. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was concerned that the practice, known as freezer exclusivity, prevented smaller companies from entering the market. Consumers would benefit from wider choice and keener price competition if retailers were free to stock rival products in the same cabinet. Sir Bryan believed freezer exclusivity had been 'a major factor' in the success of Wall's, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, in raising its share of 'impulse' ice-cream sales to between 60 per cent and 70 per cent. These sales, typically made at newsagents and kiosks, are worth about Pounds 350m a year. The inquiry is a victory for Mars, the US-owned food manufacturer, which has repeatedly challenged Unilever's domination of the European ice-cream market in Brussels and in national courts. Mars, which began making ice-cream versions of its chocolate bars in 1989, has about 10 per cent of UK impulse sales, which are the fastest-growing part of the market. Mars welcomed the inquiry. But Wall's said it was 'surprised and disappointed' by the OFT's decision after a report by the commission in 1979 had cleared the practice of freezer exclusivity. Wall's said six new competitors had entered the UK market in the past five years. Its own growth since 1979 had been due to new products, advertising and service to retailers, rather than to freezer exclusivity, which was a 'not unreasonable' practice. According to the OFT, about 90,000 retail outlets have freezer cabinets, of which 42,000 are supplied by Wall's. The earlier commission report said competition would benefit if more retailers had their own freezers. The legal battle over ice-cream broke out three years ago, when Unilever obtained a court injunction in Ireland prohibiting Mars products from being stocked in Unilever freezers. Mars appealed against the ruling but lost. Under pressure from Mars, however, the European Commission last year suspended arrangements which Unilever and Scholler Lebensmittel, a large German ice-cream manufacturer, used to exclude competitors from many retail outlets. The EC also expressed doubts about the legality of freezer exclusivity, which it is still investigating.</p>

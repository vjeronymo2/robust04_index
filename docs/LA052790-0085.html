			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: ETHNIC L.A. BY ZENA PEARLSTONE (HILLCREST PRESS, P.O. BOX  10636, BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF. 90210: $12.95; 188 PP.)  </P> <P> Los Angeles is the second-largest Mexican, Armenian, Korean, Filipino,  Salvadoran and Guatemalan city in the world, and more than 50 foreign-language  newspapers are published in L.A. County, says Zena Pearlstone in "Ethnic L.A."  Her book describes the enormous human diversity of the city, to which the  author applies the metaphor mosaic rather than melting pot, because the  communities tend to retain their individual characters. With its statistics and  local histories of the various ethnic groups, this book can be used as a  reference, or it can function as a guidebook: It concludes with lists of ethnic  foods, religious centers and a calendar of celebrations that could keep any  tourist occupied every day of the year.

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Hidden risks of metal detection I HAVE been asked to allow someone to operate a metal detector on my land. I am concerned about the rights and liabilities of both the operator and myself. Should the operator injure himself could I be made liable for damages? If anything valuable is unearthed on my land who is the legal owner. How can I ensure that the land is restored to its original condition. A written agreement might be desirable but the operator is only pursuing his hobby and I do not wish to put him to any expense. Your concerns are justified. It would be wise to have a short written agreement (informal) signed by both of you in which you are declared to be not liable in respect of any injury to the operator or his goods arising out of the state of the land or anything on or in the land, providing for the operator at his expense to restore the land to its condition as it is before any operation of his and providing for him to report any finds to you and covering who is to have the right to anything found; without such agreement you are the owner of whatever is in your land unless it is treasure trove, in which case it belongs to the Crown. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 8 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  threatened here Monday [7 March] to retaliate against alleged  deficiencies in U.S. tariff-reducing offers in the final days of  the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks.    EU foreign ministers said in a statement that the Union  should reduce its tariff offers on items important to the United  States in retaliation at deficient offers made by Washington.    They said the United States had made disappointing offers in  tariff-cutting schedules that are to be included in the final  Uruguay Round agreement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade to be signed in Marrakesh on April 15.    An EU official, citing U.S. tariffs on trucks and copper,  said the Union might in retaliation reduce its tariff-cutting  offer in products such as nonferrous metals.    The ministers said such reprisals should target products  where the United States supplied 90 percent of EU requirements,  and should be carefully calibrated so that they could not be  blamed for unravelling the Uruguay Round.    The meeting also expressed alarm at last week's decision by  the United States to reactivate its Super 301 trade regulation  to force open the Japanese market.    The statement said the trade measure would be carefully  scrutinised to make sure it did not violate EU trade rights.    A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan quoted  him  as saying that Super 301 was viewed with concern as a unilateral  trade reprisal that went against the GATT tide of multilateral  dispute settlement.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stressed France's demand  that the effect on trade of environmental, social and monetary  issues should be spotlighted at the Marrakesh conference, where  a new World Trade Organisation is to be set up.    The French demand aims at preventing countries profiting  from  cut-price exports through poor environmental and social  standards, and monetary manipulation.    There was some suport for establishing an environmental  committee at Marrakesh. "But let's not cloud the Uruguay Round  with other issues now," Brittan's spokesman said.</p>

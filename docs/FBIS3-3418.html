			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 (AFP)--At least two protestors  Monday [21 March] scattered pamphlets in Tiananmen Square here  as a group of delegates to China's parliament were passing,  witnesses said. Police immediately grabbed the camera of an  Agence France-Presse photographer who had taken pictures of the  protest and opened it to expose the film. A plainclothes  policeman filmed the entire incident.    Witnesses said several hundred people were gathered behind  security barriers on the eastern side of the square to watch the  delegates leave the parliament building when, about 10:45 a.m.  (0245 GMT), the pamphlets were scattered by at least two  protestors stationed at different parts of the square.  Uniformed and plainclothed police, who have been controlling  access to the square since parliament opened its annual session  March 10, quickly moved to disperse the crowd and seal off the  area. The pamphlets were also hastily gathered up. It was not  known if any arrests were made.    Tiananmen Square was the scene of massive pro-democracy  protests which were crushed by the Army during the night of June  3-4, 1989. Since delegates from all over China arrived for the  parliament session, dissidents and intellectuals have made  several attempts to put across their pro-democracy and pro-human  rights views. Three open letters have been sent to delegates,  but Monday was the first time dissidents have openly defied the  police.    Before the session began, police launched a massive campaign  to intimidate opposition with the arrest of some 15 dissidents,  forcing some of the better-known to stay away from the capital  while parliament met.    In a separate development, a Chinese carrying a letter  addressed to communist party and parliamentary leaders calling  for democracy was arrested just after meeting journalists,  several witnesses said.    Gao Hongming, a civil servant in his 40s, was detained by  plainclothes police and pushed into a black car as he came out  of the Jianguomenwai foreigners' compound on the east side of  the capital in early afternoon. The letter, dated March 7, had  already been sent to the party Central Committee and parliament,  Gao said before his arrest.</p>

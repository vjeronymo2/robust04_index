			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Helical Bar raising Pounds 20m HELICAL BAR, the London-based property investment, development and trading group, announces plans to raise Pounds 20m net through a rights issue of 28.9m cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares. Proceeds of the issue, which is underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing, will be used to invest in higher yielding properties and to take advantage of trading opportunities. Helical said the additional liquidity would enable it to continue to respond quickly to these opportunities. The group, which is currently in negotiation to acquire residential, industrial and retail properties valued at about Pounds 25m, added that it views the remainder of the year 'with optimism,' and expects to increase the total ordinary dividend by about 20 per cent. Last year the group also boosted its dividend by 20 per cent to 4.8p after reporting a profit turnaround. The ordinary share price closed up 10p yesterday at 236p. Helical raised Pounds 19m through a convertible preference share issue in October 1987. Under the terms of the latest proposal shareholders will be offered the new 5.25p net convertible preference shares 2012 of 70p each at 72p per share on the basis of 7-for-5 ordinary and 1-for-2.785 existing convertible preference shares. They were unchanged at 85p. In addition the group is proposing a capital reorganisation which would change the rights of the existing 5.25p cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares 2012 of Pounds 1 each, to ensure that the rights of the new and existing convertible preference shares will be identical. Dealings should start on August 3.</p>

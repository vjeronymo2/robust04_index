			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pressure of `Economic Sanctions' Has No Effect on Korea"-- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- U.S. and British papers  said the "sanctions" have no actual effect on the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, but may bring undesired consequences.    THE NEW YORK TIMES March 23 said the pressure of "economic  sanctions" against North Korea is like trying to squeeze blood  from a stone.    Recalling that the Clinton administration and its Asia  allies  found themselves in an embarrassing position as regards the  "economic sanctions" against North Korea one year ago, the paper  asked what was the use of another "sanctions" against the  country which was virtually suffering from sanctions.    The paper said North Korea, unlike other countries of the  world, has long since adhered to "chuche", "self-reliance", the  keynote of the idea of the great leader President Kim Il-song,  and he has taught the people that dependence on any other  country results in the loss of the political independence of the  state in the long run, encouraging the Korean people to walk  without the help from outside.    Predicting that the world would know the viability of his  independent policy, the paper quoted a Japanese official as  saying that getting on the nerve of North Korea causes an  adverse effect.    The British paper THE TIMES March 22 noted that the U.S.  diplomacy was now in the worst phase, adding that "economic  sanctions" against North Korea could not be regarded as a wise  option and some countries do not like "sanctions" much.</p>

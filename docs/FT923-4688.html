			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Fashion: Just popping over to Paris for a tie . . . / A look at where the elitists of men's European fashion choose their clothes ONE OF the pleasures for a man travelling to Europe used to be the opportunity to return with stylish clothing unavailable in the UK. Gradually, more items have found their way to Britain. But the ultimate wardrobe is a combination of classics acquired from Britain and the rest of Europe. Wider ranges are usually available in a product's country of origin, while the original, continental flagship stores remain an experience in themselves. There are some exclusive, classic items, the finest in their field, which can only be obtained from a particular address. Shirts, for example. The Englishman is well served by Jermyn Street, London, where Hilditch &amp; Key, Harvie &amp; Hudson, New &amp; Lingwood and Turnbull &amp; Asser line up, demonstrating that a crucial component of fine English shirtmaking is an ampersand. But the Englishman abroad should still be tempted by a visit to the Jugendstil building in Vienna which houses the century-old company Knize - a tailor used by French entertainer Maurice Chevalier - famous for its hand-sewn shirts. Battistoni, Italy's most celebrated shirtmaker, has served Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat chairman, and Gore Vidal, the author and style commentator, with custom-made shirts from its Persian-carpeted premises on the Via Condotti in Rome. Charvet, shirtmakers to Windsors, Rothschilds and Rockefellers since 1838, which sells bespoke and ready-made shirts from its premises on the Place Vendome in Paris, is still perhaps the most sought after. Customers are personally escorted in a tiny lift to the company's upper floors where ready-made and made-to-measure shirts are supplied. Charvet's ground floor houses its fabulous selection of ties, another European status item. The language of the old school tie may be an English dialect but the colours of Eton or the Guards go unrecognised on the continent where the neckwear which whispers wealth and taste is the Hermes tie. Its basic design, of tiny interwoven or repeated motifs, often marine or equine, has been imitated but never bettered. Ferragamo, from Florence, is the latest fashionable alternative, with colours a bit bolder and motifs a little more inventive. But the Hermes tie remains the international power tie. The finest selection, including bow ties, is on offer at the Hermes store on the rue du Faubourg St Honore in Paris. That flagship Hermes store also offers one of the most prestigious names in British footwear, John Lobb. In London, Lobb produces made-to-measure shoes, which, are among the best in the world. But at Hermes you can buy ready-made Lobb shoes, a strange twist on bringing home stylish items. Paris also contains one of Europe's most prestigious ready-made shoe shops, JM Weston, on the Champs Elysee, where the styles are discreetly classic. However, in terms of identifiable styling, the Gucci loafer, available from the original Gucci boutique, on Florence's Via Tornabuoni, reigns supreme. This kind of light footwear suggests that your feet barely touch the ground between carpeted office and chauffered limousine. Italy beats France by a short head when it comes to hats. True, Motsch et fils, the hatters on the avenue George V, in Paris, does have a fine selection of traditional styles, and a real understanding of what an Englishman can wear. But Borsalino, perhaps the most celebrated name in hats, combines tradition with a unique flair. Its original shop is on the corner of the Piazza della Scala in Milan, but the best stocked is on Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, where you can find everything from an Indiana Jones fedora to something more suited to the urban jungle. A fine briefcase is clearly important to the Euro executive. It should fall somewhere between the lightness of an Italian Bottega Veneta, and the heaviness of an English Swaine, Adeney. Louis Vuitton luggage achieves the class which its brash monogram designs lack. Frankfurt is the home of Gold-Pfeil products. Its top quality leather goods, often in intriguing shades and colours, are rapidly gaining recognition. If you do want something made in Spain, then one of the traditionally-tooled leather belts from Loewe, sold in Madrid since 1846, will bring a genuinely Castilian flavour to your wardrobe. There is a tendency to inflate the reputation of foreign items which are hard to find in the UK, so the Laguiole pocket knife, from France, has gained cult status, simply because the Swiss Army knife is so easy to obtain. Equally, there is a tendency to downgrade our homegrown creations. Yet, when it comes to bespoke tailoring, there really is nowhere to match London's Savile Row. There is Cifonelli in Paris, famous for its jacket shoulders, and there is Caraceni in Milan, which dresses Euro cognoscenti like Baron Heinrich von Thyssen and Karl Lagerfeld. But there is something about the sharper cut favoured on the continent which is off-putting to the well-suited Englishman. For off-the-peg, however, you do have to go Italian. Immediately, everyone thinks of Armani, but his couture-level designs are now veering into an extremely relaxed style, inappropriate for many executives. Ermenegildo Zegna is much more discreet in its styling. Its comfortable, crease-resistant fabrics, and subtly patterned, and impeccably tailored suits, are ideal for international businessmen. At its store on the Via Pietro Verri in Milan, it offers some of the most sophisticated off-the-peg suits in Europe. The green Loden overcoat has become a badge of the European intellectual. It is the only item of traditional Austrian apparel which has broken the Lederhosen image barrier, and the reason why it is worth visiting Lanz, in Salzburg, which makes the best in the world. Of course, inclement weather brings out the best of British with the Burberry raincoat, or the Brigg umbrella. Ironically, of course, half of Europe is trying to look like the English, from Italians in brogues and Prince of Wales check suits, to Frenchmen fixated on le style Anglais. Or, as Tom Wolfe observed: 'At a certain level in the class struggle, once you pass a certain point, everyone dresses English.'</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNFIT FOR USE;  </P> <P> NEW LAKE AT HANSEN DAM TO BE FILLED IN  </P> <P> A small lake recently dug out behind the walls of Hansen Dam in Lake View  Terrace is a community hazard, unfit for swimming and fishing, and will be  filled in with sand this month, federal officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land, comes at  a time when area residents are demanding that a recreational lake be restored  at Hansen Dam as part of the area's revitalization.  </P> <P> Residents had hoped that the 10- to 15-acre body of water, dug out by a private  contractor dredging silt from the dam, could be used for recreational purposes  this summer.  </P> <P> "The people are going to get a lake; we're planning for it," said Lowell  Flannery, chief of operations and maintenance at corps projects in the Los  Angeles area. "But not this one this summer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Excavation Allowed  </P> <P> A year ago, corps officials allowed contractor Bill Blomgren to excavate an  area in the dam with the hope that it could be used this summer for swimming  and fishing. Blomgren said he would grade a road and parking lot for free.  </P> <P> Blomgren is the sole contractor permitted by the corps to dig out silt for sale  to construction firms. He pays the federal government 15 to 20 cents in  royalties for each ton of silt removed.  </P> <P> The water that has collected this past year, however, is now blooming with  algae and is unhealthful for swimming because it contains runoff from horse  stables upstream, corps officials said.  </P> <P> The lake's warm water temperature makes it undesirable for stocking with game  fish, except for catfish, which are predators that would swim upstream into the  Big Tujunga Wash, eating and possibly threatening the existence of native fish  species, corps officials said.  </P> <P> Also, the lake is too close to the huge bulldozers and earthmoving equipment  excavating sand and gravel, making the area dangerous for recreation.  </P> <P> With the recent hot weather and impending summer months, the unsupervised lake  is an "attractive nuisance" and could lead to injury or drowning, said Wanda  Kiebala, chief of the recreation division for the corps.  </P> <P> The decade-long deterioration of the Hansen Dam Recreation Area -- whose  once-vibrant lake was choked dry in the early 1980s by a buildup of silt -- has  been a source of community anger for years. It has come to symbolize what some  people see as governmental insensitivity to the needs of the largely  low-income, minority area that the park once served. When the lake was reduced  to a stagnant pond, the surrounding park area slowly turned into an encampment  of homeless people.  </P> <P> In May, 1988, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) obtained congressional  approval to use Blomgren's royalty payments to pay for park revitalization and  lake restoration. Funds will total about $600,000 by the end of this year,  corps officials said.  </P> <P> Tuesday night, the corps sponsored a community meeting to hear residents'  recommendations on how the park should be redeveloped. The meeting was the  first step toward creation of a corps-written master plan that will map out all  future development of the 1,450-acre area.  </P> <P> The overwhelming response was an angry call to restore the lake and horse  trails through the park, destroyed by silt inundation and the subsequent  excavation.  </P> <P> "Everyone feels the same way," said Harlene Kelley, a 33-year Lake View Terrace  resident. "We want what was once ours back again."  </P> <P> Many were critical of the corps bureaucracy, which will need more than a year  to complete the master plan.  </P> <P> "Cynicism prevails," said RobRoy McGregor of Lake View Terrace. "We all hope  this lake is going to come to pass in our lifetimes, but dealing with the corps  is like climbing the insurmountable."  </P></p>

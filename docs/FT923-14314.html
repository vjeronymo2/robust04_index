			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Lenders threaten rise in mortgage rates TWO OF Britain's biggest mortgage lenders accused the government yesterday of unfair competition in attracting savings and warned that they might be forced to raise mortgage rates unless there was a cut in bank base rates. The protests came after yesterday's launch of a new National Savings product, the First Option Bond, which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had promised in the Budget. First Option Bond pays an interest rate of 7.75 per cent net (equivalent to 10.34 per cent gross) guaranteed for one year on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. A comparable savings product from a building society would be expected to yield less than 10 per cent gross. Banks and building societies argue that the government has an unfair advantage over them in setting rates on its savings products in that it does not have to be profitable. 'National Savings are offering totally unrealistic rates which are not pitched to market rates,' one of the biggest UK building societies said yesterday. 'We cannot afford to be seen by our savers to be giving uncompetitive rates. If there is no cut in base rates, we will have to consider increasing mortgage rates.' Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said National Savings was trying to raise Pounds 6bn at the expense of the building societies. He said he did not welcome the competition because 'it is not on proper terms'. Building societies have had a bad year in attracting funds. Net receipts for the year to May were Pounds 657m compared with Pounds 1.53bn of net receipts into National Savings. A high street bank said yesterday that if there was not a base rate cut and if it lost too much business to the new product, it might be forced to raise mortgage rates although it was not in its interests to do so. The bank argued that it was 'owed' a drop in base rates because the government had cut base rates by a 0.5 percentage point against a 0.85-point drop by the bank. 'The government wants us to cut mortgage rates to get the housing market moving, but National Savings is not helping us at all in attracting savers and funds,' it said. National Savings cut the rate on its certificates from 8.5 per cent to 8 per cent this year, but it raised the limit for individual holdings of its variable rate Income Bonds from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 50,000. The vast majority of young adults still want to own their own homes in spite of falling house prices and record repossessions, according to a survey conducted for Woolwich Building Society.</p>

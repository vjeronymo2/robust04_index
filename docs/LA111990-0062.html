			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-FIVE FOR SELES IN FINAL;  </P> <P> TENNIS: TEEN-AGER OUTLASTS SABATINI IN FIRST FIVE-SET WOMEN'S MATCH SINCE 1901.  </P> <P> The last important women's tennis match of the year lasted until almost, oh,  the first of next year before Monica Seles ended the first five-set women's  match since 1901 with one final blistering backhand into the corner that  Gabriela Sabatini could not track down.  </P> <P> Match time could have been kept by calendar instead of a clock, but after 3  hours 47 minutes Sunday, Seles outlasted Sabatini, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, to  win the Virginia Slims Championships, her second major title of 1990.  </P> <P> The winner's reaction? "It was so long out there," Seles said.  </P> <P> But it took a while before Seles said so long to Sabatini. Seles, the  16-year-old Yugoslav who lives in Florida and who won the French Open in June,  came from a set down to take the fourth set on a critical double fault by  Sabatini, then out-hammered her 20-year-old counterpart in a historic fifth  set.  </P> <P> The last five-set match in women's tennis was 89 years ago in the final of the  U.S. Nationals when Elizabeth Moore defeated Myrtle McAteer, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5,  2-6, 6-2. Five-set matches were abolished in 1902 and the format was not  revived until the Virginia Slims Championships began in 1984.  </P> <P> However, Seles said she did not feel tired after playing five sets. No, it was  something else.  </P> <P> "I was getting hungry," Seles said. "I didn't have my lunch."  </P> <P> But if Seles missed her meal, she didn't miss her paycheck. Seles collected a  check for $671,851, which includes $350,000 and the remainder from bonus pools.  </P> <P> Seles won nine tournaments and $1.6 million in 1990, which probably means if  she ever gets lost in Bloomingdale's again, as she did last week, at least she  will have a nice way to spend the time looking for her parents.  </P> <P> Sabatini, who knocked off No. 1-ranked Steffi Graf in Saturday's semifinals,  may have deserved a better outcome against Seles, but seemed strangely content  to remain on the baseline and trade groundstrokes late in the match.  </P> <P> There wasn't much she could do about that, said Sabatini, who attacked the net  consistently against Graf.  </P> <P> "Today I play more from the baseline," Sabatini said. "Monica didn't give me  many chances. It was the only way I could beat her."  </P> <P> The key game in the match occurred in the fourth set when Sabatini served in  the 10th game, down 4-5. But she double-faulted to 15-30 and double-faulted  again at 30-40 to allow Seles to force a fifth set.  </P> <P> Until then, it looked as if Seles' best chance already had come and gone. Seles  led, 5-4, in the second set and seemed on the verge of taking a two-set lead,  but won only one point as she served for the set.  </P> <P> Sabatini's touch volley winner broke Seles and evened the set at 5-5. Sabatini  held for 6-5, then broke Seles again for one set all.  </P> <P> By then, Seles said she was becoming a bit discouraged.  </P> <P> "I just tried to forget what happened in the second set," Seles said. "I just  kept telling myself 'You got to take chances, and then I just went for a lot  more shots."  </P> <P> It probably also helped that Sabatini made 15 of her 57 unforced errors in the  fifth set. But even more vital to Seles' cause was how she attacked Sabatini's  second serve.  </P> <P> Sabatini won only 22 points on 66 second serves.  </P> <P> "The key was who might attack the serve more," Seles said.  </P> <P> Sabatini, who picked up a total of $322,529 for the day for her runner-up  finish as well from the bonus pool, ended the year with $973,062 in prize  money.  </P> <P> "It's hard to say what is happening inside," Sabatini said. "All I was caring  about was the match, each point. I felt like I could play forever."  </P> <P> They almost did.  </P> <P> * AGASSI WINS: Andre Agassi defeats top-ranked Stefan Edberg in the ATP finals.  C26.  </P></p>

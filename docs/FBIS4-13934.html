			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Uzi Mahanaymi] </F>   [Excerpt] In a coordination meeting held in Tunis this  month between Yasir 'Arafat and his advisers and senior Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] representatives, a framework for  cooperation between the two dominant Palestinian organizations  in the territories was worked out.    It was decided that Fatah will pursue the negotiations with  Israel in accordance with the Oslo principles, while the Hamas  will continue with controlled operations in order to increase  the pressure on Israel and facilitate the withdrawal process.    During this meeting, 'Arafat did not call on Hamas to stop  the attacks against Israel. Incidentally, the attacks involved  are the 'Afula and Hadera attacks, which 'Arafat later denounced.    The cooperation discussed is not of an operational nature,  nor does it involve early coordination regarding Hamas  operations, seeing that Hamas is an independent organization.  The participants could surmise, however, that as far as 'Arafat  is concerned, Hamas' approach is also beneficial in terms of  achieving the goal: namely, removing Israel from the territories.    Following the meeting the two organizations worked out  cooperation frameworks for Gaza, Jericho, and other territories  Fatah takes over if and when Israel evacuates them. [passage  omitted]</p>

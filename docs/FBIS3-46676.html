			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- Korea produced a  cellulose albuminous fodder highly effective in economy.    The fodder, rich in protein, consists of different nutrients  needed for accelerating the growth of livestocks.    Particularly, it contains more ferment, vitamin and other  activated materials than other fodder.    The albuminous fodder increases the daily growing rate of  pig  or duck 20 percent higher than other fodder.    The quantity of fodder consumption is notably diminished and  the rate of protein digestion rises by far.    The fodder is made from rice straw, cornhusk, corncob,  sawdust and other cellulose materials by a diastatic method.    150 or 200 kilograms of albuminous fodder, 30 kilograms of  microbial protein and some alcohol are obtained from one ton of  cornhusk.    The cellulose albuminous fodder, which has been rapidly  introduced in stockbreeding in Korea, was developed by the  scientists and technicians of the protein synthesis section  under the Institute of the Industrial Microbiology of the  Academy of Sciences.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Lamont sees two years of fast growth in economy BRITAIN is likely to grow faster than other European economies in 1993 and 1994, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday in his most upbeat assessment of the economy for some months. Speaking after a meeting in Luxembourg of European Community and European Free Trade Area finance ministers, he said: 'The prospects for Britain are very encouraging, even though the outlook for much of the rest of Europe remains of concern.' His remarks coincided with a forecast from the European Commission that growth in the EC this year was likely to be 0.75 per cent. Growth could rise to 2.3 per cent in 1994, taking into account the EC's package of measures agreed at the Edinburgh summit last December to improve the performance of member states' economies and provide for more flexible Community lending to small and medium-sized businesses. Further evidence of recovery in the UK came yesterday in a Confederation of British Industry survey showing that retail sales grew strongly in the year to March. The CBI reported that sales were up year-on-year for the third consecutive month, although the improvement was not yet firmly established. Another note of caution was sounded by Gallup, the market research company. Its latest consumer confidence survey found that the public was very unsure about the strength and durability of any recovery. Although sentiment about the general economic situation has improved, people are still wary about their own financial prospects. The latest UK Treasury growth forecast is 1.25 per cent in 1993, and an annual rate of 3 per cent in the first half of 1994 compared with the first six months of this year. At the Luxembourg meeting, Mr Lamont vigorously denied that the UK was pursuing growth through a competitive devaluation of sterling. The pound has been floating along with the lira since both currencies were forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism last September. The chancellor indicated that the UK government would like to see sterling appreciate, partly to offset inflationary pressures. He noted that UK inflation had not risen as sharply as many had expected, but added: 'I welcome strongly the recent strength of sterling.' The relatively strong UK economic performance since the exit from the ERM has caused some irritation inside the EC. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has attacked 'wildcat devaluations' which had artificially boosted competitiveness. In Luxembourg yesterday, Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said there was 'nothing astonishing' about Britain starting to regain its economic potential after a protracted recession. 'It would be much more catastrophic if there was no sign of recovery in the UK after a long period of negative growth,' said the Danish commissioner. Mr Christophersen also predicted that the UK would eventually have to return to the ERM because, he said, staying out was 'not a viable long-term strategy'. Although the UK government has insisted that sterling will not return until what it says are fault-lines inside the ERM are corrected, Mr Christophersen said the only viable strategy was to take part in European monetary integration, even if members could discuss the speed of membership.

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 15 (XINHUA) -- A trade delegation  led by Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation Wu Yi arrived here early this morning to explore the  ways and means of expanding Sino-Indian bilateral trade.    Wu Yi, who is on a three-day visit to India at the  invitation  of the Indian Commerce Ministry, will attend the fifth meeting  of the Sino-Indian Joint Team for Economic and Trade Affairs  which is taking place in a few hours.    The two sides "will discuss matters of common interest  relating to economic, trade and technological cooperation  between the two countries," she said at the airport.    The joint team was set up after late Indian Prime Minister  Rajiv Gandhi visited China in 1988 to promote bilateral trade  between the two countries.    The two countries will sign the minutes of talks and the  protocol on trade for 1994-95 at the conclusion of the one-day  meeting of the joint team.    During her stay here, she will meet Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Finance  Minister Manmohan Singh, Minister of State for Steel S.M. Dev,  Minister of State for Coal A. Panja as well as Minister of State  for Petroleum Captain S. Sharma.    Traveling with her is a 11-member team of businessmen from  Chinese trading corporations dealing with silk, livestock,  mineral products and metallurgy.    The Chinese chief executives will interact directly with  their Indian counterparts to look for more opportunities of  business and cooperation.    Bilateral trade between India and China totaled 670 million  U.S. dollars last year with a surplus of 157 million dollars in  favor of India. China imports large quantities of iron ore,  steel, hides and skins from India and exports silk to it  annually.</p>

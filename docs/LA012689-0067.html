			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEMADE CANDY IS ALWAYS PERFECT GIFT  </P> <P> Rich evaporated milk serves as a delicious base for homemade candies -- a  perfect gift for giving. Its creamy, smooth texture helps the candy remain  moist and fresh for several days.  </P> <P> But be sure to choose the right cooking pan to allow the candy ingredients to  boil freely without running over. It should be heavy enough to keep candy from  burning or sticking to the bottom. In general, the pan should be about four  times as great in volume as the ingredients.  </P> <P> Using a long wooden spoon that won't get too hot to handle is another plus for  home candy makers. A candy thermometer is also a good buy since successful  candy making depends on the temperature and the thermometer takes the guesswork  out of testing the doneness. Be sure to remove candy from heat as you test for  doneness so that overcooking does not occur.  </P> <P> Start candy making with Chocolate-Covered Pecans and Caramel, or Turtles as  they are more commonly called. This simple confection is ideal since it can be  prepared in a relatively short time.  </P> <P> In small saucepan, heat 1/4 cup butter or margarine and 1 cup evaporated milk  until butter is melted. In separate 2-quart saucepan, over medium heat, cook 1  cup sugar, 1 cup dark corn syrup and 1/4 teaspoon salt until it reaches  firm-ball stage (244 degrees). Stir often.  </P> <P> Slowly pour in hot milk mixture so that sugar mixture does not stop boiling.  Stir constantly. Cook mixture until candy reaches firm-ball stage again, then  remove pan from heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla and cool caramel to room  temperature.  </P> <P> Arrange 4 pecans per Turtle on wax paper and place heaping teaspoon of cooled  caramel on each. Let cool until firm. Melt 1 (6-ounce) package semisweet  chocolate pieces on top of double-boiler and spread over caramel. Let cool  until hardened.  </P> <P> To give chocolate shiny, hard coating, add 1 to 2 tablespoons melted paraffin  wax to chocolate, if desired.  </P></p>

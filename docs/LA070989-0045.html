			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME COMPUTER: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> POETRY FROM A PC?  </P> <P> YOU SIT ALONE at your desk by the window. A cold rain pours down outside. You  want to write a poem to tell your lover of your feelings of ineffable longing  and desperate passion. Except, today -- cruel fate -- the words won't come.  </P> <P> But, hey! No problem! Just pop a copy of Poetry Generator into your PC and let  the music play.  </P> <P>  I used to be an expert on  </P> <P>  Things I'd rather not remember  </P> <P>  Now and then  </P> <P>  The pounding of the surf keeps us awake  </P> <P>  And it begins to rain  </P> <P>  In the morning you notice that  </P> <P>  It didn't mean anything.  </P> <P>  But wait a second, you say. Your love is a heavy-duty intellectual, a fan of  Sartre and Heidegger. You can't send a mushy love poem to someone who's into  death, existential terror and the unbearable lightness of being. Then fire up  Poetry Generator one more time and lay this little beauty on her mind:  </P> <P>  Share a glass of wine with me  </P> <P> tonight  </P> <P>  Without letting anyone know  </P> <P>  And I will follow you  </P> <P>  In the milky moonlight  </P> <P>  Faded photographs  </P> <P>  Settle over the landscape  </P> <P>  And it had to end this way  </P> <P>  Sudden the sky grows dark.  </P> <P>  Poetry Generator can compose a poem in about three seconds in any quantity you  like. As with snowflakes, no two are alike. The author, R. K. West of Mission  Hills, has compiled a library of thousands of words and phrases randomly chosen  by the software and then arranged in poetic form according to certain  structural rules. Eight out of each 10 poems make only partial sense, but the  remainder are at least as comprehensible as the sort of things you see in  poetry magazines or the kind of existential Angst that angry young men and  women used to shout out at poetry readings.  </P> <P>  The weight lifters who don't belong here  </P> <P>  Know exactly what they want  </P> <P>  They are all unfaithful to you  </P> <P>  Even though they've lost track of the time  </P> <P>  You feel your cheeks burning with shame  </P> <P>  They look at you through  </P> <P> binoculars  </P> <P>  And your analyst was right.  </P> <P>  Poetry Generator, a shareware program, is available from Public Source, P.O.  Box 4408, Stanford, Calif. 94309. The cost is $3, plus $1 shipping and  California sales tax.  </P> <P> </P></p>

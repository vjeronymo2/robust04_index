			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Brittan to step up calls forJapanese market access SIR Leon Brittan, the EC competition and financial services commissioner, will today renew pressure on Japan to provide genuine equal access to its markets for EC financial institutions, when he addresses the Japanese Financial Services Institute in Tokyo, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. During his six-day visit to Japan Sir Leon is also expected to criticise the international drift towards bilateral trade agreements, such as that between Tokyo and the US. Since Sir Leon's last visit to Japan a year ago, the Community has issued a joint declaration with Japan which called for 'equitable access' to both markets and set up a framework for regular high-level political contacts. The EC and Japan also reached agreement on plans to open the Community market fully to Japanese car imports by 1999. Sir Leon is expected to praise progress made by Tokyo in removing obstacles to foreign companies and enforcing competition powers. But in meetings with politicians and business leaders he will stress the need for Japan to continue the process.</p>

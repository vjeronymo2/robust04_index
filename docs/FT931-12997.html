			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Putting the bite on consumers: A broadly based tax on energy use could be the first step PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has a habit of leaving his options open until the last moment. But it appears likely that in his first economic statement due next month he will try to set a new course for US economic policy by increasing the emphasis on consumption taxes. These currently form a much smaller proportion of total receipts than in other industrial countries. At the weekend Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, signalled that a broad-based tax on energy was being seriously considered as a first step towards higher consumption taxes. Mr Clinton, however, cautioned yesterday that no final decisions on how to trim the deficit had been made. A broad energy tax covering fuels such as coal, natural gas and nuclear power, as well as oil, would be easier to sell politically than a higher levy on petrol alone (which has been mooted several times) because the pain would be spread more evenly. Mr Bentsen said energy taxes were also attractive on environmental grounds, because they would encourage energy conservation. The form an energy tax would take is undecided. Vice-President Al Gore has advocated a tax based on the carbon content of fuels. But the Clinton administration seems more likely to consider a levy based on their heat content, as measured, for example, by British thermal units. The Congressional Budget Office, an independent adviser to Congress, has estimated that a 5 per cent energy tax would raise about Dollars 18bn (Pounds 11.8bn) a year. Mr Bentsen said a more comprehensive shift towards consumption taxes was likely in the longer term as a way of boosting incentives to save and invest. However, complexities over the collection of consumption taxes and their potential 'regressivity' - the fact that they hit the poor harder than the affluent - meant that the timing or extent of such a shift was uncertain. A national sales or value added tax was not on the immediate agenda. He did not, however, rule out other long-term options, such as the 'consumed income' tax advocated last year by a bipartisan commission headed by Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Pete Domenici of New Mexico. A consumed income tax would be collected from individuals rather than businesses and could be levied at a higher rate on the affluent. The main difference from an ordinary income tax is that it would exclude all forms of saving from tax. Other elements of President Clinton's likely economic strategy are also falling into place. He is backing away from his promise to halve the deficit in four years on the grounds that the projected deficits are Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn higher than when he formulated his plan last year. The strategy now favoured is to cut the deficit by about Dollars 145bn over four years - the same absolute amount as promised in the campaign. This would reduce the prospective deficit in fiscal 1997 from about Dollars 350bn to just over Dollars 200bn. Mr Bentsen also confirmed that plans for an income tax cut for middle-income families have effectively been shelved. The administration, however, will press ahead with plans to increase income taxes on the affluent - families earning Dollars 200,000 or more a year. Mr Bentsen refused to be drawn on the size of this tax increase but most observers expect the top marginal rate to rise from 31 to 36 per cent. According to Mr Daniel Patrick Moynihan, his successor as chairman of the powerful Senate finance committee, a larger increase in top marginal rates would be counter-productive because of its impact on economic incentives. On the spending side, Mr Bentsen said all entitlement programmes - medical care for the elderly and poor, and federal pensions - were being examined for possible savings. But he made no specific commitments to curb such programmes, which have caused the deficit to balloon in recent years. Mr Bentsen also signalled that the administration would press ahead with plans for a short-term fiscal stimulus. This was, he said, prudent because the economic recovery had faltered twice in the past two years. He refused to confirm reports that the stimulus would be only about Dollars 20bn, but said it would be much smaller than the Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn mentioned last year.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: TIPS TO AVOID LURE OF CLEVER PONZI SCAMS  </P> <P> Suppose a stranger called you on the telephone and suggested that you invest in  a company that refined sand from a Costa Rican beach into gold.  </P> <P> Would you give him money? Probably not.  </P> <P> Well, what if an executive from an oil and natural gas exploration company that  you've never heard of asked you to hand over some of your hard-earned money so  his company could drill for oil in the Appalachian Mountains?  </P> <P> This executive proves to you that he's found oil once already -- and he really  has -- and that his first group of investors made out pretty well.  </P> <P> This one you might go for.  </P> <P> Both were scams -- the first a pretty transparent one; the second ended up as a  cleverly disguised Ponzi scheme in which a couple of groups of investors got  what looked like a return but really all they were getting was some of the  money being invested by subsequent generations of investors.  </P> <P> Investors lost a lot of money before the government shut the scams down.  </P> <P> In fact, regulators have been shutting down lots of so-called penny stock and  commodity scams lately. And just last week the Justice Department and other  government regulators stepped up their vigilance by establishing a task force  in six major U.S. cities to combat fraud.  </P> <P> The only problem, experts say, is that unsavory characters, including organized  crime figures (see below), seem to be creating new investment scams faster than  the old ones can be eradicated.  </P> <P> Since regulators seem to be making only a little headway on the supply side of  the fraud equation, experts say that controlling the demand for these shady  investments seems to be the best way to reverse the trend.  </P> <P> This won't be easy, of course, since a lot of investors get caught up in scams  because they're greedy. "There's very little a consumer can do except stay  away," says Philip Feigin, Colorado's securities commissioner.  </P> <P> Investors can also watch for certain clues that a scam is in the works. Here  are a dozen tips from Joseph Goldstein, associate director of the Securities  and Exchange Commission's enforcement division (who has even received calls  from probable scam artists while at work), and Sarah Ackerson, assistant  director of market regulations, that might help even the greediest investor  avoid getting scammed.  </P> <P> * Rule 1: Be wary of any investment promise that seems too good. And if the  "broker" guarantees that an investment will yield a certain amount, ask him to  put it in writing. Chances are, says Goldstein, that a crooked broker will  balk.  </P> <P> * Rule 2: Don't be lured into buying penny stocks just because you think it  would be cool to own 10,000 shares of anything.  </P> <P> * Rule 3: Don't trust any broker you don't know. Chances are he got your name  off a list of several hundred potential investors that he's calling that day.  There's a second thing to be wary of here, says Ackerson. Some unscrupulous  brokers will try to develop a rapport with an investor by calling him several  times over a short period of time. But he won't try to sell you anything until  the third phone call or so.  </P> <P> * Rule 4: If you don't understand an investment, don't invest in it.  </P> <P> * Rule 5: Be wary of out-of-town calls. Why would a broker in Florida be  calling your home in Kansas City? Some regulators say that if you can't walk  across the street and shake the broker's hand, why would you trust him with  your money? (A lot of scam artists work out of Florida, according to the SEC.  Since they don't want to meet their prospective customers anyway, the con men  figure they might as well live someplace warm.)  </P> <P> * Rule 6: Before writing that check, investors should investigate the brokerage  firm's history and get a copy of its most recent financial statement. Another  warning: Some scam perpetrators will acquire a legitimate brokerage firm and  assume its identify, so even this precaution isn't foolproof.  </P> <P> * Rule 7: If a broker tries to sell you stock in a company whose price you  can't follow in any of the usual places, be careful. Some legitimate  over-the-counter stocks are listed on what's called the "pink sheets." But if  you can't find price quotes on a stock (except through the broker who sold you  the security), it could mean that the stock and the company don't really exist.  </P> <P> * Rule 8: Ask a regular brokerage like Merrill Lynch whether it would be able  to sell the stock you're thinking of buying. If a regular brokerage firm can't  execute a sell order, you might be stuck with the stock for a long time.  </P> <P> * Rule 9: If a broker you don't know says you have to buy a stock quickly  because something good is going to happen soon, hang up. The typical trick,  says the SEC, is to tell an investor that another customer just canceled a buy  order for some stock that has already gone up in price. The broker then tells  an investor that he can have part of the trade that the other investor  canceled, but only if he moves quickly. "The urgency of the situation is  another red flag," Goldstein says.  </P> <P> * Rule 10: If a broker you are not familiar with tells you he has some hot  information about a company -- for instance, that it is about to be acquired --  chances are you're being set up, Ackerson says.  </P> <P> * Rule 11: Check out the brokerage representative that calls you to see if he  has a record of securities violations. Most states keep tabs on this sort of  thing, as does the SEC. The North American Securities Administrators Assn. in  Washington acts as a liaison with state regulators. Another warning: Most scam  artists are now hiring salespeople right out of college, so the person who  called you last night might not have a record yet.  </P> <P> * Rule 12: Remember that brokers from these scam firms use scripts. So just  because the guy can answer all your questions without stumbling doesn't mean  that he's on the up and up. "They will put you at ease," Goldstein says.  </P> <P> Nobody knows for sure how many stock scams are going on at this time, and even  the experts won't venture a guess as to how much money is taken from defrauded  investors around the country each year. But experts sense that scams are  growing in both number and complexity.  </P> <P> "The criminal element has become more sophisticated," says John Arterberry, who  works on stock frauds at the Justice Department. "They take some of the old  schemes and dress them up."  </P> <P> Consider this: Last summer, regulators in Florida alone inspected 17 brokerages  and found serious violations at 15.  </P> <P> Charles Harper, associate regional administrator at the SEC's Miami office,  says the successful penny stock salesperson can earn between $20,000 and  $30,000 a month. An office manager for an unscrupulous brokerage can rake in  over $2 million a year.  </P> <P> The salespeople work hard, probably each making hundreds of calls a day. One  questionable brokerage operation working out of a motel in Jacksonville, Fla.,  was generating 900 phone calls a day. "They sell nationally," Harper says, "but  a lot of it is sold in Florida because there is a lot of wealth in this state."  To be a success, a salesperson probably only has to get five or so new  customers a day.  </P> <P> Not all crooked stock dealers live in Florida. Feigin, the securities  commissioner in Colorado, says his office's case load has increased 575% since  1982.  </P> <P> The First National Bank of Louisville (Ky.) may be out $10 million and Credit  Suisse may have been taken for $5 million in the Haas Securities scandal, say  sources familiar with the case . . .  </P> <P> Tax experts have suggested that one way to help balance the federal budget  deficit would be through an increase in the so-called sin taxes on liquor and  tobacco. But the Beer Drinkers of America, a 50,000-person strong organization  headquartered in Costa Mesa, thinks that idea is nothing but a lot of froth.  The group -- which says it got some initial funding two years ago from  Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing -- is initiating a national petition drive  campaign to keep Congress' hands off its mugs.  </P> <P> Meredith Berkman contributed to this column.  </P></p>

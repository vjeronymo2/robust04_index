			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London--Quds Press--Hani al-Hasan, member of the  Fatah Central Committee, has said that U.S. President Bill  Clinton's call on the PLO and Israel to send delegations to  Washington to resume the negotiations on implementing the  provisions of the self-rule agreement are only aimed at  containing the incident and ending its repercussions.    He added that the political leadership of the PLO must not  accept a compromise stand from President Clinton's  administration, noting that it must not respond to his call to  go to Washington.    Al-Hasan said that the bloodbath that occurred in the  Ibrahimi Mosque and the Juniyah massacre against Christian  worshipers are both part of an Israeli plan to create chaos in  the region on the road to establishing a new Israeli  geopolitical situation.    Al-Hasan called for escalating confrontations against the  Israeli enemy until the army begins to withdraw from our  territories--occupied since 1967--under UN supervision. He  noted that the escalation of confrontations and the shedding of  the heroic martyrs' blood will only be considered a turning  point if the current negotiations are immediately halted and the  Declaration of Principles signed in Oslo is terminated. There  can be no negotiations except those based on a comprehensive  solution and an immediate Israeli withdrawal from our beloved  homeland.    Al-Hasan urged the Egyptian Government to take measures, to  at least immediately withdraw its Egyptian ambassador from Tel  Aviv and to expel the Israeli ambassador from Cairo.    He called on the Palestinian political forces to meet in  order to draw the bases for a national unity aimed at escalating  the struggle and confrontation against the Israeli enemy.    Al-Hasan said: Fatah cadres inside and outside the occupied  territories should close their ranks and return to our  revolutionary and sound course.    He said that these are historic days in which the failing  ones will be severely punished. He added: As of today, there  will be no place for political committees. Glory to the great  intifadah.</p>

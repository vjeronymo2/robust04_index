			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Employment Minister Michel Giraud by </F> Michele Lecluse; place and date not given]    [Text] While his staff is drafting the documents relating  to the implementation of the five-year law on employment, whose  publication will be extended until the end of March, the  employment minister reveals in an interview to LES ECHOS the  next stages in his action: New measures being studied to boost  employment, bill on participation, preparation of the new  roundtable of social partners at the Hotel Matignon [prime  minister's office], and so forth. For the first time, Michel  Giraud also replies to the president of the republic who is  advocating a "new social contract."    [Lecluse] The prime minister is inviting the social partners  to a roundtable meeing at the Hotel Matignon at the end of  February. What subjects do you plan to discuss?    [Giraud] The aim is to implement the five-year law,  especially as regards negotiations on the adaptation of the  working week, and to urge the social partners who manage  unemployment insurance to reach agreements on long-term  compensations for reduced working time and the differential  compensation paid to the unemployed person who finds a job.    In addition, it strikes me as necessary to pursue the effort  in the sphere of reducing the cost of labor on low wages within  the scope of available budget resources and the effort in the  sphere of youth employment. In addition, I attach particular  importance to the rapid development of service jobs.    [Lecluse] Is that not ring alarm bells?    [Giraud] It has been discussed for a long time, but it does  not ring alarm bells because the five-year law has made  provision for their development through the service voucher  [cheque service]. On a very practical level, tenders are being  invited for implementing it.    [Lecluse] What do you think of the president of the  republic's idea for a "new social contract for employment?"    [Giraud] The president of the republic is putting into words  what the government has been doing since its installation nine  months ago: dialogue, consultation, negotiation... The  drafting of the five-year law gave rise to a very broad exchange  with all the social partners even before its presentation to  Parliament. The law itself strongly revives collective  negotiation in many spheres.    Thus, in the next few months, employers' and trade union  organizations, at branch, enterprise, or establishment level,  will have to decide on the length of the working week, the level  of wages, initial training courses, the rate of continuous  training, and the organization of work time (free time,  probationary periods), the best methods to be adopted by  institutions which represent staff, and so forth.    This is not an exhaustive list but it is enough to show that  the five-year law revives social dialogue and thus gives full  meaning and every opportunity to a new organization of relations  between employers and employees.    Moreover, the employment law requires us to build ever  broader partnerships with the regional councils, associations,  and other regional operators, thus prompting a healthy  decompartmentalization in the social sphere. Is it not a very  practical and very operational task to mobilize everybody in the  fight for employment?    [Lecluse] What are the grounds for the government's hope to  stabilize employment by mid-1994 in view of the fact that the  recovery will be much lower than the necessary level for halting  the slide?    [Giraud] All the macroeconomic forecasting bodies agree in  predicting the beginning of a reversal in the situation during  1994, with the differences only relating to the starting point  and the scale. However, it is obvious that the recovery would  be too modest to generate, on its own, a number of jobs likely  to significantly reduce unemployment.    However, the government is justified in hoping for the full  effect of the emergency measures (law of 27 July 1993), the  five-year law (better organization of work, training, youth  employment...), and the 1994 budget. Thus, during the second  half of 1994, we should experience an encouraging deceleration  in the unemployment curve.    [Lecluse] With hindsight, if you were to draft the  five-year law today, would you proceed in the same way? Do you  have regrets?    [Giraud] The process of design, drafting, consultation, and  then consideration of the five-year law took place over eight  months... In all honesty, I do not think that I could now take  a more open approach... On the other hand, with regard to some  expectations -- I am thinking in particular of the "32-hour"  working week -- I might envisage a more vigorous response so  that the attention of our fellow citizens is not distracted from  the essential issue of the law's content. Moreover, it is in  this spirit that I have started a wide-ranging effort to provide  information on all the new measures proposed in this law.    [Lecluse] The government plans to pursue the reform of  social security funding. Do you advocate a more rapid  implementation of the timetable to include family contributions  in the budget or a new reduction in the sickness benefit  contribution?    [Giraud] The pursuit of the reform of social security  funding and its implementation provisions require a concerted  and united choice by the government. I would like to confirm  two personal convictions:    -- The relationship between the reduction in contributions  and the preservation or creation of jobs is undoubtedly strong.    -- The effort to reduce social security contributions must  be  based on the minimum wage if we are to secure the maximum effect  with regard to employment. I am therefore strongly in favor of  speeding up the reduction in the cost of labor for the benefit  of the lowest wages, and, moreover, this is a way of protecting  the jobs concerned.    [Lecluse] Are you not afraid of creating daunting threshold  effects by concentrating the reductions on wages in the region  of the minimum wage at the very time when enterprises are very  strongly limiting their wage increases?    [Giraud] This is a false debate in that there is no  threshold proper. Indeed, every year until 1998, the level of  the wage exempted increases by 10 percent in accordance with the  process started last July. In addition, through the opportunity  given to new enterprises to benefit from the 1998 conditions as  from 1994, considerable room to maneuver is being opened up. In  other words, the reductions do not fix the most modest wages at  their present level. I am even convinced that they could  encourage a gradual increase in them.    [Lecluse] Are corporate social plans being presented to you  today better constructed than a few months ago?    [Giraud] Since the beginning of last fall, we have observed  a clear improvement in the quality of social plans. The  mobilization of the public employment services, greater  awareness on the part of enterprise chiefs, and the early  implementation of the provisions of the five-year law make it  possible to further encourage alternative solutions to  redundancies. Out of 2,000 procedures concerning enterprises  with more than 20 employees, only 80 observations of  shortcomings have been reported. This is a good development  especially because the number of social plans is still worrying.    In reality, we are gradually moving toward company plans  composed of three largely equal parts: one-third internal  measures (partial unemployment, gradual early retirement,  shorter working hours compensated over a long period,  reorganization of the enterprise); one-third external  conversions with reorganizing divisions, leave, and conversion  conventions; and one-third age measures (Social Security --  National Employment Fund).    [Lecluse] Enterprises are now stepping up initiatives of  all kinds to help employment and the unemployed. What do you  think of social marketing?    [Giraud] I do not like the term "social marketing." It  suggests that the enterprises are using employment as an  argument for "comparative social publicity" whereas many of  them, by becoming aware of the social and economic implications  of unemployment, have decided to become involved themselves and  in their way in the struggle for employment. This display of  solidarity is constructive and beneficial and must be welcomed.  For instance, it is reflected in the circular of 29 December  1993 which institutes the clause of "best social policy." This  gives priority to job creation as a selection criterion in the  awarding of public procurement contracts.    [Lecluse] Will the very strong reservations, not to say  hostility, of the social partners to the plan for a single  alternative training option prompt you to postpone your bill,  initially planned for spring?    [Giraud] You will have noted that Article 64 of the  five-year law calls on the government to present Parliament with  proposals aimed at "extending and harmonizing the use of  different training measures in work contracts to help the  young." This means that the debate is open. To clarify it, at  my request, the Tax Inspectorate and the Health and Company  Affairs Inspectorate have launched a mission whose conclusions I  will have at the end of February. On that basis, I will decide  my position and propose the guidelines which strike me as most  beneficial for the training and employment of young people.  However, it is very clear that I will strive to respect and  ensure respect for the deadlines set by the legislator. If the  bill could not be included in the spring session, I will ensure  that it is included in the fall session.    [Lecluse] What progress has been made on the decree relating  to compulsory rest periods which particularly affect banks  wishing to open on Saturdays?    [Giraud] I am anxious to propose to the social partners in  the next few weeks a perfectly balanced document relating to the  long postponed implementation of the ruling of 16 January 1982.  This document should safeguard the employees' most important  gains while improving flexibility in the organization of the  working week in the spirit of the five-year law. In this  sphere, there cannot be any winners or losers, but, I hope, a  better service to the public and additional jobs, especially  part-time jobs.    [Lecluse] You are drafting a bill on participation. In  addition to the financial aspect, how do you plan to encourage  the participation of employees in the enterprise?    [Giraud] With the bill on participation and profit-sharing  which I will present in the spring session, staff  share-ownership will be given real recognition with greater  involvement of staff representatives in supervision and  management councils. The distribution of profit-sharing funds  will now be such that it cannot benefit a particular category of  employees as is still the case with the 1990 legislation.    With regard to participation, the conditions for drawing up  group agreements will be made more flexible to encourage  procedures which enable all the employees of different companies  to benefit from the group's health. The first draft of the law  also makes provision for the creation of a time-saving account  and the adaptation of profit-sharing to this provision. For  instance, it will be possible to allocate profit-sharing in the  form of time following agreement from the social partners. In  order to have an effect on employment, the leave resulting from  this capitalization would be a minimum of six months.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Employers welcome the new approach: Dearing report recommends slimmed-down curriculum with testing restricted to English, maths and science SIR Ron Dearing yesterday opened the way for a shift in England and Wales to a Continental style of education concentrating on vocational education from the age of 14, which was generally welcomed by employers. In a surprising addition to his report, Sir Ron announced that he will consult until the end of the year on 'the merits of a modified approach to the curriculum from 14 to 16 which retains a mandatory core but which provides a smoother transition to study post-16, through a wide range of options'. He said: 'In the rest of Europe, 16 is not a particularly significant stage in schooling, and, post-14, many of our neighbours place particular value on technical and vocational education.' In France, Germany and the Netherlands 25 per cent of students post-14 go to schools specialising in vocational education. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said earlier this year the national curriculum in England and Wales had left less academic children 'disadvantaged and demotivated'. Continental employers believed pupils who had spent their time from 14 to 16 working on a narrow academic curriculum plus specialised courses in systematic disciplines such as woodwork and metalwork were more motivated, according to the institute. Sir Ron's move was welcomed by employers, although some were alarmed by the decision not to make testing of technology compulsory. Mr Ian Toombs, of West London CBI and the Japanese company NEC, said he regarded the national curriculum as a useful development but there were more deep-rooted problems in British education than simply the content of the curriculum. A change of culture was needed to integrate education, training and the workplace, and the government ought to offer fiscal incentives for employers to involve themselves in education. Mr Brian Lindop, manager of educational affairs at Vauxhall Motors, said the place of technology in the national curriculum had to be defended. 'If we are to compete in the international marketplace we need to improve the skills of all of our young people in the technology area,' he said.</p>

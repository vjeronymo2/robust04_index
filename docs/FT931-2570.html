			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Extra help with fuel bills as Major bows to backbenchers THE THREAT of a backbench revolt yesterday forced Mr John Major, the prime minister, into promising extra help for 10m people on low incomes who will be hit next year by the Budget imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power. The move marked a climbdown from earlier indications by Treasury and social security ministers that compensation would be limited to uprating income-related benefits in line with retail prices, including fuel costs. The announcement eased alarm among Conservative MPs but the government difficulties could be further deepened by separate official calculations showing that hidden costs of government energy saving schemes could add nearly 4 per cent a year to domestic fuel and electricity bills, in addition to VAT. Last night, there were no figures on how much the package announced by Mr Major will cost - underlining the haste behind the move. Estimates circulating among Tory MPs suggested the sum could be as high as Pounds 1bn, which would have to be found from the public spending total already set for 1994-95. The government was careful not to promise full compensation for the VAT extension. It indicated that falling gas prices and the extra boost given to benefit claimants this year would be taken into account. VAT on domestic fuel will start at 8 per cent in April 1994. Details of relief may not be decided until November - unless, as seemed likely last night, pressure from Conservative MPs forces further concessions. Some Tories are still pushing for an increase in the basic state pension. The finance bill will be published immediately after the Easter recess. Amid complaints that the government's position had been 'misinterpreted', the cabinet agreed for Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to give interviews to clarify the position. On Wednesday, Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, appeared to rule out special help above price indexation saying 'all such issues are made up of swings and roundabouts'. Yesterday's decision will help 5m people on income support and a further 3m on housing benefit, council tax benefit or family credit. Cold weather payments will also be adjusted. In the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, accused Mr Major of 'betraying' election promises by extending VAT. Mr Major did not challenge Mr Smith's calculation that the 'typical' family will have to pay Pounds 8.50 a week in extra taxes from next April and Pounds 12.50 a week extra in the following year. But he said: 'I said last year that we had no plans to raise taxes and nor did we. But we have an overriding commitment to return the deficit to balance and to take the action necessary to do that.'

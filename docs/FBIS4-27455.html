			<p>BFN     [Text] It was reported that on 25 May, 240 soldiers of the  puppet units in Takeo Province who were sent by the two-headed  government to fight on the Route 10 battlefield deserted the  action.    The report said that these soldiers who were sent from Takeo  Province to Route 10 by their puppet commanders did not want to  fight and kill fellow Cambodians. They want peace and national  reconciliation so that they can return to their parents, wives,  and children.    The report added that these puppet soldiers from Takeo  Province have seen with their own eyes how hundreds of the  two-headed government's soldiers from both the Vietnamese and  U.S. puppet groups were killed and wounded every day. Some  stepped on land mines or were attacked by the National Army of  Democratic Kampuchea, while others were shot dead by the  communist Vietnamese and U.S. puppet commanders who were angry  that the two categories of puppet soldiers kept refusing to  fight. Some of them died of malaria and a shortage of food and  medicine. Under such conditions, the two categories of puppet  soldiers mobilized from all areas have continued to desert the  battlefield in groups of 10, 20, and even hundreds. The fleeing  puppet soldiers do not hesitate to shoot at anyone who tries to  stop them.</p>

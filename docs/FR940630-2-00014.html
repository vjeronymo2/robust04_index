The 32-acre site is closed and maintained in a caretaker condition. The Army considers PSA unencumbered, meaning no conditions or restrictions have been placed on the PSA property for transfer. A Statement of Condition was issued by the Department of the Army on August 11, 1993, which stated that the site has been fully restored and is available for reuse. The screening process has been completed for PSA with the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, the McKinney Act, and state and local agencies. The City of Pontiac was the only organization showing interest in the PSA property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of PSA's disposal, the Army has worked with Federal, state and local entities in order to identify three reasonable reuse options for the reuse of PSA. These alternatives were evaluated against PSA's existing baseline condition in order to determine an environmentally sound and socioeconomically beneficial use for the property. The baseline was described as the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the site in caretaker status. The three alternatives considered included: (1) Light Industrial and Commercial; (2) Light Industrial and Warehouse; and (3) the No-Action Alternative, as required by National Environmental Policy Act and AR 200&hyph;2. Alternative 1, Light Industrial and Commercial, is the local community's preferred reuse of the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 1 was chosen over Alternatives 2 and 3 because it provides the greatest economic benefits for the state and local community, while having no significant impact on the natural or human environment. While Alternative 2, Light Industrial and Warehouse, has even less impact on the human and natural environment than Alternative 1, it does not provide the most beneficial economic gain. Alternative 3, the No-Action Alternative, would provide no economic benefits to the area and no benefit to the Federal government. The property would remain under the care of the Army and may experience some deterioration of buildings and overgrowth of grounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Placing the property into the local economy would create revenues for the state and local tax base. In addition, implementation of Alternative 1 would have a positive effect on the regional economy by creating as many as 250 new jobs and increasing local sales volumes. It would not have a significant impact on the population or housing market, public services, and infrastructure. Land use would be compatible with the current zoning of the site. Local traffic flow may be altered in the immediate vicinity of the facility when compared with baseline conditions, but would require only minor mitigative measures to lessen impacts to traffic and transportation. Additional traffic signals and entrances to the site would alleviate impacts to local traffic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental resources affects associated with the disposal would be insignificant. The topography or geology of the site would not be affected under the proposed activities. Additional parking requirements may cause minor disturbances to soils and loss of vegetative cover, but the impacts would be minor. Water resources would not be affected under the disposal. It is anticipated that the ambient air quality would not be significantly impacted nor the National Air Quality Standards levels would be exceeded. No hazardous materials nor waste generation is expected. However, if they are included in the reuse, the appropriate regulatory requirements would be met. Plant and animal resources effects are expected to be insignificant. No wetlands, threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources exist within the boundaries of PSA. Noise levels are not anticipated to be above background levels and the aesthetic value of the site is expected to remain the same. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the environmental and socioeconomic impact analysis in the Environmental Assessment for the Disposal and Reuse of Pontiac Storage Activity, which is incorporated into this Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), it has been determined that the disposal of real property and its subsequent reuse would not have a significant impact on the quality of the natural or human environment. Because there would be no significant environmental or socioeconomic impacts resulting from implementation of the proposed action, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required and will not be prepared. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Persons wishing to comment may obtain a copy of the EA or inquire into this FNSI by writing to the U.S. Army Materiel Command, Attn: AMSCO (Robert Jameson), 5001 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22333&hyph;0001 or by calling (703) 274&hyph;9166 within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ADDRESS> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lewis D.

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Fischler strongly criticises EC proposals on agriculture Mr Franz Fischler, Austrian agriculture minister, has strongly criticised the latest European Commission proposals on agriculture which would force Austria to reduce sharply its sugar and grain production under European Union quotas, writes Patrick Blum from Vienna. Speaking on Austrian television on his return from Brussels on Thursday evening, Mr Fischler said the Commission's proposals contained 'very negative elements'. His comments come less than a month before the March 1 deadline for completing Austria's and the three Nordic countries' negotiations on EU membership.</p>

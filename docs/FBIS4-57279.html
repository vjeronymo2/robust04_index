			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN member Julio Lopez Campos by Walter </F> Lacayo Guerra; place and date not given; first paragraph is EL  SEMANARIO introduction]    [Text] Though Julio Lopez Campos says he does not belong to  an internal Sandinist Front faction, it is inevitable that many  of his party comrades identify him as one of the "ideologues of  the orthodox faction or Pikin group," as the Sandinist  Democratic Left Discussion Forum is called. In July 1993 his  signature appeared on that famous "Document of the 29," which  called upon the Sandinist party leadership to take a clear  position opposing Violeta de Chamorro's government. Six months  later, in January 1994, he attended a meeting of about 50  members of the Pikin Guerrero Union School, which some members  of the National Directorate also attended. Here the Discussion  Forum or faction to which he belongs was formed. Julio Lopez  Campos has agreed to answer our questions.    [Lacayo Guerra] You are one of the promoters of a faction  called Sandinist Left. What does that mean? Is not  the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] itself a party of  the left, entirely composed of people on the left?    [Lopez Campos] First of all, we are not a Sandinist Front  faction. If you check the public statements of the Democratic  Left Discussion Forum, we have never claimed to be a faction. As  the name clearly indicates, we are a discussion forum, that is,  a large group of Sandinist comrades who are promoting democratic  debate within the FSLN structures.    [Lacayo Guerra] What do you mean by faction?    [Lopez Campos] Faction? The only faction here is the one led  by our comrades Sergio Ramirez and Luis Carrion, with an  alternative proposal for the FSLN, developed with the clear  intention of offering an alternative and renovating proposal for  Sandinism. That is a faction. The Democratic Left Discussion  Forum is not a faction; it only promotes debate among comrades.  On the other part of your question, we believe Sandinism is  revolutionary; historically, the FSLN has been the vanguard in  this country, it has been the greatest expression of the  Nicaraguan left. But that fact should not automatically lead to  the conclusion that all Sandinists are necessarily on the left,  and that we all hold revolutionary positions. Within Sandinism  there have appeared some comrades who claim to be centrists.  That is part of the present situation in the FSLN.    [Lacayo Guerra] The Sandinist Front is an electoral party  and  the 1996 elections are--as the saying goes--just around the  corner. In your opinion, what should the FSLN do to win back the  majority it has lost?    [Lopez Campos] The FSLN must evaluate its history and the  1990 election results objectively and fairly, so it can have its  feet firmly planted on the ground to handle the work it must do.  That, I believe, is where some of our problems stem, for the  record of what the Sandinist Front has done is not being  considered carefully and equitably in terms of the 1990 election  defeat. There are some very prejudiced views; people want to  continue seeing us as an exclusive Sandinist Front. During the  war the FSLN did have to take specific steps to promote extreme  cohesiveness on the part of its forces, which generated the  image of an exclusive internal party, but if we look at the  party structures now, we will find that in the party's  operational areas there are absolutely no exclusive or  authoritarian attitudes. Just the opposite is true. I believe it  is important to portray the FSLN accurately, and that is the  first step in being able to position ourselves correctly to do  our jobs. In this context, access to the government is not going  to come about through arms, but elections.    [Lacayo Guerra] The party program is one basic element for a  party to win elections, but so is its presidential candidate.  How do you think the FSLN should select its candidate?    [Lopez Campos] I am absolutely convinced that the FSLN has  to  return to office by electoral means, and so it must reaffirm its  historic mission. In a country in which 80 percent of the  population has an income of less than $200 a month, obviously  the most suitable program for Sandinism must be based on the  needs and interests of these large masses of campesinos, young  people, women, the unemployed, and the workers. A party that  wants to obtain the support of the masses must necessarily have  a popular mission; if it does not, it cannot claim to lead the  struggles and represent the interests of the masses. I do not  see how it could bring to the next elections the forces needed  to get the results we have to obtain. Sandinism arose with the  aim of creating profound transformations in Nicaraguan society.  In this phase it was through the vote, but Sandinism has not  restricted, nor can it restrict its political work within formal  institutional confines. These struggles cannot be limited solely  to the four established branches of government, even though  there may be some comrades who believe that is possible. What  can be done about the arbitrary evictions ordered by the courts?  The FSLN has to organize to defend the interests of all those  families. We have no other alternative, even though that may  mean clashing with the forces of law. What can be done in the  rural areas of Matagalpa and Jinotega where the lives of our  Sandinist comrades have been threatened? I am one of the  militants who say that in that area the FSLN must take the lead  to protect the lives of our Sandinist comrades who have been  threatened. This places us at odds with the strictly legal  order, but that is not important to me. What matters most to me  is the lives of the Sandinists in that area.    [Lacayo Guerra] Let us get back to the question. What  mechanism should be used to select the FSLN's presidential  candidate?    [Lopez Campos] In the Discussion Forum, we act in the  context  of what was decided by the Sandinist Front. That is why I insist  that we are not a faction. In the FSLN, selecting the candidate  for 1996 is not on the agenda. That is not the reason for  convening the Extraordinary Congress. This congress is being  convened to discuss the program and the statutes. Absolutely  nothing is planned about candidacies. We believe it is too early  to introduce the issue of candidacies when we have still not  resolved the problem of our new identity. In my opinion, Sergio  (Ramirez) made an extremely grave political mistake when at the  end of last year he and his comrades decided to give an  electoral emphasis to what they had been doing, by introducing  the dynamics of the presidential candidacy. In fact, that  faction was working inside the FSLN and to some extent, the  Discussion Forum arose as a reaction to that faction that had  been active without publicly acknowledging its existence. They  could have continued to promote the policy they wanted. All that  was healthy and positive. That is no crime, there is no problem  with that. But when they decided to combine their political work  and start to identify an election slate, including possible  deputies--because they had talked of candidacies, and some were  talking about "possible positions" in the future  government--then we said: those comrades are making a very  serious mistake. In saying this, I am not censuring the  legitimate right that any comrade has, and some have more than  others. In my opinion, Sergio has every right to aspire to be a  candidate for president of the Republic, but I do feel it was a  political mistake to have started to work with a view toward  candidacies for 1996, when what is on Sandinism's agenda now is  solving its internal problems and developing its program, its  statutes, and its new identity. So my answer is that it is too  soon to talk about candidacies.    [Lacayo Guerra] Sincerely, you have never thought about who  might be the right candidate for the Sandinist Front?    [Lopez Campos] Yes, I have thought about that...one  difference between an electoral and a revolutionary party is  that revolutionaries organize to fight in an ongoing manner.  Their ultimate objective is the election, and in the meantime,  they face struggles every day. Only a combative front that goes  to the neighborhoods, to the streets, to the fields, and to the  mountains can help us to win back the masses of the people.  Later, we will work out the election issue more easily. I think  a slate that weakens the front, that splits it, would not be  viable. I would not even reject a candidate who might not be in  our party; we might form an alliance for the elections. The  candidate could also be someone from the front who is not a part  of its leadership structures, someone like Mariano Fiallos, who  is not a leader of Sandinism, but who has great prestige and  authority. There is a full array of possibilities. It is typical  of electoral political processes that when you want to get rid  of someone, you toss his hat into the ring early, and he will be  sure to burn out. In my opinion, that is another mistake Sergio  made. He began his own process of self-destruction. His latest  positions are creating friction and a lack of consensus in the  Sandinist Front, and that affects him as a leader.    [Lacayo Guerra] Moving on to the Atlantic Coast election  results. Could you comment on that?    [Lopez Campos] In all honesty, I am waiting to hear the  evaluation made by our Atlantic Coast comrades. Sometimes we in  the Pacific area are very arrogant, and the truth is that the  Atlantic Coast is a very special situation. There they have what  does not exist in the Pacific, and the decisive factor is the  ethnic problem. The truth of the matter is that we Sandinists in  general do not know that situation very well. So the first thing  we have to see is how the people from the coast view the  situation, and see how we feel about their evaluation. And,  since I am speaking to EL SEMANARIO, I want to say that Sergio  made an overhasty evaluation of the Atlantic Coast results  without first knowing the official views of the comrades. I am  sure support for the Atlantic Coast elections has not become a  priority issue in either the leadership of the front or the  Sandinist Assembly. I would rather wait for their evaluation  before expressing an opinion.    [Lacayo Guerra] In general, what is your opinion of the  debate among Sandinists, and the strong dissent that offends  some party members?    [Lopez Campos] Well...we have to be open to an intense  debate, and the debate among Sandinists about the nature of the  matters we have to discuss must be a firm, impassioned debate  with strong convictions, but that should in no way lead us to  exclusive attitudes and terms that destroy the fraternity that  should exist among Sandinists. I believe it would be a mistake  not to admit that there have been faults on all sides. Similar  or worse damage is done to the debate not only by one who speaks  in extremely frank language, which may be rude, and by one who  wields his words as skillfully as a surgeon's scalpel, making  cuts and deep wounds without those wounds being perceptible to  everyone. There has been some of that in this debate. There are  some comrades who have the ability and skill to open wounds  without them being apparent to everyone, and there are some who  resort to rough language.    [Lacayo Guerra] What do you think the FSLN's relations with  the U.S. Government should be?    [Lopez Campos] The U.S. ambassador stated in EL SEMANARIO  that history cannot be repeated. People who forget their own  history are people who do not deserve respect. The United States  will respect us if it sees that we are consistent with ourselves  and our history, and with our healthy intention of having  friendly relations with it. We did not attack the United States.  It was the United States who has attacked us throughout our  modern history, and we cannot forget that. Nor can that be the  starting point for maintaining a position of friction and  hostility. I do not know any Sandinist who thinks that he can  conduct Sandinist politics by seeking confrontations with the  United States. I do not know a single one. Some points that  Sergio has been making have greatly displeased me. In his  statements to EL PAIS, in his zeal for strengthening his  proposals for renewal, to which he is fully entitled, he has  been distorting his diagnosis of reality and dwelling on an  apocalyptic image of the nation's future, saying that the  tragedy will be to be torn between radical Sandinism, on one  side, and Arnoldo Aleman's extremism on the other. In that  situation, says Sergio, the prospect is chaos, and so we need to  converge toward the center of the Nicaraguan political spectrum.  Honestly, I say I do not see where Sergio gets that extremist  and radical Sandinism. It seems to me that he is trying to  strengthen his own position by using that image or invoking that  "horrific danger."</p>

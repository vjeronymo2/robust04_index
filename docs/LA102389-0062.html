			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PERLMAN OPENS CELEBRITY SERIES AT MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> There must be some sort of physical law that makes artists who perform often  and worldwide fall into a programming rut. That seems to be the case with  Itzhak Perlman, who on Saturday evening opened the Los Angeles Philharmonic's  Celebrity Series at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> Make no mistake: The violinist played with a level of precision and refinement  few can equal. He exhibited nearly faultless bow control and technical  accuracy. His tone was as pure and silken as it has ever been. And he exuded an  easygoing amiability that makes his recitals truly pleasurable.  </P> <P> But pleasurable does not mean satisfying. The listener left the hall  half-sated, for only about half the program proved truly substantial.  </P> <P> In Bach's Partita No. 3, the evening's most memorable installment, Perlman  delineated phrases with poetic eloquence and infused his playing with  invigorating rhythm, all the while maintaining an unflagging, fluid line.  </P> <P> Demonstrating great expressivity and arching lyricism, the violinist and  pianist Janet Goodman Guggenheim teamed up to offer a sweeping account of  Faure's First Sonata, a compelling early work.  </P> <P> Beethoven's E-flat Sonata, however, which opened the program, is not from the  composer's top drawer. Both musicians nonetheless brought clear definition,  stylish elegance and fine ensemble to their performance, though the violinist  asserted a bit too much during the Finale.  </P> <P> As is his wont, Perlman devoted the last quarter of his recital to trifles,  announced from the stage, by Ponce, Pergolesi, Moszkowski, Gershwin and  Sarasate, only the last an actual encore.

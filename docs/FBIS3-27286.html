Song, who is also minister in charge of the State Science  and  Technology Commission, made these remarks during an eight-day  tour of Jiangsu Province, East China, which concluded today.    Accompanied by Yang Xiaotang, vice-governor of Jiangsu  Province, Song Jian inspected the high-tech development zones at  Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou, and some high-tech enterprises in  Kunshan, Changshu, Zhangjiagang, Jiangyin, Wuxi and Yixing,  which are all located in the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou high-tech  industrial belt.    Song said that a high-tech development zone should be  different from an economic development zone. It should pay more  attention to apply domestic research results and encourage and  attract domestic large and medium-sized enterprises, research  institutes and higher education colleges to establish  enterprises in it to develop high- tech and new products for  export.    Song noted that at present, China's high-tech industry is  still in the embryonic stage and high-tech development zones  should provide the embryonic industry with a base for  development.    Efforts should be made to foster some big enterprise groups  whose annual production output value would reach one billion to  10 billion yuan each so that they can compete in the  international market.    He said that it was necessary to attract some people with  master's degree or a doctorate and some people who have studied  abroad to work in the leading bodies and administrative bodies  of high-tech development zones.    Remuneration should be divided into different levels, so as  to improve the rewards for intellectuals, experts and  management. Those enterprises with high productivity can raise  the rewards for their workers and staff members before the  others.</p>

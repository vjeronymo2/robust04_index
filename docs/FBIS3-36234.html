In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS, Grachev described  as one of the main results of the visit the signing of a  protocol of intent to set up Russian military bases in Georgia.  Under the protocol, Russia will establish three military bases  in this Caucasian republic -- in Vazeani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi  -- by July 1, 1994. They will be staffed mostly with land and  Air Force troops.    Aleksandr Galkin, head of the Russian delegation to the  talks  with Georgia, said that Georgia wants Russian troops to stay in  the republic after 1995 when an agreement on their presence in  Georgia expires.    Galkin said that Russian military presence in Georgia is  indispensable for ensuring stabilisation of the situation,  protecting the rights of the Russian-speaking population and  providing assistance to Georgia to establish its own armed  forces.    The agreement on Russian military bases in Georgia has been  signed for ten years. After that it can be prolonged by mutual  consent. The number of troops and weapons at the bases will be  specified by a special working group later. However, Grachev  believes that Russia should keep up to 23,000 troops in the  Transcaucasia, including two thirds of them in Georgia.    The sides also agreed that Russia will train military  specialists for Georgia. According to Galkin, georgia will need  at least five years to establish its own armed forces.</p>

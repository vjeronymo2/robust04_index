			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Sing it again . . . THE essential folk re-issue of the year is Hanibal's three CD set devoted to the career of Richard Thompson, Watching the Dark (HNCD 5303). A wonderful mix of the rare and the well known from the 1960s and his days with Fairport Convention to the 1990s and his solo recordings The Dark confirms Thompson's stature as an enthralling guitarist and singer and writer of bitter love songs in which pain is forever uppermost. He is, with Elvis Costello, Britain's greatest describer of despair. Also superb is the first eponymous album of Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle (Hannibal HNCD 4401). On it they cleverly unite the folk and singer-songwriter traditions by yoking together the concerns of singer-songwriterdom - personal confession, intimacy - with the instruments of folk, rather than rock. The result, which includes their own version of the hit they wrote for Linda Ronstadt, 'Heart Like A Wheel' and the oft-recorded 'Talk To Me Of Mendocino', is one of the best unknown albums of the 1970s. For historians the set of the year was British Pop Before the Beatles (EMI 789220-226). There was pop music in Britain before the 1960s but it was a very strange phenomenon. The values of light entertainment held sway and, for the most part, Rock'N'Roll spoke with a decidedly polite growl. Collectively the seven CD set tells the story of how an American music was tentatively transplanted to the UK and, against all expectations took root. This sense of everything happening at one remove, of intense experiences being filtered through the due decorum of being British, is the prevailing mood of the early volumes. Even when teenagers take over from the first British middle-aged celebrants of Rock'N'Roll, they are just as repressed. Real delight does not figure until volume 3 and 1958 with Cliff Richard's 'Move It'. Similarly pain, the other central teenage emotion, does not occur until volume 4 and Billy's Fury's brooding, haunted 'Maybe Tomorrow'. In their place, good taste and condescension to things American reign. But that certainly does not mean that the recordings are boring. If one is interested in the complex process that attended the rise of pop (teenage oriented) music at the expense of popular music this set is essential listening. For example, listening to the CDs two small but significant observations comes to mind: the long time it took for UK session guitarists to lose their dance band habits and play the guitar with attack rather than restraint (compare the Bert Weedon's 'clever' version of 'Apache' here with the Shadows' recording). Equally notable is the complete absence of the manic excitement of so much American Rock'N'Roll. The outrage of something like 'Riot in Cell Block No 9' is smothered by embarrassment in the British cover version. The set also explains why the Beatles and their fellow beat groups took root so quickly: their forebears had prepared the ground before them but not sown the seed. On the soul front the great re-issue is the two CD set, The Best Of Solomon Burke (Rhino/Atlantic 8122-70284-2) which collects together the best of Burke's ever so church derived messages. Not for nothing did Burke dub himself the king of rock and soul. His impassioned soul pleadings - 'The Price', 'Just Out Of Reach', 'Everybody Needs somebody to Love', etc. - justifies that title.</p>

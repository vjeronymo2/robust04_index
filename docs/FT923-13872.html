			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pay body is rebuffed on MPs' cash THE GOVERNMENT proposes to grant MPs the cost of an extra quarter-of-a-member of staff and a Pounds 4,000-a-year rise to take account of general office expenses, even though more radical changes were proposed by the Top Salaries Review Body. The increase will take the maximum an MP can claim from Pounds 28,986 to Pounds 33,190 for the present financial year, including the equivalent of the annual uprating according to the existing formula. The allowance will now reflect an assumption that an MP employs 1 3/4 staff rather than 1 1/2 , which is the basis for the present arrangements. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said yesterday that the increase 'represents a fair balance between taxpayers' interests and the needs of MPs for sufficient support to enable them to carry out adequately their duties to their constituents'. The review body recommended: That the allowance should be put on the basis of two staff per MP, and that salaries should be kept separate from other costs. That there should be central arrangements for procuring equipment such as computers and fax machines and, in the meantime, a one-off acquisition grant of Pounds 5,000, instead of a continuation of each MP making his or her own arrangements. That MPs who based their offices in their constituencies - and thus did not benefit so much from the free lighting heating and telephone lines at Westminster - should receive an extra Pounds 2,000. That a Westminster personnel office should be created to advise MPs and staff on pay and conditions of service. Those would have taken the maximum allowance that could have been claimed to between Pounds 37,360 and Pounds 42,360. The government rejected the idea of compartmentalising the allowance, in spite of the arguments about greater accountability and better conditions for staff, in the interests of flexibility for MPs to choose how to use their allowance. The idea of a personnel office was turned down because of the 'concern of many MPs about possible external intervention in the relationships between themselves and their staff'. In spite of its reservations, however, the government is content for the Commons information committee to consider the TSRB's points about provision of office equipment. Government business managers are conscious that there may be a backbench rebellion when MPs debate the increase on Tuesday night - the day after they will have discussed changes to rationalise the working week at Westminster. On both the last two occasions, MPs have had the chance to influence the annual increase in the allowance, in 1986 and again in 1987, they voted for an amount larger than ministers had in mind. Even in a recession and in the midst of tough public spending negotiations, it is easier for MPs to argue for an increase in their office costs allowance than for an increase in their own salaries, since the money can be seen directly in their service to constituents. A clash between the government and the review body was in prospect even from the terms of reference. Ministers did not see the need for a fundamental review, while the body itself said a thorough inquiry was needed because of the changing pressures on MPs.  -----------------------------------------------               BASIC ANNUAL PAY            (excluding allowances)  ----------------------------------------------- British MP                     pounds30,854 German MP                      pounds42,310                                 (DM121,536) French Deputy                  pounds47,110                                (FFr455,556) US Congressman                 pounds67,465                            (dollars129,500)  -----------------------------------------------</p>

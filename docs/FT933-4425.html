			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Costs dispute with Prague sours Skoda deal  -Profitability drive by Volkswagen could damage prospects in Czech Republic THE Czech government and Volkswagen, the German carmaker, are locked in dispute over prices and suppliers which threatens to sour their relationship and damage VW's prospects in the Czech Republic. The dispute erupted when Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer in which VW has a 31 per cent stake, announced in August it was increasing its car prices by an average of 8 per cent, and hinted it would seek some supplies from western Europe because of rising costs in the Czech Republic. VW plans to raise its stake in Skoda to 70 per cent by 1996 and invest up to DM9bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in the venture over 10 years. Only yesterday Lucas, the UK motor components group, said it had won an 'historic' contract to supply Skoda with components via a Czech-based joint venture. Lucas Autobrzdy, set up in March and in which Lucas has a minority interest, is to supply Skoda's Czech plant with rear axle assemblies in a deal worth Pounds 15m a year. The Skoda announcement on price rises in August stems from the Volkswagen group's drive to improve profitability and cut production costs worldwide. Suggestions early this summer that Skoda, which is expected to help develop a large network of suppliers in the Czech Republic, was considering switching some of its supplies from Czech to German and UK producers, angered the government. 'If Volkswagen is changing its view, then we can also change our view,' said a government official privately. The increase in the price of the Skodas was the latest in a series that has brought the price of a basic model to about CzK170,000 (Pounds 3,860). That is almost twice the cost of a similar Skoda model three years ago, an increase well above price rises generally. The move surprised the government which wants to curb an inflation rate expected to be about 17 per cent this year. Mr Stanislav Belehradek, minister for economic competition, responded by threatening to reduce the tariff on imported cars from 15 per cent for European Community-produced cars and from 19 per cent for other cars, to 10 per cent. The threat aimed at increasing competition from other manufacturers fell flat however when it became known that in 1991, the Czech government had promised VW it would maintain high tariffs on imported cars for four years, as an incentive for the German company's investment in Skoda. Prime minister Vaclav Klaus, who at the time was finance minister of the now defunct Czechoslovak federation, said he had rejected VW's request for tariff protection. He said the promise was made without his knowledge in a letter by Mr Petr Pithart, the then Czech prime minister. The suggestion is that as the letter was not formally approved by the cabinet it may not be binding. This provoked a furious debate within the government, with senior officials warning that going back on the promise would damage the country's reputation. The problem for the government is that it cannot back down without losing face. The price increases have provoked angry letters of complaint from customers. Autoklub, the Czech motoring association, accused Skoda of taking advantage of its effective monopoly on Czech low-priced cars. Skoda rejects the accusations saying its market share had fallen to around 35 per cent with the biggest market share going to second-hand imports. 'We have to raise prices because we have large costs to improve the cars, marketing, establishing a network of suppliers, and we are investing in the development of a new car. People have to understand they have to pay for our investment in new products,' Mr Milan Smutny, Skoda spokesman said. He also rejected suggestions VW had lost interest in local suppliers. 'We want to continue with the input of Czech and Slovak producers. Our policy is that the majority of our supplies should be made here, but we need low (supply) prices. We can't continue co-operation with suppliers who cannot adapt when we can get 30-40 per cent lower prices from Germany,' he said. The joint venture plant at Mlada Boleslav, 40 miles north of Prague, was established in 1991. It produces more than 200,000 cars annually, more than half of which were exported last year, and plans are to raise production to 450,000 cars. But tough restructuring measures launched this year by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, had created 'big pressure to cut cost and raise profits' throughout the group, said Mr Smutny.</p>

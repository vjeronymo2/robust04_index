			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Observer: Ruffled feathers More haste, less speed. The celebrations of the lift-off of Jacques Attali's BERD - the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - would clearly have benefited from better preparation, not to mention greater support from Her Majesty's Government. For a start, Britain's Overseas Development Administration may be part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but giving it such a big role in the event has upset some foreign visitors. The ODA knows a lot about the Third World, but precious little about eastern bloc countries. Moreover, whose idea was it to site the three-day inauguration on the wrong side of the river? It is in the International Maritime Organisation, south of the Thames, with no parking and no handy underground station. Surely HMG could have pulled strings and cleared somewhere more convenient, such as the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre by the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, the governor of the Bank of England upset the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales by suddenly dropping out as guest speaker at last night's annual dinner. Presumably something more important turned up, such as the chancellor of the Exchequer's dinner for BERD's board. As the governor is not the sort of person to snub an important and long-standing City invitation, it sounds as if the person in charge of planning the BERD ceremonies should be given the bird.</p>

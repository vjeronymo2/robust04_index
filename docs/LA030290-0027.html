			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> GOLDEN LEAGUE  </P> <P> Antelope Valley  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Van Cheri, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 11-12; tied for 3rd in league at 7-8  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: It's graduation time -- many of the Antelopes move up to the  varsity. Junior catcher Jack Cox (6-foot-2, 195 pounds) and junior outfielder  Matt Chaffin (6-0, 175) staged a season-long race for the junior varsity  batting crown last season. Chaffin came in at .412, Cox at .411. Cox also  played well behind the plate. "Jack had a good arm last year," Van Cheri said.  "People didn't try and run on him." Speaking of running, the Antelopes plan to  do a lot. Junior shortstop Chad Eberhardt, who batted better than .300 last  year on the JVs, is an "excellent base stealer," Van Cheri said. Junior second  baseman George Boykins, who will bat leadoff, also is fast. "If he gets on  base, it's almost a sure double," Van Cheri said. Third baseman Tony Abrams  (6-1, 200) and first baseman-designated hitter Jade Freeman (6-2, 265), both  seniors, and sophomore outfielder Fred Edwards (5-10, 170) all played varsity  football. "We have a heck of a football team," Van Cheri said. "We could line  up right now." Senior Kevin Branch, a member of the basketball team, serves as  pitcher, first baseman and dugout comedian. "He hasn't set anyone's foot on  fire yet," Van Cheri said. Mound duties fall upon senior right-handers B.J.  Petersen, another basketball player, and David Cook, who played outfield for  the varsity last season.  </P> <P> Junior right-hander Rick Nickols (6-3, 245) is a hard-throwing reliever whose  repertoire doesn't include a curve. "He's all fastballs," Van Cheri said.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Speed kills. And the Antelopes hope to hunt down opponents with some  blazing baserunning. "That's probably our best asset," Van Cheri said. Pitching  is suspect, but, to the Antelopes' advantage, the center-field fence at  Antelope Valley is 411 feet from home plate. It's 385 down the right-field  line, 365 down the left-field line.  </P> <P> Canyon  </P> <P> COACH: Rich Montanio, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 14-12; tied for 2nd in league at 10-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Pitching is where the Cowboys seem most improved. Last  season, Canyon posted a team earned-run average of 4.53 and surrendered 209  hits in 185 innings. This year's staff should be stronger. Senior right-handers  Scott Thomason (4-4, 3.87) and Eric Rodriguez (4-1, 4.02) both have improved,  Montanio said. Thomason, with an expanded repertoire, is the No. 1 starter.  Rodriguez, who also plays first base, is the top reliever. Senior right-hander  Don Moody (6-0, 170), who started as a sophomore, missed last season because of  shoulder surgery. Junior right-hander Erik Hilgus (6-4, 200) throws hard. "We  have more pitching but it's not enough to dominate the league," Montanio said.  Senior Ben Ealy (5-10, 175, .273) moves from right field to third base. Senior  designated-hitter Steve Mann (5-10, 185), who is recovering from a knee injury  suffered while playing football, will see action at first base. Senior Chuck  Hothan (5-8, 165), who did not play last year, is playing catcher for the first  time. "He's doing a good job of learning," Montanio said. Junior second baseman  Oscar Silva (5-8, 150) was the junior varsity's best pitcher last year. Senior  Lonnie Gonzalez (5-10, 160), a varsity reserve last year, is the team's best  shortstop in three years, Montanio said. Juniors Chris Stark (LF), Kevin Bialas  (CF) and senior Roy Bjorklund (RF), a returning varsity player, form a  completely new outfield.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: With thin pitching last season, Canyon was forced to rely on offense.  The Cowboys scored at least 10 runs in eight games, including four of their  last six. This season, "it's gonna be a whole different flavor for us  offensively," Montanio said. "Probably a line-drive offense and hopefully a  little bit quicker. I think we'll do better than we did last year."  </P> <P> Palmdale  </P> <P> COACH: Terry Vernor, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 12-11; 3rd in league at 7-8  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: None of the Falcons' four returning starters hit a home run  last year. "We're going to have to manufacture some runs," Vernor said. Senior  Jeff Mapson (5-10, 185), a three-year starter who moves from first base to  catcher, batted .258 in league play last year. Senior outfielder Mike Payne  (5-9, 200) batted .324 but knocked in only seven runs in league play.  Left-handed first baseman Travis Wilson (6-1, 205), one of four junior  infielders, has the most power. Junior left-hander Chris Tampoya (5-9, 160),  who was 2-3 with a 2.90 ERA last year, is the No. 1 starter. "For a little guy,  he throws reasonably hard," Vernor said. Senior right-hander Jim Carson (6-2,  200), who was 1-0 with a 5.50 ERA in part-time duty, "depends more on  location." Senior right-hander David Mosher (6-1, 200), who was 0-0 with a 2.33  ERA, rounds out the three-man rotation. Junior third baseman Scott Reusser  moves up from the freshman team. Second baseman Jeff Pica, who was used  primarily as a pinch-runner last season, and shortstop Jason Rose, up from the  freshman team, are both switch-hitters. Senior Kim Lawson, a versatile fielder,  missed last season because of a knee injury. "He's going to play somewhere,"  Vernor said. "He might play third base, he might play outfield, but he's going  to play." Senior outfielders Jim Ortega, David Mount and John Johnson, a  three-sport athlete, did not play last season. "We're in need of help in the  outfield," Vernor said.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Palmdale may be forced to nickle-and-dime its way into the playoffs.  "We're not going to overpower anyone," Vernor said. "But I think we have some  good hitters, one through seven, in our lineup. I would say our strength is our  speed and balance." The Falcons also have as much experience as any team in the  league with the exception of Quartz Hill.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill  </P> <P> COACH: Stan Lyons, 1st year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 7-14; tied for 5th in league at 4-11  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Rebels have 13 players returning, more than any team in  the league -- maybe the Valley area. The problem is that many are untested.  Seniors Rene Varela, a right-hander, will be the No. 1 starter. Senior  left-hander Tony Rizza and junior right-hander Ron Turner, both of whom played  sparingly last season, are battling for the second starting job. Also battling  for starting duties are senior first basemen Andy Putnam and Jimmy Weese. "One  will play first base, the other will DH," Lyons said. Senior shortstop Jason  Haner, who batted .370 in American Legion last summer, is the team's best  hitter. Senior third baseman Kendial Armstrong, the school's quarterback,  batted a team-high .328 last season. Seniors Roy Brown (center field), who  batted .300, and catcher Terry Thompson are returning starters. Junior  outfielder David Nelson, a transfer from Carson, is a probable starter in the  outfield and will be used as a reliever. Sophomore left-hander Mike Casuncad,  who joined the varsity late last season, is another candidate for relief duty.  Sophomore outfielder Chad Goodwin batted .400 for the frosh-soph team last  season.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Rebels' strengths are pitching and defense. "I would say there  should be great improvement," Lyons said. "And we're going to be a running  team, offensively." That might be advantageous in a league with few proven  catchers. And Lyons, a former assistant at Palmdale, should know the league  well enough to capitalize.  </P> <P> Saugus  </P> <P> COACH: Doug Worley, 15th year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 23-5; 1st in league at 13-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The big question in Saugus: How will Saugus fare without  Roger Salkeld (30-7, 404 strikeouts, 0.68 ERA in three years), now a member of  the Seattle Mariners' organization? "He's gone," Worley said simply. "You can't  look back and we don't." With no declarative successor, mound duty will be  divided among six young pitchers. Junior submariner Doug Maggiora (6-3, 175),  who logged less than six innings last year, is the most experienced and "the  one we'll probably count on," Worley said. Senior Shawn Holt, junior Chris  Pendleton, and sophomores Jaimie Riggio, David Weeg and Chris Hernandez, a  left-hander, all will throw. "They're young," Worley said, "but they're  talented." Senior catcher J. B. Johnson (6-1, 195, .393, four home runs, four  doubles) arguably is the league's best catcher and premier power hitter. Senior  shortstop Walter White, who did not bat last season, is the only other  returning starter. Senior third baseman Chad Hankinson (6-0, 175), who batted  .500 with six doubles, four home runs and 35 RBIs for Grace Community, is a  welcome transfer. Senior center fielder Pat Henry, an all-league wide receiver  on the football team, will anchor the outfield. Left-handed twins Jeff (left  field) and John Albert (designated-hitter) both swing the bat well. Sophomore  John Lopata is the likely first baseman.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Without Salkeld's sizzling fastball the Centurions, who reached the  3-A final last season, won't be as overpowering. But Worley is excited about  the team's young pitching staff. "If I was someone else, I wouldn't believe  we'd be any good," Worley said. "But we're excited and we think we'll be pretty  respectable." The Centurions always seem to have an abundance of pitching.  Hitting is a question mark.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Konorov on round table meeting conducted at </F> the Ministry and Technical Policy: "Will We Have Our Own  Newtons?"]    [Text] A round table meeting was held at the Ministry  of Science and Technical Policy.    The head of the Ministry, Boris Saltykov, who opened the  meeting, emphasized that preserving the best part of Russia's  scientific-technical potential in conditions of the economic  slump is the main goal of state policy in the sphere of science  and technology.    Boris Saltykov noted bitterly that because of the shortage  of  finances, all last year scientists had to think more about  preserving science than developing it.    But even under these difficult conditions a great deal was  accomplished. Forty-one state scientific-technical programs were  formulated and are being realized. Proposals for realizing 117  priority technologies and new types of output within the  framework of the state structural policy were prepared.  Thirty-three state scientific centers received financial  support, and that made it possible to preserve the leading  scientific schools in the high technology fields.    For the first time and as one of the first among the  republics of the former Union, Russia became a full-fledged  member in the European technological program "Eureka." An  intergovernmental agreement on scientific-technical cooperation  with the United States was concluded. Russia's international  scientific-technical cooperation made it possible to continue  many scientific research projects in the field of high-energy  physics, the human genome and bioengineering, and promising  information technologies.    However, the speaker noted, the situation in the  scientific-technical sphere is becoming increasingly strained.  Science continues to be financed month by month and on the  left-over principle. Thus, last year scientific organizations  received about 300 billion rubles less than needed.    The number of scientific personnel is also declining: both  because of the exodus of scientists to commercial structures and  owing to the "brain drain" abroad. The best are leaving. The  prestige of scientific labor has dropped, the proportion of  graduates of VUZes [higher educational institutions] which train  scientific cadres is declining, and scientific schools and  entire fields are collapsing.    The volume of enterprise contracts with scientific  organizations has sharply declined, construction of scientific  facilities has ceased, and unique structures are becoming  unusable. The disruption of contacts among organizations of the  former Union republics is causing enormous losses to science and  technology.    The lack of hard currency is retarding and reducing the  scope  of international cooperation.</p>

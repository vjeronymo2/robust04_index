			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: NU-MED REPORTS LOSS OF $2.89 MILLION FOR QUARTER  </P> <P> Nu-Med Inc., an Encino operator of hospitals and other health-care facilities,  said it lost $2.89 million in its fiscal second quarter, compared with a  $703,000 profit a year earlier.  </P> <P> The loss came as Nu-Med's revenue for the quarter that ended Oct. 31 showed  virtually no change, at $65.5 million, compared with a year ago. Nu-Med blamed  the loss on several factors, including higher operating costs, lack of revenue  gains and increased interest expense on its debt.  </P> <P> For the first half of its fiscal year, Nu-Med lost $1.85 million compared with  a $5.54-million profit a year ago. Its six-month revenue rose to $139.4 million  from $130.1 million.  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Russia seeks aid for republics THE Russian government is pressing the Group of Seven industrialised countries to set up a multi-billion dollar fund to assist the non-Russian former Soviet republics - and has pledged that it will start the fund with Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from its own scarce foreign resources. The plan, being debated within the International Monetary Fund and between senior officials of the G7 states, would be designed to stimulate trade bwtween these countries and specially between them and Russia - dominant market and raw materials supplier in the former Soviet Union. Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the executive director for Russia at the IMF, said in an interview that 'This fund will be designed to stop the total disintegration of states - like Moldova, Armenia and Georgia - as well as to stimulate trade between all the former Soviet republics including the Baltic states. We should act to see to it that there is not a total disintegration, as in Yugoslavia.' Mr Kagalovsky said that over the past year, Russia had given hundreds of millions of roubles in credit to the former Soviet states - the bulk of it in 'hidden subsidies' which took the form of subsidised energy and other products sold at prices often fraction of world levels. This fund, which Mr Kagalovsky said had been approved by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, would be a way of exercising 'conditionality' on the other former USSR states - rewarding their efforts to co-operate and trade with each other. Mr Kagalovsky said he expected the issue would be discussed at the G7 simmit in Tokyo in July and it may be decided there. The continuing pulling apart of the former Soviet republics is now causing increasing concern in Moscow as the effects of severance of links between industrial partners components becomes more serious. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has urged the greater integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States which unites all of the former Soviet republics except the Baltic countries, Georgia and Azerbaijan - but so far without noticeable effect.</p>

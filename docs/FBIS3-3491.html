			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National </F> Committee, delivered by Ye Xuanping at the Second Session of the  Eighth CPPCC National Committee on 8 March]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (XINHUA) -- Members of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], entrusted by  the Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, I  now submit the report on the work of the Standing Committee of  the CPPCC National Committee for your examination and approval.  <H5>  I. </H5>   In the past year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, the people of all  nationalities in China have further emancipated their minds,  seized opportunities, deepened reform, and opened wider to the  outside world. As a result, China has enjoyed sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic growth, and political and social stability.  Unity among the nationalities has been further strengthened,  and all fields of endeavor have continued to advance. In  particular, the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," made by  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  shows that China's economy has entered a stage in which package  reforms and breakthroughs in key areas are integrated. Although  there are still contradictions and problems in our way of  advance, as a whole China is in a period of massive development  unprecedented in its history.    The new situation of reform and construction in China has  set  new tasks and requirements for the CPPCC, and has also created  better opportunities and conditions for improving the work of  the CPPCC. Since the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee, the Standing Committee, guided by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and basing itself on the experiences of the  past CPPCC national committees, has worked hard to explore new  ways of fulfilling the CPPCC's functions of political  consultation and democratic supervision in the new situation.  The Standing Committee has stressed that the CPPCC should  thoroughly understand its important position and role in the new  period; should strive to fulfill its functions without  overstepping its authority; should correctly understand its  characteristics and select the proper angle in exploiting its  advantages; should focus on the central task of economic  construction, and refrain from formalism in participating in the  administration and discussion of state affairs; should give full  play to its specialized committees and organize its members to  take part in various forms of activities regularly; should  strengthen information work in order to promptly and correctly  reflect people's sentiments and opinions; should vigorously  widen its foreign contacts in coordination with the state's  overall plan in foreign affairs; and so on and so forth. All  these have been designed to enable the CPPCC, a unique form of  democracy of the Chinese people, to better adapt itself to the  requirements of the new period for socialist modernization; to  fully play its role in the political, economic, and cultural  life of the state; and to solidly and effectively advance the  construction of socialist democracy, thereby guaranteeing in a  better way the thriving of our undertakings, long- term  stability in the country, and the realization of the great cause  of the reunification of the motherland.    In the past year, the CPPCC Standing Committee has  conscientiously organized the implementation of the tasks set by  the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. The  Standing Committee has participated in the administration and  discussion of state affairs while focusing on the central tasks  of the country and has made new advances in various fields of  work, thus bring about a more vivid and lively situation. The  major achievements are:    -- Conscientiously convene meetings, and strengthen  discussions and consultations of important state affairs.  Every year the CPPCC holds its plenary session to fulfill its  functions, discuss policies of the state, attend the NPC session  as observers, and participate in the discussion of the  government work report, the work reports of the Supreme Court  and the Supreme Procuratorate, the national economic and social  development plan, the state budget, and other important matters.  Meetings of the Standing Committee represent the major form of  carrying out the function of political consultation and  democratic supervision during the recess of the CPPCC plenary  session. In the past year, the Standing Committee has held five  plenary meetings to discuss the economic situation in the  country and countermeasures to deal with the situation, the  international situation, and other issues regarding the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure,  promotion of honesty in government institutions, and the fight  against corruption. During these meetings, leaders of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council, including Zhu Rongji,  Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, and Wei Jianxing were invited to make  reports on different occasions. While focusing on the central  issue, the members of the Standing Committee exchanged views  freely and put forward many valuable opinions and proposals,  bringing about a new atmosphere in the participation in the  administration and discussion of state affairs. Last June, the  chairmanship meeting discussed and adopted the "Proposal on  Strengthening Macroeconomic Regulation and Control To Check  Inflation" submitted by the Economic Committee. The analysis on  the country's economic situation and the countermeasures for  checking inflation, contained in the proposal, were adopted by  the party Central Committee and the State Council and thus  played a positive role in helping the state to enforce  macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure a sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.    -- Strengthen the work of special committees and  organize the members to constantly take part in various  activities. The special committees of the CPPCC are  working groups which organize the members to constantly take  part in various activities as well as important setups for  developing the members' role of providing political consultation  and democratic supervision, and of participating in and  discussing state affairs. Over the past year, the special  committees were very busy in organizing the members to take part  in various activities. This has further whipped up the  initiative of the members to participate in and discuss state  affairs. Various special committees also carried out  investigations and studied the building of the two civilizations  and some important issues of the united front work, and put  forward 24 investigation reports. Among those reports, "Some  Suggestions on Developing and Stabilizing Grain and Cotton  Production," "Suggestions on Saving and Protecting Cultural  Relics in the Three-Gorges Construction Area," "Investigation  Report on the Building of China's New and High Technology  Development Zones," and "Investigation Report on the Issue of  Helping Minority Areas Eliminate Poverty and Develop the  Economy" were taken seriously by the party Central Committee,  the State Council, and other concerned departments. Many  suggestions have been accepted. Various special committees also  held discussion meetings on formulating laws governing religion  and donations by overseas Chinese, and on implementing laws to  protect the rights and benefits of women and children, and laws  governing teachers and taxation. They put forward a number of  opinions and suggestions.    -- Expand the fields of foreign contacts to enhance  friendship and cooperation with other countries. From the  end of November to early December last year, Chairman Li Ruihuan  made formal visits to three South Asian countries at the  invitation of the speaker of Nepal's Upper House, the speaker of  the Indian Union Parliament and the chairman of the Pakistani  Senate, and achieved complete success. This was a major foreign  affairs activity last year by a principal leader of our country.  It was also the first visit to foreign countries by the  chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and was significant in  the history of foreign contacts by the CPPCC. Chairman Li  Ruihuan introduced China's reform, opening up and economic  construction to leaders, concerned departments, and people of  various circles of the three countries; explained China's  peaceful and friendly foreign policy, the characteristics and  functions of the CPPCC, and China's multiparty cooperation and  political consultation system under the leadership of the CPC;  enhanced the three countries' understanding of the basic  situation of China's socialist construction, especially the  political system of socialist democracy; promoted exchanges and  cooperation between the CPPCC and parliaments of the three  countries; and deepened friendship between the people of China  and the three countries. Vice chairmen Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian,  Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi, Hu Sheng, Qian Weichang, and Sun  Fuling also led delegations to a number of foreign countries,  and made many friends. Over the past year, the CPPCC National  Committee organized 15 delegations to visit 20 countries,  received visits by delegations from various countries, and  established new contacts with related organizations in 14  countries. As of now, the CPPCC National Committee has  established friendly relations with 46 organizations, and the  parliaments of 36 countries.    -- Expand friendly contacts at home and abroad, promote  the peace reunification of the motherland. With the goal  of promoting two-way exchanges and "postal, transport and trade  relations" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the  Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee has  strengthened relations and contacts with compatriots in Taiwan,  Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas Chinese abroad. In the past  year, the Standing Committee received 20 visiting delegations,  and some 500 people. Through extensive contacts with  influential and noted personages, and people of various circles  in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao regions, we have publicized our  policies, and increased mutual understanding. Members of the  CPPCC are from various sectors of society. They have maintained  extensive contacts with compatriots at home and abroad. They  have done a lot of useful work in developing exchanges and  cooperation in the economic, trade, science and technology, and  cultural fields between the mainland and the outside world, and  between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. In particular, the  members elected from Hong Kong and Macao have played a positive  role in maintaining the stability and long-term prosperity in  Hong Kong and Macao, and promoting the peaceful reunification of  the motherland.    -- Actively participate in the anti-corruption struggle  and assist state organizations to effectively promote clean  administration. In August last year, the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council made plans for the  anti-corruption struggle which won the wholehearted support of  personages representing various democratic parties and sectors.  In the course of this struggle, the Standing Committee  earnestly carried out its democratic supervision functions as  well as actively participated in general inspection of the  anti-corruption struggle, organized by the party Central  Committee. Six central inspection groups either headed or  deputized by Standing Committee members or members of the CPPCC  National Committee successively investigated the implementation  of central anti-corruption plans in four State Council  ministries and eight provinces. At its fifth meeting, the  Standing Committee included the subject of anti-corruption and  promotion of clean administration as an important agenda. The  meeting held earnest discussions and forwarded many fitting  opinions and suggestions. In addition, through various meetings  and proposals, members held activities to promote the  anti-corruption struggle and clean administration, promptly  handled calls and opinions of people from various sectors, and  actively forwarded various constructive suggestions.    -- Improve members' inspection as well as offer  suggestions and advice for reform and development. To make  members understand more about China's reform and construction  for better participation in political consultations, the general  office conducted on-the-spot or trans-provincial and  trans-regional inspection for members from Beijing and other  localities. In the entire year, a total of 466 CPPCC National  Committee members from 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities participated in inspection. The members went  deep into the grass-roots level to understand the situation, and  forwarded many good opinions and suggestions to which relevant  central departments and local governments attached importance.  The general office also sent members from Hong Kong and Macao  to separately inspect Xinjiang, Jiangxi, and Hainan to enable  them to understand more about national conditions in order to  forward ideas and suggestions for local economic construction  and social development.    -- Strengthen work in handling and answering  proposals. Proposals are an important way for various  participating CPPCC units and individuals to carry out their  consultative and supervisory functions as well as exercise their  democratic rights. In recent years, the CPPCC's proposal work  has been gradually moved onto a regular and systematic orbit.  The Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee  has emphasized the need to upgrade the quality of its work by  attaching great importance to handling proposals. It followed  up on investigation, worked jointly with others, and held  consultations and discussion meetings to enhance the work of  handling proposals. In the past year, a total of 1,900  proposals were handled and registered, of which 13 were  submitted by parties and organizations. A total of 1,506  members, or 72 percent of the total number of CPPCC members,  submitted proposals. By 15 February 1994, 1,881 proposals had  been handled and answered. Even though some proposals handled  did not result in satisfactory outcomes, many important opinions  and suggestions were indeed adopted by relevant departments  which produced good effects in implementing them.    -- Earnestly receive opinions from all sides and make  preparations for the CPPCC's constitutional amendment. The  current CPPCC's constitution, revised in 1982, has played a very  important role in initiating a new prospect for CPPCC work. In  the past 12 years, China has made tremendous achievements in  socialist modernization, resulting in profound changes in her  outlook. In particular, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speeches  during his inspection in the south, and the 14th CPC National  Congress, China's reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization has entered a new development stage. Essential  amendments to China's Constitution, as well as the constitutions  of the CPC and democratic parties, have been correspondingly  made. By virtue of this, the CPPCC Constitution also needs to  undergo necessary revisions. The second meeting of this  Standing Committee adopted the "Decision on Proposing a Partial  Amendment to the CPPCC Constitution" and set up a constitutional  amendment working group headed by Li Ruihuan, and comprising Ye  Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, and Hu Sheng as deputy heads. After half a  year of efforts, an amendment to the CPPCC Constitution took  shape on the basis of opinions solicited from responsible  persons of various democratic parties and the All-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce, local CPPCC committees, and  relevant units of the central authorities. This amendment  contains mainly convergencies with the Constitutional Amendment  with regard to some major wordings, such as the stress on the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  basic line in the primary phase of socialism, the system of  multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the CPC, and the socialist market economic system;  as well as replenishes -- after incorporating fresh experience  and achievements in developing China's socialist democratic  politics and in the CPPCC's work since the Third Plenary Session  of the 11th CPC Central Committee -- relevant provisions on the  CPPCC's performing the functions of political consultation and  democratic supervision. The proposed amendment puts forward  clearly: "The main functions of the National Committee and  local committees of the CPPCC are to carry out political  consultation and democratic supervision, and to organize for the  CPPCC's various participating parties and organizations as well  as people of all nationalities and all circles to take part in  the administration and discussion of state affairs," and that  "political consultation means consultations carried out before  decisions are made on the cardinal policy and principle of the  state and localities as well as important issues in the  political, economic, cultural, and social life; and those  carried out on major problems arising during the process of  implementing such policy decisions." These two stipulations and  the revision of other relevant clauses represent an  incorporation of the "Opinions of the CPC Central Committee on  Upholding and Improving the System of Multiparty Cooperation and  Political Consultation Under the Leadership of the CPC,"  relevant contents of the "Temporary Provisions of the CPPCC  National Committee on Political Consultation and Democratic  Supervision" transmitted by the CPC Central Committee, as well  as relevant guidelines of the First Session of the Eighth CPPCC  National Committee to specifically stipulate the major duties of  the CPPCC. It is believed that such stipulations will have a  major effect in standardizing and giving impetus to the CPPCC's  work. In line with the principle of making only essential and  partial revisions, this amendment does not alter any content in  the existing constitution to which a revision is optional. We  will propose resolving through state legislation, and other  ways, any issues that need to be solved in the CPPCC's work but  fall outside the capacity of the CPPCC Constitution itself.  Having been adopted by the Fifth Standing Committee meeting of  the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the amendment to the CPPCC  Constitution is now submitted for deliberation by this session.    -- Forge closer ties and cooperation with local CPPCC  committees and strengthen guidance for their work. As most  local CPPCC committees were reelected at almost the same time  last year as the CPPCC National Committee, vertical  communication was thus especially needed in the course of  opening up a new prospect in the work of local CPPCC committees.  This Standing Committee, therefore, further strengthened its  guidance for the work of local CPPCC committees in accordance  with its constitution. For instance, principal responsible  comrades from the CPPCC committees of various provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities were invited to our  Standing Committee meetings as observers to join in discussions  on state affairs and the study of the CPPCC's work; our chairman  and vice chairmen met with and heard work reports by comrades  from local CPPCC committees when inspecting local work; the  special committees concerned carried out cooperation and held  joint work meetings with their counterparts in local CPPCC  committees or conducted joint investigation and study on issues  of common concern; training was conducted for several batches of  responsible comrades from a number of city- and county-level  CPPCC committees. All these moves were welcomed by local CPPCC  committees.    Committee members, since the First Plenary Session of the  Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the Standing Committee has made  progress in its work. Many shortcomings and deficiencies,  however, remain in our work. For example, consultations on  issues of major importance need to be bolstered in terms of  fuller research and more thorough investigation; democratic  supervision by the CPPCC should be carried out -- in a more  down-to-earth manner -- in coordination with reform, opening up  of the state, and the development of political, economic, and  social undertakings; and greater improvement is needed in the  processing of motions submitted by the political parties, public  organizations, and committee members. We are convinced that so  long as we work with one heart and one mind, build on our  successes, and overcome our deficiencies, we can continue our  march forward.  <H5>  II. </H5>   Committee members, 1994 will be a crucial year for China's  reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. The basic  policy for the party's and state's work -- that is, fully  implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  seize the opportunity to accelerate the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure, maintain a sustained, fast,  and healthy development of the national economy, maintain  political stability, and bring about all-around social progress  -- has been decided. This year is the second year of the Eighth  CPPCC National Committee. The basic policy for the work of its  Standing Committee is to, under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, hold high the banner of patriotism and  socialism, revolve closely around the central task of the party  and state in executing -- in a still better way -- its functions  of political consultation and democratic supervision, improve  efficiency in the participation in the administration and  discussion of state affairs, and make due contributions in  implementing the task of seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability. Accordingly, the Standing Committee has set the  following as its main tasks for 1994:    1. Study the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics in a deep-going manner to enhance our common  understanding. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics is a guide to action for  a big country with a population of 1.1 billion to eliminate  poverty to achieve prosperity, to eliminate backwardness, and to  achieve modernization. In the past 15 years, people of all  nationalities across the country have implemented this theory  and scored world-renowned achievements. Building socialism with  Chinese characteristics has become the supreme consensus among  people of all nationalities across the country. The various  democratic parties, public organizations, persons without party  affiliations, and persons representing ethnic groups -- the  components of the CPPCC -- must integrate theory with reality  and study this theory on their own initiative so they will have  a deeper understanding of the basic tenets of Marxism, a  systematic understanding of the current national conditions of  China, and a complete and accurate knowledge of the country's  general principle and policy. Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping reflects in a concentrated way the  theory on building socialism with Chinese Characteristics. We  should make it the most important teaching material for us in  conducting self-education, and in enhancing our understanding  under the new situation. Deng Xiaoping's works contain a series  of expositions on the nature, tasks, and functions of the united  front and the CPPCC in the new period, carrying forward Comrade  Mao Zedong's theory on the united front and people's democracy  under the new historical conditions. We must study them in a  systematic and deepgoing manner. Efforts should be made to  study the new situation and new characteristics of CPPCC work in  the course of establishing a socialist market economic system,  dare to explore new ways, dare to act, uphold the principle of  "democracy, realism, unity, motivational atmosphere," and  implement, in a still better manner, the system of multi-party  cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of  the CPC.    2. Select important issues in economic construction,  reform and opening up to the outside world, the building of  spiritual civilization, and the people's livelihood as subjects  for organized investigation and study, and conscientiously and  properly participate in the administration and discussion of  state affairs. Proper participation in the administration  and discussion of state affairs is the essential requirement of  the CPPCC's duties of political consultation and democratic  supervision as well as an important criterion for measuring the  CPPCC's work. We should closely revolve around the party and  the state's central task in participating in the administration  and discussion of state affairs, improve actual work results,  and give play to the CPPCC's advantage of being  intellect-intensive, and having widespread information sources  and a relatively smooth vertical communication system, to  vigorously promote socialist modernization. From late last year  through early this year, the State Council successively  introduced a series a reform measures aimed at accelerating the  establishment of a socialist market economic system. As  continually deepening reform of the economic structure would  guarantee a sound structure for promoting economic development,  we should unswervingly unite the people in support of the  government's move to implement measures to deepen reform, and  should look squarely at a series of new contradictions and  difficulties arising amid the reform, to promote the integration  of reform, development, and stability. This is the overall  situation of the state. In unfolding various activities in  political consultation, democratic supervision, and  participation in the administration and discussion of state  affairs, the CPPCC should conscientiously submit to and serve  this overall situation. This Standing Committee will prudently  select several issues of overall importance in reform, opening  up to the outside world, and the building of spiritual and  material civilization as subjects for comparatively systematic  and in-depth investigation and study organized under the  initiative of the general office of the CPPCC National Committee  or relevant special committees, so as to find out about the  various situations and put forward countermeasures. Whenever  necessary, local CPPCC committees or the democratic parties  concerned will be invited to take part in these activities.  This Standing Committee or the chairmanship meeting should  carry out earnest deliberations and make proposals to be  formally submitted to the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council.    3. Democratic parties and mass organizations should  carry forward the fine traditions and play a more important role  in participating in administration and discussion of state  affairs. Democratic parties and mass organizations  constitute an important foundation of people's political  consultative organs, and they play a particularly important role  in multiparty cooperation and political consultations. Promoted  and nurtured by revolutionaries of the older generation like Mao  Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping over the last several  decades, the CPC and various democratic parties have developed  the fine traditions characterized by "long-term coexistence,  mutual supervision, showing utter devotion to each other, and  sharing weal and woe," as well as the fine traditions  characterized by close cooperation, and discussion of state  affairs among all parties of the people's political consultative  organs. Today, not only should we inherit these traditions, but  we must also carry them forward. Last winter and this spring,  Chairman Li Ruihuan visited the central committees of all  democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and  Commerce, and exchanged views with them on various situations.  From now on the CPPCC National Committee should forge stronger  ties with democratic parties and mass organizations, and give  full scope to their roles in participating in administration and  discussion of state affairs. We should attach even greater  importance to their suggestions and motions, and create more  opportunities for them to take part in administration and  discussion of state affairs. All special committees should make  it a regular practice to exchange views with democratic parties  and mass organizations, and strengthen operational coordination  with them.    4. CPPCC organs should contribute to maintaining  political and social stability by forging closer ties with  people of all nationalities in all sectors, earnestly reflect  their views to the government, and coordinate their  relations. CPPCC organs should establish closer ties with  member units and members, and all member units and members  should forge closer ties with people in various sectors. As the  intensity of economic reform increases and more reform measures  are introduced, the interests of different social groups will  certainly have to be readjusted, and the readjustment will  inevitably give rise to new social problems. Thus CPPCC organs  at all levels are duty bound to maintain political stability and  unity, mobilize all positive factors, and turn negative factors  into positive factors to make sure that the government can  successfully carry out its reform plans. All member units,  special committees, and members of CPPCC organs must set  examples of taking the interests of the whole into account and  maintaining stability, and they must not do anything unfavorable  to unity and stability. Meanwhile, we must take the initiative  in going deep among those with whom we have established ties to  hear and reflect their views, requests, and complaints. For  those hot issues with which the masses are concerned, and to  which they have responded strongly, we should actively seek ways  and means that can solve them, and through participating in  administration and state affairs discussion, urge the government  to deal with them. For those problems that cannot be  immediately resolved, we must also assist the government to  enlighten the people so that the contradictions will not be  aggravated. We must strive to help people of different  nationalities and with different religious beliefs to understand  one another and trust one another, and promote their unity  through coordinating their ties. Special committees should pay  particular attention to helping remote and impoverished areas  through giving them intellectual support, and help these areas  as well as minority areas and the former revolutionary bases set  up production projects, and help them shake off poverty, improve  their livelihood, and develop educational, cultural, and  scientific-technical projects.    5. We should earnestly carry out democratic supervision  through conducting effective inspection and presenting more  constructive proposals. CPPCC organs carry out their  democratic supervision primarily through putting forth  suggestions and making criticism. CPPCC organs must therefore  attach great importance to, and promptly reflect, the views and  suggestions -- especially those critical views -- which member  units and members put forth at various meetings, and during  inspections. Democratic parties, mass organizations, and  members of CPPCC organs should strive to demonstrate their  supervisory role, improve the quality of proposals, be more  efficient in examining and establishing cases for investigation,  and analyze each and every case to make sure it is valid and  will be handled constructively. On this basis, we should make  sure that all proposals are handled promptly and properly.  Bureaucratic conduct -- such as shelving the motions, stalling  their handling, or handling them perfunctorily -- should be  criticized through the media. Members of CPPCC organs should be  encouraged to report and expose all lawless conduct. CPPCC  organs at all levels should safeguard by law the  responsibilities and rights of CPPCC member units and  individuals to perform their democratic supervision.    6. Expand channels of contact in developing friendship  with people abroad, promote peaceful reunification of the  motherland. As the days of recovering Hong Kong and Macao  in 1997 and 1999 are getting closer, and with the development of  relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the CPPCC  must intensify efforts to promote peaceful reunification of the  motherland. It is necessary to expand the scope of contacts;  widen channels of contact in developing friendship; strengthen  efforts to publicize the principles of "peaceful reunification"  and "one country, two systems"; enhance mutual understanding;  strengthen the study of the situation in Taiwan, Hong Kong and  Macao; and improve coordination with all concerned departments.  We will continue to promote the realization of direct postal,  transport, and trade relations with the Taiwan region. We will  continue to work for the stability and long-term prosperity of  the Hong Kong region. We will firmly support our government  resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong according to  the schedule despite all kinds of winds and waves [feng lang  7364 3186], and all kinds of artificial obstacles [ren wei di  zhang ai 0086 3634 4104 7140 4293]. We will continue to work  hard for the smooth transfer of political power and peaceful  transition in the Macao region in accordance with the principles  of the Macao Basic Law.    7. Give full play to the advantageous position of the  CPPCC, continue to develop friendly contacts with parliaments  and nongovernment organizations of various countries. The  CPPCC's foreign contacts are an important component part of our  country's overall foreign affairs. We must follow the principle  of serving the interests of China's economic construction and  overall diplomatic mission, give full play to the CPPCC's  advantageous position of integration of the government and  nongovernment sectors, and actively unfold activities in the  field of external relations. In the new year we should, on the  basis of consolidating our existing friendly relations, increase  contacts with countries and regions which lack understanding of  our country. In developing external relations, we can promote  contacts with nongovernment friendly organizations as well as  foreign parliaments. We should publicize the features of our  country's system of socialist democracy in light of our  country's special characteristics; we should turn the CPPCC's  foreign contacts into links and bridges for promoting  international cooperation and understanding in China; and we  should strive to create a favorable international environment  for china's socialist modernization drive.    8. Strengthen the organizational work of the CPPCC in  an all-around way, raise the quality of cadres, and increase  work efficiency. In order to create a new situation for  the work of the CPPCC, we must effectively strengthen the  ideological and organizational building of the CPPCC, and  improve our workstyle and systems. We should carry out  organizational reform, increase efficiency, raise the quality of  service, and effectively improve all kinds of work of CPPCC  organizations. We will ask cadres of various CPPCC  organizations to seriously study job related knowledge,  especially theory and policies of the united front work; attain  modern economic, scientific and technological knowledge;  heighten their sense of service; raise cultural and professional  quality; and improve their ability to serve the united front  work, to serve the meetings of the CPPCC, and to serve members  of the CPPCC. We will vigorously advocate good practices for  making constant progress, unity and cooperation, strictly  observing discipline, paying attention to efficiency, and being  honest in performing official duties. We will show concern for  and train cadres, and create good conditions for the steady  growth of middle-aged and young cadres. In short, we will  strive to cultivate contingents of workers of the CPPCC who love  work related to the CPPCC, and are good in ideology,  professional skill, and workstyle.    Fellow members, the 45th founding anniversary of the CPPCC  as  well as the 45th founding anniversary of the People's Republic  of China will fall in this year. Let us hold high the banner of  patriotism and socialism, unite closely around the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and struggle  hard for the accomplishment of various tasks set by the current  session, and score a new victory in the work of the CPPCC!</p>

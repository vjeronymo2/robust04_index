He said Sudan's cultural plan  required effort and patience and that Sudanese of various  orientations did not differ on it. His Excellency explained at  the first consultative [shura] meeting yesterday evening, which  was attended by many scholars and thinkers, that the causes of  the economic problems included the weakness of the inherited  economic structure, external economic pressures, the continuing  war in the south and the need to find more economic inputs.

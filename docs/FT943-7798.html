			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Journalist takes a risk to get himself into print - Max Hotopf fled Fleet Street to become his own boss. It was, a rewarding decision When he left university Max Hotopf had no idea that within 12 years he would be the head of a publishing corporation. His career, in fact, got off to a bad start. After a year teaching English as a foreign language he worked as an advertising executive and an invoice clerk. 'I was fired and made redundant twice by the age of 24,' said Hotopf, 36, who gained a combined honours degree in politics and sociology at Durham University. Casting his mind back he thinks this is no bad thing. 'It gave me the desire to succeed - and above all, to make money,' he said. By the age of 29, after working in public relations and as a journalist on a computer magazine and then Accountancy Age, Hotopf gained a job on the city staff of the Daily Mail. It was a good job. He earned more than Pounds 30,000 for a four-day week. But after nearly four years he decided to leave and start his own business newsletter. 'My colleagues thought I was mad to leave a good job in a recession to form a new venture in an area known to be risky,' Hotopf said. 'I had the burning desire to start my own business. But it was a tremendous gamble as my wife and I had recently bought a 14th century house in a Suffolk village, and a second baby was on the way. 'Somehow I just didn't see myself as becoming a city editor. Really I saw starting my own business as growing up, and I knew there was money to be made in business newsletters - providing you get the arithmetic right.' With a Pounds 105,000 mortgage and a large medieval house in need of extensive renovation it was important to get it right first time. He did. But before that there had been a false start. While at the Daily Mail, Hotopf and a colleague had tried to start a newsletter on management consultancy. 'Unfortunately my partner gave the game away. Word of our plans leaked out and somebody else got a similar project off the ground first,' Hotopf said. 'I regarded this as bragging and I was very angry.' His new venture started in September 1991, with immediate mailing of the first details of his new newsletter - PC Europa - to 1,200 potential subscribers. 'It was a crucial exercise. It really had to pull in the first subscribers, as we had no plans to sell advertising and only a recent legacy of Pounds 20,000 to live off if the venture failed,' Hotopf said. The mailshot pulled in 30 subscribers of Pounds 300 each from Europe, North America and the Far East. It was a response of nearly 3 per cent - very good by mailshot standards. 'It pulled in a vital Pounds 9,000 and gave us confidence and credibility,' Hotopf said. A key element had been a deal with American Express which allowed its credit card to be to use for payment. 'I knew it would be very difficult to get credit card company recognition from the onset,' Hotopf said. 'When Amex initially refused me I rang their press office and said I was from the Daily Mail. I explained why I thought I should be eligible. 'It hinged on the question of resale and the fear of the credit card companies that unknown new customers might resell goods bought on a credit card that they have not paid for. I was able to convince them that my newsletter had no resale value.' Eventually, representatives of Amex visited him in his home and viewed his business plan. Shortly after gaining Amex approval, he also won over Diner's Club. The other fundamental to start-up success was wording. Hotopf named his newsletter PC Europa. The description underneath the name on the front of the 24 page publication is very precise. It reads: 'Authoritative newsletters on Europe's pc markets.' It is very specific, and aimed at a precise target area. Hotopf liked the name Passant - his mother's maiden name - so he called his tiny company by the grand title of the Passant Publishing Corporation. 'Although the word corporation has little meaning in English company law, the title had a ring to it, and also the feel of credibility. I felt the word corporation would appeal to the Americans and the Japanese,' he said. The home of the Passant Publishing Corporation was the equally grand-sounding Church House, in the High Street of the pretty village of Nayland, near Colchester. Subscribers were not to know this was Hotopf's home. Rebecca, who trained as a doctor and is her husband's business partner, remained at home to run the business while caring for the couple's children. Hotopf travelled to the crucial computer exhibitions. After less than three years subscribers total 800, Hotopf has a staff of two, and at his year-end in August he expects turnover to top Pounds 300,000. Profitability stands at about 30 per cent. The company also produces three annual directories - Distributors in Europe  -the top 500; PC Retailers in Europe; and The new PC Assemblers. 'My main worry is the current rate of renewal. The experts say it should be around 80 per cent, and we are not hitting this figure,' Hotopf said. 'Keeping quality up is my top priority. A regular flow of up-to-date information is the key. However, despite the arrival of Mark Russell (a 26-year-old languages graduate) five months ago, I think we might have let it slip slightly.' Hotopf and Russell do all the interviewing and writing, 90 per cent of which is by telephone. The third member of the team is administrator Robert Rennie. By far the biggest overhead - Hotopf currently works from a small office near his home with a rent of Pounds 350 a month - is his telephone bill. It averages Pounds 1,000 a month because of the high proportion of international calls. As the owner of a successful and profitable specialist business newsletter one might think Hotopf's eyes would be on expanding the Passant Publishing Corporation. But he will not be drawn on this. 'First of all I want to produce three or four more reports,' he said. We are currently limited by the size of our office so a move is the next thing on the cards. Then I'll take a hard look. I can double the turnover of the business from doing a few more reports and improving the quality and circulation of the newsletter, so maybe this will be the course to follow.'

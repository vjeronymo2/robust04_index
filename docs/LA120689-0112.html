			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KILLEA CLAIMS NARROW VICTORY OVER BENTLEY  </P> <P> In a race seen as a referendum on abortion and how far Catholic Church leaders  may go in opposing it, Democratic Assemblywoman Lucy Killea narrowly won a  special election in a heavily Republican state Senate district Tuesday.  </P> <P> Three weeks after Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher made her a national cause  celebre by denying her Communion because of her pro-choice stand on abortion,  Killea apparently defeated Republican Assemblywoman Carol Bentley in the 39th  state Senate District -- a conservative stronghold with a daunting 11  percentage point Republican registration edge.  </P> <P> With 2,800 absentee ballots that were dropped off at the polls Tuesday  remaining to be counted today, it is mathematically possible -- though  improbable -- that Bentley could overcome her 1,528-vote deficit. However, in  order for Bentley to overtake Killea, she would have to draw a  disproportionately large percentage of those absentee ballots -- an unlikely  development given that Killea handily carried the absentee votes counted  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Final unofficial figures showed that Killea received 60,012 votes (50.6%),  compared to 58,484 votes (49.4%) for Bentley, a first-term legislator who was  seeking to become the fourth consecutive Republican from her 77th Assembly  District to move up to the 39th District Senate seat. A minor third candidate,  Tom Connolly, a public defender from El Cajon, was little more than a political  footnote in the race, drawing only about 50 write-in votes.  </P> <P> Though better known, better financed and having a longer legislative resume  than her opponent, Killea's apparent victory nonetheless was an improbable one  attributable more to the fallout from Maher's unusually harsh -- and, many  felt, improperly political -- sanction than anything said or done by either  major candidate.  </P> <P> Indeed, although Killea, not wanting to be labeled a single-issue candidate,  consistently stressed that abortion was "only one of many differences" between  herself and Bentley, Maher's action undeniably galvanized her campaign,  infusing it with a fervor rarely seen in state legislative races.  </P> <P> If his purpose was to make Killea an example to other pro-choice Catholics in  public office, Maher's action did precisely that -- though clearly not in the  way he had intended. By guaranteeing that the volatile abortion question would  overshadow all others, the bishop unintentionally drew campaign battle lines  most favorable to Killea -- in the process offsetting the daunting partisan  disadvantage confronting her that, under normal circumstances, would have all  but preordained a Bentley victory.  </P> <P> "We felt we had a good chance before, but this makes it more of a race," Killea  said shortly after Maher's sanction.  </P> <P> Bentley glumly offered the same analysis, saying: "The bishop's action  certainly played right into (Killea's) hands. In a way, he did my opponent's  work for her."  </P> <P> Viewed as an important, if otherwise obscure, state legislative race at the  outset, the 39th District contest was catapulted to national prominence in  mid-November when Maher imposed his sanction against Killea.  </P> <P> Calling Killea "an advocate of this most heinous crime," Maher ordered her not  to take Communion at Mass unless she recanted her position -- something that  the 67-year-old former San Diego City Council member made it clear she did not  intend to do.  </P> <P> By making Killea the first American Catholic elected official so severely  punished for a pro-choice stand on abortion, Maher ignited a political  firestorm that provoked another heated round in the continuing public debate  touched off by last summer's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states broader  authority to restrict abortion.  </P> <P> In addition, Maher's action revived the familiar debate over separation of  church and state, drawing alternate interpretations as a deserved punishment of  one who flouted church orthodoxy or an unwelcome church intrusion in politics.  </P> <P> Equally important, Maher's action dramatically altered the dynamics of the race  for the seat that Republican Larry Stirling vacated two months ago to accept a  Municipal Court judgeship.  </P> <P> If for no reason other than the district's 49%-38% Republican registration  edge, the special election had been widely regarded as Bentley's to lose,  despite her shorter tenure in Sacramento and lower name recognition. Maher's  sanction, however, turned conventional political wisdom on its head,  introducing a potent outside force that knocked the campaign off its axis,  sending it careening off in wildly unpredictable directions largely beyond the  control of its two principals.  </P> <P> Though Maher described his action as "more pastoral than political," even the  bishop was well aware of the political ramifications of his controversial  decision. Expressing hope that Catholics would heed his message, Maher said: "I  doubt that Lucy Killea will get many Catholic votes."  </P> <P> Far from damaging Killea, however, Maher's action proved to be an asset,  transforming the unassuming, low-key legislator into an overnight celebrity who  made national television appearances on the Phil Donahue show, "CBS This  Morning" and other network news programs.  </P> <P> Killea's new-found fame, in turn, acted as a magnet for dollars and volunteers,  helping her to outspend Bentley by a more than a 2-to-1 ratio -- $317,000 to  $128,000, as of last week. Moreover, it riveted public attention on the very  issue that Killea had always hoped to highlight as one of her major differences  with Bentley, who opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or where the  mother's life is endangered.  </P> <P> Among Killea's strategists, abortion was seen as precisely the kind of  emotional issue that could persuade pro-choice Republicans to cross party lines  and generate a higher-than-usual Democratic turnout -- factors essential to her  chances in the heavily Republican district. The sprawling district covers most  of eastern San Diego County, stretching from Ocean Beach to Imperial County and  reaching north to Escondido and Ramona.  </P> <P> But, although the episode was a momentous political break for Killea, it also  presented considerable potential risks. Killea consultant Larry Sheingold  noted, for example, that there was "a thin line between reacting effectively"  and appearing overly eager to capitalize on an incident that Killea herself  described as "emotional and painful." To that end, Killea persistently  emphasized that the confrontation with Maher "was thrust upon me," and declined  press requests to accompany her to Mass.  </P> <P> Bentley, meanwhile, watched with a mixture of amazement, confusion and chagrin  as her opponent's extended stay in the media spotlight depreciated her own  candidacy from front-runner status to one mentioned almost as an afterthought  in stories about the race.  </P> <P> "When you see your opponent's picture on Page 1 every day, and she's on the TV  news every night . . . it is a little upsetting," the 44-year-old freshman  legislator from El Cajon said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Bentley doggedly stuck to her original plan -- chipping away at  Killea's superior name recognition by building up her own, emphasizing the  candidate's partisan differences in a district where that distinction clearly  benefitted her, and trying to paint the four-term Democrat as a liberal with  close ties to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Tom Hayden  (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> "Lucy Killea likes to tell Republicans she's a Democrat with a small 'd,' " a  Bentley mailer said. "But her voting record proves she's a Democrat with a big  'D' and a liberal with a big 'L.' "  </P> <P> Indeed, the two candidates differed on a range of issues beyond abortion, with  Killea's votes generally falling within a moderate to liberal range, while  Bentley typically hews to a conservative line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Diego County Election Results  </P> <P> Results for write-in candidates may not be available at edition time.  </P> <P> Percentages may not equal 100% because of rounding.  </P> <P> Senate District 39  </P> <P> 536 of 536 Precincts Reporting  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.78IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lucy Killea (D)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 60,012  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Carol Bentley (R)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 58,484  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Escondido School Trustees  </P> <P> 94 of 94 Precincts Reporting  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.67IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bill Horn  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,707  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 46.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Billy Falling  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,112  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Larry Coyle  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,852  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Stephen Thorne  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 728  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ray Lawrence  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 619  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Harold Polesetsky  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 593  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Terry Cottrell  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 429  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bill Tomkins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 132  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

Utah also proposes to add new UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;17(6) to specify that UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;17(2)(t)(ii) is repealed effective September 30, 2004. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;18, operator requirements for underground coal mining, by adding new subsection (4) to require the permittee of an underground coal mining operation after October 24, 1992, to promptly repair or compensate for material damage resulting from subsidence to occupied residential dwellings and related structures or noncommercial buildings. Utah further proposes that repair of damage includes rehabilitation, restoration, or replacement of such damaged dwellings, structures, or buildings; and compensation is to be in the full amount of the diminution in value resulting from the subsidence. Lastly, Utah proposes that the requirement to repair or compensate for material damage resulting from subsidence will not prohibit or interrupt underground coal mining operations, and the Board will adopt final rules to implement these provisions within 1 year after enactment of UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;18(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20, contest of violation or amount of penalty, by adding new subsection (2)(e)(ii) to provide that if the operator fails to submit the amount of the civil penalty within 30 days of receipt of the results of an informal conference, the operator waives any opportunity for further review of the violation or to contest the violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;22 pertaining to violations of Utah's program or permit conditions by (1) requiring at subsection (1)(d) that, where a determination is made that a pattern of violations exists has existed and the violations were caused by the permittee's unwarranted failure to comply with Utah's program or the conditions of the permit, the Division will request the Board to issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked and provide an opportunity for a public hearing; if the permittee requests a hearing, the Board will give notice in accordance with its rules of practice and procedure; and if the permittee fails to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the Board will immediately enter an order to suspend or revoke the permit; (2) adding the word ``district'' before ``court'' at subsection (2)(a) and clarifying that any relief granted by the district court will continue in effect unless the Utah Supreme Court on review grants a stay of enforcement or sets aside or modifies the Board's order which is being appealed; (3) providing at subsection (3)(a) that a permittee or aggrieved person may initiate Board action by requesting a hearing and requiring at subsections (3)(b) and (d) that the Board will act in accordance with its rules of practice and procedure; (4) changing terms at subsection (3)(e) from ``issued'' to ``entered'' when describing the outcome of the Board's order and from ``administrative'' to ``adjudicative'' when describing ``proceeding;'' and (5) at subsection (3)(f), providing that the Board's action is subject to judicial review by the Utah Supreme Court as prescribed in subsection 78&hyph;2&hyph;2(3)(e)(iv), rather than by the appropriate district court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a correspondent's report from  Aranyaprathet, Police Major General Tit Kim-on, the chief of  police in Poipet, Cambodia, came to Ban Pakkat, Aranyaprathet  District with some men at 0200 on 13 April to receive 16  Cambodian soldiers from Colonel Ongkon Thongprasom, deputy chief  of the Thai-Cambodian Coordination Office. These Cambodian  soldiers fled into Thailand on 10 April to escape the Khmer  Rouge encirclement and bombardment of Pailin.    Police Lieutenant Colonel Kay Kien, 40, one of the  Cambodians  who fled to Thailand, said he was given instructions from the  government by Police Lt. Col. Teap Li. The instructions were to  protect Pailin -- captured from the Khmer Rouge on 19 March --  by taking 150 men to defend Phum O Lak, about 3 km from the Thai  border and 22 km northwest of Pailin. They came under heavy  Khmer Rouge fire and received no government reinforcements.  Thus, they had to flee into Thailand on 11 April [date as  published]. They asked the Thai force in the area to send them  back to Battambang. Teap Li disappeared; his fate is unknown.    According to the latest report, although there has been no  confirmation of the Khmer Rouge recapturing Pailin, Cambodian  Government soldiers say the Khmer Rouge now has the advantage  because it is in a position to cut off supply routes and carry  out guerrilla activities in many areas, particularly in Pailin  itself. They expect more Cambodian Government soldiers to flee  into Thailand.    Moreover, there have been occasional violent acts along the  border. On the same morning, the inspector of the Khlong Nam  Sai police station received a report that a Cambodian man and  woman, about 50-60 years old, were killed and their bodies left  near Ban Noi Si Chomphu, about 20 km from Aranyaprathet. Their  bodies showed that they were killed by sharp instruments. They  were reportedly killed by Cambodian or Thai robbers who took  their four cows, which had been grazing in Thai territory.  Efforts are being made to inform their relatives.</p>

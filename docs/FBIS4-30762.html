			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Jiri </F> Kouda; place and date not given: "If You Are Traveling, You Must  Pay the Toll"]    [Excerpts] [Kouda] The prime minister signed the  Partnership for Peace recently. In your opinion, this is merely  the way to full membership in NATO. Is that opinion shared by  all the coalition partners?    [Baudys] I admit that I have not encountered any other  opinion among the other partners.    [Kouda] Does that not mean, however, taking responsibility  -- to a certain extent -- for NATO even in possible situations  when it is not in the Czech Republic's interest?    [Baudys] When you enter into a marriage with someone, you  must know with whom you are entering into it, that is, whether  this is a reliable person. Understandably, it does not only  mean a number of advantages, but also a number of  responsibilities and sui generis certain restrictions. It is  impossible to be a fare-dodger on a train. Simply, if you are  traveling, you must pay the toll.    [Kouda] Many opposition politicians are cautious about  joining NATO, many are opposed to it. In this context, they  often emphasize the role of the CSCE. Moreover, there is also  Russia here with its negative position toward NATO expansion so  that a new cordon sanitaire is not created around that power.    [Baudys] It is necessary to realize that the CSCE is a forum  for negotiation. It is not an executive body that has executive  powers and repressive elements. It is completely different from  NATO or the Western European Union. Every responsible  politician, and especially the defense or foreign minister, must  do all he can to ensure that this country functions. We know  that situations may arise that could exceed this country's  defense capability. It is necessary to look for bodies of  collective security. History leads to a certain general  integration -- communication and technological -- and NATO is  also one of the levels of integration.    [Kouda] And what is your view of a power like Russia?    [Baudys] Of course, Russia is not only a power, it is a  superpower. That is one thing. The other is that each state  must seek its own identity, a place where it belongs. This  government team, which won the most support in the elections,  has come up with a program according to which the Czech Republic  is part of European and Western European civilization. It  belongs to and acknowledges the values of the European Union; it  acknowledges the values that NATO defends. As far as Russia is  concerned, it is up to it alone where it stands and what it  avows.    [Kouda] Would it not be appropriate, however, to confirm  this orientation in a referendum? That is, by asking whether  citizens want the Czech Republic to join NATO?    [Baudys] Several principles are being mixed up here. A  referendum is normal in democracies of the kind found in  Switzerland, where they are conducted even on a local level  about something important. A referendum is a different way of  pursuing democracy than is normal in our country. There is a  historically well-established method here -- electing political  parties. Each party produces a specific program and we as  coalition parties have never made a secret of our attitude  toward NATO. The voters accepted this, these parties were  elected by the majority, this is part of the government's  program, and parliament has approved this program. I see no  reason to hold a referendum on this. I would ask, if not NATO  or the Western European Union, then what? No opposition  politician has been able to answer this question yet. No one  has been able to propose an alternative that would make any  sense. [passage omitted]    [Kouda] According to General Nekvasil, there should be  33,000 professional soldiers in the Army. This number has now  declined, however, and this situation is being reflected mainly  among the posts of squad, platoon, and company commanders. How  do you intend to deal with it?    [Baudys] The Army's transformation is oriented toward  ensuring that it is compatible with other armies from advanced  democratic states, mostly NATO members, by means of its ability,  structure, and organization. Reducing the size of the Army is  one thing, transferring from a division to a brigade system is  another, and the method of command and management is something  else again. Other things include the personnel issue, the  education and training system in the Army, the whole principle  of budgeting and planning, democratic management, and creating a  comprehensive new and functioning logistical system. These are  processes that were started in the middle of last year,  processes that take place at a specific time and according to a  timetable. In reply to your question: By significantly  reducing the number of most senior officers and transferring  them to command the lower-level units -- squads, companies, and  so on.    [Kouda] Do you think that the officers will transfer to  these posts?    [Baudys] The process will take some time. Of course, it  will be difficult for a 50-year-old officer to command a platoon  or a company. That is not the purpose. It will lead to natural  waste in the Army; people will retire. A number of people no  longer want to be in the Army, mainly for financial reasons.  Dozens, however, are returning to it again. Filling the  lower-level posts could not be done last year, for it was not  clear which units would be abolished, whether people would get  an apartment, and so on. Consequently, we could not offer them  any prospects. Now this is under way, we have a concept, and  only now are we recruiting for the Army.    [Kouda] The across-the-board screenings have, obviously, not  fulfilled their purpose.    [Baudys] That was not understood properly. It was  constantly pressed upon me that the screenings mean a sweeping  purge. We needed to map out the situation, that is, who is who  and take action against the most flagrant cases. I had  anticipated that we would be able to take action against more of  these cases; we simply did not succeed 100 percent, but  fundamental changes are in progress. [passage omitted]    [Kouda] You have admitted that smallpox cultures were stored  in the military hospital in Stresovice. How and when were the  cultures destroyed and who bears, or will bear, the  responsibility for storing them?    [Baudys] Those are problems that have been foisted upon us.  So far, no investigation has shown that the Czech Army preserved  anything that would be at variance with the law or at variance  with international conventions. I had the viral cultures  destroyed because it was apparent from the conclusion reached by  the inter-departmental commission that there was no need to  continue to store them. That entire issue has been unbelievably  blown up and overdramatized.    [Kouda] As defense minister, you made the decision to  destroy the smallpox virus. So, the Czech Army had preserved it  for a certain period.    [Baudys] That was not at variance with any international  convention, however. If I had not given the order for its  destruction, nothing would have happened. It is also necessary  to say that the issue here involves the variola minor and  variola major forms of smallpox. The variola major was  destroyed in 1975. What the Czech Army had was variola minor,  which is less dangerous than variola major. A number of very  dangerous viruses -- which you can purchase for a few dollars in  any laboratory, however -- were preserved. The issue was blown  out of proportion.</p>

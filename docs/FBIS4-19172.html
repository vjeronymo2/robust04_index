			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 13 (AFP) -- Treaties to accept  Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European Union [EU]  were formally wrapped up and printed here Wednesday [13 April],  EU officials said.    The treaties took more than a year to negotiate. The final  major obstacle was removed last month when Britain removed its  objections to a modification of EU voting rules to take account  of the EU's first enlargement since 1986.    The officials said the treaties were being sent to the  European Parliament, which must approve them by May 5 if the  four countries are to have any chance of joining the 12-nation  union by the target date of January 1 next year.    The treaties must also be ratified by the parliaments of EU  countries, and by popular referendums in all four of the  applicant countries.    Last-minute sticking points, involving particularly fishing  disputes with Norway and Sweden, were finally overcome late  Tuesday, the officials said.</p>

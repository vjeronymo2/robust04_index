			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ROCKY STATUE FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL  </P> <P> Long odds never bothered Sylvester Stallone's cinematic alter ego Rocky Balboa,  but his fans have an uphill battle to keep Rocky's 8 1/2-foot bronze likeness  atop the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  </P> <P> "Would you like to buy a prizefighter 8 feet high?" museum President Robert  Montgomery Scott asked Wednesday.  </P> <P> Scott wants the statue gone from the front of the museum when filming is done  for "Rocky V," but the prop-turned-tourist-attraction is gaining supporters,  including Mayor W. Wilson Goode.  </P> <P> "There is a contract between the 'Rocky V' production group and ourselves that  it will be removed on Saturday but they've been pushing pretty hard to keep it  there," Scott said.  </P> <P> "Rocky" creator Stallone had the statue made for the third movie in his series  about a Philadelphia club fighter who makes it to the top.  </P> <P> Goode said the statue represents "the struggle of so many people."  </P></p>

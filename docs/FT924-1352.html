			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways British Airways is flying high in its quest to be global. The airline's victory in the auction to buy 25 per cent of Qantas is a welcome fillip, although bad news about its proposed Dollars 750m investment in USAir may sour the party. Qantas is undoubtedly desirable. It has a productive young fleet compatible with BA's. It still has to squeeze significant benefits from its acquisition of Australian Airlines. And although Qantas's European traffic is unlikely to rise heavily over the next few years, it has attractive routes in the lucrative Bangkok-Singapore-Hong Kong triangle. But BA is paying a full fare. A cash outlay of Pounds 291m looks expensive for an investment that would have generated profits of just Pounds 9m last year, before financing costs. The deal is likely to be dilutive before contributing usefully by 1995. BA is in for the long haul. It helps, though, that the Australian government's ADollars 1.35bn recapitalisation plan for Qantas will sweeten the national carrier's profits by about ADollars 120m. As for the USAir deal, that appears to rest with Mr John Major's negotiating skills over the weekend. If the two deals were to come off, BA's debt-to-capital ratio would rise to nearly 70 per cent which is close to its limit. A rights issue at the current stage of the cycle would represent poor timing. But airline industry investors must have realised by now that unpredictability is its only certainty.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Africans abandon reserve on gold hedging - Miners have made more forward sales than many thought UNTIL RECENTLY South African mining houses had an almost theological view of gold. There was no such thing as a pricing policy - you were simply expected to believe in the metal and the price would inevitably rise. In the words of one industry newcomer: 'You were supposed to leave the marketing to God'. In consequence, compared to North American and Australian producers, South Africans remain novices at gold hedging. They have, however, progressed well beyond theology as was revealed in a blast of glasnost last week when producers, celebrating the recent rise in the metal price, stumbled over each other in the rush to release details of their forward positions. Anglo American, the world's largest producer, released details of its forwards sales for the first time, as did its associate Johannesburg Consolidated Investments. Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group, also offered more detail than in the past about its forward sales strategy. The picture that emerges is that South Africa is selling forward more gold than many thought: in the year to June 1994, about 173kg (the figure is not precise as Randgold does not publicise the extent of its forward sales) or 28 per cent of production, which is on course for about 617 tonnes in 1993. The broad picture, however, disguises some significant divergences between the different mining houses in terms of strategy. Some are clear winners and some equally obvious losers, with the associated rewards and penalties considerable. A variety of reasons were put forward for the improved disclosure. Foremost among these was shareholder pressure, cited both by Mr Kennedy Maxwell at JCI and Mr Gary Maude at Gengold. Mr Maxwell said that with the recent reversal in the price trend, investors were very anxious to know the extent to which various mines were exposed to the spot price. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo's gold and uranium division, cited two different reasons: that the company had achieved the aims of its hedging policy; and that it was no longer active in the market (and hadn't been since April). The aim of the policy, said Mr Sunter, was to keep marginal mining areas at full production. That the policy has worked is illustrated by the fact that Anglo is producing more gold than three years ago, while its workforce has shrunk by only 7,000 out of a total of 180,000, the sort of social commitment the group is anxious to make. According to Mr Sunter, Anglo's hedging policies secured 110 tonnes of annual production, worth R4.4bn at present prices, saving 70,000 jobs in the process. About 50 tonnes of this comes from marginal areas and the other 60 tonnes from major capital projects that the group was able to proceed with because hedging helped keep suitable tax shields in place. Others had even more basic reasons to hedge. Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, notes that they hedged in order to survive. He notes that in September 1992, most of the group's production was in the R26,000-R33,000 (Pounds 3,900-Pounds 4,900) a kilogram cost bracket compared with a price of R31,383 a kilogram. 'We had very, very good reasons to protect ourselves,' he says. 'We're hedging to stay in business, not to make extra income.' Hedging, of course, is a double-edged sword. The price of securing insurance against lower prices is missing out on the potential bonanza should prices rise sharply, as they have recently - from about R32,000 to R42,000 a kilogram in three months. Mr Maude is thus painfully aware that, at current gold prices, earlier hedging is actually denying them extra income. Gengold concedes, for example, that hedging depressed its profits in the June quarter by about a third compared with what they would have made receiving the spot price. Arguably those like Gengold - Randgold, the gold arm of the Rand Mines group, is another - who came fairly late to hedging have been doubly hurt. First, when cost pressures really started to weigh on the industry in about 1990, they missed out on the opportunity to lock in more favourable prices. Now, they find themselves having hedged large portions of their production at prices well below the present market level. The consequences of these decisions are considerable. While Anglo is able to boast about hedging helping to protect jobs, Gengold has seen its workforce shrink to 49,000 from 90,000 in 1989. At Harmony, the largest Randgold mine, the workforce is down to 14,500 from 29,000 three years ago. At the very least, had these groups pursued hedging earlier, it is likely their job losses would have been less and the financial state of their mines would probably have been better. That, however, is water under the bridge. What to do in future again presents agonising dilemmas, especially given the recent surge in the gold price. Excellent prices can be locked in now - R52,000 a kilogram for a sale two years out - but this has to be set against the possibility of a genuine bull market developing. All that can be said with certainty is that heated debates are under way in the various mining houses about appropriate strategy. Both Anglo and Gengold have said they have stopped selling forward, but will continue to watch the market for pricing opportunities. In terms of strategy, Mr Maude says Gengold will in future use hedging to provide insurance against downside in the price as opposed to merely securing survival. Hedging aside, one sure trend in the months ahead is that the mines will take the opportunity offered by the higher gold price to access more marginal ore bodies, saving the higher grade deposits against the return of tougher times. Development work at the mines will thus be increased vigorously to reach these lower grade ore bodies, allowing mines more production flexibility and ultimately prolonging their life expectancies. Mining lower grades, however, will push up unit costs and keep a damper on profit margins. But for mines that until recently were struggling to show any profit margin at all, that is the sort of problem they can live with.</p>

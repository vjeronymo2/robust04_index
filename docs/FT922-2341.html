			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP seeks publication of Imro report on Maxwell MR FRANK FIELD, the Labour MP who is leading the campaign for compensation for Maxwell pensioners, will today ask Mr John Major to publish a confidential report on the regulatory supervision of Maxwell companies. The secret report produced by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is critical of its own performance over the Maxwell affair and the professional advisers who were in a position to warn regulators. Mr Field, chairman of the select committee on social security which held hearings on the Maxwell affair, will deliver a letter to Downing Street today. The Imro report has already been sent to the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. The SIB and the Treasury, the government department responsible for City affairs, are anxious to see the document published but are concerned that parts of it may be libellous. The report criticises Imro's own failure to concentrate on companies of high risk. But it also points out that the trustees, directors and a range of professional advisers, including auditors, failed to alert regulators to irregularities dating as far back as two years before Mr Maxwell's death. Mr Field said his committee concluded that the auditors to the Maxwell pension schemes were in a better position than any professional adviser to spot irregularities. Liquidators are examining the audited report for the year to April 1990 of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned company which managed the pension funds of other Maxwell companies. That report notes a share-lending agreement between BIM and Lehman Brothers, the US-based investment house. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, BIM's auditor, said it acted properly in approving the accounts. Securities firms frequently borrow shares from institutional fund managers for very short periods in exchange for collateral and a commission. As required by Stock Exchange rules, the shares were lent through a licensed money broker, Shearson Lehman Equity Money Brokers. It was accompanied by a share lending agreement and Coopers confirmed that collateral was held. Coopers, however, said that the shares were lent for an indefinite period unlike most stock lending which is done for one day at a time. Coopers was auditor to all the Maxwell companies and pension funds, apart from the Liechtenstein trusts. To protect client confidentiality, it had four separate teams working on different parts of the Maxwell group. The firm said none of these teams communicated with one another. The last audit of the pension funds was for the period ending in April 1990. Most of the pension funds' eventual losses of Pounds 448m appear to have occurred after that date. The April 1990 audit report was not completed until April 1991. Coopers says the 12-month lag is within the timetable recommended by the Occupational Pensions Board and that pension fund accounts normally take longer than public company accounts to be finalised. The audit for the year to April 1991 never took place. Maxwell extended the audit period to December 1991, a gap of 21 months. Coopers says it pressed for interim accounts in July 1991 and complained that 21 months was too long a gap.</p>

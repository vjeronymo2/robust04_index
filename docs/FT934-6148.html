			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Top Thai broker is fined over Pounds 1m The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) yesterday fined Phatra Thanakit, a leading stockbroker which co-operates with SG Warburg on company research, a total of Baht 40m (Pounds 1.07m) for breaking exchange rules. SET officials said they thought that the fine was the largest imposed since the exchange was founded in 1975. Phatra Thanakit was guilty of automatically channelling a stock order from a sub-broker on to the market instead of re-keying the order on its own computers, the exchange said. The practice is believed to be common in Thailand, and the misdemeanour came to light only because the sub-broker, Peregrine Finance and Securities, mistakenly issued a sell order worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) for 200m shares in Ayudhya Investment and Trust (Aitco) instead of the 2,000 actually being sold by a client. Aitco only has 25m shares in issue, and 18m were sold before Phatra and the exchange were able to correct the mistake. The transactions were subsequently annulled by the exchange, saving Phatra from substantial losses. Phatra shares were suspended, and after the suspension was lifted yesterday the shares dropped almost to their 10 per cent limit, falling Baht 68 to Baht 636. Some rival stockbrokers said the fine was reasonably severe, amounting to more than 4 per cent of Phatra's Bt912m net profit in 1992. They noted it did not preclude further action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Others, however, criticised the exchange for cancelling the Aitco transactions. With trading volume sometimes exceeding Dollars 1bn a day, the Thai authorities have been attempting to improve regulation of the exchange.</p>

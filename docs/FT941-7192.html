			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Harcourt results disappoint investors Harcourt General, the US publishing, retailing and insurance group, yesterday posted a 29 per cent increase in operating earnings in its first quarter, thanks to improved performances by all its main businesses. However, net earnings of Dollars 19.9m, or 25 cents a share, fell well short of Wall Street's expectations of about 30 cents a share. The stock was marked down Dollars 1 1/8 on the news and closed at Dollars 34 5/8 for a loss of Dollars 1 3/4 on the day. The 1994 results compared with net earnings of Dollars 31.8m, or 40 cents, in the three months to January 31 1993. When earnings from Harcourt's discounted cinema operations are excluded from the year-earlier figures, profits were Dollars 26.8m, or 34 cents, including a one-time pre-tax gain of Dollars 20.6m related to a legal settlement. Consolidated revenues from continuing operations increased 3.1 per cent to Dollars 832m, from Dollars 806m. Most of the growth came from Harcourt's specialty retailing operations, which include a 65 per cent stake in the Neiman Marcus department store group. Sales by the division - Harcourt's largest - climbed 5.8 per cent to Dollars 507m, from Dollars 479m a year earlier. By contrast, revenues from its insurance arm fell to Dollars 128m, against Dollars 138m a year ago.</p>

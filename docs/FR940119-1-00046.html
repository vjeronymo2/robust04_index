Specifically, the agency is considering issuing a proposal to establish requirements for the use of retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors for certain trailers manufactured prior to December 1, 1993, the effective date of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's final rule on conspicuity for newly manufactured trailers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before March 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;94&hyph;1, room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.

Manufacturers of retroreflective sheeting or reflectors are required to certify compliance of their product with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108) whether the product is for use as original or as replacement equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NHTSA first requested comments concerning the use of reflective material to make heavy vehicles more visible on May 27, 1980 (45 FR 35405). Forty-two comments were received, most of which favored the concept. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Between 1980 and 1985, the NHTSA conducted a fleet study in which retroreflective material was placed on van-trailer combinations in a manner designed to increase their conspicuity during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility. The treatment of trailers consisted of outlining the rear perimeter, and delineating the lower side. No reflectorized mud flaps were used. The study concluded that truck-trailer combinations equipped with this material were involved in 15 percent fewer crashes (in which a trailer was struck in the side or rear) than combinations lacking the material. A copy of the report, ``Improved Commercial Vehicle Conspicuity and Signalling Systems_Task III Field Test Evaluation of Vehicle Reflectorization Effectiveness,'' September 1985 (DOT HS 806 923) is included in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 18, 1987 (52 FR 35345), the NHTSA published a notice of request for comments. The notice presented results of NHTSA's fleet study and sought comments on the test results as well as experiences motor carriers may have had with the use of reflective material to enhance conspicuity. Thirty-seven comments were received, most agreeing that a 15 percent reduction in accidents could be expected when all large vehicles were so equipped with reflective material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990 (sec. 15, Pub. L. 101&hyph;500, 104 Stat. 1218), the Congress included a provision directing the Secretary of Transportation ``to initiate a rulemaking proceeding on the need to adopt methods for making trucks or any category of trucks more visible to motorists *&blank;*&blank;*'' not later than February 3, 1991, and to complete the rulemaking proceeding not later than November 3, 1992. On December 4, 1991, the NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 63474. The NHTSA regarded its NPRM as responsive to the congressional mandate and the final rule as the completion of the rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the issuance of the final rule, the NHTSA published the results of additional research on heavy vehicle conspicuity. The purpose of the research program was to define a range of minimally acceptable large vehicle conspicuity enhancements that could be used as a basis for revised Federal regulations. A number of laboratory and field studies were carried out to assess the value of using a pattern in the marking material, the form the pattern should take, the placement of the treatment on the trailer, the effect of retroreflective markings on the detection and identification of stop and turn signals, and the trade-off between the width and retroreflective intensity of the treatment material. In addition, field surveys were conducted to assess the effect of environmental dirt on the performance of the marking systems and the durability of retroreflective materials when used on trucks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

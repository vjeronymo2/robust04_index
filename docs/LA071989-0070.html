			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED CROSS HELP IN EMERGENCIES  </P> <P> The American Red Cross is the nation's official volunteer disaster relief  organization. It responds to disasters of all types to help mitigate the  suffering of those affected.  </P> <P> The East San Gabriel Valley Chapter did just that July 3, when fire raced  through the canyons of Hacienda Heights, destroying homes and causing families  to flee. Trained disaster workers, some volunteers, some paid staff, worked  around the clock to provide emergency assistance to these families.  </P> <P> A shelter was opened at Los Altos High School and approximately 2,000 meals  were served for disaster victims and emergency workers. When the fire was out,  additional immediate assistance was offered to those who needed it, including  food, temporary housing, clothing, medical aid, information and referral to  government agencies that can give further assistance.  </P> <P> Many smaller Red Cross chapters, such as the East San Gabriel Valley chapter,  may have limited financial and human resources, however, no disaster is too  large for them to handle. This is because they can, at any time, call upon the  resources of the entire organization and their community.  </P> <P> I'm pleased to say that our neighboring chapters assisted us, and that the  involvement of the community in supporting us was outstanding. We wish to thank  them for this help.  </P> <P> All American Red Cross disaster assistance is an outright gift, made possible  by voluntary contributions for the American people. And, the East San Gabriel  Valley Chapter will continue to assist those affected by the Hacienda Heights  fire as long as our help is needed.  </P> <P> THOMAS HARTSOCK  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> East San Gabriel Valley Chapter  </P> <P> American Red Cross  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Where attendance levels focus on the freebies Diverting corporate history is not always uppermost in the minds of those regular attenders of annual meetings. As one seasoned organiser said: 'The bulk are there for the love of the sound of their own voice, or a free sandwich.' The AGM is like a class reunion, particularly for the retired employees who attend. While there may be colourful speeches and aggressive questioning, the emphasis remains primarily on presentation and consumption. In some cases, the actual purpose is lost. One listed company had large attendances for several years, attracted by a buffet and drinks. But last year, directors were faced with an almost empty auditorium, after the registrars decided to check on arrivals and found that genuine shareholders were a significant minority. 'You can usually gauge the attendance level of an AGM by the size of the lunch or the gifts', said one cynical PR executive. However, there are changes afoot. The recession has affected the quality of free gifts, such as key rings and pens, at the same time as it has hit corporate confidence. In post-Cadbury Britain, shareholders are therefore taking the formal portion of the meeting more seriously. Troubled industrial giants, such as British Aerospace and Trafalgar House, have attracted crowds out of proportion to their hospitality, reflecting concern over chequered management performance. 'The question and answer sessions are getting longer, and while AGM's are getting more stagey, there are fewer shareholders coming along just for the vol-au-vents and Chablis,' said Mr Stuart Bell, research director at Pensions and Investment Research Consultants. Shareholders at the recent Lonrho and BAe AGM's managed to lead a vociferous and coherent opposition to management policy. But since the power of small shareholders is limited - proxy votes vastly outstripped attempted people power at Lonrho and BAe - such drama is generally only the icing, and attention is more focused on the quality of the cake. For these regulars, 60 seconds on the microphone, a glass of wine, and a gift of a pen or a food pack, must remain sufficient justification for their annual trip to the corporate pantomime. Food and drink-related companies therefore remain the traditional crowd-pullers. Guinness, for example, has created a popular formula of plenty of good food, followed by a pack of goodies in a black velvet bag. At last year's Tomkins AGM, the mass of shareholders were less inclined to question management on its running of the Ranks Hovis McDougall business, and more focused on Ranks' legendary annual gift packs. The true test for the cynics will be the Tomkins turn-out in September. The company decided last year that it should be delivering earnings per share rather than RHM hand-out's, and it gave out nothing. It is quite possible that the smaller shareholders will disagree.</p>

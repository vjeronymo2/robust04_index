			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Israeli right sees no change on settlements EXTREME right-wing members of the Israeli government said yesterday Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, had promised them he would not compromise on Jewish settlement of the occupied territories, despite Washington's protests that continued settlement could upset its Middle East peace effort. Meanwhile Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, head of the prime minister's office, said the government would not accept any Palestinian from Jerusalem in a Palestinian delegation to talks and opposed extending the role of a proposed regional peace conference beyond an opening function for later bilateral negotiations. Both issues - along with settlements - are among the obstacles to convening Arab-Israeli talks that Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, will seek to overcome when he returns to Israel today for further talks. Mr Shamir met the Tehiya party, a three-member faction in the coalition led by the Likud party, and a group of settlers to discuss their concerns. Ms Geula Cohen, a Tehiya junior minister, said afterwards Mr Shamir had 'promised that settlement will not be harmed'. Ending Jewish settlement of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is a key demand of Palestinians and other potential Arab peace conference participants. But Mr Shamir's government has repeatedly vowed that it should continue. Yesterday, opposition politicians published a report they said showed mortgage subsidies beyond those available in Israel proper were on offer to settlers to encourage faster settlement.</p>

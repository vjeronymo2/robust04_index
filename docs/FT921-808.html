			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Tootal helps Coats Viyella lift profits THE RAPID integration by Coats Viyella, the textiles company, of Tootal, the rival acquired last May after an acrimonious takeover battle, has helped Coats improve 1991 pre-tax profits by 10 per cent to Pounds 111.4m. However, net borrowings at the year end jumped to Pounds 264m from Pounds 91.4m, largely as a result of the acquisition. The performance of Tootal enhanced earnings slightly. Market shares in thread, Tootal's largest business, also improved. 'We waited a long time to get Tootal. It has been a good merger,' said Sir David Alliance, chairman. Coats has changed its accounting practices to conform to new and proposed accounting rules. It restated its 1990 figures as if they had followed the same rules as used in the 1991 figures. Extraordinary costs of Pounds 3.6m in 1990 were restated as exceptional costs, depressing some 1990 figures. Earnings per share in 1991 were 10.4p, compared with 8.9p on a restated basis but 9.6p as published a year ago. The dividend is maintained at 7p for the whole year. The shares rose 9p to 189p. Thread, Coats' biggest operation, saw both turnover and margins improve. The addition of Tootal doubled the industrial thread business and contributed to sales for the whole thread operation of Pounds 840m, up from Pounds 729m, with margins improving from 7.9 to 8.7 per cent. Fashion retailing, including the Jaeger and Viyella brands, suffered badly. 'We went for sales at the expense of margin,' said Mr Neville Bain, the chief executive. Margins fell from 7 per cent in 1990 to 2.9 per cent. Branded menswear, including Van Heusen shirts, had a bad year. However, improvements elsewhere, such as in uniforms during the Gulf war and hosiery, pushed clothing turnover to Pounds 350.5m, from Pounds 300.5m, at a margin of 4.8 per cent, up from 4.6 per cent. Sales of homewares such as Youghal carpets and Dorma bedware were flat. Sales in the Dynacast precision engineering operation fell to Pounds 104.7, from Pounds 111.7m, because of a poor performance in Brazil and the weakness of the North American car industry.

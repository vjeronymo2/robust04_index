			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / US group may buy Ulster engineer A big US company may be about to buy FG Wilson (Engineering), the Larne-based company which is Europe's largest producer of diesel sets used for generating electricity. Privately-held Wilson, one of Northern Ireland's most successful engineering companies, confirmed yesterday that its directors were in discussions with a 'major American corporation' which had approached it. Wilson would not name the suitor and said talks were at a preliminary stage. It expected to make a further statement by today. Last night, there was strong speculation that Emerson Electric, the US electrical and electronics product group, would launch a bid for Wilson. A spokesman for Emerson said he had no information on any bid. If Wilson is taken over, it would be the second purchase this week of an independent UK producer of generating sets. Cummins Engine, the US diesel engine group, is buying Sandwich, Kent-based Power Group International, best known for its Petbow, Auto Diesel and Agreba brands. A substantial investment in Wilson would be a major coup for a company wishing to enter the fast-growing market for diesel generating sets. The Larne company was founded in 1966, and has grown to achieve annual sales of more than Pounds 160m and export markets in 120 countries. It employs about 1,000 people, most of them at Larne. It recently moved into an old GEC factory there, consolidating manufacturing which used to take place at five separate facilities. A link-up with a company such as Emerson, one of the best-known names in the world electrical products industry, could give Wilson access to a wider distribution network. Other names mentioned as possible bidders included Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment company, which also has a power generation business. At Cummins, Mr James Henderson, president and chief executive, said PGI fit 'right into our product diversification strategy and our goal to achieve profitable growth in global markets'. Terms were not disclosed, but Cummins said PGI was profitable and had sales last year of Pounds 59m. It has plants in the UK and Singapore producing generators ranging from 20KW to 3MW and more than 400 employees.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Serov] </F>   [Text] London June 23 TASS -- Great Britain has called upon  the Latvian leadership to reconsider "restrictive" clauses in  its draft citizenship law, taking into consideration the  recommendations made by the CSCE (Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe) and the Council of Europe, a British  Foreign Office spokesman said today, commenting upon the Russian  Foreign Ministry statement issued on Wednesday [22 June], which  condemns the aforesaid act as discriminatory.    The British Foreign Office understands the complexity  experienced by Latvia in search of a solution to the question  about the future status of the people, who are not citizens of  the republic. But it regards that the integration of the ethnic  minorities constitutes an important prerequisite for ensuring  long-term stability in the region, and therefore, expresses  concern over some of the aspects of the draft citiznship law,  which was adopted after its third reading in the parliament on  June 21, the British Foreign Office spokesman indicated.</p>

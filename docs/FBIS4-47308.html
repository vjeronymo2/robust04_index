			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. G. Sukhov, Institute of Control Problems, </F> Moscow; UDC 681.3:61]    [Abstract] Computer tomography problems place high demands  on computing equipment. Regularization methods must be used;  consequently, matrix algorithms must first be developed.  Cellular methods may be advantageously used to solve large  linear algebra problems on parallel computers by recursively  decomposing the matrix problem and taking advantage of computer  features. This paper studies the applicability of cellular  methods in two-dimensional linear computer tomography. The image  is represented by a square symmetric matrix of order  n, which determines the resolution. A  cellular-triangular SIMD computer with numerous processor  modules with a small amount of local memory and a moderate  amount of common memory may be used to solve the problem. The  entire system can be controlled with a single program in special  computer memory. Another way of solving the problem is to invoke  control from a host machine, typically a PC. The first solution  is suitable for tomography, the second for design work.  References 5 (Russian).</p>

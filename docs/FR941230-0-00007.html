The purpose of these interim regulations is to reduce the cost of administering the FEHB enrollments of enrollees who make payments directly rather than through payroll or annuity deductions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These interim regulations are effective January 30, 1995.

However, in some cases enrollees may make direct payments. These include: (1) certain annuitants and compensationers (individuals who are entitled to compensation from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs based on a job-related injury or disease) whose annuity or compensation has been waived or suspended; (2) former spouses whose enrollment is based on a qualifying court order under subpart H of 5 CFR part 890 governing FEHB; and (3) former employees, former spouses, and children enrolled under the Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulations governing these direct pay situations require that if the employing office does not receive the payment by the due date, it must notify the enrollee by certified mail, return receipt requested, that continuation of coverage rests upon payment being made within 15 days after receipt of the notice. (The regulations affecting former spouses with qualifying court orders and TCC enrollees allow 45 days for enrollees living overseas.) The TCC regulations further provide that, if the return receipt is not received, termination occurs 60 days after the date of the notice (90 days for overseas enrollees). All terminations are retroactive to the last day for which the enrollee made payment. Enrollments terminated for nonpayment of premiums cannot be reinstated unless the enrollee shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the payment on time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the return receipt was to make certain that the enrollee was aware that the employing office had not received the payment and the consequences of nonpayment. Because of the high cost of certified mail, return receipt requested, ($2.29 per notice) OPM has reevaluated the need for this requirement and has determined that the value of the return receipt does not justify the cost. The absence of subsequent payments during the 60- to 90-day delay before termination of the enrollment makes it clear that the initial failure to make the payment was not a simple oversight or loss of the payment in the mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the interim regulations will be much more convenient for enrollees. Under current regulations someone must sign for the notice. If no one is at home when the letter carrier arrives to deliver the return-receipt-requested letter, the enrollee must go to the post office to sign for it. Under the interim regulations, the letter will be left in the enrollee's mailbox and the enrollee will have the necessary information without making a trip to the post office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

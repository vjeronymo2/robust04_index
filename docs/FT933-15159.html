			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Leaders react to changing agenda THE G7 leaders left the summit with an economic agenda markedly different from their gatherings in the 1980s. In the 1980s the enemy was inflation. In Tokyo their main economic concern was structural unemployment. To promote long-term growth they will seek to co-operate in reforming labour markets, social security and health care systems. In the 1980s their main focus was co-ordinating their fiscal and exchange rate policies to promote growth. There has also been a marked change of tone. Deregulation to liberalise markets is no longer the overriding goal. The finance ministers' report recommended action to promote training, control health care spending and to limit the risks of financial deregulation. They even said there was a place for incomes policies. President Bill Clinton's idea of a jobs summit was warmly welcomed. Ms Kim Campbell, the Canadian prime minister, enthused: 'It will be a think-tank of experts to generate ideas about problems of employment in post-industrial societies. These are problems we all face.' Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, echoed Mr Clinton's observation that 'old economic equations' were being broken by new production technologies. Mr Ciampi said: 'The enterprise system in industrialised societies is being changed by new ways of combining labour and capital, which requires our workforces to adjust to the future.' But the summiteers' concerns extended beyond unemployment, to its consequences for social security and health care. There was a consensus that in these areas reforms were needed to cut costs, and possibly to narrow entitlements, without damaging basic services. Mr Clinton explained: 'The French economy in the 1980s was very strong in every sphere but unemployment. Even when they were chugging along with high growth they could not get unemployment down below 9.5 per cent. All these countries in Europe are facing low population growth, an ageing population, and within 10 years they will have only two people working for every person who is retired.' Mr Ciampi put the consequences this way: 'We all have to spend less by spending money better. There is widespread concern in Italy about the cost of health care and pensions.' Ms Campbell remarked: 'Canada has the second highest health care costs in the G7. We should consider the side effects of the way we deliver health care without reducing services.' Japan has low unemployment, but it faces a rapidly ageing population and very low growth in its workforce. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, implied the consequences for government finances could be sweeping: 'We are facing a turning point. We shall soon have to review the tax system as a whole.' The political implications of the need for structural reform were drawn out by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor. He explained that the German and US plans to reduce their federal fiscal deficits had set a new standard for consolidating public finances which others, such as Britain, would have to follow.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (4): Adjustment abandoned - Nigeria SUCCESSFUL structural adjustment in Nigeria, the region's second largest economy after South Africa and its most populous nation, would have created the positive demonstration effect the continent needs so desperately. But it was not to be. A year after seizing power, in August 1985, General Babangida's military administration launched a bold reform, unpopularly known as SAP (Structural Adjustment Programme). The naira was devalued 66 per cent, import licensing was abolished, tariffs were partially restructured, most prices were deregulated, a privatisation programme was launched and monetary reforms introduced. But the follow-through was weak; within 18 months, growing public opposition to some of the measures, spearheaded by those who had lost their preferential access to foreign currency, import licences and other 'rents', forced the government to back down. With hindsight, the reflationary 1988 budget can be said to have marked the end of effective reform. Nigeria's IMF programme began to collapse, and by mid-1993 the country's arrears on external debt and trade payments were put at more than Dollars 6bn. If failure could be attributed to a single factor, it would have to be the military's inability to control public spending. Substantial amounts of oil revenue - estimated at 200,000 barrels a day - were siphoned off into 'off-budget' accounts and never accounted for. Revenue-gathering efforts were stunted by the government's refusal to tax domestic fuel consumption realistically and by massive evasion of border taxes on imports. With a narrow revenue base substantially reliant on oil, the budget deficit over the SAP period from 1986 averaged 7.7 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in the pre-adjustment period. SAP had its positive aspects, notably a distinct culture change within Nigerian business: there is no support for a return to import licensing and direct controls. In agriculture, food crop production went up 60 per cent and export crops rose almost 45 per cent. Manufacturing saw strong growth in textiles, with output more than doubling during 1986-89, having fallen 40 per cent between 1981 and 1986. Privatisation fell short, with 68 parastatals being fully or partially privatised by 1992, compared with a target of 111 enterprises. One central lesson is that, even with a 'big bang' approach, as in 1986-87, adjustment cannot work unless the momentum of reform is maintained in several different key areas simultaneously. When it came to the crunch in 1988, the political will was not there, and the country is now in crisis.</p>

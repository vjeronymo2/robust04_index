			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has decided that  settlers who received orders restricting their movements or  administrative detention orders and have had their IDF weapons  taken away, will not serve in their reserve units and will not  be called up for reserve duty for the time being, the IDF  spokesman said tonight.    The parents of Eyal Moqed, one of the administrative  detainees, announced that they would demonstrate tonight outside  the Hasharon Prison demanding that their son be presented  immediately before a judge as is the practice in administrative  detentions cases of any Israeli citizen. Shmu'el Ben-Ishay of  Qiryat Arba', who was detained for three months under an  administrative order, is also incarcerated in Hasharon Prison,  and the High Court of Justice will consider the legality of his  detention this week.</p>

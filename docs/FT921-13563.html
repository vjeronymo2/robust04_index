			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: Brazil's sell-off gathers pace as field widens - The country's programme of two-a-month privatisations THE heads of Brazil's big state enterprises appear at last to be developing a taste for privatisation. The announcement last week that Embraer, the state aerospace company, would be privatised this year prompted a complaint from the president of Acominas, a state steel mill, that it would delay the sale of his company. Such a pro-privatisation attitude from within Brazil's enormous state machine shows how much feelings have changed since the programme's inauspicious beginning in September. It then faced a barrage of legal objections and violent protests attempting to block the sale of Usiminas, the continent's largest steel mill. The fact that Usiminas finally went under the hammer in late October is a tribute to the perseverance of Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National Development Bank (BNDES), who is co-ordinating the programme. Three months and 30 lawsuits on, he can now relax, having just completed his sixth sell-off and the first without any legal controversy. 'Privatisation has caught on,' he says. 'Had we not started with Usiminas, we'd still be having legal questions. As it was, we had to deal with them all in one go.' So confident is Mr Modiano of Brazil's new acceptance of privatisation, the government is issuing weekly decrees expanding the programme. Already 22 sales are scheduled for this year, including Embraer and Lloyd Brasileiro, the state aerospace and shipping companies, and Mr Modiano is working on the inclusion of ports and railway concessions. He has even dared mention the sale of Petrobras, one of the last bastions of nationalism. Although each of the companies sold so far has raised above the minimum price, financial targets have been radically reduced. Instead of the Dollars 18bn Mr Modiano was originally aiming at by the end of 1992, he hopes to raise Dollars 3.4bn this year to add to last year's Dollars 1.7bn. Even these figures are misleading as most purchasers are using government debt, swapped at par, even though creditors had long since thought it would never be honoured. The main problem is the almost complete lack of foreign interest, frightened off by the fiasco surrounding Usiminas. Mr Modiano says: 'The only solution is doing what we're doing - going ahead no matter what and eliminating disincentives to foreign capital.' Thus, though the limit on foreign capital remains at 40 per cent and the discount rate for external debt conversion at 25 per cent, shares no longer have to be held for two years and the money no longer has to stay in the country 12 years. The participation of Brazilian state pension funds in the auctions, which had led to fears of continuing state control, has been limited to 25 per cent. Although Mr Modiano admits Brazil's continuing economic volatility remains a deterrent, he believes one problem was that his first sales were in the steel sector which holds little attraction. He points out that the announcement of the sale of Embraer has already led to overseas enquiries. Once petrochemical companies go on sale in March, Mr Modiano says 'the tide will turn'. He achieved an important victory with the presidential decree forcing Petroquisa, the petrochemical arm of Petrobras, to sell all but 15 per cent of its share in each of the sector's companies. Petrobras directors had been lobbying hard to retain 33 per cent which, says Mr Modiano, shows, 'the interests of Petrobras are no longer necessarily the interests of the sector'. Although Mr Modiano would obviously relish the sale of Petrobras (requiring a constitutional revision), he says: 'I don't want to jeopardise the sale of the manufacturing sector by dwelling too much on this.' Benefits of privatisation are already obvious. Freed from state control and able to compete more aggressively, Usiminas has increased market share, which explains the sudden interest in privatisation from the president of Acominas. Mr Modiano admits that in some cases the eagerness is because state companies, many of which are loss-making, think they will get cash injections. But he warns: 'We will put no money in - we will not repeat 1987 when BNDES put Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn in the steel sector to prepare for privatisation and it just disappeared'. His team is hard at work, however, restructuring debt. The old state mentality is not yet dead. The Air Ministry wants the government to retain a golden share when it sells Embraer to ensure that supply to the Brazilian air force is not affected. Mr Modiano says 'if I do that, everyone will want one believing it is their last link to Treasury coffers'. He points out that when Celma, an aircraft-maintenance company was sold, the ministry had a list of 10 items they considered strategic, which he reduced to one. 'In the case of Embraer, they will probably have three pages of things, but they will get only limited and temporary protection.' For the privatisation of ports, Mr Modiano has found an unusual ally in the form of state governments. Brazilian ports are still governed by 1937 legislation which protects labour and results in costs which are among the highest worldwide. 'We first need to modernise the legislation or no one will buy,' he says. He also hopes to take advantage of a constitutional revision due next year to lobby for the privatisation of Telebras, the telecommunications company, which, he says, urgently needs new investment and 'could raise more than the entire manufacturing sector'. In the meantime, with an average of two sell-offs a month, he has plenty to occupy him.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FORTHCOMING PRIVATISATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company            Sector         Date  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indag              Fertiliser     January 23 Piratini           Steel          February 12 Goiasfertil        Fertiliser     February 19 Franave            Navigation     March 12 Petroflex          Petrochem      March 18 Enasa              Navigation     April Arafertil          Fertiliser     April Copesul            Petrochem      May 14 Tubarao            Steel          June Caraiba            Copper mining  June  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PRIVATISATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Embraer            Aerospace Cosipa             Steel CSN                Steel Acominas           Steel Lloyd Brasileiro   Navigation RFFSA*             Railways  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Expected to be announced  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source BNDES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

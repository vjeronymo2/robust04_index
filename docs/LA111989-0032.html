			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: CONSOLIDATORS OFFER CUTS IN ROOM RATES  </P> <P> Consolidators -- companies that sell low-fare air tickets and cruises -- also  deal with hotel rooms.  </P> <P> One such company is Hotel Connections, established in 1985 and based in  Petaluma, Calif. It offers discounts of $20 to $50 a night off regular room  rates at about 70 hotels in the United States. Some of the properties are part  of chains -- Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton and Radisson.  </P> <P> Another chain the company works with is Chatwal Inns, which has seven  properties in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Among the cities with participating hotels are San Francisco, San Diego,  Scottsdale, New York, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Denver, Orlando, Boston,  Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas. The discounts are available all year including  weekends, but there may be sold-out dates varying from property to property.  </P> <P> Reservations are made through a toll-free number to Hotel Connections, which  processes the information to the hotel. You get a confirmation number over the  phone, but no written confirmation. However, Hotel Connections reconfirms your  reservation a day before your arrival. Your initial reservation has to be made  at least 48 hours before arrival.  </P> <P> Payment must be made by credit card, with full payment required at the time of  booking. No refunds are available for cancellations or date changes, but Hotel  Connections will process a change of dates at no extra charge.  </P> <P> You can also call Hotel Connections to have a free brochure and rate sheet sent  to you that lists the regular rate, discount rate and amount of tax for  properties around the nation. Sold-out dates for each hotel are also listed.  The rates quoted are for single or double occupancy. This rate sheet is  upgraded quarterly.  </P> <P> You can also get a directory of the hotels working with Hotel Connections,  including details about their amenities.  </P> <P> There is no service charge this year, but Hotel Connections is planning to  start such a surcharge in 1990 that will probably be in the $7-$15 range per  transaction. The same $20-$50 range of discounts for rooms will be available  next year, according to a spokesman.  </P> <P> Contact Hotel Connections at 6 Petaluma Road North, Petaluma, Calif. 94952, or  call toll-free (800) 456-1969.

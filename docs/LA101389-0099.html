"I knew all along that I'd be a Spur."  </P> <P> The team did not announce terms of the agreement, but sources said the 6-foot-8  forward from Arizona would receive $1.8 million a year, or $9 million over five  years.  </P> <P> "The speculation has been extremely accurate," said Bob Woolf of Boston,  Elliott's attorney who negotiated the deal.  </P> <P> Elliott signed in time for the Spurs exhibition season opener Saturday against  Milwaukee in San Antonio. Asked if Elliott would play, Coach Larry Brown  laughed, "Until his tongue hangs out."  </P></p>

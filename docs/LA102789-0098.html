			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL NUNN MAKES A DEAL WITH LAS VEGAS HOTEL  </P> <P> Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, has  signed an exclusive multiyear contract with the new Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas,  The Times learned Thursday. A formal announcement is not expected for several  months.  </P> <P> Negotiations are under way for Nunn to fight at the Mirage for the first time  in January against Marlon Starling, World Boxing Council welterweight champion.  </P> <P> "I am not in a position to confirm or deny a deal with the Mirage," said Dan  Goossen, Nunn's manager. A spokesman for Steve Wynn, the hotel's principal  stockholder, confirmed only that talks have been held with Goossen.  </P> <P> Nunn, 34-0 with 23 knockouts, has not fought since retaining his title with a  decision over Iran Barkley in August. Bob Arum, Nunn's promoter, severed his  ties with Nunn and Goossen after the bout, claiming that the North Hollywood  fighter's lack of punching power makes him impossible to promote. Goossen later  said the split was over money.  </P> <P> The 3,000-room Mirage is expected to open late next month. The first fight in  its 16,000-seat arena will match Sugar Ray Leonard against Roberto Duran, for  the third time, on Dec. 7.  </P> <P> One source said Mirage officials want to delay an announcement regarding Nunn  to keep the spotlight on Leonard-Duran III.  </P> <P> Goossen said of Starling: "He's at the top of our list, but we have three other  options. We could fight Lindell Holmes or John Mugabi or wait until after Dec.  7.  </P> <P> "It's not written in stone that Ray will fight Tommy (Hearns) if he beats  Roberto. Should Roberto win, there is a possibility he could fight Michael.  Roberto could win in a fight with Ray. He has risen to that level before."  </P></p>

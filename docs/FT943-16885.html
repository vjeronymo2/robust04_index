			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Growers seen as unlikely to gain from coffee surge Smallholder farmers were unlikely to benefit from the explosive price rise in coffee futures this week, TransFair, a foundation securing Third World growers prices above world market levels said, reports Reuter from Cologne. 'Wholesalers continue to buy coffee from the small farms at the old rock-bottom prices,' claimed managing director Mr Dieter Overath. 'Farmers in countries such as Guatemala and Mexico don't even know of the Brazil frosts and the price rallies.' German consumers should therefore not assume that higher retail prices meant the Third World was doing any better. TransFair works through some 20 licensed roasters who have launched their own Third World brans, charging the consumer Dm2 to Dm3 (80p to 122p) per 500 grammes than ordinary brands cost. When the New York price is below 165 cents a pound the difference between this level and world market prices is passed on to approved businesses. Nearby New York coffee futures were close to 190 cents a pound yesterday, but distant positions were closer to 160 cents. TransFair pays the extra sums to family businesses, co-operatives and infrastructure projects in coffee growing regions. It said its system was securing the long term survival of the coffee trade by offering long-term contracts and forward credits of up to 60 per cent of sales values. TransFair has a less than 1 per cent share of the German coffee market but expects further growth from public sector catering institutions.</p>

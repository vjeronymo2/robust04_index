			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share options for the not so rich Sir, May I correct the impression given in your column 'Labour names share option 'millionaires' ' (August 19) that the discretionary options scheme used for executives is different from that for other employees. There is a single scheme under the 1984 Finance Act which covers all employees, whether executives or not. In practice it has been used mainly for executives and has become popularly known as a result as the 'executive share option scheme'. This however is a misnomer and there is a current trend (Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, is an example) towards using the option scheme for large numbers of employees.

By requesting an in-depth reassessment of ``all financial,  legal, and social aspects of the installation,'' opponents are  hitting the right target. It no longer is a matter of  criticizing security alone. Even the danger posed by the fires  caused by leaked sodium, which were very difficult to control,  was played down in the expert report.    It is now up to the politicians to decide whether or not to  continue the development of this technology, which, as everybody  agrees, will not be economically viable for several decades.  One kW/h produced by the Super-Phoenix prototype is 2.3 times  more expensive than 1 kW/h generated by a conventional nuclear  power station. This fact, together with the collapse of the  uranium market and the freeze in nuclear programs, seems to  argue against the construction of a superbreeder reactor network.    So, should we halt this program for good? This would cost us  a little fortune, both for decommissioning the reactor and for  indemnifying France's [foreign] partners. Should we opt,  instead, to continue this program and try to make a little  profit out of the installation by having it generate kW/h and  incinerate small quantities of waste? The latter solution would  keep the research teams busy and enable us to keep current of  developments in this technology should it one day become  econmomically viable.    Pending this decision, the reactor operator and the  political  authorities are working on the financial figures. Super-Phoenix  required an investment of 27.7 billion French francs [Fr]  (current francs), including Fr7.65 billion in intercalated  interests [interets intercalaires]. Moreover, the superbreeder  reactor costs more when it is idle (Fr750 to 800 million per  year) than when it is operating normally (Fr650 million).  However, this has to be weighed against the political pressure  emanating from ecological groups, for whom Superphenix has  become the symbol of the nuclear danger that has to be  eradicated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Renato Constantino, organizer of conference </F> on East Timor in Manila, by TEMPO correspondent Yuli Ismartono  -- date not given]    [Text] [Ismartono] How did the idea to hold the conference  on East Timor first begin?    [Constantino] The idea to hold the conference was first  hatched in Bangkok two years ago, namely during a conference  called the People's Plan for the 21st Century [six preceding  words in English], which was attended by hundreds of  nongovernmental organizations from several countries. I must  admit that it was [East Timor leader opposed to Indonesia] Ramos  Horta's idea to hold the conference, but we are the organizers  who prepared the agenda.    [Ismartono] Why do most of the participants belong to the  Fretilin [Revolutionary Front of an Independent East Timor]  group, who are against East Timor integration into Indonesia?    [Constantino] We have invited delegates from all political  groups and made efforts to ensure that the conference will be  attended by all sides, including the East Timorese who hold  different political views. Among these people, there are two  persons who were recently allowed by the Indonesian Government  to return to Dili to visit their families. These people are  certainly not Horta's friends.    Indeed, we have been accused of trying to discredit the  Indonesian Government, but the allegation is not true. I made  the preparations for the conference in an open manner. Last  April, I held three-hour talks on the matter with officials of  the Indonesian Embassy in Manila. We also invited them to send  their representatives to the conference so they can also voice  their views.    [Ismartono] What are the objectives of the conference?    [Constantino] The conference is aimed at turning attention  to the East Timor issue from a government forum to a people's  forum. We especially want to look at the human rights issue in  East Timor. That is why we have invited various nongovernmental  organizations. We also want to give a chance to all parties  involved in the East Timor issue to voice their views in an  academic atmosphere devoid of government threat or influence.  Among the ASEAN countries, I believe only the Philippines can  provide such an atmosphere.    [Ismartono] Has the Philippine Government ever tried to  force  you to cancel the conference?    [Constantino] Government officials have contacted us since  last November, but they never tried to scuttle the conference  and they only urged us to watch our step. As you know,  preventing us from holding the meeting and voicing our views is  against the Philippine Constitution. The Manila government is  not stupid. They are only anxious to see that the conference  should not be a one- sided affair with one party being put on  the defensive. To counter this, I told them that we would  invite officials from the Indonesian Embassy in Manila as well  as government officials from Jakarta to ensure that the  conference would be fully represented.    [Ismartono] Have you done this?    [Constantino] Not yet. When I made this proposal, Philippine  officials became increasingly worried because they thought it  would make things more complicated. Therefore, I decided not to  extend the invitation to the Indonesian officials.    [Ismartono] Did you ever consider the impact of the  conference on Indonesia-Philippines ties?    [Constantino] You mean bilateral relations will be strained?  Well, it cannot be helped, but I hope that will not happen.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Restructuring looms for Japan car makers FALLING profits, output and exports mean that Japan's motor industry may not be able to escape the structural shake-outs which have already affected western car makers, according to a new study from the Economist Intelligence Unit, writes John Griffiths. After a decade of what the report* describes as rampant growth, when Japan's new car market rose by 80 per cent and car output by nearly one-half, 'the 1990s are shaping up to be a period, at best, of consolidation and restructuring to take account of the major new restraints with which the sector is confronted.' For the first time since 1984 Japan's new car market is shrinking, accompanied by spiralling production costs and sever labour shortages. There has been a sharp decline in profitability, with the smaller, most vulnerable producers falling into losses. The Japanese industry's problems are seen as being not only domestic. The report warns that the resurgence of protectionist sentiment in the US could have knock-on effects in Japanese manufacturers' North American plants, many of which are operating at below break-even and facing the prospect of over-capacity.

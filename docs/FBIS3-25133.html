The statement said the defense minister's utterances are far  from the actual situation in Somalia. This is not the first  time the Italian defense minister has issued such  disinformation. The statement said it is unfortunate that such  remarks should be made by an Italian senior minister, adding  that it is an issue that could seriously dent the excellent  bilateral relations and cooperation existing between the two  nations.    The statement said it has become a habit of senior Italian  officials to make misleading statements about Somalia with the  deliberate intention of painting a negative picture of the  prevailing situation in Somalia. The statement said the remarks  made by the Italian defense minister are unfortunate,  misleading, and made without proper research on the subject.    The statement said the recent confrontation that took place  in Balcad, Shabeelaha Dhexe region, was caused by an intentional  provocation by the Italian soldiers, which led to deaths and  injuries on both sides. The statement said the Government of  Somalia is optimistic that, in the future, Italian leaders will  consult their representative in Somalia before uttering  misleading statements that could cause disinformation about a  particular incident. It warned Italian officers against  dramatizing minor incidents as well as avoiding matters that  might trigger provocation between Italian soldiers and the local  people. The statement advised Italian soldiers and officers to  carry out their duties in accordance with the UN Operation in  Somalia mandate.</p>

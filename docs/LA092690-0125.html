			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> C. RUSSELL COOK PARK EXPANDED BY 4 ACRES  </P> <P> City-owned C. Russell Cook Park was expanded by nearly 4 acres recently when a  previously fenced-off area was opened for use as soccer fields.  </P> <P> The park, which consists of three parcels along Calle Arroyo adjoining San Juan  Creek, now covers 19 acres. It was named for a civic activist who founded the  Fire Department.  </P> <P> Ron Sievers, director of public lands, said the park size will increase. "As  money from local development becomes available, we'll use it to prepare more of  the parkland in the area."  </P></p>

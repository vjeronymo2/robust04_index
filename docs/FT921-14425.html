			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Thames Water pays Pounds 59m for US and German acquisitions THAMES WATER, the largest of the UK's privatised water companies, is strengthening its environmental engineering activities with the acquisition of a German engineering design and contracting business and a US manufacturer of municipal water treatment products for a total consideration of just under Pounds 59m. Thames, which has been one of the most aggressive groups among the privatised water companies in diversifying out of its core regulated water business, is acquiring Mitteldeutsche Wasser-und Umwelttechnik AG Halle (UTAG), and FBL Holdings (Leopold), based in Pittsburgh. The acquisitions, among the largest foreign purchases to date by water companies since privatisation, will bring Thames's non-water business turnover up to Pounds 250m. The deals will give Thames possibly the highest proportion of unregulated earnings among the privatised water companies. Mr Mike Hoffman, chief executive, said that the acquisition of UTAG, was a strategic move that would enable the group to strengthen its presence in continental Europe. Germany, in particular among European markets, provided a significant opportunity as investments totalling up to DM10bn (Pounds 3.5bn) per year were expected to be made over the next ten years to bring eastern Germany's water supply and waste water standards up to EC levels. It would also position Thames to move further into both eastern and western European markets. The group won a strongly-contested battle to take over UTAG from the Treuhand agency. It put in the highest bid at Pounds 33m and has pledged to retain 935 jobs which, together with investments, will bring additional investment in the German company to about DM20m, according to Mr David Luffrum, finance director. UTAG has annual sales of DM131m. The acquisition of Leopold for Dollars 44m (Pounds 25.9m) will strengthen Thames's presence in the US. Leopold's experience in the municipal sector will complement Thames's operations through LA Water Treatment in the US industrial water treatment market as well as provide an important route for distributing group products in the US. LA Water Treatment is expected to achieve turnover of about Pounds 10m while Leopold's for the year to end-May is expected to be about Dollars 30m.</p>

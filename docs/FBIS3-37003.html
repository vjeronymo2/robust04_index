			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- Russia is proposing that the UN  Security Council [UNSC] be immediately convened to examine  practical ways for the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the  introduction of UN administration there. This was stated at a  briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department.    He said that "Russia proposes that this session be made open  for the participation in the discussion not only of Security  Council members but also other interested countries, especially  those whose interests are in Bosnia and Herzegovina."    The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the NATO  Council had adopted a statement on the problem of the Bosnian  crisis. In it the Council urged all the sides -- Serbs and  Muslims -- to urgently place their heavy armaments in the  Sarajevo region under UN control or to remove them from the  area. Essentially, this is close to the position taken by  Russia that has more than once come out with an initiative for  the urgent demilitarization of Sarajevo and the imposition of UN  administrative control in that city. In Grigoriy Karasin's  opinion, such measures would be a most important step toward a  settlement of the Bosnian conflict.    He expressed satisfaction that the NATO Council, like  Russia,  had reaffirmed its support for talks as the way to a settlement  of the conflict in Bosnia. It is precisely this path that  demands vigorous pressure on the part of the world community on  all the sides involved in the conflict.    Unfortunately, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman  believes, in the position of a number of NATO members one can  sense an attempt to interpret this pressure as a unilateral  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs by threatening them with air  strikes. The Russian Federation, Grigoriy Karasin stressed,  cannot agree with this unilateral approach.    "We are also convinced," the Russian diplomat said, "that it  is the Security Council that must adopt decisions on the problem  of lifting the siege of Sarajevo," as Russia proposed two weeks  ago. Unfortunately, Russia's proposal was not adopted. G.  Karasin said that at the same time, this problem had been put to  the NATO council which, as is known, has no authority to adopt  decisions on the matter of a Bosnian settlement. The UN  secretary general had earlier approached NATO with a proposal to  state the alliance's readiness to use aircraft if the United  Nations asks for it. A decision on such a request should be  adopted by the secretary general following consultations with  the Security Council members. This procedure, which has been  established by the Security Council, should be rigorously  followed, Grigoriy Karasin emphasized.    He noted that a few hours before the announcement of NATO's  decision, reports had come in that the Bosnian Serbs and  Muslims, through United Nations mediation, had reached agreement  on a cease- fire, and had agreed on specific measures for the  withdrawal of armaments from Sarajevo. "Hasty decisions outside  the framework of the United Nations carry the risk of wrecking  this encouraging process. Progress toward a settlement is  possible only if neither side gains advantage while the  demilitarization measures are being carried out by UN forces,"  the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.</p>

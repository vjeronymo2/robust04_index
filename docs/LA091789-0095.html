			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Philippine Supreme Court upheld a government decision barring former  President Ferdinand E. Marcos from returning to the Philippines. It voted 8 to  7 to dismiss a petition by Marcos seeking to return home. The court said  President Corazon Aquino "did not act arbitrarily or with grave abuse of  discretion" in barring Marcos' return as a "serious threat to the national  interest and welfare." Marcos, 72, has lived in exile in Hawaii since he was  overthrown in February, 1986, by an uprising that brought Aquino to power. He  has been hospitalized since January.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA  </P> <P> There's one thing we can do, other than just wring our hands over the China  holocaust, still in process. We can protect the students here.  </P> <P> Now they are being photographed, spied upon, tracked down and threatened by  undercover operatives of the ruling murderous junta. Retaliation is threatened  when these students return to China, and/or immediately against their families  now in China.  </P> <P> But the Chinese students and the Chinese-American community know these  infiltrators, and they can be apprehended and deported. The attempt to bring  the China wars into this country can be stopped at the water's edge.  </P> <P> Our laws are clear on the matter: The Chinese students (as well as all aliens)  enjoy the full protection of the U.S. Constitution while here. International  law is clear on the matter: Representatives of a foreign government have no  right to carry out acts of political repression in another country.  </P> <P> The slaughter of Beijing students was an expensive act. Expensive to China,  since it is consuming its bright children and since it has repudiated the  international cooperation that made the China miracle. And expensive to the  rest of us, since debts to the new China must now be written off, exploratory  plans torn up, and a new and fretful economic frontier established.  </P> <P> But better we should accept these minor inconveniences. Better nearly anything  but that China slip into the national psychosis that impelled Germany to  challenge the world 50 years ago. True, the unfolding drama as yet lacks a  credible Hitler among the ruling Chinese hard-liners. But we do have in George  Bush, ably seconded by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a credible  Neville Chamberlain for the necessary appeaser role. American outrage  transmitted through this mouthpiece becomes a squeak.  </P> <P> DAVID ALAN MUNRO  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

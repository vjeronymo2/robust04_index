			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Royal Doulton pleases City with upbeat sales outlook Royal Doulton shares rose 19p yesterday to 253p as the fine china manufacturer made its first profits announcement as an independently quoted company and revealed that sales were running at their highest levels for four years. This leaves the shares some 31 per cent higher than the initial quote price of 193p following the demerger in December from media conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times. Mr Stuart Lyons, chief executive, said the order book for the current year was 'satisfactory' after better than expected trading in December. The UK was showing particularly good growth, with an encouraging increase in the premium brands. A series of one-off costs as a result of the demerger forced Royal Doulton's 1993 pre-tax profits down from Pounds 3.89m to Pounds 3.04m for the year to December 31. The costs included a Pounds 1.9m loss on the sale of a stake in the Canadian newspaper group, The Financial Post, and a Pearson management charge of Pounds 2.35m. Further demerger costs came to Pounds 851,000. Pearson was also paid a special net dividend of Pounds 18.2m, which left Royal Doulton with a Pounds 5.7m advance corporation charge to be offset against tax on future UK profits. Mr Mark Burrell, non-executive chairman, said the underlying performance had been good. Cost cutting and tight control of working capital had helped operating profits to increase from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 11.6m on sales 10.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 222m. The sales increase had benefited from currency gains. At constant exchange rates, however, sales were still more than 5 per cent ahead. The company incurred losses in the Canadian retail business, continental Europe and a Japanese joint venture. However, steps had been taken to repair the losses and Royal Doulton was confident the Japanese division would return to profitability as the economy recovered. The group is to buy the outstanding joint venture stake in August for up to Pounds 5m. Royal Doulton announced a stronger than expected balance sheet, with net debt of Pounds 18.1m, including the ACT charge. This reflected strong cash generation and a Pounds 9m reduction in stocks to Pounds 79.2m. Gearing was 17 per cent against a pro forma 69 per cent. A single dividend of 3p is proposed. Losses emerged at 5p (earnings 14.2p), reflecting the demerger and non-recurring costs. After adjustment, earnings advanced from 9.2p to 10.6p.</p>

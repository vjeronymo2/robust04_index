			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World News in Brief: Police at English port find huge explosives cache British police found more than two tonnes of explosives hidden on a lorry which arrived at the northern English port of Heysham from Northern Ireland. Police said the explosives, found during a routine check, were believed to have been destined for a mainland bombing campaign. The discovery raised fears of a new wave of violence by the Irish Republican Army as it considers last December's Downing Street Declaration. It coincided with the annual Orange Day march by Northern Ireland's Protestants and a missile attack in Belfast on a British Army helicopter, which was forced to make an emergency landing.

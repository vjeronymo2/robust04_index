			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Uniform Federal Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have been working closely with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to ensure that this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the policy published by NSF in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be consistent, and will impose the same obligations on funding recipients. In addition, HHS has been working with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office Management and Budget, NSF, and other interested agencies to develop and propose a common Federal policy on investigator conflicts of interest. It is expected that this policy, when completed, will ensure consistent treatment of investigator conflicts issues by all Federal funding agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the statutes described above have necessitated some inconsistencies between these proposed regulations and the policy being published by the NSF. Unlike the NSF policy, there is no provision permitting institutions to waive the management, reduction, or elimination of an actual or potential conflicting interest when such action would be either ineffective or inequitable, and the potential negative impacts that might arise from the conflicting interest are outweighed by interests of scientific progress, technology transfer, or the public health and welfare. Because section 493A of the Public Health Service Act requires institutions conducting PHS-funded clinical research projects to manage or eliminate financial interests that would potentially bias the project, we do not believe HHS has the discretion to permit institutions to waive this requirement. Similarly, section 493A necessitates the requirements for institutional notification of the PHS Awarding Component in &sect;50.604(a)(7)(ii) and (8). In addition, the statute specifically requires the announcement, with each public presentation of the research, of a conflicting financial interest that was not managed, reduced, or eliminated, as set forth in &sect;50.606(d). This requirement is limited to PHS-funded clinical research projects, but the requirements of institutional notification to the PHS have not been so limited, because we believe that such notification serves a useful purpose for all PHS-funded research, and that disparate reporting requirements for different types of research would cause confusion and create burdens for the institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that ``management of a financial interest that could potentially bias a project'' may include recognition by the institution that a potential conflict exists, and monitoring progress of the research to insure that the financial interest does not bias the project. The Department specifically requests comment on whether this interpretation maximizes consistency between this NPRM and the NSF's final policy, in the light of the statutory distinctions discussed above. The Department seeks comment on whether this expansion of the statutory requirement is appropriate in the context of PHS-funded research and the need to minimize burden on institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Relationship to Other Laws <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many Institutions funded by the PHS Awarding Components are State Institutions whose employees are subject to State laws designed to prevent financial conflict of interest. The proposed rules would not supplant these requirements and are intended to be applied in addition to other applicable Federal and State restrictions related to potential financial conflicts of interest, including Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit trading in securities with knowledge of privileged or non-public information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide for enforcement remedies both against researchers that fail to comply with institutional policies issued under the regulation and Institutions that fail to comply with the regulation. The proposed rules specifically state that the requirements constitute a condition of award and as such could be enforced through the suspension or termination of a grant or cooperative agreement. A Termination for Convenience or a Stop Work Order could be issued in accordance with the FAR if a contractor fails to enforce the Special Standards. Each contractor would be required to meet the specified responsibility requirements prior to award of a contract. PHS awarding components will work diligently with applicants to resolve compliance problems informally, to avoid the need for formal enforcement action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

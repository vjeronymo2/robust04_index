			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: Getting our own back Sir, The building societies feel aggrieved and hold National Savings responsible for savers withdrawing funds from them. Strange that some societies seem to have ignored the fact that for some time they have persuaded savers to deposit funds with them, initially at competitive rates, only for savers to find shortly after that interest rates have been unilaterally reduced without them being informed. Could we be getting our own back? Herbert Haberberg, 9 Denewood, New Barnet, Herts EN5 1LX</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Poll fears mount MOUNTING concern about the Conservative party's electoral prospects and the weakness of sterling pushed rates still higher on the UK money market yesterday. Dealers said the market was realising that a Labour majority in the general election on April 9 could not now be ruled out, following the first opinion poll since the UK Budget, which showed Labour with a three-point lead. Another fall in sterling sparked worries that a base rate rise might not be out of the question at some point, and the gloom was increased by a rumour that a Sunday newspaper opinion poll would show Labour with a six-point lead. Interbank rates jumped up across the board, with the key three-month up 3/16 to 10 7/8 -10 3/4 . Even the one-week rate stood at 10 3/4 -10 1/2 per cent, while the one-year touched the 'big 11', at 11-10 7/8 per cent. The June sterling contract opened 13 basis points down at 89.22, and plummeted to around 89.09 after heavy selling. After initially forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.5bn, the Bank of England appeared to be trying to calm the market by offering to purchase any bills it was offered, including those in the longer bands 3 and 4 for the first time in more than a month. However, only Pounds 17m of band 3 and 4 bank bills were purchased in the early round, due to uncertainty about dealing rates. By midday, when the shortage was revised down slightly to Pounds 1,450m, the rates were established at 10 3/16 for band 3 and 10 5/32 for band 4. The Bank purchased a further Pounds 355m of bank and treasury bills in bands 1, 3 and 4, along with Pounds 7m bills for resale on March 30 at 10 7/16 per cent. It purchased a further Pounds 871m of bills in all four bands in the afternoon to take the day's operations to Pounds 1,243m, leaving the system still around Pounds 200m short. Overnight rates touched 18 per cent in the afternoon, and there was even talk of 20 per cent rates in the late scramble to get square before the weekend. German call money rates eased to 9.50/60 per cent from the 9.55/65 seen all week, as liquidity improved in the banking system. Dealers said heavy tax payments due this month had not yet begun leaving the system, but would put pressure on reserves early next week.</p>

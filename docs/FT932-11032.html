			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / People: Dorling Kindersley appoints in US Dorling Kindersley, the recently floated publisher of highly illustrated reference books, has appointed an American to become chief executive of its New York-based publishing subsidiary. John Sargent, 34, currently president and publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster's children's book division, will be responsible for both adult and children's lists and will report direct to the DK board in London. The UK group, long a successful licenser of books to other publishers in the US, began to publish there under the DK imprint in 1991, and the American publisher now accounts for about 18 per cent of group sales. This autumn it will publish 77 titles, including the American Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Gardening (the US version of the the UK's best-selling Royal Horticultural Encyclopedia).</p>

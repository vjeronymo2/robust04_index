In his opinion, the  published ratings of politicians in which Luzhkov ranks third as  a possible contender for the post of head of state "get on my  nerves. At the same time, after 50 years everyone knows their  own worth, and so do I. My philosophy, my goal, and the meaning  of my career is to do something useful for Moscow and win  people's respect in my job," the mayor of the capital said.    Yu. Luzhkov makes no secret of his concern over the recent  political amnesty, which, in his opinion, if it had to be  carried out at all, should not have happened before 9 May, since  the opposition's love of red-letter days is well-known.    And he is alarmed not so much by the release of the 10 main  organizers of the October bloodshed in Moscow as by the amnesty  for the "20,000 to 100,000 other criminals." Luzhkov believes  that a considerable number of them will head for the capital.  And he does not rule out the possibility that the former  Lefortovo inmates and amnestied criminals "have common interests  which money could help to bring closer together."    Luzhkov has no doubt that the opposition is well backed up  by  interested structures. "On 3-4 October the White House was  being supported by gunmen and the members of fascist  organizations. Big money was at work," he stated, referring to  information from the special services. In order to ensure that  the "victims" do not join forces to organize new unrest, the  mayor intends to develop necessary measures at a session of the  Moscow Anticrisis Committee.    Luzhkov is also disappointed about the fact that the  political amnesty has sown dissension and confusion among  law-enforcement workers. "MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]  staffers' ability to counteract the opposition is even weaker  today than it was 3-4 October," he believes. The fall in morale  is explained, in his opinion, by the fact that a considerable  number of militia workers now doubt whether it was right for  them to side with the president and the government. "It is as  if we are numbering law-enforcement staffers among the  analytical public. Yet these are people of direct action. Now  they are saying among themselves that there was no point in  their swimming against the tide, since nothing came of it --  either with the State Committee for the State of Emergency or  with the organizers of the October coup." The fact that the  militia is taking the same approach to the relationship between  the presidential and opposition sides as it does to mafia  investigations is even worse. The militia, the mayor said,  sometimes deliberately delays such investigations by 15-20  minutes to allow criminal groupings the time to finish each  other off, so that the militiamen can pick up the pieces on the  battlefield later.    The political consequences of the amnesty have thereby, in  the mayor's opinion, been directly counter to the deputies' good  intentions of bringing harmony to society.    A destabilizing factor, Yuriy Luzhkov believes, is the  smoldering polemic on the timing of the next presidential  elections. He rebukes the press for, in his view, being  excessively and prematurely interested in the subject:    "Understand that it will not be any individual but the  economic situation in the country that will predetermine the  outcome of these elections," he exclaimed.    Like Viktor Chernomyrdin, who believes that it would be  "unethical" under the current president to be talking about the  next election, Yuriy Luzhkov considers such talk "unpresidential  and undermining the head of state's authority." "Let's put this  subject to one side until 1996," was his appeal to the press.    The mayor of Moscow refuted the numerous press claims that  he  had set up the Party of the Majority for his own future election  campaign. "I have nothing to do with it, apart from the fact  that, at the request of one of my friends, I signed a greetings  message to the constituent congress of the Party of the  Majority, since its aim of supporting the formation of a class  of entrepreneurs does not run counter to my views," the mayor  explained.    According to him, of all our parties he has most sympathy  for  the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, whose leaders --  Gavriil Popov and Anatoliy Sobchak -- have the "most sensible  ideas." But when asked if he agreed with Gavriil Popov's claim  that the political amnesty was thought up by Boris Yeltsin  himself to rally the democrats around the president, Luzhkov  laughed: "The press sometimes flatters politicians by ascribing  a farsignted strategy to them. Sometimes after such articles  you start to respect yourself. In actual fact decisions are  most often made without any particular plan in mind." And that  is a pity.    Incidentally, in Luzhkov's opinion the economic and social  situation in Moscow at the moment is far more stable than in  other parts of Russia. "For this reason not one of the 15  candidates from Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party who ran  in Moscow made it to the State Duma," the mayor believes.    At the same time, he is by no means complacent about the  state of affairs in the capital, where the implementation of  social programs is being held up owing to a lack of funds. Nor  can you envy Sergey Dubinin, Russian Federation acting finance  minister, about whom Yuriy Luzhkov was justifiably angry:    "Last year alone Moscow paid 27 trillion rubles into the  federal budget. Yet you can't get anything about of state  coffers for the capital's needs. Dubinin states: `Subsidies?  You won't get any!' And I ask him: How are we supposed to  solve urgent problems and, in addition, maintain this huge  machinery of the state organs located in Moscow?    "Nobody is working on tax reform," Luzhkov continued. "Chaos  reigns in the tax collection system. Yet the Russian Government  has introduced a 3-percent tax to support high-tech enterprises.  And this is a turnover tax, which in monetary terms is many  times greater than any profits tax. And nobody explains how the  state is spending value-added tax and other revenue -- otherwise  they would have to admit the irrational spending of budget  funds."    This kind of tax policy, in Yuriy Luzhkov's opinion,  "stifles  enterprises and prevents them from expanding production."    One other "headache" for the mayor is the import duties that  have been introduced by the Russian Government:    "I recently visited the food fair at the Izmaylovo complex.  Trade was brisk and Moscow enterprises were actively concluding  contracts with food suppliers from the provinces. The same day  Central TV showed an interview with Vice Premier Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, who stated: `We in the government are examining the  question of raising the duty on imported foodstuffs by 20-30  percent.' The next day agrarians at the fair stopped signing  contracts, referring to the fact that they would need to revise  their prices -- in what direction is obvious. Nonetheless, the  government carried out its intention. I am sure that import  duties were raised to satisfy the agricultural lobby, and this  decision will lead to a sharp increase in the prices not only of  imported foodstuffs, but of Russian food too. First and  foremost, it will have an impact on the cost of the basket of  consumer goods for residents of large cities. And it is not  clear why it is necessary to slow the influx of foreign food  into the country. Have we really achieved surpluses?  Disagreeing with this measure, the mayors of three major cities  -- Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg -- intend to send a  protest to the government.    "I am convinced that the state should be concerned about the  unity of its goals rather than about resolving local tasks. As  regards the agrarian sector we need to improve production forces  and production relations, as the classics of Marxism-Leninism  taught us, rather than trying to ensure that Russian foodstuffs  are competitive by cranking up the prices of imports. Otherwise  the countryside's problems will again be resolved at the cities'  expense."    Luzhkov has been arguing about tax policy not only with the  acting finance minister but with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin too. According to the mayor, he tried to persuade  the premier that there is no point in increasing duties on  foreign cars imported into the country. As was the case with  duty on food imports, this measure, he believes, will only serve  to boost car prices, but without in any way improving Russian  car manufacture. "Duty should be increased on right-hand drive  cars and cars more than 10 years old to prevent pollution and to  stop Russia's car scrap heaps filling up" -- that was the  argument he put to Chernomyrdin. When asked how the prime  minister reacted, Yuriy Luzhkov countered with disarming  frankness: "He adopted the previously planned decision of  raising import duties."    As we can see, the mayor of Moscow is fully immersed in  economic concerns. He made a point of stressing his reluctance  to play politics. "We need to get creative processes going and  start work. Then the opposition will retreat," Luzhkov said.</p>

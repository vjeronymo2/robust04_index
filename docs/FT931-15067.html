			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: ABN Amro may withdraw Breevast offer ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' largest bank, will not proceed with a proposed tender offer worth up to Fl 105.6m (Dollars 57.7m) for Breevast, a Dutch property investment company, unless the Finance Ministry lifts a claim lodged against Breevast, writes Ronald van de Krol. In mid-December, ABN AMRO, which owns a 21 per cent stake in Breevast, said it expected to launch a tender offer of between Fl 15 and Fl 16 for the outstanding 6.6m shares it does not own. But the companies said yesterday Breevast was presented with an unspecified financial claim by the ministry in late December.</p>

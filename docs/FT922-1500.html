			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Arts: Orpheus in the Underworld - Opera Opera North close their 1991-92 season exactly as they opened it, with a French operetta revival. Last September the choice fell on Chabrier's L'Etoile, a gem of zany musical farce which the company buffed up to a splendid new shine. At the Bradford Alhambra last Friday they unveiled a new production of perhaps the quintessential work of the entire genre, Orphee aux enfers. ***** The good things about the evening start with the decision to perform the operetta in its original version - the small, scabrous two-acter of 1858 - rather than (as more commonly happens) in Offenbach's grossly overblown revision of 1874. There is a terrific new translation by Jeremy Sams, which follows his no less terrific Etoile text in packing into every number a bundle of saucily singable rhymes (Eurydice sings of the joys of becoming one of Bacchus's 'Bacchantes/dancing in my scanties') concealing a considerable amount of style-conscious elegance beneath their impishness. There is a neat, intimate, on-the-move production by Martin Duncan, in sets and costumes (designed by Tim Hatley) that marry Classical architecture and burlesque. The temple facade of Act 1 has a wonked pediment and ruched curtains; cut-out sheep, pigs, clouds and other elements of the pastoral are slid on and off with snappy precision. Mr Duncan and his cast have worked hard on not falling into traditional attitudes of oo-la-la uproariousness in Hades, always a tricky business in English-language performances of Offenbach. Here, the can-can flows out of the final scene with welcome adroitness. I laughed a great deal: in common the noisily enthusiastic Bradford audience, I had a jolly time. And yet, since I had expected from a new Opera North Orpheus something altogether sharper in its sting, I can't conceal a feeling of disappointment. A perennial problem crops up in the revival of popular works of genius whose satire is, paradoxically, universal and tied to a specific place and time. Orphee aux enfers is perhaps the most explosively tight, purposeful send-up of a country's ruling class ever penned, yet appreciation of its comedy is bound up with an intimate knowledge of subjects (the Second Empire, Greek mythology) with which most modern audiences have lost direct contact. ***** Mr Duncan's treatment lacks ferocity. He is right not to have gone for the pile-driver underlining of 'relevances' that so disfigured the ENO's Pountney-Gerald Scarfe Orpheus. But the Gods in particular seem to fall a little too easily into postures and routines inherited from Up Pompeii: a genuine re-creation of satire has moved out of reach. This has much to do with the cast - on Friday none of the Gods, Jupiter not excepted, proved quick enough on the draw, verbal or vocal - but also something to do with Wyn Davies's affectionate but slack conducting, with tempos too often too slow for the sustaining of vital momentum. Still, five of the players give great pleasure: this Offenbach vaut le voyage for them alone. Paul Wade's daffy yet strangely touching John Styx is one; Linda Ormiston's Scots-accented Public Opinion, a Morningside lady in tweeds with a mad glint in her eye and to her umbrella ferrule, is a second; and Alan Oke's matinee-idol Pluto, ideally witty in delivery, is a third. Harry Nicoll's slyly sweet-faced Orpheus and Linda Kitchen's adorably bright, bubbling Eurydice look and sound so good in operetta that both could spend the rest of their careers thus employed. Co-production with D'Oyly Carte Opera, sponsored by English Estates; in the Opera North autumn-season repertory from October 14.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (7): The property market draws the map - The West End is as much an idea as a clearly defined area The West End is a fiction. It is accepted as one of the world's largest business centres but no-one can agree exactly where it begins and ends. It exists only as an indeterminate swathe lying west of Whitehall and north of the Thames. Borders change according to the state of the market - or the views of whoever is drawing the map. Tenants widened their search for space during the boom, so King's Cross and Paddington were drawn into this amorphous mass in the tidal wave of surveys produced by agents. Jones Lang Wootton has even crossed the river into Lambeth - a sort of South-West End - since the heightening of interest around Waterloo Station. Demand and supply figures therefore need to be treated carefully. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, for instance, says take-up fell from 1m sqft to 646,000 sq ft in the three months to June, while supply fell 15 per cent from just under 8m to 6.7m sq ft. JLW, on the other hand, puts take-up at 685,000 sq ft with supply down 2 per cent at 8.76m sq ft. Overall figures are relatively meaningless anyway. 'It is far more useful to look at what is happening in specific areas,' says Philip Dawe of Herring Baker Harris. 'The West End is not one single entity but a collection of markets.' MAYFAIR/ST JAMES'S, the core area, is in greatest demand from high-profile tenants. It sets the tone for the West End: 'What happens here today affects the rest of area tomorrow,' says Mr Dawe. One key happening was the letting of Almack House to J P Morgan, according to James Birkett of Richard Ellis. This was one of only a handful of 100,000 sq ft-plus buildings left in the whole West End, and must make other tenants looking for headquarters feel distinctly nervous about what they will have to pay in future. The 40 a sq ft headline rent, while well below the 70 peak achieved in the boom, sets a benchmark for valuing other space. 'It also reveals proven demand in a market where there is very little space,' adds Birkett's colleague John Olney. That is one more factor which could get development moving again after a long hiatus. So is the creeping erosion of a vast rump of second-hand space. Rents have crept up from Pounds 30 to as much as Pounds 35 a sq ft in buildings such as Lansdowne House and Berkeley Square House over the last six months. The Prudential was encouraged enough to started work on 55,000 sq ft of speculative development at 30 Berkeley Square, which it considered selling 18 months ago. That might be thought a key move, as institutions hold a near-monopoly of prime sites and buildings, leaving developers with little chance of muscling in. Any big surge of development is likely to be in 1995 rather than this year, however. 'There are not enough deals at good headline rents to convince investors,' says Paul Yearley of JLW. But pressure is rising as landlords notice that rent-free periods have dropped from more than two years to around 18 months. With a few more lettings, they will have enough evidence to move - and they could be already in train. Pearson, for instance, which owns the Financial Times, is understood to have offered Scottish Widows around Pounds 35 a sq ft to put Lazards into the 40,000 refurbishment in Burlington Gardens. SOHO and COVENT GARDEN stand next in the queue for reassessment, with rents rising for the first time in five years, says Mr Birkett. The main thrust comes from media companies which shed space early in the recession. 'They are now lean, mean and hiring again - but have no space,' says Mr Yearley. CD &amp; P had to fight off three other advertising agencies to take a sub-let of 40,000 sq ft in Aquila House, Soho Square, from the Pru. There are doubts, however, whether media groups will pay the new going rate for space. While rents rose to Pounds 50 in the peak, real levels are now half this amount, says Philip Dawe. 'The industry is notoriously cost-conscious,' he says. 'It is difficult to see groups like publishers going above the Pounds 35 level needed to justify new space.' Dormeil House, an 80,000 sq ft block going up in Golden Square, could test the industry's confidence and courage, as this is likely to be priced at more than Pounds 30 a sq ft. One alternative is to move out of their traditional stamping ground. VICTORIA has already laid claim as the new media centre, says Mr Yearley. Channel 4 built its own HQ in Horseferry Road, which is bound to gather like-minded production and publishing companies. Advertising agency DMB&amp;B is thought to be paying around Pounds 25 a sq ft for the 80,000 sq ft released by Tiphook in 123 Buckingham Palace Road and the Press Association is understood to be buying Bank Paribas' 40,000 sq ft Denison House in Vauxhall Bridge Road for more than Pounds 10m. Some developers are well set to tap the spillover from Mayfair and Covent Garden because they have started construction early in the cycle. Land Securities has 50,000 sq ft underway at 25 Victoria Street, CIS is preparing to start 60,000 sq ft in Wilton Street and Chesterfield Properties has an 80,000 sq ft refurbishment in Vauxhall Bridge Road. The vacancy level in Victoria of 8 per cent is the lowest in the West End, says Herring Baker Harris, but with rents static at around Pounds 27.50 a sq ft there is little incentive for more new development. Victoria may have broken out of its traditional second-tier role, however. Salomon Brothers has voted to stay in the area by paying Pounds 80m for its lease on Victoria Place, showing that this is a viable location for a leading financial group. Ian Noble of Cluttons points out that there is still more than 1m sq ft of space - much of it second-hand - on the market. That is bound to muffle the impact of demand on rents. Prime new space is hard to find, however, which means Victoria is back at the top of its traditional two-tier market. NORTH of OXFORD ST, the opposite fringe of the West End, there is more strong competition for tenants, particularly the half dozen or so advertising agencies in the market for between 20,000 and 80,000 sq ft, according to Brien Martin of Imry. There is plenty of piecemeal, substandard accommodation, but few quality blocks with strong identities, he says, which is the rationale behind his company's 23,000 sq ft refurbishment of 54 Baker Street. But hefty competition will come from schemes such as CIN's 130,000 sq ft renovation of 33 Cavendish Square and the glossy new 40,000 sq ft being built by AXA Equity and Law at Wigmore Street. These are exceptions to the rule, however. Rents of around Pounds 22.50 a sq ft are again too low to stimulate much development. But Jonathon Evans of KFR says the ever-tightening market in the core will spin off demand to the fringes, just as it did in the boom. If, as is likely, development lags the revival of demand for large buildings, tenants may even spin as far as: EUSTON ROAD, where Hammerson hopes to catch them with open arms in Marathon House - providing the tenant does not take on a short-term renewal of the lease as rumoured. Perhaps the best sign of better things to come, however, is the Pounds 35 a sq ft being asked by British Land for 60,000 sq ft of renovated space in Regent's Place, the new name for the Euston Centre. Its chairman, John Ritblat, rarely calls the market wrongly. If he thinks that will pull in the tenants, perhaps the West End is on the verge of recovery after all.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP RENTAL NORMS (Pounds/sq ft per annum)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1990 (year)   1993 (year)   1994 (Jan-June)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mayfair             70.00         40.00         40.00 St James's          70.00         40.00         40.00 Soho                50.00         20.00         22.50 Covent Gdn/Strand   57.50         25.00         27.50 Victoria/Belgravia  55.00         25.00         27.50 Northern (west)     55.00         22.50         22.50 Northern (east)     47.50         20.00         20.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Richard Ellis, August 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

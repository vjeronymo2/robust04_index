The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment of the proposed action, ``Environmental Assessment by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Relating to the Expansion of the Spent Fuel Pools, Public Service Electric and Gas Company, Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;70 and DPR&hyph;75, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;272 and 50&hyph;311,'' dated April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel'' (NUREG&hyph;0575), concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation of nuclear with the accompanying spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in SFP designs, the FGEIS recommended licensing SFP expansion on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Salem Units 1 and 2, the SFP modification will not create any significant additional radiological effects or measurable nonradiological environmental impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event of a fuel handling accident, the whole body dose and thyroid dose that might be received by an individual at the site boundary is well within regulatory requirements. It is not expected that an increase in the occupational radiation dose will result from the operation of the expanded spent fuel pools. For the modification of the pools, the occupational exposure is estimated to be less than 4% of the total annual occupational exposure at the facility. To assure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) goals are met, during the SFP expansion activities, work, personnel traffic and movement of equipment will be monitored and controlled. Therefore, the staff concludes that the exposure to workers is ALARA and is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only nonradiological impact affected by the expansion of the spent fuel pools is the waste heat rejected. The increase in total plant waste heat is insignificant (less than 0.05% of the total plant heat loss to the environment). There is no significant environmental impact attributed to the waste heat from the plant because of the expansion of the spent fuel pools. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff has reviewed this proposed facility modification relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR part 51. Based on this assessment, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendments to the licenses will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendments to the Technical Specifications dated April 28, 1993, as supplemented by letters of August 12, 1993, November 17, 1993, February 2, 1994, and April 7, 1994, (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG&hyph;0575), (3) the Final Environmental Statement for Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, issued April 1973, and (4) the Environmental Assessment dated April 25, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located in the Salem Free Public Library, 112 West Broadway, Salem, New Jersey 08079. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 25th day of April 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles L.

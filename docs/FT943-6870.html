			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Santer plans wide-ranging reforms to open up Brussels Mr Jacques Santer, incoming president of the European Commission, is planning a more open, less autocratic style of leadership as well a wide-ranging internal shake-up when he succeeds Mr Jacques Delors next January. Officials close to him say he intends to introduce a more collegial approach, ending Mr Delors' practice of concentrating power in an inner circle and creating an underground network in the bureaucracy. Mr Santer, who has been commuting between his native Luxembourg and Brussels, intends to outline ideas on reforming the Commission during a forthcoming tour of European capitals. Originally dismissed as a safe but uninspiring choice to succeed Mr Delors, the long-time Luxembourg prime minister wants to shape his own team and reorganise the Commission in preparation for his five-year term starting on January 6. His task is harder because of delays by member states in putting forward candidates for commissioners and rivalry over portfolios. In France, the Gaullist-led coalition is finding it hard to pin down President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, on suitable candidates. Mrs Edith Cresson, a former prime minister and Mitterrand favourite, would be welcomed as a political heavyweight - though French claims to the external trade portfolio are being resisted by the UK which wants Sir Leon Brittan to retain it. Brussels officials are also worried that referendums on European Union membership to be held in Finland, Sweden, and Norway could force delays in agreeing a division of the Commission spoils. 'If we carve up the jobs before the referendums, we could be accused of treating the Scandinavians like second-class citizens,' said one. If EU enlargement goes ahead, the number of Commissioners will rise from 17 to 21 (including Austria). Mr Santer is said to be confident enough work can be found, but others are doubtful. An early test will be whether Mr Santer unscrambles one of Mr Delors' most important innovations: the creation in 1992 of a commissioner for external political affairs running a new department called DG1A. Mr Hans van den Broek, the present incumbent, has spent much of the past 18 months scrapping with Sir Leon Brittan who runs external trade, but the Dutchman may leave Brussels next year. Many officials believe Mr Delors created the portfolio in order to grab powers over EU foreign policy which he failed to gain during the 1991 negotiations leading to the Maastricht treaty. The creation of DG1A antagonised sovereignty-conscious France and the UK, but scrapping it could trigger fears about an overmighty Sir Leon. Some officials argue that Mr Santer must switch around portfolios in order to stamp his authority on the new Commission. This would mean moving Sir Leon from trade, the popular Mr Karel Van Miert from competition policy, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the German industry commissioner. But Mr Santer seems likely to reject this argument. Instead, he is expected to press hard to restore power to the director-generals, the international civil servants whose power was often usurped by the private staff in the cabinets of Mr Delors and other powerful commissioners.</p>

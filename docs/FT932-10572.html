			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten ready to press on with testing FRESH BLOWS to the government's plans for testing have increased the pressure on Mr John Patten, the education secretary, but left him still determined to press ahead. Although the courts have not proved a way of preventing the looming boycott by teachers, and the traditional 'divide and rule' approach to the teachers' unions has collapsed, Mr Patten and other ministers insist in public that they want this year's tests to proceed. In private, however, both ministers and officials recognise that there will be disruption, and that the only question is its scale. One said yesterday: 'The tests will be disrupted, that is now discounted.' Another said: 'There won't be many league tables.' Although the changes made to testing in Scotland as a result of pressure from teachers and parents have been urged on ministers as a way of avoiding the likely shambles, elsewhere in government there is little enthusiasm for what has resulted there. Ministerial determination not to change course has been bolstered by the reaction to the advertising of leaflets about testing - the number of responses asking for copies of the leaflets will be released in the next couple of weeks. A further 1.3 million copies will be issued with child benefit. One official said: 'It is now clear that the government is prepared to muddle through. We are locked into our position.' The government seems to believe the worst is behind it. The resignations of two key advisers from the School Examinations and Assessment Council this week are seen as a 'nuisance' rather than a more serious difficulty, and the teachers' plans on the curriculum are seen as simply a matter for Sir Ron Dearing's review. Deep-rooted Tory dislike of the educational establishment has muted much criticism of Mr Patten, although some ministerial colleagues have privately expressed surprise that Mr Patten seems to have courted confrontation rather than tried to avoid it.</p>

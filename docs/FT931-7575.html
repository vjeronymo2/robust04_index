			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Trade News: New exports cover for Poland urged BRITISH exports to Poland could rise as high as Pounds 1bn a year if cover provided by the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, removed in 1982, were to be restored, the British Chamber of Commerce in Warsaw has told Mr John Major, the British prime minister, Christopher Bobinski writes from Warsaw. The letter marks an appeal for ECGD cover to be resumed and comes on the eve of a visit to London by Ms Hanna Suchocka, the Polish prime minister, next week. Last year British exports expanded by 75 per cent to Pounds 605.6m. If oil and petroleum revenues are removed, sales grew by a mere 14 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRAQ SCOFFS AT U.S. PUSH TO USE FORCE  </P> <P> The United States conducted last-minute lobbying today as the U.N. Security  Council prepared to authorize a military strike to liberate Kuwait if Iraq  refuses to withdraw by Jan. 15.  </P> <P> Passage would mark only the second time in the 45-year history of the United  Nations that the council has authorized the use of force to counter aggression.  The first time was in 1950, during the Korean conflict.  </P> <P> In an extraordinary meeting of 13 foreign ministers, the council was to hand  Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to vacate the tiny oil-rich  emirate, which his troops invaded Aug. 2, or risk military conflict with  U.S.-led forces. Only the ministers of Yemen and the Ivory Coast did not  attend.  </P> <P> It would be the 12th council resolution condemning the Iraqi aggression, and  would strengthen President Bush's hand with Congress and the American people in  calling for offensive action against Baghdad.  </P> <P> At least 12 of the 15 council members appeared to be solidly behind the U.S.  initiative, with a possible abstention by China and abstentions or negative  votes by Cuba and Yemen. The United States and its allies continued working  toward the measure's passage today.  </P> <P> Nine affirmative votes were required. Any of the five permanent council members  can veto the measure. Three -- the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain  -- sponsored the brief resolution.  </P> <P> The resolution gives Hussein "one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill,"  to retreat.  </P> <P> He has refused to leave and has defied all previous resolutions condemning the  occupation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Hussein responded defiantly to the developments at the United Nations. He  declared he was not afraid of fighting the United States, which he said had  been overly influenced by "Rambo" movies.  </P> <P> "The Americans are still influenced by 'Rambo' movies but this is not a 'Rambo'  movie. This is something different," he said.  </P> <P> "We do not underestimate American military power, but we scorn their evil  intentions," he said in remarks carried by official Baghdad radio.  </P></p>

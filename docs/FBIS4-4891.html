			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- More than two thousand  students belonging to the South Korean Federation of General  Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) Tuesday [5 April] held a rally  in the amphitheatre of Konkuk University before going over to an  anti-U.S., anti-"government" demonstration to check the  "parliamentary ratification" of the "Uruguay Round accord  fulfilment schedule", urge renegotiation and protest the U.S.  arms sale pressure, according to a report from Seoul.    In a resolution they adopted, the students expressed  indignation at the fact that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique  was inflicting colossal losses upon the people by opening the  farm market wider and voiced strong opposition to the  "parliamentary ratification" of the "fulfilment schedule" slated  for April 12.    At the end of the rally they took to the streets and had a  fierce clash with the riot police.    The demonstrators were carrying a large streamer reading "No  U.S. arms sales" and shouting: "We urge renegotition on basic  farm products".    On the same day, more than one thousand students held a  rally  in demand of the boycott of the Uruguay Round accord in the  Jongmyo Park, Seoul, and then staged a street demonstration.</p>

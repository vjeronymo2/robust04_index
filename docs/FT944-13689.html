			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (2): Intel against Compaq in bitter battle - Desktop computers / Paul Taylor tries to evaluate the conflicting claims Once again, the worldwide personal computer market is in turmoil with leading PC manufacturers slashing prices to keep volumes moving ahead and a bitter public power struggle breaking out between Intel, the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer, and Compaq Computer, its biggest customer. In mid-August, a new price war erupted in the US personal computer market when International Business Machines slashed prices on many of its PC products by up to 27 per cent. The move came in response to similar price cuts by Compaq, the US market leader. IBM also cut the prices of its PC network servers to less than those of equivalent Compaq machines. Compaq is the dominant supplier of PC servers, used to control office computer networks. This is the most profitable and fastest growing section of the corporate PC market. Then last month, in an unprecedented outburst, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and chief executive, lashed out at Intel, accusing the US chip maker of undermining Compaq's marketing efforts and of not giving his company due consideration as the biggest seller of PCs in the US and Europe. Mr Pfeiffer cited Intel's promotion of its own brand name, chip pricing strategy, and the direct competition posed by Intel's growing PC and circuit board manufacturing operations. These battles are taking place against the backdrop of a market which has been underpinned throughout the recession by the continued shift by business customers away from mainframe computers to networks of desktop PCs and mid-range computers (client-server systems). According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, about 45 per cent of PCs were connected to networks last year, and this is forecast to rise to 55 per cent this year and 77 per cent by 1997. The impact of this trend is apparent in PC volume sales. Despite cutbacks, budget freezes and huge numbers of bankruptcies and redundancies, the European PC market grew by 12.5 per cent in unit terms in 1992 and by about 14 per cent in 1993, according to an Economist Intelligence Unit research report. Projections for 1994 are that demand will continue to rise, with unit growth increasing by a further 20 per cent. At the same time, there has been a marked resurgence in sales by the large brand name PC manufacturers over the past two years, reversing the trend towards the cut-price 'clone' manufacturers apparent since the late 1980s. The top five PC manufacturers all increased their market shares last year in terms of worldwide shipments, according to Dataquest. In western Europe, shipments by the top nine manufacturers rose by 7.3 percentage points to 54.4 per cent of the total market. Compaq, in particular, has achieved a dramatic turnaround. Several factors are responsible. First, the old established manufacturers have hit back at cut-price clone manufacturers with competitively priced machines of their own. Second, the growth of the local area network has placed a premium on PC networking compatibility and on support and service. Finally, customer buying habits for desktop computers have moved back towards established indirect distribution channels. Meanwhile, PC prices have continued to tumble. According to London-based Marketline International, the average price of a PC in the UK fell by 16.8 per cent between 1991 and 1993. At the same time, the specifications continue to rise, meaning that entry-level business computers now boast features that were available only on top-level machines a few years ago. Slim profit margins and shortening product cycles continue to take their toll - there has been a steady stream of casualties on both sides of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, volumes are such that no serious contender in the data processing industry can afford to ignore the PC market. Fuelling the PC price battle are sharp cuts by Intel in the prices of its microprocessors. The US chipmaker reduced the prices of its 486 and latest generation Pentium chips by about 40 per cent in the second quarter. More recently, Intel has announced an advertising campaign to persuade business customers and home consumers to buy PCs based on the Pentium chip - sales of which have been slower than expected. This has annoyed Compaq, which had large stocks of machines based on lower performance chips at the end of the second quarter. Compaq sees Intel's attempts to accelerate the pace of technological advance in the PC industry as an intrusion. For its part, Intel is thought to be marketing Pentium chips aggressively so as to maximise its already strong profit margins, and to outflank mounting competition from rival chip manufacturers which threaten to eat into its 90 per cent market share of world microprocessor sales. Among the competition, California-based Advanced Micro Devices has already launched versions of Intel's 486 microprocessors and has promised a Pentium clone by the end of the year. Other competitors include Nexgen, a privately-held chip developer in which Compaq has a minority stake, and Cyrix. Market analysts believe these companies could achieve a 20 per cent or higher share of the PC microprocessor market over time. Meanwhile, both Apple Computer and Motorola, the US electronics and communications manufacturer, have launched PCs based on PowerPC microprocessor chips, jointly developed by the two companies together with IBM. Its advocates claim the PowerPC microprocessor is more powerful than competing chips from Intel, making them well suited to demanding desktop applications such as multimedia with sound, video and graphics which are beginning to appear in the office. However, the new chips lack the broad software base available for Intel-based PCs. This is one reason why IBM has delayed the launch of its own version of the PowerPC until early next year. Lou Gerstner, who took over as IBM chairman 18 months ago, has said that some of IBM's customers are concerned about the rapid obsolescence of the products they buy, and the pace of technological change. However Mr Gerstner has also acknowledged that IBM has often been slower than its rivals to bring new products to market - even when it has a technological lead. Despite the concerns of both Compaq and IBM, it seems unlikely that the pace of technical innovation will slow. Therefore one of the main challenges facing corporate PC customers will continue to be to sift through the competing claims.</p>

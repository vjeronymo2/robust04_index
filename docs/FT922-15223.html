			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Lucas likely to lose top commercial paper rating LUCAS Industries, the UK engineering group, is likely to lose its top credit rating for commercial paper but has pre-empted the move by replacing short-term borrowings with long-dated institutional funding. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, said it was reviewing the A-1 credit rating of Lucas Industries and its US subsidiaries following the announcement of results for the six months to end-January. The agency said the fall in trading profits to Pounds 32.7m, from Pounds 66.5m, was worse than expected. It noted net interest cover, before exceptional items and distribution from pension fund surplus, had fallen to under two times, from over five times in the last full financial year. But, Lucas has already moved to repay commercial paper in the US. Last week, it said it had secured Pounds 100m 12-year debt funding from a group of US financial institutions, arranged by Wertheim Schroder. Mr Peter Skeggs, assistant treasurer, said the arrangement had been used to pay down uncommitted short-term funding in the US, mainly commercial paper. A term loan arranged last year was also used for this purpose. Net of the proceeds of the debt placement, Lucas will have only around Dollars 30m of commercial paper outstanding in the US. In the UK, the company has a cash surplus, said Mr Skeggs. The debt placement with five US financial institutions, led by Lincoln National of Indiana, gives the company access to fixed-rate dollar funding at an interest rate of 8.57 per cent. The proceeds of the placement were swapped into floating-rate dollars. Harrisons &amp; Crossfield, the diversified UK trading group, has raised Dollars 120m debt funding maturing between 2002 and 2004 from a placement with US institutions arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. MAY TAKE JAPAN TO TASK OVER SLOW OPENING OF MICROCHIP MARKET  </P> <P> Foot-dragging by Japan in the opening of its microchip market to foreigners  will probably lead to a tougher U.S. trade stance, the president of the U.S.  Semiconductor Industry Assn. said today.  </P> <P> The Ministry of International Trade and Industry "is moving more slowly than it  should," Andrew Procassini told reporters.  </P> <P> As a result, Japan will probably be named a "priority" nation, requiring new  negotiations and possible sanctions in accord with Section 301 of the U.S.  Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, he said.  </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills is expected to include Japan's  semiconductor market when she unveils a list of alleged unfair trade practices  on April 30.  </P> <P> She will have 30 days from then to decide whether to name Japan a "priority"  nation, a move that would oblige her to open special negotiations that could  lead to retaliatory sanctions.  </P> <P> The United States already imposes 100% tariffs on $165 million worth of  Japanese exports in retaliation for alleged failure to honor a pledge under a  1986 microchip pact to give foreign makers greater market access.  </P></p>

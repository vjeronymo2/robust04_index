			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Arts: Interpreting Ashton's works - Ballet The continued life of a ballet in repertory - the reasons why it should still appeal to audiences; why it should still be worth watching on the most rigorous critical terms; why it should not be referred to the nearest Trading Standards office - has to do with a precious balance between style and spontaneity. Casts must feel at ease with the intentions of the choreography (however remote in time) and with their own powers to interpret them. Because Frederick Ashton's creations lie at the heart of the Royal Ballet's identity, and because he was notoriously not interested in second or third (or 33rd) casts, his works are particularly subject to performance by rote, and all that implies of 'This is what Sir Fred wanted, and this is the way you must dance it'. There has resulted a paralysis in Ashtonian interpretation, doctrinally rigid - the letter killing, the spirit absent. So Cinderella's Ugly Sisters, still played as debased copies of Ashton's and Helpmann's originals, are now a serious deterrent to watching the piece. So, a revival of Symphonic Variations in Birmingham looked as if its cast wore strait-jackets rather than Fedorovich's tunics, and were terrified to be themselves. So, on Wednesday night, A Month in the Country and The Dream as part of a triple bill, were, respectively, how and how not to dance Ashton. The Dream lacked any lightness or clarity and, especially, that sexual pungency which must make the last pas de deux so real an image of Titania and Oberon's love. The Puck was leaden; the quartet of lovers were as time-worn as their predictable antics; the midsummer magic was autumnal, the wit doughy. William Trevitt was an Oberon of promise, and deserved a better setting; so did Luke Heydon as a gleefully simple Bottom. It is time for The Dream to be reconsidered; the lustre has gone. Though I had little sympathy for some of the subsidiary casting in A Month in the Country - performances showed the spontaneity of a 'speak your weight' machine - the ballet was admirably Ashton's. That it was so I attribute to developments in both Sylvie Guillem's and Bruce Sansom's interpretations. Mlle Guillem now looks at ease as Natalya. The caprices of a bored woman trapped in her summer dacha; the last flare of romantic feeling as she yields to Belyayev; the sense of affection, of guilt and of ungovernable jealousy that mark her relationship with Vera, were sensitively shown, and the dance gleamed. Mr Sansom, who has seemed too perennially boyish for Belyayev, has gained in emotional weight and technical authority. The role is beautifully danced - line, dynamics impeccable - and sure in its sensitivity to Vera's calf-love and its boldness when confronted with Natalya's passion. The other pleasure of the evening was Sarah Wildor's debut as Vera. The dancing, as we have come to expect from this gifted young artist, was lovely in its bright, true accents, its sweetness of outline. It was essentially Ashtonian. Her reading of the character - a first infatuation that tells of troubling depths - was ideal. The ballet was alive. The bill was completed by David Bintley's recent Tombeaux. It offers excellent costumes for the women (Jasper Conran's black and amethyst tutus are a joy) and men in black long-johns that make them look like gymnasts in a frenzy of mourning. The dance chatters vivaciously and keeps a mixed bag of Royal Ballet girls on the hop. Viviana Durante appears as an elegant creature in devore velvet and makes a great deal of the duets that are the best things in the piece; Bruce Sansom whips about the stage, expending quantities of classic style on some arduous evolutions. It is too garrulous for my taste - party chat as art. The programme is repeated tomorrow, matinee and evening.</p>

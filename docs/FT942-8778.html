			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Power investors near deals in India India's bid to attract private investment into the power industry is about to bear fruit with promoters of four projects together worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) close to signing financing agreements. Mr N. Ramji, joint secretary in the power ministry, said yesterday financing deals could be signed in the next 'one or two months' for the schemes, which could produce about 1520MW of electricity. The projects are the most advanced of a total of 75 schemes in which private investors, including foreign groups, have expressed interest. India opened the industry to new private investment in 1992 as part of its economic liberalisation programme. Commercial negotiations have been complex because the government is permitting investment, principally in power generation and not, generally, in distribution which remains in the hands of 17 state-level electricity boards. Operating under the influence of local politicians, state electricity boards have been notorious for under-charging politically-favoured groups and not paying their bills. Potential investors have pressed central government for guarantees of payment in the event of a default by an electricity board. Delhi has reluctantly agreed to guarantee payment in the event of default by either the electricity board or the relevant state government. The first project to get the guarantee is a 695MW plant to be built in the western state of Maharashtra by Enron, a US energy group, General Electric of the US, which will supply equipment, and local partners. Enron originally planned a Dollars 3bn 2000MW plant but has divided the project into stages. The other companies expected to complete financing arrangements soon are GVK Industries, an Indian mini-conglomerate, and ABB, the European engineering combine, which plan a 235MW station in the central state of Andhra Pradesh; Spectrum Power Generation of the US which plans a 200MW station also in Andhra Pradesh; and AES, a US generating group, which wants to build a 420MW coal-based station in Orissa state. Mr Ramji said three other investor groups had also secured government approval - Ashok Leyland, a diversified company controlled by the London-based Hinduja trading family, and National Power of the UK, which plan a 1,000MW station in Andra Pradesh; Cogentrix of the US with a 1,000MW project in Haryana, near Delhi, and ST Power Systems and CMS of the US which have proposed a 750MW station in Tamil Nadu. In addition, the few existing Indian private generating companies permitted to operate before liberalisation are expanding their combined capacity from about 2,850MW to 4,200MW. Welcome as these investments are for power-short India, they will not close the gap between supply and demand immediately.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "`There Is No Alternative' Hurd </F> Tells Euro Rebels"]    [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, told  Conservative Euro-sceptics questioning Britain's membership of  the EC yesterday that they were "out of touch with reality."    In an attempt to dampen speculation that Mr Major would  threaten to withdraw from the Community if further encroachments  were made on national sovereignty, Mr Hurd said there was no  alternative to continued participation.    "We are part of Europe, and I am quite clear that our  prosperity and security depends on making a success of Europe,"  he said. "Therefore we have to argue strongly, as we have done  and will do, for the kind of Europe with which we are at ease."    But Mr Edward Leigh, who was sacked as Industry Minister,  claimed that as many as 200 Tory MPs "do not want to be dragged  further and further into a federalist system."    Mr Hurd's comments came at the end of a week in which Tory  tensions over Europe have reasserted themselves as battle-lines  are drawn ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference that  will chart the development of the EC into the next century.    Sensitivities are such that ministers swiftly denied there  had been any fundamental redrafting of the party's manifesto for  the forthcoming European elections, though it was conceded its  rough edges had been smoothed and some sections dropped.    The Prime Minister, on a regional tour of the north west of  England, said the manifesto had gone through the normal  redrafting process and was now virtually complete. Suggestions  that the original drawn up by Mr Hurd had been rewritten by  Downing Street were "over dramatised and fanciful," Mr Major  said.    The manifesto attempts to bridge the gulf between the  party's  two extremes on Europe and Mr Hurd believes he has produced a  document that will satisfy about 90 percent of MPs.    He wants the party to campaign on avowedly European issues  in  order to highlight the differences between a Conservative  commitment to a loose alliance of nation states and alleged  Labour and Liberal Democrat support for bureaucracy, regulation  and interventionism.    A comprehensive policy statement on Europe is included in  the  annual Campaign Guide published by the Conservatives last night.  It emphasises that the Tories are committed to keeping Britain  "at the heart of Europe" and to playing a "pragmatic  constructive and above all practical" role in the EC.    But Euro-sceptics, who now term themselves "realists," fear  that if a stand is not taken now, then Britain will be dragged  along in the federalist slipstream leading to a united states of  Europe and a common currency.    With some on the Tory Right now openly canvassing the option  of withdrawal, both Mr Major and Mr Hurd made clear yesterday  that this was not a strategy they would embrace.    The Prime Minister said it was in Britain's economic and  security interests to remain part of the EC although that did  not mean that every edict from Brussels or opinion of a European  partner had to be accepted.    The Foreign Secretary speaking in Devon, said "Our message  is  positive in that we see no alternative to Europe."    Mr Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade,  also rounded on the Euro-sceptics for reopening the divisions  ahead of the June 9 elections.    "It is undermining the position of the Prime Minister, of  our  candidates and making our supporters in the country reel with  amazement," he said.    The rekindling of the Conservtiave Euro arguments has  provided the opposition parties will ample ammunition in the  run-up to the June 9 elections, at which the Tories face heavy  losses, although largely because of domestic unpopularity.</p>

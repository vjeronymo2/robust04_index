			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / French mainstream parties advance The French political landscape has regained a certain stability after the first round of local elections. Although the governing centre-right parties underlined their supremacy, the opposition Socialists and their left-wing allies managed to recover from recent electoral disasters. The mainstream parties gained at the expense of the fringes. The environmentalist vote slipped to less than 4 per cent, to the benefit of the left, and the National Front vote (9.8 per cent) dropped for the first time for many years below that of the Communist party (11.3 per cent), which rallied after a long decline. Despite record unemployment and violent anti-government protests, prime minister Edouard Balladur's coalition won 44.7 per cent of the vote, compared with 43.9 per cent in last year's legislative poll, and the Socialists and their allies took 28.8 per cent, up from 20 per cent last year. In the short-term, therefore, the Balladur government will be reinforced in its determination not to cede further to the trade unions over its plan to allow French employers to pay some young people less than the national minimum wage, in return for extra training-on-the-job. While also continuing to meet yesterday with the unions to try to win their acquiescence to the youth wage plan, Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, said over the weekend the government would stand as firm against the protesters as France had against the German offensive at Verdun in 1916. For his part, Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader, claimed that his party had showed itself 'half way' to regaining power. But in a poll in which almost every party claimed satisfaction, if not victory, the National Front could point to its success in doubling the vote it gained in the 1988 cantonal elections, even if it fell well below the 12 per cent it scored in 1992-93 polls. In the south, the National Front did well in the scandal-ridden Var department, whose president, Mr Maurice Arreckx, after being questioned by police searching for the killers of the murdered MP, Mrs Yann Piat, has been forced into a difficult run-off. But allegations of financial misconduct did no harm to Mr Bernard Tapie, who came out top in a Marseille canton. While last Sunday's first voting round was a pure test of parties' relative popularity, next Sunday's run-off is more complex as eliminated candidates throw their support to those still in the race. These alliances sometimes cross the classic left-right divide. The broader consequence of the polling will be to silence, temporarily at least, critics of Mr Balladur and Mr Rocard inside their own parties. Supporters of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR leader and Mr Balladur's rival for the presidency, openly acknowledged the poll's apparently positive verdict on the Balladur government.</p>

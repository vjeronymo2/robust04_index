			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fiat layoffs meet hostile reaction The prospect of over 5,000 layoffs following Fiat's purchase of a 90 per cent stake met a hostile reaction among the 23,000 workers currently employed in FSM's two plants at Bialsko Biala in southern Poland. A spokesman for the Solidarity trade union said three unions had called a strike alert, which is often the first stage leading to strike action, writes Anthony Robinson. Although weakened by the recession which has seen industrial production in state-owned enterprises slump 40 per cent over the last two years, the trade unions and the workers councils still retain allegiance among workers fearful of layoffs and affected by the government's 'popiwek' tax designed to keep wage increases below the rate of inflation.</p>

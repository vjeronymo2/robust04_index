			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Lean and mean, but is it fair? - Frances Williams questions a world competitiveness rankings report The world competitiveness rankings represent a bold if not necessarily accurate stab at identifying what makes an economy successful. This year for the first time, the compilers of the annual World Competitiveness Report*, the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, have produced a consolidated ranking of 23 rich and 18 poor nations. This has proved both fascinating and puzzling. It may come as no great surprise to see the US displace Japan as the world's most competitive economy. But does it really make sense to rank Singapore, with a population of less than 3m, above economic heavyweights such as Japan or Germany? Part of the problem relates to the desire to be fair to small economies. The report chooses to define competitiveness as 'the ability of a country or a company to, proportionally, generate more wealth than competitors in world markets'. But, by basing the definition on the idea of global rivalry, the implication is that countries become a bigger 'threat' the higher their position. The rankings show East Asia already a competitive force to be reckoned with and the emergence of a 'second wave' of competitors from Latin America. At an individual level, however, the 1994 scoreboard produces some odd results. For instance, Colombia (30th) is considered more competitive than Italy (32nd), even though Italy is a Group of Seven member with the world's fifth largest economy and many companies of world renown. Arguably, the rankings are too dependent on short-term factors - for instance, the country's position in the economic cycle - and on the inevitably impressionistic results of an international survey of business executives which accounts for a third of the data used. (Only 2,851 questionnaires were returned out of 16,500). The US ascendancy over Japan largely reflects its early economic recovery while Japan has yet to emerge from its deepest recession in decades. Other problems arise with the choice of the 381 criteria, availability of comparable information and the way data are combined to produce the overall rankings. What does it mean when business executives classify people in their country as 'lacking energy and enthusiasm' or 'having a positive attitude to life'? Interestingly, the most 'positive' nations turn out to be Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Ireland and Malaysia, with Colombia in 8th place. The most lacking in energy and enthusiasm among the 41 countries rated are, from bottom, the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa, Poland and Venezuela. Britain ranks 35th. Discussing the implications for changing competitiveness in a global economy, the report is in two minds. Prof Stephane Garelli, director of the World Competitiveness Project, warns that market opening will tempt many industries to relocate in countries with low-cost labour. Industrialised nations employ 350m people at an average hourly wage of Dollars 18, he says. But industry has access to huge new markets such as China, the former Soviet Union, India and Mexico, with a labour force of 1,200m paid on average less than Dollars 2. 'Today, an outflow of manufacturing operations from western economies seems inevitable,' he says. Even more gloomily, he predicts service jobs will soon follow. Prof Thomas Vollmann, also of IMD, takes a different view. 'There is a common misunderstanding that competitiveness in manufacturing depends heavily on labour costs. For most products this is simply not the case'. What is needed is 'enterprise transformation' directed at establishing market dominance, not indiscriminate cost-cutting. 'Lean and mean is too often anorexia,' he says. World Competitiveness Report 1994.

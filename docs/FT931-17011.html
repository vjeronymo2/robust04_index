			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Kenyan opposition parties reject election results KENYA's political crisis deepened last night as the three main opposition parties rejected election results and alleged 'massive rigging'. President Daniel arap Moi said they were pushing the country towards civil war. The move by the united opposition, pledging to prevent Mr Moi from exercising power and dem-anding fresh elections, immediately raised the prospect of conflict in the country. Provisional results last night showed the 68-year-old president and his ruling party Kanu had won the presidential and parliamentary polls. President Moi told reporters at State House that he denied the allegations and said the opposition leaders were 'liars' pushing Kenya towards civil war. In what was taken as an imminent crackdown, Mr Moi said he had tolerated much abuse from the opposition. 'This will now cease,' he said. He appealed to western governments to recognise his victory and resume aid suspended last year pending pol-itical pluralism and economic re-form. 'Kenya has taken a giant step forward, not without great risk and potential pitfalls,' he said. 'I call on the world . . . to recognise our achievement.' The opposition demands coincided with a statement by the Commonwealth group of observers, further undermining Mr Moi's credibility. 'It was evident to us from the start that some aspects of the election were not fair,' the group said. It qualified its criticism, saying the election 'constitutes a giant step on the road to multi-party democracy'. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the secretary-general of the Commonwealth, was last night poised to break off a holiday in Gambia for a crisis mission to Kenya. A joint statement by Mr Ken-neth Matiba, of Ford-Asili, Mr Mwai Kibaki, of the Democratic party and Mr Jaramogi Oginga Odinga of Ford-Kenya, the three opposition leaders, accused Mr Moi and Kanu of 'hijacking democracy' and bringing the country to the brink of a crisis. Among the electoral abuses they alleged against Kanu were widespread intimidation, massive fraud in counting and tallying votes, introduction of illegal ballot boxes stuffed with Kanu votes and the counting of opposition votes for Kanu candidates. It was clear that the opposition coalition was trying to hold back a possible eruption of violence. However, although the parties refused to spell out their strategy, they were threatening to mobilise massive protest if their demands were not met. 'If we had not acted, the people of Kenya would already be in the streets,' said Mr Matiba. Results from 167 of the 188 constituencies announced by last night showed that Mr Moi had won the presidential race with 1,796,233 votes. Mr Matiba, with 1,228,870 votes, was in second place ahead of Mr Odinga and Mr Kibaki. In the parliamentary poll, out of 156 results declared Kanu had won 85 seats to the opposition's 71, lead by Ford-Asili and Ford-Kenya with 25 MPs each. Kanu must win 89 seats to give it a working majority. Opposition officials pointed out that, even in what they said was a rigged poll, Mr Moi had only won 36 per cent of the presidential poll. In the parliamentary election, 15 of his cabinet ministers were defeated, including two of his most important 'political barons', Mr Elijah Mwangale, former agriculture minister, and Mr Joseph Kamotho, the Kanu secretary. Mr Moi and Kanu had also been trounced in the heartland of Kenya's two biggest tribes, the Kikuyu and the Luo. Matiba profile, Page 3 Jury out on Kenyan experiment, Page 7</p>

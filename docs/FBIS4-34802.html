			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>   [Text] Panama has ordered the freezing of bank accounts and  properties of the Haitian and Libyan Governments in this country.    The decision was adopted in compliance with resolutions the  UN Security Council has taken against the military officers who  overthrew Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and against  Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, who is accused of promoting  terrorism.    The Foreign Ministry decrees enable Attorney General Jorge  Valdes to "immediately" order the freezing of Libyan and Haitian  military funds.    The Foreign Ministry measure regarding Haiti also prohibits  the Haitian military from entering Panama and bars exports and  imports to and from that country.    President Guillermo Endara's government has also banned  Panamanian airplanes from flying to Haiti.    These UN measures were adopted in order to restore democracy  in Haiti and reinstate deposed President Aristide.    Concerning Libya, in addition to ordering the freeze on  funds  and properties of that Arab government or companies, Panama has  prohibited the sale of equipment the al-Qadhdhafi regime could  use for oil exploration.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'MONEY, POWER, MURDER' JUST CAN'T CARRY THE PLOT  </P> <P> The made-for-TV movie "Money, Power, Murder" promises in its title almost  everything in the ratings sun except sex and rich chocolate treats.  </P> <P> This CBS endeavor (9 p.m. Sunday on Channels 2 and 8) stars Kevin Dobson as  smart but wise-aleck, clever but unorthodox, tough but heart-o'-gold reporter  Peter Finley, who works for a small but feisty New York cable news operation. A  good, breezy character.  </P> <P> He sets about covering the disappearance of hot-eyed and hot-rated (but hotly  despised) network anchorwoman Peggy Ann Brady (Julianne Moore). Then a lot of  people start showing up dead.  </P> <P> There's some money, power and murder here, and a little sex, too, between Peter  and his ex-wife (Blythe Danner).  </P> <P> As written by New York Daily News sportswriter Mike Lupica from his book of the  same name, the script gives Dobson a lot more snappy patter than is needed.  Likewise, he gives us more incredible plot than is needed and it stumbles over  itself before falling down of its own weight.  </P> <P> It proves that money, power and murder aren't enough anymore.

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Esselte to cut dividend despite return to black ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, has reported a SKr259m (Dollars 33m) profit after financial items for 1992, after the demerger of a lossmaking unit and rationalisation measures helped it turn round a 1991 loss of SKr416m. Despite this, the group is cutting its dividend to SKr2.50 per share from SKr5.25 because it says cash-flow has deteriorated and the market outlook is uncertain. Group profit would have been SKr124m higher in 1992 without the impact of currency losses caused by the depreciation of the krona. These, together with a worsening of market conditions towards the end of the year, prevented the group from meeting its June forecast of a SKr400m profit. Turnover fell to SKr9.91bn from SKr15.6bn, partly because of the recession but mainly because of the demerger of the company's Scandinavian-based distribution business which now operates under the name of Scribona. These activities contributed to the 1991 loss as did SKr416m in non-recurring costs caused by restructuring. The group's main unit, Esselte Dymo, which markets office products in Europe, Australia and the Far East, saw sales fall to SKr3.69bn from SKr4.01bn.</p>

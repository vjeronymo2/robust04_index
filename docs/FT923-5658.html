			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Rome spells out will to defend lira THE Italian government yesterday emphasised its determination to defend the lira following a bruising day for the currency on the foreign exchanges. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said: 'The government will adopt any measures that may become necessary towards maintaining the current central rate of the lira within the European Monetary System.' The government statement was seen as a last option before having to raise interest rates to defend the currency, which earlier in the day hit its floor against the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and brushed against its minimum permitted level against the Belgian franc. The lira has come under renewed pressure because of fears that a negative vote in next month's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty will derail plans for closer economic and monetary links between European countries' currencies. The commitment to such union is seen as one of the main factors obliging the Rome government to take firm action on reducing Italy's huge budget deficit. 'Realignment now makes no sense, as it would just require another one after a possible French no-vote. But interest rates will probably have to rise, probably after next week's bond issues', said one economist. Conflicting reports on the absence of support for the lira by the Bundesbank triggered uncertainty over whether the German authorities had deliberately decided to stay on the sidelines. A Bank of Italy spokesman stressed that support buying was part of every's central bank's commitment under the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The renewed weakness of the Italian currency, which regained some ground against the D-Mark earlier this week, sparked off renewed rumours of a rise in interest rates. On Thursday, Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro paid an unexpected visit to the central bank, where he discussed the lira's problems with its governor, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Mr Scalfaro's visit was widely interpreted as a sign of support for the bank's current policies.</p>

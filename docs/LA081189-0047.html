			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICE AUTOPSY;  </P> <P> SUCCESSOR TO FLAMBOYANT CORONER NOGUCHI TARGET OF MISMANAGEMENT CHARGES  </P> <P> It was just a few years ago that Los Angeles County's self-styled "Coroner to  the Stars," Dr. Thomas T. Noguchi, was demoted for poor management of the busy  medical examiner/coroner's office.  </P> <P> After a series of court battles in which Noguchi failed to get back his job,  the flamboyant former coroner settled into a job as a pathologist at County-USC  Medical Center. Now, his successor, Ronald N. Kornblum, who took over the  office in 1982, finds himself and his agency under intense scrutiny by county  and outside investigators.  </P> <P> Once again, there are allegations of poor management and criminal activity.  Some of the scrutiny was initiated by Kornblum himself, who hired a special  investigator to look into reports of wrongdoing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consulting Team Hired  </P> <P> How well the coroner's office is managed is being studied by the county  auditor-controller's office and a private management-consulting team hired by  the Board of Supervisors in June in response to growing complaints. The aim of  the private firm's study is to determine whether the office is "providing  effective and efficient services."  </P> <P> The district attorney's office is investigating whether coroner's office  employees helped mortuaries perpetuate a double-billing fraud involving  indigent veterans. Another case involves drivers for a defunct trucking firm  who were using phony county identification cards.  </P> <P> Other incidents referred to the district attorney's office include:  </P> <P> * Possible thefts from bodies by a coroner's investigator.  </P> <P> * Illegal use of a coroner's identification card to free someone from jail in  Mexico.  </P> <P> * Possible kickbacks to a coroner's employee from a private firm that finds  heirs.  </P> <P> * The discovery of a coroner's employee with burglar's tools near a looted Los  Angeles residence from which a body had recently been removed.  </P> <P> * The arrest of a coroner's investigative aide in a Memphis, Tenn., airport in  the company of a person with a large amount of cocaine.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert H. MacKenzie, who works in the prosecutor's major  frauds unit, is in charge of all criminal inquiries involving the coroner. He  declined to be interviewed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Blame Kornblum  </P> <P> But one former coroner's employee, who has been cooperating with investigators,  told The Times: "There are people in the coroner's office who should be in jail  right now."  </P> <P> Some blame Kornblum for the department's troubles.  </P> <P> Among them is Dr. Sharon I. Schnittker, a deputy medical examiner for 14 years  who resigned last fall to work for the Utah Medical Examiner.  </P> <P> "He's extremely aloof," Schnittker said. "He didn't attend doctors' meetings.  It was very difficult to discuss ongoing problems with him. . . . For me it  just reached an intolerable level. I found the whole environment just totally  chaotic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not His Strong Suit  </P> <P> Kornblum acknowledges that administration is not his strong suit. "I'm a  scientific person," he said. As for his administrative abilities, he said:  "I've never had any formal training. If I have an Achilles' heel, that's where  it is."  </P> <P> But his bosses apparently disagree. Given the pressures that Kornblum must  endure in the face of a growing workload and the problems he inherited from the  Noguchi era, the current coroner has done remarkably well, some officials said.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, Dr. Kornblum has done an excellent job in running a very  difficult department," said Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative  officer. "He gets high marks as a pathologist and, given the constraints, high  marks as an administrator."  </P> <P> For the last three years, county agency heads have been rated on their  performances and given pay raises by the Board of Supervisors based on these  evaluations. Dixon said performance ratings played a role in raising Kornblum's  salary to its current annual level of about $118,000 from $103,000, his pay  level when he was named permanent coroner on May 29, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Performing Satisfactorily'  </P> <P> "It's clear he has been performing satisfactorily or he would not have received  the increases he got," Dixon said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Dixon said, the coroner's office filled the long-dormant  post of chief deputy, giving the office a full-time administrator.  </P> <P> During Noguchi's 15 years as coroner, he frequently clashed with county  supervisors over his running of the department. Given to holding press  conferences whenever celebrities became coroner's cases and to taking on lots  of outside consulting work, Noguchi headed a department that was "basically  running itself," according to a county auditor. The office had a big backlog of  cases, the auditor found, and a lax security system had apparently allowed  coroner's employees to steal valuables and drugs from bodies and death scenes.  </P> <P> Kornblum heads what has become the nation's third-busiest coroner's office,  behind New York City and Chicago's Cook County. It handled 17,825 cases last  year. Its 16 doctors, including Kornblum, performed 9,027 post-mortems,  including 6,218 autopsies.  </P> <P> The office has 181 employees and a budget of $10 million. Given his  department's increased workload, Kornblum won an extra $729,000 this year from  the supervisors. "We've got too many cases to handle. We need more staff," he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Too Worried  </P> <P> Kornblum, 55, told The Times he was "not really too worried" about the current  investigations.  </P> <P> One reason Noguchi got into hot water was his penchant for taking on consulting  work and ordering his employees to help him conduct private research. His  critics complained that it interfered with the coroner's performance.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Kornblum disclosed in court testimony that he had asked his  niece, who works in a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department laboratory, to  test a suspected murder weapon for blood. At the time, Kornblum was testifying  as a $150-an-hour consultant in an Orange County murder case.  </P> <P> "It's true," Kornblum told a reporter. "It was not a very wise thing to do. I  thought it was the quickest way to resolve the case." He added that he does  consulting work "two or three times a year."  </P> <P> Kornblum said his niece did the work on her own time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hired by Noguchi  </P> <P> A graduate of UC San Francisco Medical School, the former Ventura County  coroner was hired by Noguchi as his chief of forensic medicine in 1980.  </P> <P> Kornblum believes that much of the current controversy about the department  stems from his hiring last March of Karl Harris, who has both an extensive  educational background, including a doctorate in psychology, and law  enforcement experience as chief of the police force that protects the campuses  of Los Angeles' community colleges.  </P> <P> Kornblum made Harris, 57, his assistant chief of investigations and then,  almost immediately, gave him a green light to form a special internal  investigative unit amid reports of internal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential Fraud  </P> <P> It was not long before Harris' sleuthing crew presented Kornblum with a  potential fraud case involving the burial of indigent veterans. Harris  uncovered evidence that some mortuaries, with the help of coroner's employees,  were billing the county and the Veterans Administration for the cremation and  mortuary expenses of poor veterans.  </P> <P> Under the alleged scam, a mortuary would first collect approximately $400 per  body from the county for burial costs. Then, with authorization from a contact  inside the coroner's office, the mortuary would also put in for burial benefits  to the Veterans Administration -- without reimbursing the county.  </P> <P> In this way, a dishonest mortuary could pick up as much as $1,400 per body,  said one former coroner's investigator.  </P> <P> Both the county auditor and the district attorney's office are investigating  the allegations. Assisting them is the investigative arm of the Veterans  Administration and the U.S. Secret Service, according to an informed source.  </P> <P> With Kornblum's blessing, Harris' unit met more than a year ago with the county  chief administrative officer's head of special investigations, Harry Koulos, on  the alleged veterans scam. Koulos relayed the information to the county auditor  and the district attorney. Officials do not know how many bodies might have  been involved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Phony Identification Cards  </P> <P> Harris' crew also found that drivers for the defunct trucking firm, Central  Transportation of Sunland, were using phony county identification cards when  they picked up bodies at homes and hospitals. Officials of the firm, hired  without a contract to reduce some of the coroner's drivers' workload, said they  had the cards printed to cut the red tape involved in taking possession of  bodies.  </P> <P> Firm officials said they had authorization to have the cards printed from a  coroner's official, Gary Siglar, who had not obtained county identification  cards for Central Transportation's drivers. Siglar denied giving such  authorization.  </P> <P> In addition, authorities are investigating whether any of Central  Transportation's drivers, some of whom have felony records, had anything to do  with burglaries at the homes where they had picked up bodies.  </P> <P> Between May, 1988, and last February, continuing internal investigations turned  up about 80 problems, ranging from alleged criminal wrongdoing to shoddy work,  a knowledgeable source told The Times. The individual, a key source for  government investigators, asked for anonymity.  </P> <P> Harris and Kornblum, meanwhile, had a falling out and Harris left at the end of  1988. "Kornblum had an opportunity to clean house and make it a squeaky-clean  department," said Harris, who believes he was forced out for doing his job too  well. "He just dropped the ball because he fears publicity. He just covered it  up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Probably a Mistake'  </P> <P> Kornblum, however, said Harris ran amok.  </P> <P> "Frankly, hiring (Harris) was probably a mistake," Kornblum said.  "Unfortunately, he took a bad situation and made it worse. . . . It was my own  fault for allowing it to happen. (Harris' internal investigative group) became  their own little private Gestapo."  </P> <P> A final determination of any wrongdoing on the part of any coroner's employee  may be months away.  </P> <P> J. Tyler McCauley, the veteran chief of the county's audit division, is  coordinating the audit. The county staff work is being augmented by the Harvey  M. Rose Accountancy Corp., which is preparing a $180,000 management study due  by mid-November.  </P> <P> Rose, a former California auditor-general, and his San Francisco-based firm  have a long track record.  </P> <P> "We've done work for 28 grand juries in 16 counties since 1982," Rose said. "My  staff lives, eats and breathes government operations."  </P> <P> Three outside experts are working with Rose's staff:  </P> <P> * Dr. Richard Mason, forensic pathologist for the Santa Cruz County  sheriff-coroner, will study the efficiency of the coroner's doctors.  </P> <P> * Dr. Randall C. Baselt, director of the Chemical Toxicology Institute of  Foster City, will analyze the coroner's lab work.  </P> <P> * Wesley Johnson, a retired Santa Clara County assistant sheriff, will evaluate  the coroner's investigations.  </P> <P> Times Community Correspondent Karen Denne contributed to this article.  </P></p>

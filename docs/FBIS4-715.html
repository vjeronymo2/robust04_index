Even when escorted by UN vehicles you must not hang  about here, because bullets sometimes whistle past all around  you. On the left is the former rebels' billet, which today is  the core of the pocket of resistance taken by the RPF in the  northeast section of the capital. To the right, just below the  hill, extends a vast no-man's land, where its commandos venture  out. [passage omitted]</p>

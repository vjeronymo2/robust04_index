			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR AMERICA AND DRUGS IN LAOS  </P> <P> In "Fury Won't Make the Truth Go Away," (Column Left, Commentary, Sept. 20)  columnist Alexander Cockburn makes the serious charge that I doctored a later  edition of my book "Air America" to enhance the reputation of the protagonists  of a second book I was writing. This is completely untrue.  </P> <P> The chapter on opium in my book "Air America" is expanded and updated -- not  dropped -- to take into account further research. While writing a second book  on the secret war in Laos -- "The Ravens" -- I inspected numerous documents  that were classified when I first started my research, and conducted interviews  with people involved in all aspects of the war.  </P> <P> I concluded that the drug-smuggling in Laos was conducted by high military  personnel in the Laotian military, and these were the people who profited from  it. Unable to control their clients' activities, the U.S. government and the  CIA turned a blind eye.  </P> <P> This view is backed up by Prof. Al McCoy whose "legendary research" Cockburn so  admires. McCoy states in his book, "The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia":  "Unlike some national intelligence agencies, the CIA did not dabble in the drug  traffic to finance its clandestine operations." Again, McCoy points the finger  at the Laotian military. And the professor has not been banned from mainstream  academia, as Cockburn says, but enjoys tenure at the University of Wisconsin.  </P> <P> Similarly, Prof. William Leary, at the University of Georgia -- who has  conducted exhaustive research into Air America -- concludes that "portions of  the Laotian air force and high officials of the Laotian government" were the  culprits in the drug trade.  </P> <P> A recent article in the New Yorker states that it is still the Laotian military  today that conducts the drug trade -- under a communist government.  </P> <P> Cockburn seems to have an ideological need to believe the trivialized and  distorted view of the cartoon version of Air America, which is the movie --  described by its own screenwriter as "a fun, zany thing for the whole family,  with laughs aplenty and big things blowing up."  </P> <P> It is the movie -- and its misguided true-believers -- who are ignoring the  truth, not those of us -- often from opposing political positions -- who have  spent years of research in trying to shed light on a complicated and difficult  subject.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER ROBBINS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

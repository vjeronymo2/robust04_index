In a speech to the NDP's political club last night, Dr. Wali  said that the points of agreement with the opposition leaders  were far greater than those of disagreement. He said the  dialogue is a good initiative because it has enabled the  opposition parties to comprehend the NDP's views. It has also  enabled the party's bureau staff to understand the concepts of  the opposition party leaders concerning the national dialogue  issue.    Dr. Wali said that he will meet with the leaders of the  Greens Party and the Democratic Unionist Party by the end of  this week. Meanwhile, the NDP's bureau staff will meet with the  officials in charge of AL-AHRAM's Strategic and Political  Studies Center, which is exploring the various opinions about  the national dialogue issue.</p>

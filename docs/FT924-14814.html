			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Nafta treaty initialled in Texas NEGOTIATION of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was formally concluded in San Antonio, Texas, yesterday with a symbolic initialling by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's commerce secretary, and Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade and industry minister, Our Foreign Staff reports. They were flanked by the leaders of their respective countries. The initialling must still be followed by formal signing and ratified by each nation's legislatures. President Bush hopes the treaty will boost his electoral chances, especially in states thought to gain from extra US-Mexican trade, hence the choice of Texas for the initialling. However the conditional support of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, for the treaty is likely to reduce, if not eliminate, any such advantage. An opinion poll by the Mexican Institute of Public Opinion showed 48 per cent of Mexicans asked supported Nafta, down from previous estimates by other organisations.</p>

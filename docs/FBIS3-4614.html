Vice Information Minister Yi Kyong-chae presided over a  related commitee meeting that agreed to keep a close watch on  articles in local newspapers regarding next year's elections for  regional governors and mayors, and to take strong  administratitve action against publishing violations such as  advance election campaigning or defamation.    The committee, comprising directors-general of the Home and  Labor Ministries, Prosecutor-General's Office, Office of  National Tax Administration, National Police Agency and Office  of Legislation, decided to act strongly against local dailies  and weeklies carrying provocative and lewd articles and  photographs.    It will conduct a national survey on quasi-media twice this  year and a comprehensive study of weekly newspapers and  magazines, as well as closely monitoring insolvent publishing  companies and areas with frequent reports on quasi-journalists.    Through third-round surveys last year, the committee  cancelled the registrations of two newspapers, stopped eight  local papers from publishing and arrested 200 quasi-journalists.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (7): Following at snail's pace - Jonathan S. Schwarz discusses tax regimes' imperfections TAX LAWS follow several steps behind business innovation. While financial institutions have developed and marketed sophisticated and inventive financial instruments, tax systems have adapted at a snail's pace. Comprehensive tax regimes for foreign exchange gains and losses and financial instruments designed to manage currency and interest rate risks are still in their infancy. As a result, tax authorities and payers alike struggle to adapt existing tax rules to these transactions. Not only are results obtained unsatisfactory, but the tax consequences of legitimate transactions are often uncertain. On the other hand, tax authorities are uneasy because of potential revenue losses arising out of the use of increasingly sophisticated and complex instruments. The US has shown the way with tax legislation specifically on foreign currency transactions. The US Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent amendments codified numerous aspects of foreign currency transactions. Regulations are used to clarify certain aspects of the taxation of a number of financial risk-management instruments, such as notional principal contracts including many hedging instruments. Although London is one of the three key international financial centres, it is only in 1993 that UK legislation codifying the taxation of financial risk management transactions has appeared. There has thus been pressure on multinational corporate groups to move profitable treasury functions to tax-favoured locations such as the Dublin Docks or Belgian co-ordination centres. In the UK, tax on foreign-currency gains and losses has until now been taxed under general principles. The traditional distinction between income and capital has caused numerous difficulties in this area. Revenue receipt or expenses are included in computing taxable income, while capital gains or losses on capital assets are determined separately. Capital gains and losses are not recognised generally for tax purposes until realised. In addition, gains and losses arising in respect of capital liabilities are outside the tax system. Transactions that fit together commercially may be awkwardly asymmetrical once tax has been taken into account. Difficulties in relation to currency gains and losses have long been recognised. In 1989, the Inland Revenue issued a consultative document on the tax treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses. It proposed symmetry in taxing exchange gains and losses on the same basis with respect to timing methods and amounts. It tentatively proposed the abolition of the distinction between capital and income in respect of foreign exchange, gains and losses arising in the course of trade. In March 1991, the Inland Revenue issued a further consultative document on the reform of the tax treatment of currency gains and losses. This formed the basis for measures included in the 1993 Finance Act. The new law deals primarily with gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. Generally, qualifying assets and liabilities are those debts not convertible into equity, contracts to acquire foreign currency and foreign currency itself. The rules which are contained in more than 50 sections and four schedules to the Act provide that exchange differences on monetary items are to be included in taxable profits on a translation basis. They will fall outside the capital gains regime. Currency contracts are subject to tax as if the currencies were acquired when the contract is entered into. Fluctuations over the life of the agreement in relation to sterling are taxable or deductible. Complex transitional rules determine the applicability of the new regime. Given the fact that a number of areas are still to be clarified by regulation and the necessary overlap between these rules and the rules relating to financial instruments, it will be some time before its impact can be fully assessed. There are few provisions under current UK tax law specifically dealing with financial instruments. The rules have been unco-ordinated and unfocused. Corporate users of financial instruments are faced with different rules for traded futures and options, as opposed to other futures and options for example. Similarly, swaps with UK banks or swap traders are treated differently from any other swaps. In 1989, the Inland Revenue issued a consultative document on the taxation of financial instruments for managing interest rate risks. The document focused specifically on swaps. Then, current practice tended to discriminate against non-bank entities in the UK swap market. Under the proposals, recurring swap fees would be assimilated to interest. Because swap payments were assimilated to interest, other rules would apply such as thin capitalisation rules and treaty provisions dealing with interest. A further consultative document was issued by the Inland Revenue on financial instruments in 1991. The government objectives were to recommend how payments and receipts should be characterised for tax purposes, to include as many instruments as possible that are commonly used for managing interest-rate risk, and to provide rules for the timing of recognition of payments and receipts for tax purposes that are consistent with ordinary commercial accounting. Specific anti-avoidance measures to protect the Exchequer were proposed. These proposals are broadly enacted in new draft clauses, released on August 20 this year, and are expected to be included in the next Finance Bill. The draft clauses are designed to dovetail with the new currency regime. It therefore applies to companies, but excludes several entities taxed as companies, such as unit trusts and offshore funds. Special rules are provided for special taxpayers such as insurance and mutual trading companies. Taxation may be on a 'mark to market' basis. This taxes payments and receipts in each accounting period and changes in the value of the underlying instrument over its life. Alternatively, an accrual basis method may be adopted. Payments and receipts under all swaps and financial hedging instruments are to be treated as income, and therefore deductible and taxable accordingly. Most instruments primarily used for currency and interest-rate risk management are covered. They include swaps and other instruments involving periodic payments which are either fixed or determined by reference to the application of an interest rate to a notional principal amount. These include interest-rate caps, collars and floors. There must be at least one receipt or payment determined by a variable interest rate. Single period instruments are also included. These include forward rate agreements, interest-rate futures and options, as well as currency futures and options. Clearly, the Inland Revenue is suspicious that sophisticated financial instruments may be used to confer unintended tax benefits. As a result, several anti-avoidance provisions are included. Withholding tax will apply to payments made by UK resident companies to parties in tax haven countries or in territories where there is no interest article in an applicable tax treaty. It is ironic that, while the tax rules relating to instruments for the management of interest-rate risks have moved towards an accrual based system, the rules relating to the taxation of interest have not. The UK continues to apply the old-fashioned cash basis. A number of key international issues remain unsolved. Although the UK has opted to treat payments on qualifying financial instruments as interest, it is unclear whether such payments will always be interest for tax treaty purposes. There is a strong body of opinion that the definition of interest for treaty purposes must follow the definitions in specific treaties. Payments under swaps, for example, are often classified as 'other income,' which commonly escapes taxation under many tax treaties. In some circumstances, they may also be regarded as 'business profits,' which escape taxation in the absence of a permanent establishment. This will be of particular importance in relation to those treaties where withholding tax on interest is not entirely eliminated. In the European Community, the Commission is arguing that the Parent Subsidiary directive be extended to interest payments. The directive eliminates withholding tax on dividends from companies at least 25 per cent owned by a parent in another member state. This would be a step forward, but would only solve the problem for related party transactions. A single market in financial instruments will not emerge in the EC until withholding tax barriers have been eliminated. The risks of double taxation, or indeed double non-taxation, as a result of inconsistent categorisation of financial instruments, traps and opportunities arising from differences in timing of recognition of income and deduction and withholding tax problems continue. Transfer pricing will continue to be a crucial issue where centralised treasury functions are carried out for group companies in multiple jurisdictions. Jonathan S.

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Stability vital, Gatt tells South Africa SOUTH AFRICA has considerable potential as a market, a supplier and a host for new investments, but political stability will be essential, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published today. The report notes that the severe recession since 1989 has led to an annual drop in per capita incomes of 3 per cent a year and a loss of one million jobs. Unemployment has risen to record levels and over 40 per cent of the labour force is estimated to be outside the formal economic sector. 'The immediate challenge is to regenerate growth in the context of policies aimed at social advancement,' Gatt says. 'To this end, a reorientation of production away from emphasis on satisfying limited domestic demand and more along the lines of South Africa's comparative advantage should lay the foundation for sustainable growth.' The report says that between 1985 and 1989 sanctions, especially financial sanctions and the disinvestment campaign, may have cost 13 per cent of 1991 gross domestic product. Trade sanctions were less effective, lopping perhaps 7 per cent off export earnings. Though the process of dismantling sanctions began in 1990, Gatt argues that many of South Africa's economic problems are home-grown, resulting partly from the apartheid system which created damaging rigidities in resource allocation, and partly from inward-looking policies that stressed import substitution at the expense of exports. Rising labour costs, persistent inflation and business concentration have hurt competitiveness. Gatt says that with the lifting of sanctions South Africa is now looking to fashion more outward looking trade policies, and has made some progress in removing import controls, reducing tariffs and lowering import surcharges. Deregulation, privatisation and macroeconomic stabilisation 'are being cautiously pursued'. However, the tariff regime is 'far from stable or transparent' and industry remains heavily protected by high trade barriers and reliant on expensive export subsidies. Gatt's governing council, which discussed the report yesterday, urged South Africa to implement economic reforms more rapidly, undertake autonomous trade liberalisation and improve its modest tariff offer in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.</p>

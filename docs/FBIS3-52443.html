			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is to be no decision on the final disposition  of the controversial expansion of the Bet Orot Yeshiva on the  Mount of Olives until proper approval by the Jerusalem Planning  Commission. This was made clear by Mayor Ehud Olmert last night,  who ordered the removal of the seven mobile homes placed on land  adjoining the yeshiva. The mayor says the religious seminary  does not have all the necessary permits for the move. At the  same time, Olmert told reporter Mark Weiss, that he still  supports the construction of permanent buildings at the East  Jerusalem site to house the yeshiva students and their families  -- a move opposed by the previous mayor, Teddy Kollek.    [Begin recording] [Olmert] I think this is a private  property, belongs to a Jew. I see no problem in that particular  area, which is not densely populated by Muslims and Arabs; that  there can be an institution. I don't think that the east side  of Jerusalem should be empty of any Jewish presence; on the  contrary. And, I don't remember that anyone was protesting when  the Mormons were building a big university and a big campus.  It's not Muslim, it's not Arab, and yet it was built and no one  protested. Only when a Jew wants to build something in that  particular area, and everyone protests. And, I don't quite  agree with that.    [Weiss] And how do you react to the criticism that a move at  this stage in the peace process could jeopardize the talks?    [Olmert] I don't see that there should be any connection  between this and the peace process. If the peace process does  not apply to Jerusalem, as everyone says, why should it be  applied? Jerusalem is out of the context at the present time,  it's supposed to be out of the context at the present time. We  talk about Jericho and about Gaza, not about Jerusalem. [end  recording]    Meretz Knesset Member Avraham Poraz has called on the  attorney general to annul the Jerusalem Planning Commission's  decision to allow building on the Bet Orot site. Poraz charges  that the decision was illegal.</p>

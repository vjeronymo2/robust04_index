			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC NEWS: CHALLENGES AT KUSC: REACHING THE YOUNGER LISTENER  </P> <P> "We see that the classical music (radio) station, as we have known it, is a  dead art form -- either losing ground or going out of business," says Wallace  A. Smith, president of USC Radio, the new umbrella title for KUSC-FM and its  affiliate stations. "This is because the traditional stations have not kept  current with the newer people who are interested in classical music."  </P> <P> Also, he says, "While we weren't looking, two generations of potential  listeners have been deprived of music in the public schools, and have grown up  without that exposure."  </P> <P> Attracting new and younger listeners becomes a first priority, given these  conditions, Smith believes. He expects his new team of administrators to  implement that priority.  </P> <P> "It's a tremendous challenge, but one we can address by very carefully  broadening our repertory. By expanding our limits without changing the formats  our present listeners enjoy."  </P> <P> With the appointment of three members of what he calls "the senior management  team," Smith takes the first step in what he calls the "reinvention of KUSC for  the '90s."  </P> <P> In May, Tom Deacon of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. will become vice  president for programs. Judith Leventhal of WNYC Communications Group will be  vice president for finance and administration. And William V. Kappelman,  currently director of engineering and operations at KUSC, will be given vice  presidential authority for those areas. Under Smith, these three will become  responsible for planning and implementing "new directions for USC Radio."  </P> <P> At the creation of USC Radio when Smith returned to Los Angeles in August -- he  had spent 11 months as an administrator at WNYC AM/FM in New York City -- the  organization began a reassessment of its mission, Smith told The Times last  week.  </P> <P> "I realized that in my first tenure here we were preoccupied with cultivating  partnerships, making KUSC a part of the musical community. That was important  then. But, what I failed to do, that time around, I want to achieve now: To  make KUSC a great radio station."  </P> <P> ON THE FESTIVAL PATH: The 13th annual Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston,  S.C., takes place between May 26 and June 11. In 1989, Gian Carlo Menotti's  late-spring gathering in the historical Southern city offers Bellini's "La  Straniera" (with Carol Neblett in the title role), "Le Nozze di Figaro," Laurie  Anderson's "The Electronic Theater," the world premiere of Astor Piazzolla's  "Tango/Orfeo," the Boston Ballet and the Trisha Brown Company, four jazz  concerts, daily chamber music events, recitals and visual arts. Write: P.O. Box  704, Charleston, S.C. 29402.  </P> <P> The world premiere of a work by American composer Stephen Paulus, a mounting of  Boito's "Mefistofele," and guest appearances by Frederica von Stade, Jeffrey  Kahane, Garrison Keilor and the male vocal group Chanticleer -- would you  believe these are offerings at the Oregon Bach Festival in Eugene in 1989?  Well, believe it. Of course, Helmuth Rilling's much-admired, fortnight-long  festival also promises Bach, as well as Beethoven, Bartok and Monteverdi. For  brochure, call: (503) 686-5666.  </P> <P> In Colorado, the 41st Aspen Music Festival, June 23-Aug. 20 -- nine weeks of  daily concerts, master classes and symposia -- offers Rossini's "Moses in  Egypt," two Britten operas, a sixth annual medical conference on the problems  of dancers and musicians and a number of special events. For information, write  Box AA, Aspen, Colo. 81612.  </P> <P> The Catalina Festival of Chamber Music, sponsored by the Da Camera Society of  Mount St. Mary's College, will present its third edition, June 2-4, in and  around Avalon. Twelve concerts at seven sites will be given, featuring the Da  Camera Players (Delores Stevens, music director) and the Angeles String  Quartet. Those sites include the Airport in the Sky, Casino Theater, the Zane  Grey Pueblo Hotel, Avalon Community Church, the Inn at Mt. Ada and the Bird  Park. In addition, three special events mark this weekend: a Friday night  welcome party at the Casino Ballroom; "Stuart Whitman Reads Zane Grey" at the  Zane Grey mansion and, back at the Casino Ballroom on Sunday morning, a  champagne brunch/live radio broadcast by festival director MaryAnn Bonino.  Information: (213) 746-0450, Ext. 2211.  </P> <P> BEL CANTO WINNER: A shopping mall usually isn't the site of a formal opera  competition, except in Santa Monica where, on April 6, Michael Taylor of  Belmont, along with four other finalists, stood before clusters of shoppers in  the center court area of Santa Monica Place and won the Bel Canto National  Operatic Competition.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old baritone, a graduate student at the San Francisco Conservatory,  sang arias (from "Carmen" and "Pagliacci") to win a six-week scholarship to  study opera in Siena, Italy, this summer.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Bel Canto Foundation, which has been sponsoring opera  competitions in shopping malls since 1987, claims the idea really isn't that  odd because opera itself originally began in marketplaces in Italy.  </P> <P> 'LOVE' SCREENING: Violinist Arnold Brostoff of the Chicago Symphony will lead a  live, 21-member orchestra in his recently composed score to the 1927 silent  film, "Love," which will be shown Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Royce Hall at UCLA.  </P> <P> The veteran Chicago musician -- he has been a member of the Symphony since 1964  -- says he was inspired to write the 1 1/2-hour work, in which he will serve as  his own violin soloist, after he saw Greta Garbo's performance as Anna Karenina  at a screening of the film two years ago. (This was the first film in which  Garbo plays Anna Karenina; she made a second in 1934.)  </P> <P> "I was just knocked out," recalls Brostoff. "There's a naturalness about her,  an emotional look. A femininity." Describing his composition as "eclectic in  nature" but "not terribly new in sound," Brostoff adds that he included Baroque  elements in the music because, in his mind, "that's the sound of love."  </P> <P> The Turner Entertainment Co., which owns the rights to "Love," has expressed  interest in Brostoff's musical score when it shows the Edmund Goulding movie on  its cable television network, the violinist says.  </P> <P>  Calendar intern Frank A. Fisher contributed to the research for this column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

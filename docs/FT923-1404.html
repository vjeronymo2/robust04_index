			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Domestic economy shows no growth in Japan THE Japanese domestic economy was virtually stagnant in the second quarter of this year, according to a clutch of official figures published yesterday. Domestic demand did not grow between April and June, with only net export growth and income from investments abroad pushing the economy to meagre growth, according to figures published yesterday by the Economic Planning Agency. The stagnation in the domestic economy was confirmed by a government survey of household spending in July which found the average household spent Y347,025 (Pounds 1,570), unchanged from the same month last year. Japan's gross domestic product grew by 0.2 per cent and gross national product by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, only because the weakness of the domestic economy was offset by external factors. Economic growth in the short-term hinges on government spending and export performance. Growth in domestic demand was just below zero because higher government investment, which rose by 7 per cent from the first quarter and a modest upturn in the housing market, offset a 2.4 per cent cut in corporate investment, a 20.5 per cent reduction in the rate of growth of inventories and stagnant personal consumption. Increased real net exports contributed 0.3 per cent to the overall growth rate. However the growth in net exports was in large measure a reflection of the weakness of the domestic economy because imports fell by 4.8 per cent, a steeper decline than exports which were 3 per cent down. The other external source of growth was income from investments abroad which contributed 0.1 per cent of the GNP growth rate. Domestic demand may have continued to be flat over the summer according to the household spending survey by the Management and Co-ordination Agency which found average household spending, before adjusting for inflation, rose by 1.5 per cent in July compared with a year before. With official estimates of inflation running at about 2 per cent, this means real spending is likely to have fallen. Spending on housing rose by about 2.9 per cent mainly because of rent increases. Parents' spending on their children's education has been protected from the recession, with a 3 per cent increase. However one sign of how deep the downturn is starting to bite into family budgets was a 4.9 per cent fall in spending on shoes and clothes and a 0.4 per cent cut in spending on food. Spending is falling even though the Japanese 'salaryman' is yet to suffer a significant cut in his income. Incomes for salaried workers rose 6.3 per cent in the year to July, compared with a 1.8 per cent cut in incomes for manufacturing workers mainly because of lower bonuses and less overtime.</p>

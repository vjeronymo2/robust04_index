			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels/Geneva, 13 Feb (DPA) -- Colombia suffered a  major diplomatic setback and was isolated in the "banana war"  when it unilaterally announced the withdrawal of its demands to  the GATT, and the EU disregarded its urgent request to maintain  the quota distribution offer made in December 1993.    New and significant details were disclosed the weekend of 11  February regarding the desperate diplomatic efforts made on 10  and 11 February by Colombian Ambassadors Carlos Alberto  Marulanda in Brussels, and Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez in Geneva  following Costa Rica's withdrawal from the group made up also of  Nicaragua and Venezuela.    In a last and desperate attempt to convince the Europeans to  maintain the quotas, Colombia sent a letter to GATT disclosing  its decision to withdraw its demands against the questioned  European regulations for banana imports so long as the EU offer  was still standing. The letter was accompanied by a new offer  made by the Colombian Government to the EU, which proposed a  23.4-percent increase in the relative percentage of the total  quota for Costa Rica while for Colombia the quota was set at 21  percent, for Nicaragua, 3 percent, and for Venezuela, 2 percent.    The EU ignored the Colombian request, from this sterile  fight  among the Latin American countries and decided definitively to  withdraw the 14-December offer once the decision by the GATT  committee of experts was revealed on 11 February in Geneva.  This decision declared the EU regulations for banana imports  discriminatory and in violation of international trade rules.    Rene Steichen, the European commissioner for agricultural  affairs, said that the formula that proposed an increase of the  quota to 2.2 million in 1995 and a distribution of quotas and  licenses among the Latin American exporting countries had been  discarded because two of the exporting countries, namely Costa  Rica and Guatemala, had not accepted it.    In this manner, Colombia's position, which it had secretly  negotiated with the EU, fell apart and at the same time  compromised Nicaragua's and Venezuela's position, two countries  that had supported Colombia's stance.    A diplomatic source close to the other countries (Colombia,  Nicaragua, and Venezuela) indicated that Costa Rica's attitude  caused "considerable unease" within the group. The weakening in  this group's position reinforced the stance held by Ecuador,  Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Mexico who are challenging the  European import system and have presented a counterproposal  consistent with GATT regulations and currently under evaluation  by the EU.    Diplomatic sources have pointed out that Ambassador  Marulanda's performance, the obvious proponent of the secret  negotiations held last year during a three month period with the  EU in Brussels, is fully backed by President Cesar Gaviria and  his Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos. It has been  learned that Marulanda is expected to return to Colombia in the  next few days in response to his government's summon.    Since last Wednesday, the Governments of Ecuador, Guatemala,  Honduras, Panama, and Mexico increased their high-level contacts  with Costa Rica following President Gaviria's and Trade Minister  Santos' unsuccessful bid to persuade Ecuadoran Vice President  Alberto Dahik, currently visiting Santa Fe de Bogota, to adhere  to Colombia''s thesis.    Following the inevitable failure of the quota offer made by  the EU (which was brought about by Colombia's initiative), the  Latin American countries are now once again trying to close deep  wounds and restore lost unity. The announcement related to the  fall of the quota offer was made to the Latin American foreign  and trade ministers on Thursday in Brussels by Commissioner  Steichen himself when they delivered the counterproposal.    Costa Rica was the first country to realize in time the need  to reaccommodate its diplomatic position in light of the  strength of the other countries' initiative which is supported  within the GATT by Brazil and now also by the United States.    GATT General Director Peter Sutherland and EU Commissioner  Leon Brittan were advised of the U.S. position by Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor. Sutherland is attempting to  reschedule the 25 March deadline for an earlier date in order to  present proposals to improve the Uruguay Round offers (which  will finally be signed on 15 April in Marrakesh, Morroco). The  negotiating period with the EU expires on 28 March, before  experts committee decision on the banana issue is passed to the  GATT contracting parties council.    There is the likelihood that negotiations between Latin  American countries and the EU will take place sometime before 27  March. With the EU withdrawing the quota offer made on 14  December, the original offer No. 404 made in March 1993 on the  import system in effect since 1 July of last year remains  standing.    A better offer could rise from new negotiations between  Latin America and the EU which is in an uncomfortable position  as well as under pressure that the technical committee decision,  which establishes a poor precedent as regards international law,  will be made public during the meeting between the 117 GATT  member countries.    There are several formulas circulating around Brussels as  well as Geneva diplomatic and technical circles, including one  by the German Government, another by the U.S. Senate, in  addition to a counterproposal by a group coordinated now by  Guatemala. This proposal includes an assistance fund for those  banana producing countries who are signatories of the Lome  Treaty (Africa, Caribbean, and the Pacific).</p>

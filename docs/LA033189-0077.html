			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'SLOW MOVING TRAIN' CHUGS ON THE RIGHT TRACK  </P> <P> People probably use "Pinteresque" too much to describe a certain kind of stage  or film dialogue. But the term fits the cryptic Australian thriller, "Warm  Nights on a Slow Moving Train" (Beverly Center Cineplex). Most of the talk is  spare, allusive; everyday chatter sliced into stylized chunks, deceptively  casual but pointed badinage that seems to conceal sinister portents, inner  madness.  </P> <P> The movie suggests what might have happened if Pinter, Ionesco and Albee had  tried a joint invasion of "The Lady Vanishes." In "Warm Nights," every  conversation is, to some extent, a combat, a game or a riddle. The characters  are abstract, defined by their roles. Only one of them, a professional  politician, even has a name.  </P> <P> The central figure, the Girl (Wendy Hughes), is a chameleon-like hooker who  seduces men on a weekend night train, changing her personality to suit every  fresh conquest. At first, the film seems to be getting its mileage out of a sly  sexual reversal. The Girl treats men the way obsessive Don Juans often treat  female conquests: kicking them all out on the dot of 3 a.m., ignoring them  afterward. The train, hurtling through its endless night, with the same lounge  car piano revelry, the same metronomic clack-clack pace, is the site of  continuous erotic variations always building to the climactic zinger, "Of  course, you'll have to pay."  </P> <P> But gradually, the story becomes a fable about good, evil, the puzzles of  identity, the dangers of compartmentalizing love. The Girl has a "moral"  motive. And she meets a Man (Colin Friels) who seems to offer escape, love or a  darker, more dangerous temptation.  </P> <P> It would be wrong to synopsize more. "Warm Nights on a Slow Moving Train" gets  its effects almost entirely from the felicities of its acting and the  continuous twists and turns of the plot. It's best to go into it as cold as  possible.  </P> <P> Director-co-writer Bob Ellis was the scenarist for several of Paul Cox's films,  including "Man of Flowers," "Cactus" and "My First Wife." He has a gift for the  macabre humors of alienation and the pith of solitary pain. He knows how to  startle us with a quick twist of phrase, a sudden move in an unexpected  direction. It's a clever if abstract show in a dry, cold "House of Games" mood.  </P> <P> But, as a director, Ellis has almost no visual style. "Warm Nights" looks flat  and empty, and though this stylelessness has the merit of fixing attention on  the dialogues, it becomes monotonous, like the clack of the rails. There's also  something over the top and hasty about Ellis' last act. It comes too suddenly,  it's too drastic -- and it seems more metaphoric than dramatic.  </P> <P> It's the actors who make this train run on time, especially Friels as the rough  lover, Norman Kaye as a born-again widower, Peter Whitford as a gay steward and  Steve J. Spears as a funky singer. And, most of all, Hughes as the many-masked  prostitute.  </P> <P> Hughes has a thin face and pale, yearning eyes that make her great for  obsessive roles. Along with Kaye, she once beautifully limned the agonies of  sexual repression in Cox's "Lonelyhearts," and it's fun to see them eyeing each  other lecherously here, playing seduction games, nailing down together the  harsher solitude of joyless hedonism.  </P> <P> But there's no fun at the core. Hughes has the delicately balanced, distant  look of someone you'll never reach. She suggests both cold, calculated  sensuality on top and bitter resignation below; her face, in her near-anonymous  grapplings, takes on the ashen pallor of someone caught in a mechanical  embrace. For this woman, flesh is never warm, sweat is never wet, joy lies  bleeding and sex is always over, on the dot, at 3 a.m. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

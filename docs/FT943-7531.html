			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Airports to deal with noise disputes Heathrow and Stansted airports are to deal directly with complaints about aircraft noise from September 1, the government said yesterday. Responsibility for handling complaints at Gatwick was transferred to the airport in June, when Lord Goschen, aviation minister, said the other two London airports would follow. Complaints have been handled in the past by the Department of Transport, which will remain responsible for noise mitigation measures and for any complaints directly involving government aviation policy at Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick. Lord Goschen said yesterday: 'The transport department is seeking to increase the accountability of airports for the noise produced by their aircraft operations. 'These three airports are now in a particularly good position to deal directly with the public's complaints about noise and with requests for information,' he added. The decision was welcomed by the Heathrow Association for Control of Aircraft Noise. Mr John Boulton, chairman, said last night: 'At first we thought this self-policing would not be a good idea. But this should speed things up a bit and, we hope, lead to more direct accountability'.</p>

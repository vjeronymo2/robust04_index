			<p>BFN     [Text] As reported by the press service of the Defense  Ministry, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has come to know that  the ferrying of over 20 Tu-22 missile-carrier combat aircraft to  the Russian Federation is being made ready at two Black Sea  Fleet aviation regiments. It is planned that the flight will be  made against the background of regular tactical flight exercises  of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force from the air bases of  Oktyabrskoye and Veseloye in Crimea to the Russian military  airfield in Krasnodarsk kray's Krymsk.    The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  emphasizes that any attempts to transfer materiel and other  Black Sea Fleet material wealth outside our state, are against  the law and will inevitably lead to exacerbating the situation  surrounding issues of dividing the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

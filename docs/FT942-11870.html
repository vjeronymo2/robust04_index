			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Ecuador agrees bank debt deal: Pact aims to wipe out overdue foreign interest payments Ecuador and its leading bank creditors have reached an agreement in principle on a fundamental restructuring of its foreign bank debt. The deal is aimed at erasing overdue interest with foreign creditors for the first time since 1987. The accord, reached late on Monday by government negotiators and a committee of banks led by Lloyds Bank, covers about Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3.08bn) of capital and up to Dollars 3bn of overdue interest. Announcing the accord in Quito, President Sixto Duran Ballen emphasised that the country's status as a delinquent debtor had resulted in 'enormous difficulties in attracting foreign investment, generating employment and obtaining the necessary technology to compete internationally'. Under the Brady-style agreement, holders of debt principal will be able to exchange it either for 30-year bonds carrying a floating interest rate and a 45 per cent discount to face value, or for 'par' bonds with interest payments stepping up from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in the 11th year. As is common in Brady agreements - named after former US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady - the principal and one year of interest on the concessional bonds will be guaranteed by US Treasury bonds to be held in escrow as collateral. The government claimed that it also achieved a 20 per cent reduction on overdue interest of Dollars 3.1bn, although the calculation is based in part on contractual interest penalties which are generally not levied on such reschedulings. Most of the back interest will be repaid by the issue of 20-year bonds with a 10-year grace period before principal repayments are due. Mr William Camposano, senior vice-president at Lloyds in New York, said a full term sheet of the agreement should be in place and an international roadshow under way 'if all goes well' by the end of June. The government hopes to complete the deal this year. The government is expected to secure a standby loan agreement from the International Monetary Fund this month, and possibly also a rescheduling of its 1993 and 1994 maturities to the Paris Club of creditor governments. A maximum of Dollars 800m is available to provide initial payments and purchase collateral for the agreement. Ecuador never fully consolidated its bank debt, and though it agreed partial reschedulings in 1983, 1984 and 1985, it ceased fully servicing its debt in 1987. In the secondary market, the price of Ecuadorean debt rose yesterday before easing back later. Bankers close to the agreement were keen to avoid the negative reaction from banks that followed the recent agreement in principle with Poland. They emphasised that there would be no reallocation of choices once banks had made their initial choice and that all the collateral for the exchange bonds would be available immediately. This contrasts with the recently completed Brazilian agreement. They argued that there had been no big concessions on interest arrears. One said that in negotiating the agreement, the government had been aware that it would be 'presenting the package to a broader variety of creditors than would have been the case a few years ago'. This is a reference to the large number of private investors in such bank debt. These include the Dart family of the US, who refused to join the recent Brazil package and who are widely thought to hold positions in Ecuadorean and Polish debt. The accord will not need ratification by Congress, but some opposition politicians, while welcoming the agreement, noted that the current modernisation law forbids the use of the debt in privatisations.</p>

The correlation of supply and demand in  the labor market in the different countries changed in the  following manner in January and February this year (thousands of  people at the end of the month):    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Number of jobless applying f-|Enterprise personnel require-|  |              |or placement services        |ments reported to employment |  |              |                             |services                     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Countries     |January       |February      |January       |February      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Azerbaijan    |48.8          |49.7          |10.9          |10.4          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenia       |112.9         |115.5         |0.9           |1.3           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belorussia    |72.5          |76.7          |13.5          |11.6          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan    |...           |...           |27.8          |25.5          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kirghizia     |8.3           |9.6           |3.0           |2.9           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moldavia      |15.8          |17.1          |0.9           |1.0           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia        |1164.6        |1266.5        |282.7         |274.9         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tajikistan    |130.9         |143.1         |...           |17.4          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Uzbekistan    |30.1          |32.8          |26.2          |28.7          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine       |130.0         |138.0         |120.1         |108.4         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      There were disparities between the demand for manpower and  the supply in most of the states in February, just as there had  been in preceding months. In Azerbaijan there were 4.8 jobless  individuals for each vacant position in February 1994, as  compared to 3.1 in February 1993. The respective figures for  other countries were 92.2 and 74.8 for Armenia, 6.6 and 2.9 for  Belorussia, 3.3 and 1.8 for Kirghizia, 4.6 and 3.5 for Russia,  and 1.3 and 1.1 for Ukraine. In Uzbekistan the correlation  displayed virtually no change and was 1.1. In Tajikistan the  lower number of jobless individuals per vacancy (15.5 in  February 1993 and 8.2 in February 1994) was due to migration and  the resulting increase in the demand of enterprises for workers  (to fill the vacated positions).

The following data illustrate the dynamics of the  retail trade prices of consumer goods in the Commonwealth  states in January-February 1994:    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |In relation to same period o-|February 1994 in % of:       |  |              |f 1993, times                |                             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Countries     |Jan-Feb       |February      |Jan 94        |Dec 93        |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Azerbaijan    |8.4           |8.7           |122           |183           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenia       |43.8          |41.6          |113           |171           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belorussia    |32.0          |30.8          |124           |176           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Georgia       |...           |115.5         |141           |...           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan    |22.4          |22.3          |131           |190           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kirghizia     |12.6          |11.1          |116           |131           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moldavia[.sup]1|16.5          |16.5          |127           |184           |  |[/]        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia[.sup]1  |7.4*          |7.0*          |111           |130           |  |[/]        |              |              |              |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tajikistan    |16.0          |14.0          |94            |...           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Turkmenistan  |26.8          |23.7          |117           |143           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Uzbekistan    |12.1          |12.4          |118           |149           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine       |59.5          |55.5          |112           |139           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1. Consumer goods price index.                                            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The rise in food prices was relatively restricted in Armenia  (an increase of 11 percent in comparison with January), in  Russia (9 percent), and in Uzbekistan (8 percent). Food prices  in Tajikistan decreased by 11 percent. Meanwhile, food prices  rose 21 percent in Belorussia, 25 percent in Azerbaijan, and 28  percent in Moldavia in the past month.    In Kazakhstan the rise in food prices in February was 32  percent, and the prices were twice as high as they had been in  December. This was a result of the centralized cancellation of  earlier price controls on sales of the main food products to the  population (meat of all types, butter and vegetable oil, milk  and dairy products, eggs, noodles, sugar, and salt).    The highest increases in food prices in the organized trade  network in Russia in February were for milk and dairy products  (20-25 percent). The prices of bread and baked goods, cereal  grain, fish, and vegetables increased by 15-20 percent, and the  prices of meat and meat products rose 8-12 percent. The average  prices of milk, dairy products, bread, baked goods, and  vegetables in Russia were 1.4-1.5 times as high as in December  1993.    The retail price index for non-food items in February was  110  percent of the January figure in Russia, 116.2-117.1 percent in  Armenia and Azerbaijan, 125.5-128.5 percent in Moldavia,  Belorussia, and Kazakhstan, 131 percent in Uzbekistan, and  virtually the same as the earlier figure in Tajikistan.    The prices of agricultural produce in urban markets  continued  to rise. The following data illustrate the dynamics of prices in  this sales channel this year:    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Countries     |Feb 1994 in % |Feb 94 in % o-|Jan-Feb 94 in |Feb 94 in rel-|  |              |of Jan 94     |f Dec 93      |relation to J-|ation to Feb 9|  |              |              |              |an-Feb 93, ti-|3, times      |  |              |              |              |mes           |              |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Azerbaijan    |149           |239           |16.1          |17.1          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armenia       |115           |124           |96.6          |86.2          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Belorussia    |124           |181           |25.2          |22.9          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Georgia       |148           |--            |--            |679.9         |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazakhstan    |119           |165           |25.7          |23.9          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kirghizia     |114           |130           |9.0           |7.6           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moldavia      |114           |140           |12.6          |11.7          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia        |114           |133           |6.7*          |6.4           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tajikistan    |--            |--            |17.3          |7.6           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Turkmenistan  |150           |222           |48.3          |52.6          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Uzbekistan    |127           |117           |23.4          |24.5          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ukraine       |107           |132           |57.6          |52.1          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Prices in urban markets in Belorussia in February this year  in comparison with prices in February 1993 were 20.7 times as  high for meat products, 11.8 times as high for potatoes, 19.4  times as high for vegetables (including 11.7 times for fresh  cabbage and 43.8-47.0 times for onions and pickled cucumbers),  and 30.2 times as high for dairy products.    For citydwellers in Kazakhstan, potatoes cost 23.7 times as  much in urban markets this February as they did last February,  vegetables cost 35.8 times as much (40.6 times for fresh  cabbage, 58.9 times for onions, and 78.5 times for fresh  cucumbers); beef in republic markets cost 19.3 times as much,  pork and lard cost 22.9-27.0 times as much, dairy products cost  29.4 times as much, and honey cost 53.9 times as much.    Although the average increase in prices in Russian urban  markets in February 1994 in comparison with February 1993 was  6.4 times, the prices of vegetables were 18 times as high,  potato prices were 7.3 times as high, fruit prices were 5.1  times as high, the price of fresh milk was 8.3 times as high,  and egg prices were 7.4 times as high.

Including the turnover of urban markets, according to the data of a sample survey for  January-February--160.6 billion sum-coupons, with 86.8 billion sum-coupons in February.      Commodity turnover in Russia, including expert estimates of  the sales volume of unregistered (and therefore unrecorded)  enterprises and the unorganized imports and sales of goods from  other countries by private individuals, amounted to 23.8  trillion rubles in the past two months, or 7.5 times as much as  in the same period last year in current prices and 2.3 percent  more in comparable prices.    The private sector's share of the consumer market is  growing.  In Russia, for example, it represented (including consumer  cooperatives) 56 percent of all commodity turnover in  January-February 1994 (40 percent in January-February 1993), in  Turkmenistan it represented around 40 percent, and in Kazakhstan  it represented 49 percent.    In spite of the general reduction of 2 percent in the  physical commodity turnover of officially registered enterprises  in Russia in February 1994 in comparison with the same period  last year, food sales decreased by 3 percent, including  decreases of 9-17 percent for meat and poultry, canned meat, and  vegetable oil and of 24-30 percent for canned fish, eggs, and  sugar.    The organized trade network in Uzbekistan sold almost a  third  less meat and meat products than last year, sales of eggs and  cereal grains decreased by more than half, sales of sugar and  salt decreased by around 20 percent, sales of woolen fabric  decreased by 30 percent, and sales of clothing and linens  decreased by almost 40 percent.    Supplies of goods entering the retail trade network in  Turkmenistan were 16 percent smaller than last year's for meat,  34 percent smaller for sausage, and 56 percent smaller for  canned meats; deliveries to the retail network decreased by 41  percent for cotton fabric, 65 percent for woolen fabric, 44  percent for hosiery, and 22 percent for leather footwear. The  retail trade network in the republic did receive 1.4 times as  much lard as last year and 1.6 times as much tea, sugar, and  cheese.    The slowdown of sales of consumer goods increased commodity  stocks in retail trade. On 1 March, for example, the retail link  of the Armenian trade network had reserve stocks for 72 days of  trade, in comparison with 54 days on the same date last year.  The respective figures for other states were 60 and 48 days for  Belorussia, 73 and 53 days for Kazakhstan, 114 and 78 days for  Kirghizia, 53 and 47 days for Ukraine, and 43 and 41 days for  Russia. Supplies were approximately the same as last year in  retail trade in Azerbaijan (100 days), Uzbekistan (71 days), and  Moldavia (44 days); reserves in Turkmenistan decreased from 100  days on 1 March 1993 to 80 days of trade on 1 March this year.    The state of the market for paid services in 1994 in all  Commonwealth states was distinguished by a continued dramatic  decrease in physical volume accompanied by an increase in volume  in terms of cost.

Including services performed by private individuals--2.6 trillion rubles, representing 1100 percent  of the previous year's figure in actual prices and 54 percent of that figure in comparable prices.      The personal service sector is in a particularly  unsatisfactory state: The number of personal service enterprises  is still declining, and the reduction of the physical volume of  many types of personal services is sizable. In Belorussia, for  example, the number of studios and workshops decreased by 11  percent in the past year (and by 18 percent in rural areas);  shoemaking services decreased by 39 percent in comparable  prices, and tailoring services decreased by 45 percent, with  corresponding decreases of 60 percent in the repair and  maintenance of privately owned motor vehicles and 63 percent in  cabinetmaking services.    Paid services cost much more in February than in January  this  year in Armenia--an increase of 58.7 percent--and Azerbaijan--an  increase of 42.8 percent. The lowest service rate increases were  in Turkmenistan (6.8 percent) and Tajikistan (8.6 percent).    Public utility rates rose 5.4 percent in Belorussia, 27.2  percent in Moldavia, 3.5 percent in Tajikistan, and 241.4  percent in Uzbekistan.    Passenger transport fares rose 71.7 percent in Azerbaijan,  85.4 percent in Armenia, 10.4 percent in Belorussia, and 8.3  percent in Tajikistan.    Communication service rates increased by 68 percent in  Moldavia and 40 percent in Uzbekistan. The lowest increases were  in Kirghizia (1.6 percent), Tajikistan (4.1 percent), and  Kazakhstan (4.5 percent). The rates stayed the same in  Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.    Day-care fees for pre-schoolers rose 3.9 percent in Armenia,  0.6 percent in Belorussia, 56.5 percent in Kazakhstan, 47.2  percent in Moldavia, and 76 percent in Uzbekistan.    There were sizable increases in the rates of health care  services in Kazakhstan (117.8 percent) and Tajikistan (117.2  percent) and relatively small increases in Azerbaijan (12.1  percent) and Uzbekistan (26.2 percent). The most dramatic  increases in service rates in health resorts were in Azerbaijan  (94.1 percent) and Kirghizia (56.3 percent), and the smallest  increases were in Turkmenistan (10.3 percent) and Uzbekistan  (15.1 percent).

In January-February this year the average  milk yield at agricultural enterprises of Moldavia, Russia,  Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan was 20-30 kilograms less  than the yield in the same period of 1993. In several  Commonwealth states (Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) the  total output of milk decreased while the productivity of cows  increased, signifying a dramatic reduction of the herd in these  regions.    The total output of the main animal husbandry products in  February this year in comparison with February 1993 decreased in  all Commonwealth states, which is confirmed by the following  data (in

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 February Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] With regard to the issue of suspected nuclear arms  development by the DPRK (North Korea), a government source said  on the morning of 10 February: "If no progress is made at the  negotiations, there will be no other choice but to launch  economic sanctions." Thus, he disclosed his view that if North  Korea should keep on refusing nuclear inspections requested by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), economic  sanctions by the UN Security Council would become unavoidable.  As for the Japanese Government's actions if the UN Security  Council's decides to adopt economic sanctions, the same source  said: "As far as Japan is concerned, there is no other choice  but to cooperate. In other words, we will do our utmost within  the framework of the Constitution."</p>

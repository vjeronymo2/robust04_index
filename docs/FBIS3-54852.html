He said that the year 1993 had seen numerous significant  events such as withdrawal of Russian troops, introduction of a  permanent national currency, state of the law and order reform  and improved international prestige of the Lithuanian state.    The head of state said, however, that numerous problems  would  have to be faced in the economy, agriculture, manufacturing  industries and other areas.    The Lithuanian president expressed the hope that they would  be surmounted if the Seimas [parliament], the government and  other power and management agencies worked responsibly for  freedoms and rights, well-being and a better future of  Lithuania's residents, if the new year saw less suspicion and  hatred.</p>

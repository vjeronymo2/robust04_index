			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "Business Down for Eurocopter"; </F> AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction is  "Despite a rally in orders and excellent market penetration,  1994 will be another rough year."]    [Text] Just as CEO Jean-Francois Bigay predicted several  months ago, the Franco-German group Eurocopter has posted losses  of over 300 million French francs [Fr] for the 1993 fiscal year.  Depreciation and specific contingency provisions account for  Fr250 million of those Fr300 million. Eurocopter's turnover  comes to Fr 10.21 billion, down 10.5 percent over 1992.    Executive board co-president Siegfried Sobotta attributes  the  sales slump to a decrease in receivables from production  aircraft deliveries, which plummeted to 159 in 1993 from 211 in  1992. No one expects those deliveries to start creeping upward  again before mid-1995. Sobotta also sees the collapse as the  result of a "sharply deteriorated non-military customer base",  matched by a decline in service sales. "To adapt to this tough  economic situation, we have had to implement measures that  include staff cutbacks (a total of 1,060) in France and Germany,  reduced working hours, and lower stock levels to bring operating  costs under control," Siegfried Sobotta goes on to explain.    "1993 was a challenge way beyond anything we could have  imagined," admits Jean-Francois Bigay. "Both the civil and  military markets were disastrous--a level unlike anything we've  seen since 1965-67." Despite all these woes, results are  encouraging. "We took orders for Fr9.32 billion, including Fr4  billion for maintenance and Fr3.5 for new aircraft. New airplane  orders totaled 166 against 159 in 1992, despite a tough market."  Moreover, the new orders involved higher tonnages: 43  Cougar/Super Pumas against only 10 in 1992.    Market penetration results are also encouraging. Indeed,  Eurocopter has increased its civil market share to 54 percent of  the value of registered aircraft (compared to 51.5 percent in  1992), and 60 percent of the value of registered craft in the  parapublic sector. The group has also regained its pre-Gulf War  military market share, or 24 percent of the value of aircraft,  compared to 7.5 percent in 1992 (figures apply to the open  military market, outside the CIS and USA).    Nearly all these market shares have been won through  exports:  95 percent of the new helicopters are registered outside France  and Germany. This worries Jean-Francois Bigay, who notes that  "Too high a rate of exports makes a company fragile; [...] we  need national orders."    In any event, "1994 will be another rough year for the  group," Jean-Francois Bigay continues. "Although orders are up,  the effect will not be felt until 1995, and we expect another  10-percent decline in turnover."    "1994 will be quite a challenge for us," continues Bigay.  "Eurocopter will be consolidating to insure a calmer and more  active future for itself... We will need support from every  quarter to shore up our export position in 1994, while winning  more national orders." Eurocopter's objective is to cover 100  percent of the civil market's needs, and 80 percent of the  military market's needs by century's end.    No layoffs are planned for 1994. This is another challenge  the helicopter manufacturer has set for itself, one that depends  on its hopes to capture national orders within the next six  months.  <H5>  Boxed Material: NH-90 Opts for the RTM322 </H5>   Technical progress on the Tiger has been smooth, and the  NH-90 transport helicopter program has taken a significant step  forward with the final selection of several technical options.    --Engineers have chosen the RTM322 turbine of Rolls-Royce,  Turbomeca, MTU, and Piaggio. It will be developed and rated for  use in the naval and land versions of the NH90, while General  Electric's and Fiat Avio's T700 will be partially rated  ("brought to technical maturity") as a second engine, ostensibly  to equip Italy's 260 craft.    --Program planners no longer consider the rear ramp for the  French Army's tactical transport version an optional feature.  Instead they are taking it into account as they develop the  helicopter.    --The naval version's carrying capacity will be expanded to  include 700-kg missiles.    The other programs--the civil EC-120 and EC-135 and the  military Tiger, which is beginning tests of its navigational and  weapons systems--are moving ahead as planned. But the situation  in Russia is at a virtual standstill. The proposed joint venture  to develop the Mi-38 with Mil "has made little progress  organizationally", according to Sigfried Sobotta.</p>

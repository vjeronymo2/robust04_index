			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] The United States "is interested in protecting its  products, and this is why "it is accusing Panama of being a  mecca for forgeries of well-known brands in the Colon Free  Zone," according to Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) Deputy  Elias Castillo, chairman of the Education, Culture, and Sports  Committee. [quotation marks as published]    Castillo indicated that the problem stems from "the lack of  seriousness on the part of the authorities and businessmen" who  directly or indirectly are allowing counterfeiting in the Free  Zone.    "To prevent these kinds of problems, the Education Comittee  has drafted a bill, which was approved in a first debate and  submitted for the approval of the full Legislative Assembly,"  Castillo noted.    Referring to the sale of forgeries of well-known products  taking place in the Free Zone, the PRD deputy indicated, "the  authorities have to convey their seriousness to the manager in  order that he can project this Free Zone policy," and, in turn,  disprove the charges made by the top U.S. commerce  representative.    He added that the U.S. charges against Panama "show the U.S.  Government and Embassy desperately want Panama to approve the  copyright law as soon as possible," which punishes the forging  of well-known products.    The law against forgeries and other related intellectual  property rights infringements contains approximately 120  articles, which the Education Committee reviewed with officials  of the Commerce and Industries and Education Ministries.    LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA unsuccessfully tried by every means  possible to interview Luz Celeste de Davis, director of the  Industrial Registry Office of the Commerce and Industries  Ministry, on the charges made by the U.S. authorities.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANDS THAT DON'T MATTER  </P> <P> Out of the numerous letters I'm sure you received regarding Robert Hilburn's  article on the "20 Bands That Matter," did anyone ask, "Does anyone really  care?"  </P> <P> If Springsteen, U2 and Guns N' Roses are bands that matter, please let me place  my hat over my heart and state "Rock is dead." Pseudo-political lyrics,  three-chord songs and bad attitudes don't a band make.  </P> <P> Like most, I'm in no position to pick 20 bands that matter. In fact, I'm a KISS  fan. But heck, I wouldn't even think of putting them on the same list as Elton  John, the Who, James Brown and others. This leads me to wonder why Mr. Hilburn  continually puts Springsteen on his lists. . . .  </P> <P> DEREK IPAKTCHIAN  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

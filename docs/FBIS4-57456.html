			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] [EL PAIS] What is the sense of launching a campaign  for electoral freedom?    [Lacalle] The decision to support departmental  constitutional  reform, because this is a reform of the departmental  governments, has a scope for us that surpasses being a mere  episode of the reform, and it is an endeavor to get the country  moving toward a harmony that will help it achieve electoral  freedom.    The last century opened with a struggle among us for  electoral freedom, something essential for the National Party.  The 1870, 1897, and 1904 revolutions were not carried out in  order to take power, to overthrow the Colorado government; they  were carried out to obtain voting guarantees. We wanted to vote  freely and with guarantees.    This was being achieved until 1925 when the Election Law  that  was implemented by the Electoral Court closed the cycle for  seeking voting guarantees.    We can say without making a mistake that since 1925 we have  had complete voting guarantees and someone has said, not without  reason, that the revolution's objectives were obtained in 1925.    Then, another stage begins. We have the profuse legislation  on the Lema Law [intra-party tickets], or Lema Laws because  there is more than one, which gives us our current system.    We then go from the one and only list and ticket of the 1951  Constitution to departmental separation but within the same lema  in the 1966 reform. Now this new reform is being attempted. Now  the end of the century finds us facing a situation in which it  is notorious that the voter does not have full freedom.    [EL PAIS] Why do you say this?    [Lacalle] Because the simultaneous double vote is in a  certain sense a restriction of the popular will; because the  citizen in legal fiction says he votes for a certain party and  that within this party he prefers a certain candidate, but it is  the party that he really prefers.    Why is it that we talk about electoral freedom when  departmental reform comes up for discussion? Because we give the  voter another option.    The voter can combine his departmental option with his  national option; in other words, there is more freedom, there  are more options. Thus, the voter will combine one party with  another one by taking into consideration the management ability  more than party loyalty.    We believe this option within the constitutional reform is  the most adequate one at this time because at this time we begin  to commit our influence and political force as soon as the new  government is installed to begin a campaign for achieving  greater freedom.    We have observed that people have moved from one party to  another, and we believe that mechanisms must be sought that will  allow the voter to vote for his party at one level and for the  government at another.    It is also true that we propose using some of the points  contained in the last frustrated reform to help us with our  commitment.    [EL PAIS] In order to make it clear for the people. A  constitutional reform is going to be voted on in November and if  it is successful your idea will go into effect at that time?    [Lacalle] Of course. Of course. The two systems must be  voted  for simultaneously. For the system that is being proposed and  for the current system.    [EL PAIS] The same as in the 1971 elections?    [Lacalle] Yes, exactly.</p>

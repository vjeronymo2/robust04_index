			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATOR RAISED $58,429 TO FIGHT FORGERY CHARGES  </P> <P> Assemblyman John L. Lewis (R-Orange) raised $58,429 last year from fellow  legislators, trade groups, car dealers, hamburger magnate Carl Karcher and  others to pay for his legal defense against political forgery charges,  according to his economic interest form filed Thursday.  </P> <P> Lewis, a millionaire, faced felony charges of forging former President Ronald  Reagan's name on 1986 campaign literature for Republican Assembly candidates  despite the White House's express refusal to endorse the mailers.  </P> <P> On Jan. 23, a state appellate court in Sacramento threw out the criminal  charges, saying Lewis did not deprive anyone of property or money even if he  ordered the use of the phony presidential signature.  </P> <P> The attorney general's office has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme  Court.  </P> <P> Thursday's report shows that five of Lewis' current and former Republican  colleagues rallied to his legal defense, chipping in $25,800 from their  political campaign funds during 1989.  </P> <P> Leading in legislative largess were Orange County Assemblyman Dennis Brown  (R-Los Alamitos), whose committee gave $9,900, and former Assemblyman Bill  Duplissea of San Carlos, whose political chest kicked in a matching $9,900.  </P> <P> Others included Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), $4,000;  Assemblyman Eric Seastrand (R-Salinas), $1,000, and Assemblyman William P.  Baker (R-Danville), $1,000.  </P> <P> Trade groups or politically active organizations that also helped out included  the National Rifle Assn.'s Institute for Legislative Action in Washington,  which gave $500; the Mortgage Brokers Institute, $500; the Pacific Merchant  Shipping Assn., $500, and the Dental Plan Administrators, $2,000. Carl Karcher  Enterprises of Anaheim also gave Lewis $500.  </P> <P> Lewis could not be reached for comment Thursday.  </P></p>

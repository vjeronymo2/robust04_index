			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Property Market: French capital losses - The Paris slump is hitting banks hard Paris is facing up to one of its worst property collapses. Climbing vacancy rates and sharply falling values have created alarming difficulties for French banks and developers. Large financial restructurings are under way. In January, Mr Christian Pellerin, a developer of large tracts of La Defense, the office complex just outside central Paris, was replaced as chairman of Lucia, a property company undergoing a FFr1.1bn (Pounds 130m) capital reconstruction. Also last month, Pierre Premier, a developer, was forced to cede four-fifths of its property portfolio to the banks after incurring heavy losses. At the same time, the current round of results from banks are scarred by large bad loans to the property industry. Banks' total exposure to the industry is widely believed to exceed FFr400. Banque Paribas, which has just increased provisions to 15 per cent on its own FFr27.4bn property lending book, is not alone in facing up to heavy provisions. 'Statistics show that provisions of 15 per cent may be necessary but this varies greatly from bank to bank depending on the particular nature of the underlying credits,' says Mr Arnaud de Menibus, executive vice-president of Banque Paribas. Mr Robert Waterland, head of the Paris office of Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, believes the problem is far worse. He says the banks' write-downs will eventually exceed FFr100bn. The banks' predicament stems from the speculative frenzy that gripped the property market in 1988-89 when banks encouraged the upward spiral of prices by lending large sums to speculators promoting ambitious schemes. Many of the banks' heaviest losses have been on loans made to small traders, the so-called 'marchands de biens'. 'The quality of the small traders' real estate is abysmal,' says Mr Waterland. Banks are also facing large losses on speculative ventures, notably in a handful of large developments in central Paris. These new schemes were conceived at a time when Paris had little vacant office space. The completion of a large quantity of new offices this year could push the office vacancy rate in the French capital close to 10 per cent. Banque Paribas believes that the stock of empty offices in Paris could reach 4m sq m by December; this volume would take four years to absorb on normal take-up rates. The rising vacancy rate, together with the slowing economy, have pushed rents down by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent since mid-1991. At the same time, interest from buyers has evaporated, pushing estimates of prime yields up from less than 5 per cent to more than 6 per cent. As a result capital values have fallen by some 40 per cent. The Paris financial establishment is doing all it can to prevent a mood of crisis from developing. 'French banks are not going to get into the situation of Anglo-Saxon countries . . . There will be no Olympia &amp; York here,' said a spokesman for the Association of French Bankers last year. In an effort to prevent bankruptcies and forced sales of property, the banks are refinancing ailing companies and, in some cases, taking possession of property themselves. In the case of the stronger banks, such as Banque Paribas, the intention is to retain the property portfolios for several years before selling them, perhaps through a stock market flotation. In other instances, the banks are attempting to offload their repossessed property by selling it to companies which they have financed with low-interest loans. Another form of support is from the cross-holdings between banks, insurance groups and property companies, which allow stronger parents to bail out overstretched lenders and developers. None the less, mounting concern has prompted banks and insurance companies to appeal for government help. In December, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, responded by announcing the following: the relaxation of the agrement system, whereby tenants must obtain official authorisation for large office moves. This system, designed to encourage companies to relocate to the regions, curbed the take-up of space in Paris; the reinstatement of favourable tax treatment of finance leases, which may encourage owner-occupation; an extension to the four-year holiday on the 20 per cent transfer tax which is payable on property deals. This will ease the pressure on traders and banks needing to sell property in the short term. 'Too little, too late,' was the market's general reaction to these measures. 'Positive and useful, but insufficient,' said the AFB. The industry is continuing to pressure the government to do more. Last week, Mr Camille Cabana, the deputy mayor of Paris, proposed a public fund to lend money cheaply to developers in return for mothballing their projects and preventing yet more new offices flooding onto the market. But while the government may be prepared to help the construction industry and residential property market, it will be loathe to bail out speculators. The prospect of using public money to save the industry seems unlikely except in the event of a further sharp deterioration of conditions. But for the moment that eventuality is remote. Despite the banks' bad loans, the problems are still far from jeopardising the financial system. Indeed, there is a body of opinion which insists that the gloom is exaggerated. 'The economy is the strongest in Europe, the market is undersupplied with decent products, tenants can move freely,' says Mr David Robinson of Richard Ellis. 'When there is an upturn in the economy, the market will move quickly.' Mr de Menibus of Banque Paribas emphasises the underlying strengths of the market. 'Even if we take a pessimistic view of the market, it is not like the US or UK. It is a quite different crisis,' he says. 'Vacancy rates are much lower, prices have fallen to a sensible level, it is a well-organised market, the institutions have the muscle to keep the market at a reasonable level. The market can cope.'</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank chief calls for supervision rethink Mr Jose Perez, director-general for banking supervision at the Bank of Spain, says banks are bearing a heavier burden of regulation than ideally required to minimise costs to the financial system, John Gapper writes from Madrid. He told an FT conference on international banking in Madrid that initiatives such as the Basle Committee's proposals to allow banks to use internal risk models to allocate capital for trading could lessen the burden by changing the 'style and quality' of supervision. He suggested costs could also be reduced by managers and supervisors jointly designing databases for each bank. This would allow both groups to obtain relevant information immediately and at lower cost. Mr Perez said the multiplication of capital requirements meant that supervisors were 'at risk of applying rules that are as complex as they are lacking in accuracy'.</p>
